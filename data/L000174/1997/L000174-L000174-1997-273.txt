President, I note that over the past 2 weeks I have twice corrected a misstatement with respect to the three nominations pending on the Senate executive calendar. Twice, Republicans have said that some unknown Democrat had a hold on these judicial nominations. This is not so. Every single Democrat in the Senate is ready to vote, and vote today, on all the judicial nominees, the three judicial nominees is all it is, that have been voted out of committee so far. Every Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee is prepared to vote at the next Judiciary Committee meeting on all the nominees that are pending there. There is no, no Democrat with a hold on any judicial nominee--I want that very, very clear--neither in the committee nor in the Senate. If we have to have rollcall votes, we are glad to do that. But we should have these people come up.  We received Jeffrey Miller's nomination in July 1996, last Congress. The President renominated him on the first day of this Congress for the same vacancy, a vacancy that has existed since December 1994. We are in 1997 now. This is one of the judicial emergency vacancies we should have filled. He has the support of both Senators. He finally had a confirmation hearing 2\1/2\ years, almost, after the vacancy occurred. His nomination was considered. It has been reported to the Senate. We should vote on it.  We first received Donald Middlebrooks' nomination in September of 1996, last year. He was not accorded a hearing last Congress. This is for a vacancy that has been there since 1992, 5 years ago. That is a judicial emergency vacancy, and he has the support of both Senators from his State, one a Democrat, senior Senator, Senator Graham, one a Republican, Senator Mack. This was reported by the Judiciary Committee to the Senate April 17.  Now, here is a vacancy that has existed for 5 years. We have a judge who has gone through the Senate Judiciary Committee, reported to the Senate, supported by the two Senators from his State, one a Democrat, one a Republican. For God's sake, if we cannot vote on it, what in Heaven's name can we vote on? This should be about as noncontroversial as voting to commend the Fourth of July.  We first received Robert Pratt's nomination in August of 1996. We did not get a hearing last Congress. The President renominated him on the first day of this Congress for the same vacancy in the district court for the southern district of Iowa. He had a confirmation hearing on March 18. He was supported by the two Senators from Iowa, Senator Harkin and Senator Grassley, and was reported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee on April 17.  Well, why can we not go forward with him? You look at what we have, a distinguished woman who is being shunted aside by somebody who does not have the guts to come forth on the Senate floor and say why that Senator is holding her up. We have distinguished other judges that have gone through the confirmation process, supported by the two Senators, a Republican and a Democrat from their State, they cannot come forward.  I take our advise-and-consent function very seriously, especially when it comes to confirmation of Federal judges who have a lifetime appointment. Our system of government with coordinate branches and separation of powers, that is our responsibility. I voted to confirm some judges who ended up rendering decisions which I strongly disagreed. I voted for some judges to move from one Federal court to another, even though they had also had decisions with which I disagreed. I voted against some who turned out to be better than I predicted. But we voted on them.  If a judge decides a case incorrectly, well, then you have appeal. I remember when I used to prosecute cases, I remember somebody saying, as the juror went out to defense counsel, ``Well, let justice be done,'' and they said, ``Well, if that happens, we will appeal.'' If you lose a case, appeal it. If you think you have bad law, have a legislative change. In fact, the reason the founders included the protection of lifetime appointments for Federal judges was to insulate them from politics and political influence.  Merrick Garland had an 18-month wait for confirmation--a judge virtually everybody in the country that ruled on this, from the right to the left, on the judicial selection, said he was one of the most qualified persons ever to be up for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Mr. President, 23 Members of this body, all on the other side of the aisle, voted against Merrick Garland for that judgeship. Not one of them spoke against the nominee. Not one of them spoke against his impeccable credentials. In fact, some who voted against him praised his qualifications. They say they voted against filling an unneeded seat on the court of appeals, in the face of a letter from Chief Judge Silberman, who said they did need the seat, and a statement from Senator Hatch, who said it was needed.  In his concluding remarks, Senator Hatch said, ``Playing politics with judges is unfair, and I am sick of it.'' I agree with the distinguished chairmanof the Senate Judiciary Committee. Let the Senate quit playing partisan politics with judicial nominations. Let us do our constitutionally mandated job and proceed to confirm the judges we need for the Federal system.                               Exhibit 1       In 1987 I heard from Tom Jipping, a student at the      University of Buffalo Law School. The faculty had imposed a      speech code that was more contemptuous of the First Amendment      than even most of the politically correct gag rules      proliferating on campuses around the country.       ``Remarks,'' said the code, ``directed at another's race,      sex, religion, national origin, sexual preference'' et al.      would be severely punished. There was no further definition      of ``remarks.'' Also prohibited were ``other remarks''--not      defined--``based on prejudice and group stereotype.'' Any      prejudice?       Unique to this law school code--unanimously passed by the      administration and faculty--was a provision that the      administration would provide the rap sheets of any guilty      student to the character and fitness committees of any bar      association to which the pariah might apply.       Tom Jipping, though vilified by a prominent faculty member      and other speech police, fought the code, sending news of it      to the outside world. (I wrote about it in The Post, and      William Bennett spoke about it.) Eventually, after Jipping      was graduated, this embarrassment to the law school faded      away.       Jipping is now in Washington, where he directs the Judicial      Selection Monitoring Project, an offspring of the Free      Congress Foundation.       In his official role, Jipping sent a letter to all 100      senators, demanding they act to purge those ``activist''      federal judges who do not agree with Jipping's      interpretations of the Constitution. On Feb. 4 a follow-up      letter went to Sen Partick Leahy (D-Vt.).       In the letter, Jipping reminded Leahy that the senator had      previously received ``a letter from the largest coalition in      history to oppose judicial activism. . . . Please find      enclosed an opportunity to express your position on this      critical issue.''       He then quoted a resounding call for purges by Orrin Hatch,      chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee: ``Those nominees      who are or would be judicial activists should not be      nominated by the President or confirmed by the Senate, and I      will do my best to see to it that they are not.''       Jipping went on to warn Sen. Leahy that if he did not sign      the ``Hatch Pledge''--which Sen. Hatch will not sign because      he doesn't sign pledges--the forces of judicial correctness      will be unleashed. They will let Leahy's perfidy be known      ``to the more than 260 national and state organizations and      dozens of talk show hosts in our growing coalition.'' The      talk show hosts can surely be depended on the assess Leahy's      character and fitness.       Leahy must have enjoyed writing his answer to Jipping: ``I      do not take pledges demanded by special interest groups on      either the right or the left. Nor do I appreciate your thinly      veiled threat that you will employ talk show hosts and      national organizations to pressure me into making such a      pledge.       ``These tactics to force others to adopt your narrow view      of political correctness are wrong, and reminiscent of a dark      period from our history.''       The ever-vigilant Judicial Selection Monitoring Project      should alert the dozens of talk show hosts that a relentless      judicial activist, Chief Justice William Rehnquist, insists      that ``the idea of an independent judiciary, with authority      to finally interpret a written constitution . . . is one of      the crown jewels of our system of government.'' Then there      was a Founder, Alexander Hamilton, who wrote in the      Federalist Papers that ``the complete independence of the      courts of justice is peculiarly essential'' because the duty      of the courts ``must be to declare void all acts contrary to      the manifest tenor of the Constitution. Without this, all the      reservations of particular rights or privileges would amount      to nothing.''       Copies of the Federalist Papers might well be distributed      to members of the Senate, particularly those hunting      ``judicial activists'' and demanding their impeachment.       When Gerald Ford (R-Mich.) was in the House, he anticipated      the current jihad with a rousing speech calling for the      impeachment of Justice William O. Douglas. Ford, not a noted      constitutional scholar, said that ``an impeachable offense is      whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers      it to be at a given moment in history.''       That was spoken like the stunningly overbroad University of      Buffalo Law School speech code. Majority Whip Rep. Tom DeLay      (R-Tex.), a leader of the judge-baiters, recently quoted      Ford's definition of impeachment approvingly in a letter to      the New York Times.       It is a wonder that the Constitution, however battered from      time to time, survives the U.S. Congress.
