 President, I rise today to pay tribute to oncology nurses. May 1 marks the beginning of the 10th annual Oncology Nursing Day and Month and this year marks the30th Anniversary of the Oncology Nursing Society.  As co-chair of the Senate Cancer Coalition, I would like to recognize that oncology nurses play an important and essential role in providing quality, comprehensive cancer care. These nurses are principally involved in the administration and monitoring of chemotherapy and the associated side-effects patients experience. As anyone ever treated for cancer--or who has a loved one who has been treated--will tell you, oncology nurses provide quality clinical, psychosocial and supportive care to patients and their families. In short, they are integral to our Nation's cancer care delivery system.  The Oncology Nursing Society is the largest organization of oncology health professionals in the world, with more than 31,000 registered nurses and other health care professionals. Since 1975, the Oncology Nursing Society has been dedicated to excellence in patient care, teaching, research, administration and education in the field of oncology. The Society's mission is to promote excellence in oncology nursing and quality cancer care.  The Oncology Nursing Society has 19 chapters in my home State of California, which support our oncology nurses in their ongoing efforts to provide outstanding quality cancer care to patients and their families throughout our State.  Cancer is a complex, multifaceted and chronic disease. Each year in the United States, approximately 1.37 million people are diagnosed with cancer, another 570,000 lose their battles with this terrible disease, and more than 8 million Americans count themselves among a growing community known as cancer survivors.  In 2005, the American Cancer Society estimates that in the State of California there will be 135,030 new cancer diagnoses, and 56,090 cancer deaths. At the same time, in 2005, the Health Resources and Services Administration, HRSA, estimates that in the State of California there will be a shortage of 18,409 nurses or a ten percent unmet need for nurses overall.  We must do more as a Nation to prevent and reduce suffering from cancer and to support the oncology nursing workforce.  Every day, oncology nurses see the pain and suffering caused by cancer and understand the physical, emotional, and financial challenges that people with cancer face throughout their diagnosis and treatment.  Over the last ten years, the setting where treatment for cancer is provided has changed dramatically. An estimated 80 percent of all cancer patients receive care in community settings, including cancer centers, physicians' offices, and hospital outpatient departments. Oncology nurses are involved in the care of a cancer patient from the beginning through the end of treatment, and they are the front-line providers of care by administering chemotherapy, managing patient therapies and side-effects, and providing counseling to patients and family members.  I thank all of our Nation's oncology nurses for their dedication to our Nation's cancer patients, especially those who care for cancer patients in California. I commend the Oncology Nursing Society for all of its efforts and leadership over the last 30 years and congratulate its leaders and members on its 30th Anniversary. The Oncology Nursing Society has contributed immensely to the quality and accessibility of care for all cancer patients and their families, and I urge my colleagues to support the Society and oncology nurses in their important endeavors.                          ____________________
