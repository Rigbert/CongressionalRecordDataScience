The point I am trying to make is--and he made it so well--that 10 months' work to find $4 trillion that we could reduce from the deficit would be wiped out by the insistence on the other side of continuing these Bush tax cuts indefinitely.  I argued, and continue to argue, do what we have to do now to get out of this recession, but as soon as we see a positive, solid footing for this economy, let's start stepping forward and be very serious about this deficit reduction. I think the Commission gives us a roadmap.  I thank the Senator from Virginia.                          ____________________
