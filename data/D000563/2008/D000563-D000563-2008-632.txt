President, if I could ask the majority leader to yield for one other question.  It is my understanding, so far in this session, the Republicans have initiated 68 filibusters, which is an attempt to slow down or stop the business of the Senate. But that breaks all records in the Senate, and they are on course, if they continue at this pace, to offer over 100 filibusters before the end of the year, maybe even more.  I would like to ask the majority leader, if they continue trying to stop us from even bringing bills to the floor, debating them, amending them, and bringing them to a vote--I would like to ask the majority leader how we could reach a point where we actually do change things for the better, where we can see the progress that the American people expect.
