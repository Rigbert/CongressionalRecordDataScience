President, that is unacceptable. By my calculation, we have 4 days before we default on our debt, 4 days before the American economy suffers this mortal blow, 4 days before we default on America's full faith and credit for the first time in our history, 4 days while businesses across America are withholding agreements and negotiations that createjobs, 4 days where America people have to worry that if we default on our debt, the government will have to pick and choose those who will receive government checks in August.
