Speaker, I rise to recognize the life profession of Doni Miller of Toledo, Ohio. Doni has given herself to the practice of public health administration and is being recognized in a silver anniversary celebration tomorrow evening.  After serving as an administrator in a public hospital, Doni took over the helm of Toledo's then-struggling Federally Qualified Health Center in 1993. Under her able leadership and steady guidance, Doni was able to turn around the ailing system within a few years and turn it into a premiere organization which is a model for others. Now, 25 years later, the Neighborhood Health Association is a conglomerate of fourteen clinics in neighborhoods throughout Lucas County, Ohio serving well the health care needs of thousands of people. Its clinics are a medical home for some of the most vulnerable among us and the services provided are life changing and life altering.  It is impossible to separate the growth and success of the Neighborhood Health Association from Doni Miller. Her skill at selecting the right person for the job, providing opportunity and accomplishment, has been an important part of the organization's incredible achievements. Doni Miller has sacrificed and persevered to bring the agency to the outstanding organization it is today. She has initiated creative and unique approaches to continue to develop the Neighborhood Health Association, and nurtures talent along with her.  Because of her intimate knowledge of health care delivery, Doni's counsel is sought after by many, including myself. Her knowledge and advice is respected and well-earned. She is equally known for her ardent support of the rights of women and people who are underprivileged. In addition to her role as CEO of the Neighborhood Health Association, Doni Miller also served as President of the Toledo Lucas County Port Authority, is a founding member of the Black Women's Democratic Caucus, and has served on several other Boards and Commissions. She has been a political analyst for local television including Conklin and Company and Toledo Up-front. For several years she has hosted Bridges, a local public affairs television program focusing on important social and economic issues facing our community and nation. Just a few of the recognitions awarded to her include the Chamber of Commerce ATHENA Award, the YWCA Milestones Award, the state Democratic Women's Caucus Award, the African American Legacy Award and the 2016 NAACP Freedom Fund Award.  Her most important role is that of mother to a young woman successful in her own right. Doni Miller is a true community leader. Her abilities, compassion and leadership have lifted up community. She notes she is most inspired by Nelson Mandela's quote, ``The elimination of poverty is not charity, it is justice.'' Doni Miller truly lives this creed and I am so proud to join our citizens in paying tribute to her.                          ____________________
