I cannot tell you, with interest rates going up in this country, I have had builders and title people in this country complaining, gosh, there aren't any real inflationary pressures. Why are interest rates going up? I would posit maybe one of the reasons interest rates are going up is because your money is being taken to prop up the bank of another nation.  We thank the Speaker for this time this evening, and I thank Congressman DeFazio and Congressman Klink, Congressman Abercrombie and all those who have joined us this evening.                          ____________________
