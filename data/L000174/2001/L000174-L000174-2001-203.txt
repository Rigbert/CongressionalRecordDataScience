If the vote is going to be at 11, we will start that meeting of the Judiciary Committee--I understand it will be in the President's room. It will probably start about 11:05, 11:10.  Again, I urge Senators to show up and make a quorum because I have talked to enough Republicans and Democrats and it is going to be hard to have a quorum much beyond the end of that vote. So, please, I urge Senators to be there at 11:05, 11:10. Vote in the beginning in the well and then come on in and we can get 12, 14, 15 nominations, ranging from U.S. attorneys to judges, out of there.
