President, I want to stand in support of the statement just made by my colleague from the Commonwealth of Maryland. He knows, as I know, that our responsibilities as U.S. Senators include important votes. Some of the votes we cast will blur into history, and we will be hard pressed to remember them. But certainly any vote involving sending America to war is a vote you will never forget--at least not this Senator. Many of those votes cast over the years in the House and the Senate have created sleepless nights before the vote because you understand that even under the best of circumstances, people will die as a result of your vote. Not just the enemy but even our own risk their lives and die in defense of the United States.  It was 9/11/2001 when this U.S. Senate was faced with the awesome responsibility of voting to go to war.
