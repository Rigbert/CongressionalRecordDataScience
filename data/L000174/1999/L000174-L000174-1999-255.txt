President, I came to the floor last Wednesday to demonstrate the seriousness with which Senate Democrats take the matters included in S. 254, the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill. I took the extraordinary step of propounding a unanimous-consent request to move the Senate to a House-Senate conference. I talked to the Majority Leader and the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee in advance of making the unanimous-consent request. I noted the history of this measure and the need to move to conference expeditiously if we are to have these programs in place before school resumes in the fall in the course of my colloquy with the Majority Leader last week.  The Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill, S. 254, passed the Senate after 2 weeks of open debate and after significant improvements over two months ago, on May 20, by a strong bipartisan vote of 73-25. More than one month ago, on June 17, the House passed its version of juvenile justice legislation but chose not to take up the Senate bill and insert its language, as is standard practice to move Congress toward a conference and final passage of legislation.  Instead, what the House did was wait until last week to send the Senate a ``blue slip'' returning S. 254 to the Senate on the ground that it contains what they consider a ``revenue provision'' that did not originate in the House. The provision they point to is the amendment to S. 254 that would amend the federal criminal code to ban the import of high capacity ammunition clips. Whatever the merits of that particular provision--and I will simply say that I did not support it--it appeared to me that the House had resorted to a procedural technicality to avoid a conference on juvenile justice legislation.  Two weeks ago, Republican leaders of the House and Senate were talking about appointing conferees by the end of that week. Instead, they took no action to move us toward a House-Senate conference but, instead, were moving us away from one. By propounding the unanimous consent last week, I was trying on behalf of congressional Democrats, to break the logjam. The unanimous consent would have cured the procedural technicality and would have resulted in the Senate requesting a conference and appointing conferees without further delay.  While I regret that Republican objection was made to my request last Wednesday, I note that it was repropounded by the Majority Leader the next day. I thank the Majority Leader for that. Unfortunately, even then, objection was made and the process is being extended from literally seconds into days and possibly weeks before we can conference this important matter.  Today, the Senate takes the first step outlined in my unanimous request, proceeding to take up the House-passed bill. Senators can cooperate in taking the additional steps outlined in my consent request to get to a conference and the Senate could proceed to appoint its conferees and request a conference without further delay, today. Alternatively, Senators can exercise their procedural rights to obstruct each step of the way and require a series of cloture petitions and votes. I hope that in the interests of school safety and enacting the many worthwhile programs in the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill, they will begin to cooperate. The delay is costing us valuable time to get this juvenile justice legislation enacted before school resumes this fall. This is just plain wrong.  I spoke to the Senate before the July 4th recess about the need to press forward without delay on this bill. I contrasted the inaction on the juvenile justice bill with the swift movement on providing special legal protections to certain business interests. In just a few months, big business successfully lobbied for the passage of legislation to protection themselves against any accountability for actions or losses their products may cause to consumers. By contrast, some are dragging their feet and now actively obstructing the House and Senate from moving to appoint conferees on the juvenile justice bill that can make a difference in the lives of our children and families.  New programs and protections for school children could be in place when school resumes this fall. All of us--whether we are parents, grandparents, teachers, or policy makers are puzzling over the causes of kids turning violent in our country. The root causes are likely multifaceted. Nevertheless, the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill is a firm and significant step in the right direction. The passage of this bill shows that when this body rolls up its sleeves and gets to work, we can make significant progress. But that progress will amount to naught if the House and Senate do not conference and proceed to final passage on a good bill.  Every parent, teacher and student in this country is concerned this summer about school violence over the last two years and worried about the situation they will confront this fall. Each one of us wants to do something to stop this violence. There is no single cause and no single legislative solution that will cure the ill of youth violence in our schools or in our streets. But we have an opportunity before us to do our part. It is unfortunate that the Senate is not moving full speed ahead to seize this opportunity to act on balanced, effective juvenile justice legislation.  I want to be assured that after the hard work we all put into crafting a good juvenile justice bill, that we can go to a House-Senate conference that isfair, full, and productive. We have worked too hard in the Senate for a strong bipartisan juvenile justice bill to simply shrug our shoulders when the House returns a juvenile justice bill rather than proceeding to a conference and a narrow minority in the Senate would rather we do nothing. I will be vigilant in working to maintain this bipartisanship and to press for action on this important legislation.                          ____________________
