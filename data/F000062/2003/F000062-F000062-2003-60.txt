 I hasten to point out another attribute of this project. As the water quality problems on the Santa Ana River are gradually resolved--and this project certainly contributes to resolving some of those problems--the supply of clean, usable water in Southern California is expanded. It is yet another way to ensure that the Quantification Settlement Agreement on the Colorado River is implemented in a timely and meaningful manner. Utah and the rest of the Colorado Basin States should welcome these types of investment in Southern California.
