 President, I rise today to honor the life of Mr. Morgan French, of Radcliff, KY, who passed away in February 2012 at the age of 92. The U.S. Army's Warrior Transition Battalion at Fort Knox will soon be honoring Morgan by naming its barracks after him. Today, I would like to pay tribute to this American hero.  Originally from Perryville, KY, Morgan was a military veteran who personified the ``greatest generation.'' He served in the U.S. Army with the renowned ``Harrodsburg Tankers,'' Company D of the 192nd Tank Battalion. The Harrodsburg Tankers--including Morgan and his brother, Edward--were in the Philippines' Bataan Peninsula in the spring of 1942 and came under heavy attack by Japanese forces. Morgan's brother, Edward, was killed and Morgan was taken as a prisoner of war, POW, by Japanese troops. He spent nearly three-and-a-half years of his life as a POW, enduring extreme conditions and harsh treatment. This brave Kentuckian maintained hope and courage throughout these hardships and was finally liberated by Allied Forces in September 1945. Morgan's military service did not end with World War II, however. Following his nearly three-and-a-half years as a POW, he returned to active duty, served two tours in the Korean War, and became a member of the Kentucky National Guard. Morgan retired from the military in 1962 after 23 years of service. He continued to work selflessly as a civilian, teaching at the U.S. Army Armor School at Fort Knox until 1984.  Morgan and his wife, Maxine--who preceded him in death--made Radcliff their home for almost half a century. I can't think of a more fitting tribute than for the U.S. Army to name the Warrior Transition Battalion barracks at Fort Knox after Morgan French, an American hero.                          ____________________
