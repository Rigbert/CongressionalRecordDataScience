Speaker, and before the majority leader answers that question, I wouldsay to him that I have had consultation with the Democratic minority leader; and the Democratic leader and myself, I would say on behalf of our side of the aisle, we would agree to a unanimous consent request today to bring the Senate bill, which as I understand is Senate Bill 121, which essentially is the base bill.  I, frankly, do not interpose objections to that which the gentleman has outlined in his statement will be added to the bill. I do not necessarily find any one of those individual items objectionable; and as I understand, in the committee they were not particularly controversial. But we obviously could accelerate that.  The gentleman is correct. We do want to go by regular order. Regular order is obviously seeking from both sides a unanimous consent to take some action, and I say to the gentleman that consistent with what the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Frost) has said, this side of the aisle would be prepared to give a unanimous consent agreement to passing that bill before we go home today.  Mr. DeLAY. Well, if the gentleman will continue to yield, I am not sure I remember the question of the gentleman from Texas.
