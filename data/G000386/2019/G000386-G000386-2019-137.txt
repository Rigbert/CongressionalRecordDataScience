  More than 240 years ago, sailors aboard the warship Warren disclosed significant misconduct by the commander of the Continental Navy. The Congress then recognized these brave whistleblowers' valuable contribution to our brandnew Republic because, on this day--today--in 1778, Congress passed this resolution, saying: ``It is the duty of all persons in the service of the United States . . . to give the earliest information to Congress or other proper authority of any misconduct, frauds, or misdemeanors committed by any offices or persons in the service of these states.''  That is the beginning of the government recognizing whistleblowers as valuable patriots.  Following in their footsteps, this Senate has also unanimously agreed to designate today as National Whistleblower Appreciation Day.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
