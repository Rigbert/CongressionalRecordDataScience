Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, in H.R. 2898, we establish an oversight board for the Central Valley Project Restoration Fund.  What my amendment does is simple. It adds an additional conservation seat to the 11-member board, which will provide parity between the environmental and user group interests.  The advisory board reflects the interests of agriculture, municipal and industrial users, power contractors, wildlife refuges, in addition to the economic impacts of water operations, so that the Secretary of the Interior will receive recommendations that encompass a broad perspective.  The reason for my amendment is also simple, to ensure that a more balanced and effective approach is being taken as the Secretary of the Interior prioritizes spending levels on projects and programs carried out through the restoration fund.  Again, in closing, my amendment strikes a better balance between conservation and user groups interests on the 11-member board and will help to ensure that the annual surcharges water and power users contribute will be spent on the most effective methods in habitat restoration and environmental mitigation.
