I say to the Senator, I don't know what it is like in his State, but we are desperate for nurses in my State. We are looking all over the world to bring in nurses. Along comes the Bush administration saying here is a way, incidentally, for this hospital to stop paying overtime to nurses. It is a tough profession being a nurse, demanding. We count on them when somebody in our family is ill. What is going on here when we are cutting overtime for nurses? Why would this administration make that part of their economic policy?
