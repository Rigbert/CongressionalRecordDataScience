Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, I wish that every day on the floor we had rules like this. This is an open rule. It will allow any Member of the House to offer an amendment, and I believe that is something that we should do much more often around here. So this will be a rare moment where I can support a rule for a bill. Too many times we are muzzled and not allowed to offer amendments that would improve or alter bills before us.  The bill that is before us is very different and did not go through a regular committee process; and for that reason, some Members may be puzzled as to exactly what the bill does, as are advocacy groups on both sides of the issue among the public; and I would like to take a couple of minutes to explain that.  I had a very different approach in mind when I introduced my legislation, which would be 100 percent guaranteed, very clean, complete decoupled. That bill garnered very, very little support; and a different bill passed in the Committee on Agriculture, the Boyd-Deal bill; and then, of course, we had a bill recommended on the Senate side by Senators who I do not think the rules of the House allow me to name. But, anyway, there were some Senators that introduced a bill over.  This bill is different than all of those bills, but it combines some of the most important aspects of all. First and foremost, this bill requires that anything and everything done under this legislation follow and absolutely comply with every environmental law, every environmental rule, every forest plan, every resource management plan that is currently on the books in the United States, that it fully follow the Endangered Species Act, and allow appeals.                              {time}  1315  All that is within the scope of this bill. Any projects which might occur under this bill, which are a small part of the bill, are subject to Secretarial discretion, in addition to having to follow all rules, laws, and regulations.  There will be much controversy over the projects. The projects were not my preferred alternative, but they have been altered in a way that makes them environmentally neutral, and potentially they could be projects that would be beneficial to local communities and areas.  They could be spent for road obliteration for problem roads, for watershed restoration, they could be spent for other revenue-generating activities on the forests that do not go to timber production. They could be spent on recreation.  The gentleman from Minnesota objected to a provision I had added which would allow them to be used for work camps; that is, to be allowed for a correctional facility for nonviolent offenders to work on the forest lands. I do not find that to be objectionable. I think that is very desirable, better than having them sit in jail and watch television. So I do not understand why the gentleman would object to that.  It could also be used at their initiative for reimbursing counties for the huge unmet costs of search and rescue on Federal lands. The bottom line is, my State is more than half owned by the Federal government. The Federal government has dramatically changed the laws and rules that pertain to timber harvests, as I believe many of those changes were necessary, because we were overharvesting.  The question is, since no other productive use that generates revenues for those counties, we cannot levy taxes in those lands can go forward, should the government pay something to those counties for their ongoing obligations to provide a road network through those lands, and to provide law enforcement services and the other things? I believe the answer is yes. I hope that a majority of the body here today decides that the answer is yes.  The gentleman before me, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Regula) said this creates a bad precedent. He talked about offshore oil drilling. That is not analogous. The analogy would be base closings. When the Federal government closes a military base, it admits there are huge impacts on the communities, it dumps a whole bunch of money into that community, it does retraining, does a whole host of other things, and ultimately it turns the lands over to those communities for future purposes.  I am not advocating these lands be turned back over to the States. I am absolutely and adamantly opposed to that. But in lieu of that, we are asking for a modest replacement of revenues that were formerly created off these lands, while there will be ongoing and perpetual obligations to the counties for law enforcement and infrastructure, roads and other activities on those lands.  These are vital payments that go to schools, that go to vital county services; as I already mentioned, law enforcement, road construction, reconstruction, and maintenance. Those funds will not exist if this legislation does not pass.  In the case of my counties, we have 3 more years of a guarantee under law, but after that, we fall off the cliff. For many other counties, they have already fallen off the cliff. They need this help to rebuild the social infrastructure of their communities and maintain vital county services.  I would urge people to keep an open mind in the debate today and realize, unfortunately, having not followed a regular process, my committee having decided not to take jurisdiction, the Committee on Resources, that this has not been before Members in its final form for very long. It is very different than what was proposed. I urge the Members to read the bill and ask questions of any of us who were involved in the writing.
