 Bunning):  S. 1409. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reduce from 24 months to 12 months the holding period used to determine whether horses are assets described in section 1231 of such Code; to the Committee on Finance.    legislation reducing the capital gains holding period for horses  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I join with my colleague, Mr. Bunning, to introduce legislation to reduce from 24 months to 12 months the capital gains holding period for horses. All capital assets--with the exception of horses and cattle--qualify for the lowest capital gains tax rate if held for 12 months. This discrepancy in the tax code is simply not fair to the horse industry.  The horse industry is extremely important to our economy, and accounts for thousands of jobs. Whether it is owning, breeding, racing, or showing horses--or simply enjoying an afternoon ride along a trail--one in thirty-five Americans is touched by the horse industry. In Kentucky alone, the horse industry has an economic impact of $3.4 billion, involving 150,000 horses and more than 50,000 employees.  What supports this industry is the investment in the horses themselves. Much like other businesses, outside investments are essential to the operation and growth of the horse industry. Without others willing to buy and breed horses, it is impossible for the industry to remain competitive. The two-year holding period ultimately discourages investment, putting this industry --and the 1.4 million jobs it supports nationwide--at risk. Clearly, this is bad economic policy and must be changed.  Mr. President, the two-year holding period for horses is sorely outdated. It was established in 1969, primarily as an anti-tax shelter provision. Since then, there have been a number of changes in the tax code. Specifically, the passive loss limitations have been adopted, putting an end to these previous tax loopholes.  Although horses are categorized as livestock, they have an entirely different function than other animals, like cattle. While both are livestock, the investment in these two animals is entirely different. Beef is a commodity, with a finite and generally short life span. However, horses--whether they are used for racing, showing, or working--are frequently bought and sold multiple times over their longer life in order to maximize the return on the owner's investment. Additionally, once horses retire from the track or show arena, they continue to enhance their value through breeding.  Mr. President, there is no sound argument for distinguishing horses from other capital assets. The two-year holding period discriminates against the horse industry and must be reduced. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Bunning and me in correcting this unfair tax policy. Mr. President, I ask that the text of this legislation be printed in the Record.  The bill follows:                                S. 1409       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
