President, I thank my friend and colleague from Maine. He has enormous expertise in the area of renewable energy, and I very much appreciate his adding his expertise to this debate.  Before I yield the floor, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter dated June 30, 2015, and signed by 46 Senators, on this very issue, that was addressed to the Administrator of the EPA, the Secretary of Energy, and the Secretary of Agriculture.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         United States Senate,                                    Washington, DC, June 30, 2015.     Hon. Gina McCarthy,     Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency, Washington,          DC.     Hon. Dr. Ernest Moniz,     Secretary, U.S. Department of Energy,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Tom Vilsack,     Secretary, U.S. Department of Agriculture,     Washington, DC.       Dear Administrator McCarthy, Secretary Moniz, and Secretary      Vilsack: We write to support biomass energy as a sustainable,      responsible, renewable, and economically significant energy      source. Federal policies across all departments and agencies      must remove any uncertainties and contradictions through a      clear, unambiguous message that forest bioenergy is part of      the nation's energy future.       Many states are relying on renewable biomass to meet their      energy goals, and we support renewable biomass to create jobs      and economic growth while meeting our nation's energy needs.      A comprehensive science, technical, and legal administrative      record supports a clear and simple policy establishing the      benefits of energy from forest biomass. Federal policies that      add unnecessary costs and complexity will discourage rather      than encourage investment in working forests, harvesting      operations, bioenergy, wood products, and paper      manufacturing. Unclear or contradictory signals from federal      agencies could discourage biomass utilization as an energy      solution.       The carbon neutrality of forest biomass has been recognized      repeatedly by numerous studies, agencies, institutions,      legislation, and rules around the world, and there has been      no dispute about the carbon neutrality of biomass derived      from residuals of forest products manufacturing and      agriculture. Our constituents employed in the biomass supply      chain deserve a federal policy that recognizes the clear      benefits of forest bioenergy. We urge you to ensure that      federal policies are consistent and reflect the carbon      neutrality of forest bioenergy.           Sincerely,         Susan M. Collins; Jeff Merkley; Kelly Ayotte; Roy Blunt;            John Boozman; Richard Burr; Shelley Moore Capito; Bill            Cassidy; Thad Cochran; John Cornyn; Tammy Baldwin;            Sherrod Brown; Robert P.
