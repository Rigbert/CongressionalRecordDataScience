Speaker, that is the answer I expected. That is the answer I have been getting. And, very frankly,that is the answer this House has been getting.  I know some of my Republican friends are very frustrated by that answer, and I know all of our side is frustrated by that answer.  I will say respectfully to my friend I would certainly hope we could bring that bill to the floor.  Win or lose, whether you win or I win or Export-Import Bank is reauthorized or not, you are correct: the voice of the people should be heard on such a critical issue for jobs in this country.  Also, I know that we had marked up in committees reconciliation bills. Those reconciliation bills repeal provisions of the Affordable Care Act and defund Planned Parenthood.  The gentleman I think knows full well that the United States Senate voted on the Planned Parenthood issue and only got 47 votes for it. So in the one instance, we have an issue that got three less than one-half of the United States Senate being proposed to come to this floor, and an issue that got 64 votes in the United States Senate, as the gentleman so correctly observed, is not yet scheduled.  Can the gentleman tell me whether or not these reconciliation provisions are going to be brought to this floor, knowing full well that they won't pass the Senate and, even if they did, the President wouldn't sign them and we would sustain that veto?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Knowing the rules of reconciliation, I do believe it will pass the Senate.  The three committees that received reconciliation instructions from the Budget Committee have marked up their portions, as the gentleman has said.  I do expect the Budget Committee to meet in the near future to complete their work, and we will notify Members as soon as that is scheduled for the floor.
