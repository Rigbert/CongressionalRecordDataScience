 President, I wish to thank several of my colleagues who have recognized me for casting my 11,000th vote yesterday. I want to acknowledge the fine things Senator Reid, the majority leader, said, Senator McConnell, the Republican leader, Senator Stabenow, Senator Harkin, and Senator Leahy, and I wanted them to know I appreciate very much the recognition they brought. I hope it is nothing special, because I believe I am just exhibiting the work ethic of Iowans generally, who work very hard.                       Reservation of Leader Time
