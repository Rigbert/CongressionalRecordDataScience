President, I rise today to honor two constituents, Dominic and Brenda Randazzo, who have spent much of their lives giving back to their community.  Dominic and Brenda are a remarkable couple. Through 45 years of marriage, three children and seven grandchildren, they have maintained an unyielding spirit of giving back.  They were honored recently as the 2008 Servant Leaders of the Year by Provena St. Mary's Foundation in Kankakee, IL.  Provena St. Mary's Hospital has a special meaning for Dominic and Brenda. It is where they were both born.  For many years, both Dominic and Brenda have been among the hospital's most loyal supporters. Dominic has served as lead fundraiser for the hospital's annual Black Tie Gala for more than 8 years.  Last year, Dominic asked Brenda if she could lend some helpful suggestions for an auction benefiting the hospital. Brenda wound up chairing the auction and raised generous contributions.  Dominic grew up in Kankakee, IL and after he graduated from college, spent nearly 2 years in the United States Army, including time in Germany. After his years in the service, Dominic went to work for Armour Pharmaceutical in 1960 where he met his lovely wife, Brenda.  Two years ago, Dominic retired as the manager of community and government relations for Aventis Behring. This job combined Dominic's two favorite passions, community and legislation.  Brenda grew up in Chebanse, IL, with dreams of becoming a flight attendant or an interior designer. After working at Armour Pharmaceutical and meeting Dominic, Brenda joined Albanese Development, a company that designs, builds, and decorates hotels. Brenda's caring nature helped her excel in the hospitality industry, ultimately being named General Manager of Year in 2000 by the American Hotel and Lodging Administration.  Provena St. Mary's is only one of many community organizations to which the Randazzos give so generously of their time and talents.  Dominic also spends countless hours with the United Way of Kankakee County. In 2004, he chaired that organization's Leadership Giving Campaign and broke its previous fundraising record. For his efforts, he was honored with the Ken Cote Award, better known as the Mr. United Way Award.  For more than 15 years, Dominic organized the Hemophilia Foundation of Illinois' annual Walk-and-Bike-a-thon.  Throughout her career in hotel management, Brenda, too, has always found time to help others. On Halloween, Brenda invited Easter Seals to bring children to trick-or-treat at the hotel. She also mentored low-income women--helping them obtain jobs at her hotels and access to public transportation. And she is a stalwart supporter of both the Arthritis Foundation and the Rotary Club in Bourbonnais, IL.  Their motivation for their service is simple and inspiring. Dominic and Brenda Randazzo both say that they have been blessed, and they want to share their blessings with others.  We are all enriched by the good works and fine example of caring citizens such as the Randazzas. I congratulate both Dominic and Brenda on their well-deserved honor and thank them for their many years of selfless giving to others.                          ____________________
