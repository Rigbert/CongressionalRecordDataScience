This in no way has anything to do with safety because we are talking--the first arbitrator is the FAA. That is not what this is about at all. When we have had a chance to talk, as we have to almost all the Senators in this body, we have talked about safety. We bounced that off many people. We had a hearing at Oshkosh about safety. I had the air traffic controllers support me on this. They are the ones concerned with safety.  I would say I don't agree with the argument, but I respect the Senator from West Virginia.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Texas.
