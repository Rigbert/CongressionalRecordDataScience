President, I rise today to recognize the accomplishments of BG General Jared P. Kennish, Assistant Adjutant General for the Rhode Island Air National Guard. BG Kennish was awarded the Bronze Star Medal for meritorious achievement while serving as the commander of the 376th Air Expeditionary Wing at Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan from November 16, 2002 to April 16, 2003 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.  BG Kennish was recognized by the United States Air Force for contributing ``significantly to the overwhelming success of air and ground operations against the Taliban and al-Qaeda terrorist networks throughout Afghanistan.'' He led one of the most diverse and multifunctional air wings ever assembled, combining the operations of F-16s, KC-135s, KC-10s, C-130s and Puma helicopters from the Air Forces of the United States, Denmark, Holland, Italy, Norway and Spain. BG Kennish was also recognized as a ``true global mobility visionary'' whose selfless efforts in support of joint air operations during Operation Enduring Freedom ``will be a model for future contingencies.''  BG Kennish's accomplishments throughout Operation Enduring Freedom are no surprise to the great state of Rhode Island. Throughout a career of exemplary service that has spanned over 37 years in the United States Air Force and the Rhode Island Air National Guard, BG Kennish has left his positive imprint in every job he has performed. From service throughout Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm in 1991, to operational deployments in northern Iraq and Mombasa, Kenya, to command of the 143rd Airlift Wing, Rhode Island Air National Guard, BG Kennish has been a shining example of professional excellence of whom all Rhode Islanders are rightly proud.  I echo the praise of the United States Air Force in recognizing BG Kennish with the award of the Bronze Star Medal. I ask my colleagues to join with me today, July 29, 2003, in thanking BG Kennish on behalf of a grateful Nation for his selfless service to our country.                          ____________________
