Gary Miller.  The price of gasoline in my home state of California is already over $2 per gallon. Instead of investing in this great nation's plentiful domestic energy resources, this Administration has been ``asleep at the fuel pump.'' We are now more dependent on imported oil than at the height of the Oil Embargo Crisis of 1973.  As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Environment, we have just completed two authorization hearings on this Administration's Budget Request for the Department of Energy. This Administration's requests for Petroleum, Natural Gas Technologies, Other Fossil Energy R and Nuclear Energy are, in general, below last year's funding levels. R and production of these major and fundamental domestic energy resources should not be short-changed.  The Secretary of Energy finally went on his diplomatic mission to beg for increased production from OPEC and some of the more notorious OPEC members have only thumbed their noses at his request. Last week on the House floor, I talked about the Administration's ``F'' for failure on oil diplomacy and domestic oil production. We still don't know whether OPEC will agree to step up production to reduce prices--we are at OPEC's mercy once again.  On the domestic production side, the Administration has discouraged--in every way--the opportunity to take advantage of this country's domestic oil resources and I would like to add coal and nuclear energy to the list. It is time for us to seriously develop our great country's domestic oil reserves--we know we have the oil--it's time to produce it--of course, in an environmentally sound way--so that the American people will no longer be dependent on OPEC's whims.  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
