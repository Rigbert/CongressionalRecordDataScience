Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds just to rebut the gentlewoman from New York [Ms. Velazquez].  There is a cut in the NASA budget. It is a pretty significant cut. We went through all of that in terms of the debate on the personnel. But just to set the record straight, from fiscal year 1996 to fiscal year 1997 this bill cuts the total NASA budget by $325 million.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Weldon].
