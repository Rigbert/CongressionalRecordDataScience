 The first will be on the Hatch amendment regarding the White House Travel Office, to be followed by a vote on or in relation to the Reid amendment. Following those votes, the Senate will remain on the Treasury-postal appropriations bill, and it is hoped we will complete action on that matter as early as possible so that the Senate may begin consideration of the Chemical Weapons Convention Treaty during Thursday's session. The majority leader has announced that rollcall votes will occur throughout the day on Thursday and Senators should plan their schedules accordingly.                          ____________________
