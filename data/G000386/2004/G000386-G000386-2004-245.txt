 That is very encouraging. I recognize that upfront.  In regard to the list of amendments, the fact that it is very short, with time agreements, is very good news. However, in that list of amendments, there are some that are nongermane, some that are very controversial, some on our side of the aisle we do not think are appropriate to be brought up on this legislation; and also a reminder that we have only dealt with two Republican amendments at this point and we have dealt with a lot of amendments on the other side. Now, there is nothing wrong with dealing with more amendments on one side than on the other, and we have been very fair in how we have approached this.  I don't have a response to the Senator from Nevada, the distinguished Democratic assistant leader. We intend to work very closely with him to see if we can get this bill to finality. In the same way we have gotten this far this week--we have made a great deal of progress--it is because we have had a good working relationship with the Senator from Nevada and the Senator from Montana.  I cannot state an agreement at this point. I yield the floor.
