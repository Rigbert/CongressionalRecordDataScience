 President, I rise today along with Senator Hagel, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Durbin, Senator Corzine, and Senator Feingold to submit a resolution calling on the parties participating at the Seventh Review Conference in New York City to reaffirm their support for and take additional measures to strengthen the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.  Our resolution calls on parties to the conference to, among other things: insist on strict compliance with the nonproliferation obligations of the Treaty and to undertake effective enforcement measures against states that are in violation of their Article I or Article II obligations; agree to establish more effective controls on sensitive technologies that can be used to produce materials for nuclear weapons; support the efforts of the United States and the European Union (EU) to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability; support the Six-Party talks that seek the verifiable disarmament of North Korea's nuclear weapons program; accelerate programs to safeguard and eliminate nuclear-weapons usable material to the highest standards to prevent access by terrorists or other states; agree that no state may withdraw from the Treaty and escape responsibility for prior violations of the treaty or retain access to controlled materials and equipment acquired for ``peaceful'' purposes, and; accelerate implementation of the NPT-related disarmament obligations and commitments that would, in particular, reduce the world's stockpiles of nuclear weapons and weapons-grade material.  More than 180 states have gathered in New York to review progress on implementing their respective obligations as signatories of the Treaty and discuss additional steps each party can take to fulfill all of the NPT objectives.  The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty has played a critical role in protecting U.S. national security interests and promoting peace and stability in the international community by bringing nuclear armed and non-nuclear armed states together to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons.  Each party has clear and specific obligations. States with nuclear weapons pledge to eventually eliminate them while states without nuclear weapons pledge not to acquire them.  The track record of the Treaty speaks for itself. This framework has successfully convinced countries such as Ukraine, Kazahkstan, Belarus, Libya and South Africa to forgo possession of nuclear weapons. At the dawn of the nuclear age, who would have thought this would be possible?  Simply put, the fewer number of states with nuclear weapons, the less likely such weapons will be used or fall into the wrong hands. The Treaty has saved lives and prevented unthinkable catastrophe.  The success of the Treaty is a testament to United States leadership and our commitment to multilateral diplomacy and cooperation. The gains in the area of nuclear nonproliferation over the past thirty plus years would not have been possible if we had chosen to shut ourselves out of the international community or take on the great challenges of the world on our own.  And, I might point out, as a signatory to the Treaty, we have increased the security of Americans and our national security interests at a far less cost than any military intervention. Successful arms control treaties give us more bang for our buck.  Now is a critical opportunity to examine the successes of the past and the steps all parties can take to strengthen the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in the future.  Indeed, the world has changed dramatically since the last Review Conference in 1995 and the challenges to the nuclear nonproliferation regime have become more acute. In the past few years we have witnessed: the September 11th attacks and the intent of terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda to acquire and use nuclear weapons; the discovery of the AQ Khan nuclear black market; North Korea's withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and announcement that it possessed nuclear weapons; the exposure of Iran's violations of its obligations as a signatory of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and the possibility that states may use the ``Article 4 loophole'' and develop a nuclear fuel cycle capability; the existence of global stockpiles of nuclear weapons usable materials.  Combined with an uncertainty on the part of non-nuclear weapon states about the intent of nuclear weapon states to fulfill their disarmament obligations, these challenges threaten the continuation of a successful nuclear nonproliferation regime.  As the United Nation's report ``A More Secure World'' states: ``We are approaching a point at which the erosion of the nonproliferation regime could become irreversible and result in a cascade of proliferation.''  North Korea has already withdrawn from the Treaty and escaped penalty. Iran may be next. How many others will follow if we stand still and do nothing to strengthen the NPT?  It would be an understatement to say that the collapse of the nuclear nonproliferation regime will have a devastating effect on the security and stability of the entire world.  That is why the Review Conference is so important and why we must not let divisions between nuclear armed and non-nuclear armed states prevent the conclusion of a successful conference. We must come together to breathe new life into the nuclear nonproliferation regime and seriously consider the stepsoutlined above that will strengthen the treaty and make the world safer from the threat of nuclear terror.  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.                          ____________________[Pages S5805-S5807]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 36--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS  CONCERNING ACTIONS TO SUPPORT THE NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY ON            THE OCCASION OF THE SEVENTH NPT REVIEW CONFERENCE
