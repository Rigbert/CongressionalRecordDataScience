 President, I had the honor of serving with Lloyd Bentsen for 20 years, and I respected him as a Senator's Senator. He had a style about him. He was this really classy Texas gentleman who, when he walked into this Chamber or into a hearing room, you could just feel his presence and his desire to work something out.  I admired him because he used the power of that office to help millions and millions of Americans, especially the people he felt needed it most, the very young and very old among us.  Everyone in America who has an IRA and is saving for retirement can thank Lloyd Bentsen. Every American worker whose pensions are protected, is because of Lloyd Bentsen. He improved access to health care for needy women and children--not with some massive sweeping bill that would never have passed Congress but, incrementally, every year, giving a new benefit so more and more people were helped.  When he went to Treasury, he was the architect of President Clinton's economic plan that eventually balanced the budget and created millions of jobs and brought credibility and leadership back to this country with other industrialized nations.  I express my sympathy to his family, and especially his wonderful wife B.A. He liked to call her his best asset, but she was an asset to all of us. Our prayers are with her.                          ____________________
