 Madam Chair, the amendment does seek to target an important part of the process when prosecuting a sexual assault--the investigation of the incident.  As the Congresswoman pointed out, the Inspector General found this particular part of the process lacking in terms of interviewing victims, investigating crime scenes, and notifying the sexual assault response coordinator. The funding proposed would provide the means to include special training for tactics and techniques when investigating crimes of these natures. I would join the chairman of the committee in thanking her for raising the issue and strongly support it.  I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.
