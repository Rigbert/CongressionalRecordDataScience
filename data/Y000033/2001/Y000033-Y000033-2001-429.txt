Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1599. This is a bipartisan bill. I thank the ranking member, the chairman of the Subcommittee, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo), and the ranking member of the subcommittee, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Brown), for her support, and those people directly involved.  Mr. Chairman, I am pleased that we are taking action today to authorize the funding for these important programs. H.R. 1699, the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2001, authorizes the fiscal year 2002 Coast Guard budget at the level requested by the President, with an additional $300 million, as the gentleman has mentioned.  I, being from Alaska, and my Alaskan constituents have had a love affair with the Coast Guard for as long as we have been a Territory and a State. The first Federal officer that was stationed in Alaska was a Coast Guard employee, a captain.                              {time}  1130  They are dedicated people. They are committed and they are courageous, especially in search and rescue of our fishing fleet, which is the most dangerous fishing fleet in the world because of the climate conditions.  Just this year, there has been numerous rescue attempts successfully done by the Coast Guard using equipment that is outdated and not properly, very frankly, funded for the fuel that needs to do the mission. They have done so.  This bill does the authorization that we believe will not only fund them adequately, but will increase their deep water capability.  Many of the ships that are used by the Coast Guard in Alaska and other areas of the United States are 50 years old and older. The living conditions of those ships is deplorable, and this Congress has been neglectful. Our President has recognized it, and this Congress has recognized it for the leadership of the chairman. We are now authorizing the funding as it should be.  I have a little comment to make for those that may question the amounts of money. This is long overdue. We hope to have supplemental money in the supplemental appropriation bill for the backlog of $92 million that the Coast Guard was shorted last year.  We have some people in OMB and other areas that have decided to make this an issue, and I will tell them and I will tell my colleagues on this floor, we are going to prevail to make sure our Coast Guard is adequately funded. This bill does that.  We have to recognize the importance of this ability of this unit is really on the front lines all the time. I have great respect for my Army, my Navy. I have great respect for my Marines, my Air Force. But this unit of the Coast Guard is always on the front lines: drug interdiction, oil spill responsibility, immigration, all the things that they are charged with, we have not adequately done our job, and it is up to us to do so.  Again, I want to thank those people that are directly involved in this, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo), the chairman of the subcommittee, who has actually mentioned the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) and the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Brown) and himself have done the job that I believe is correct for this great agency which serves every man, woman and child.  There is a tendency sometimes to believe that the Coast Guard only serves those on the coast. That is why they call it the Coast Guard. But the fact is it serves every person in the United States inland and along the coast through drug interdiction, illegal immigration, oil spill responsibility. The work that they do affects every man, woman and child in the United States.  So I urge this Congress to, not only to pass this bill, but to pass it overwhelmingly.  At this time, I would also like to compliment numerous people that had amendments. There will be some dialogue between those people. We have kept this a clean bill. There is nothing in here to slow it down like happened last year. We have agreed and reached a compromise with the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Traficant). He will be offering an amendment which we will accept. But it is the only amendment because it pertains to Buy America. But the rest of the amendments, and some of them were very well-warranted, we will talk about, we will discuss, and then they will be withdrawn.  I will compliment the wisdom of those Members to keep this bill clean so when it goes over to the Senate, they will not have the opportunity to do what they tried to do last year and put a lot of garbage on the bill that should have been passed.  So I want to congratulate those involved.
