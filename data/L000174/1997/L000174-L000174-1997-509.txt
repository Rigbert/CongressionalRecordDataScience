But I also know he is equally passionate about his support for family planning. He fully understood that when you limit access to family planning, the result is more abortions.  The other side will argue that since a tiny fraction of these funds may go to private organizations that provide abortions in countries like the United States where abortion is legal, the resolution should be defeated. There is no logic in that. What if the tables were turned and I argued that no family planning organization should receive U.S. Government funds unless they do use their own funds for abortion? There would be a big outcry, ``It's big Government. How dare you tell these private groups what to do with their money?'' That is not a road we want to go down. AID requires every dime to be kept in a separate account. We know how every dime of our money is spent. There has never been any evidence that any of these funds have been used for abortion. If there were, you can be sure we would have heard about it.  So let us start spending the money that we appropriated 5 months ago so it can do some good. The longer we wait, the more we add to the costs of administering the program, the more damage we cause to the health of women and children, the more unwanted pregnancies and abortions will result. It is that simple.  I would also say, this has become more of a political argument than an argument based on reality. I do not hear any of the advocates of this position, of withholding this money, stand up and say, ``Let's not send any of our foreign aid to any country that may use some of their money, their money in that country, to pay for abortions.'' I challenge those who oppose this resolution, if you want to prove that you are really sincere, if you want to prove you are not doing this because of some other agenda, then pass a law that says that no money, none of our foreign aid money, can go to any country that uses any of its money for abortion. That make no more sense than voting against this resolution.  Mr. President, I retain the remainder of my time.                               Exhibit 1                                                  U.S. Senate,                               Washington, DC, September 24, 1996.     Hon. Christopher H. Smith,     House of Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chris: I have reviewed the materials you recently sent      to my office in response to my request that you provide proof      that U.S. funds are being spent on abortion through AID's      voluntary international family planning program.      Unfortunately, I do not see anything in these materials to      back up your assertion.       AID has a rigorous process to make sure that the current      prohibition on the use of U.S. funds is adhered to and that      no U.S. funds are spent on abortion services. First, all      agreements into which AID enters (grants, contracts, and      cooperative agreements) include a legally binding and      enforcement clause prohibiting the contractee from using the      funds for abortion services. Second, AID staff monitor all      agreements as they are implemented in the field to ensure      that the agreements terms are being met. And finally, all      grants with non-governmental organizations require a      ``Circular A-133 Audit'' every one to two years. This audit      looks not only at the financial aspects of the agreement, but      reviews compliance with all terms of the agreement including      the prohibition on the use of U.S. funds. The audit is done      by an outside Big 8 accounting firm, not AID. According to      AID, compliance with the funding prohibition has not been a      problem.       In the meantime, Chris, you are contributing to an increase      of abortions worldwide because of the funding restrictions on      which you insisted in last year's funding bill. It is a      proven fact that when contraceptive services are not      available to women throughout the world, abortion rates      increase. We have seen it in the former Soviet Union where      women had no access to family planning and relied on abortion      as their primary birth control method. Some women had between      eight and twelve abortions during their lifetimes. This is      unacceptable to me as someone who is strongly opposed to      abortion.       It is my hope that we can work together to resolve this      issue before AID's international family planning program is      destroyed.       Kind regards.           Sincerely,                                                 Mark O. Hatfield,                                                     U.S. Senator.  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.
