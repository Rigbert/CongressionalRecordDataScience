President, and, of course, both the Senators from her home State have opposed her. In fact, if she is confirmed, this may be the first such Senate confirmation over the opposition of both home State Senators in the history of the Senate, something, I might say, that during President Clinton's time was inconceivable-that Republicans would even consider a nomination if one Senator from the home State opposed the nominee and, of course, under no circumstances both. Here both Senators do oppose her, and yet her nomination is going forward.  There remain 36 Republican Senators serving today who voted against the nomination of Justice Ronnie White of Missouri in 1999. Justice White is now the chief justice of the Missouri Supreme Court, having been that high court's first African-American member. Former Senator Ashcroft came to the floor and vilified Justice White as pro criminal in 1999, after action on that nomination had been delayed more than 2 years. Then, in a surprise party-line vote, Republican Senators all voted against his confirmation. In fact, that is the only party-line vote to defeat a judicial nomination that I can remember in my 31 years here.  Immediately after this party-line vote, by which Republican Senators defeated the nomination of Justice Ronnie White, many of them told us: We know he is qualified, but we had no choice because both home State Senators opposed the nomination. In order to respect the views of these home State Senators, they had to vote against a nominee who many felt was highly qualified.  Both Justice Brown's home State Senators oppose her confirmation. They have been consistent in that opposition. Republican Senators felt compelled to vote against Justice White, a nominee of President Clinton, in 1999 because of the opposition of his home State Senators. It is hard to see how they can now turn around and say: Well, but we can vote for a Republican nominee notwithstanding the same kind of opposition.  It is not just the two distinguished Senators from California who oppose her. Her views are so extreme that more than 200 law school professors around the Nation wrote to the Judiciary Committee expressing opposition.  The ``Los Angeles Times'' concludes she is a ``bad fit for a key court.'' The ``Detroit Free Press'' concluded she ``has all but hung a banner above her head declaring herself a foe to privacy rights, civil rights, legal precedent, and even colleagues who don't share her extreme leanings.''

Three of the high court's current members--Antonin Scalia,      Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg--came from the D.C.      circuit. So did onetime Chief Justices Warren Burger and Fred      Vinson, among others.       Presidents also give special attention to the D.C. court's      appointments because it often hears high-profile challenges      to presidential and congressional actions, defining the      government's authority. This year the D.C. Circuit Court      upheld the indefinite detention of potential terrorists at      Guantanamo, Cuba. In past years, it expanded police search      and seizure powers and upheld the 1971 campaign spending law      and environmental and workplace safety Laws. Before it now is      a challenge by California and other states to the      administration's view that the Clean Air Act does not allow      regulation of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.       That President Bush may view California Supreme Court      Justice Janice Rogers Brown as a future U.S. Supreme Court      justice could explain why he nominated her to the D.C. court,      3,000 miles from her San Francisco base. But during her seven      years on California's high court, Brown has shown doctrinaire      and peculiar views that make her a troubling choice for this      appeals court.       Judges are supposed to consider disputes with an open mind,      weighing facts against the law and precedent. Conscientious      judges sometimes find that their decisions conflict with      their personal beliefs. However, in opinions and speeches,      Brown has articulated disdainful views of the Constitution      and government that are so strong and so far from the      mainstream as to raise questions about whether they would      control her decisions.       `Where government advances,' she told a college audience,      `freedom is imperiled, community impoverished, religion      marginalized and civilization itself jeopardized'--a      startling view for someone who would be charged with      reviewing government actions. Brown has spoken disapprovingly      of what she called the U.S. Supreme Court's `hypervigilance'      with respect to such `judicially proclaimed fundamental      rights' as privacy, calling them `highly suspect, incoherent      and constitutionally invalid.'       These views may have prompted Brown's bitter dissents in      cases in which her colleagues upheld regulatory actions such      as local zoning and land-use laws. They seem to have fueled      her skepticism toward employment discrimination claims, cases      involving the rights of people with disabilities and the      meaning of consent in rape.       Brown's dogmatism and a style bordering on vituperation      earned her only a `qualified' rather than `well qualified'      rating from the American Bar Assn. Some committee members      found her unfit for the appeals court.       The Senate Judiciary Committee could vote on Brown's      nomination Thursday. There's little question that Brown is an      intellectually sharp and hard-working jurist, but that is not      enough. Her own words are unrelentingly hostile to      government's role in regulatory matters and protection of      individual rights. These are the very things on which she      would rule most often. Brown is a bad fit for the District of      Columbia appeals court.                                  ____                 Judicial Pick Not Fit for U.S. Court,       [From the Atlanta Journal and Constitution, Oct. 29, 2003]       President Bush has once again nominated a right-wing judge      for one of the nation's most influential appellate courts.      Worse yet, Janice Rogers Brown, a California Supreme Court      justice, is not qualified for the U.S. Court of Appeals for      the D.C. Circuit.       Despite Bush's penchant for politics over professional      qualifications in judicial appointments, Democrats are not      blameless in the current standoff. They filibustered the      nomination of Hispanic conservative Miguel Estrada for the      same appellate court vacancy. Estrada, who finally withdrew      from consideration, had unquestioned scholarly and legal      qualifications for a federal judgeship.       Rather than select another highly qualified conservative      for the key appellate bench, the president took the low road,      choosing a judge who previously received an `unqualified'      rating from the California bar's evaluation commission and      last month got a mixed rating of `qualified/unqualified' from      the American Bar Association. By contrast, Estrada received a      unanimous ABA rating of `well qualified.'       Brown's views, as espoused in speeches to ultraconservative      groups, are far out of the mainstream of accepted legal      principles. For example, she has disputed whether the Bill of      Rights, as incorporated in the U.S. Constitution, should have      been applied to the states.       While the African-American jurist claims her tendency to      `stir the pot' wouldn't affect her rulings, such a radical      view causes the public to wonder if she will respect basic      individual liberties guaranteed in the Bill of Rights.       Brown meets the GOP's litmus test of being anti-affirmative      action and anti-abortion, but that is a sorry measure of      judicial excellence. Bush knows that Brown will fall victim      to a Democratic filibuster. Apparently, this president would      rather have a campaign issue than a qualified federal      judiciary.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, Oct. 25, 2003]                      Out of the Mainstream, Again       Of the many unworthy judicial nominees President Bush has      put forward, Janice Rogers Brown is among the very worst. As      an archconservative justice on the California Supreme Court,      she has declared war on the mainstream legal values that most      Americans hold dear. And she has let ideology be her guide in      deciding cases. At her confirmation hearing this week,      Justice Brown only ratified her critics' worst fears. Both      Republican and Democratic senators should oppose her      confirmation.       Justice Brown, who has been nominated to the United States      Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, has      made it clear in her public pronouncements how extreme her      views are. She has attacked the New Deal, which gave us      Social Security and other programs now central to American      life, as ``the triumph of our socialist revolution.'' And she      has praised the infamous Lochner line of cases, in which the      Supreme Court, from 1905 to 1937, struck down worker health      and safety laws as infringing on the rights of business.       Justice Brown's record as a judge is also cause for alarm.      She regularly stakes out extreme positions, often dissenting      alone. In one case, her court ordered a rental car company to      stop its supervisor from calling Hispanic employees by racial      epithets. Justice Brown dissented, arguing that doing so      violated the company's free speech rights.       Last year, her court upheld a $10,000 award for emotional      distress to a black woman who had been refused an apartment      because of her race. Justice Brown, the sole dissenter,      argued that the agency involved had no power to award the      damages.       In an important civil rights case, the chief justice of her      court criticized Justice Brown for ``presenting an unfair and      inaccurate caricature'' of affirmative action. The American      Bar Association, all but a rubber stamp for the      administration's nominees, has given Justice Brown a mediocre      rating of qualified/not qualified, which means a majority of      the evaluation committee found her qualified, a minority      found her not qualified, and no one found her well qualified.       The Bush administration has packaged Justice Brown, an      African-American born in segregated Alabama, as an American      success story. The 39-member Congressional Black Caucus,      however, has come out against her confirmation.       President Bush, who promised as a candidate to be a      ``uniter, not a divider,'' has selected the most divisive      judicial nominees in modern times. The Senate should help the      president keep his campaign promise by insisting on a more      unifying alternative than Justice Brown.
