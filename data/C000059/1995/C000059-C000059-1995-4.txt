Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 207 as introduced by my esteemed colleague from California [Mr. Cox]. This is a matter of importance to my district and with that in mind I ask for passage of this bill.  Time is of the essence in this case. The county of San Diego has decided to disallow all building permits on the Lost Valley Scout Reservation until a master land plan is approved. This approval cannot come until this boundary dispute is resolved.  Lost Valley needs building permits now. The scout population at Lost Valley has increased 150 percent in just the past 3 years. As a result, repairs, and capital improvements must quickly commence. The Reservation is in dire need of 18 new staff cabins and a new dinning hall. In fact, the local health department has only allowed the existing dining hall's continued operation with the understanding that it will be replaced in the near future.  This bill is a fair settlement to end this boundary dispute and I urge its passage.
