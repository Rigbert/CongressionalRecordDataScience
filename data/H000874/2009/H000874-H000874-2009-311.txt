I have supported such a commission. The Speaker has discussed it as well, as the gentleman correctly points out. At this point in time, however, there has been no action taken on the creation of such commission.  So at this point in time, I certainly wouldn't anticipate when and if legislation might come to the floor. I would not be surprised if committees of Congress, however, did, in fact, take cognizance of both of the issues the gentleman raises, and there might possibly be legislation from committees. The commission is under active consideration.
