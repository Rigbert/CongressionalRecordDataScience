President, General Peter Pace will soon become the nextChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. There is no person more deserving of this honor and more ready to take on this awesome responsibility than General Pace, who has served the country with great distinction in the Marine Corps for almost four decades. I know the entire Senate joins me in congratulating him and in extending all best wishes as he assumes his new post as the primary military adviser to the Secretary of Defense and the President of the United States.  General Pace assumes the position at a difficult and a delicate time in our Nation's security situation. We are trying to bring political stability to Iraq, carrying out an intense counterinsurgency in a country rife with sectarian tensions and outright violence. The war in Iraq and ongoing operations in Afghanistan are placing enormous stress on our military's equipment, long-range planning, and, most importantly, its people. Our defense forces are also heavily engaged in the relief effort in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Active-Duty military personnel from each service are working closely with the National Guard to help Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas to recover from these catastrophes.  Yet if there is any military officer who will help the Nation's leaders understand the possibilities and limitations of military power in this ever-shifting international landscape, and mobilize our capabilities to best effect, it is General Peter Pace. General Pace has an extraordinary background forged through his strength of character, sharpness of intellect, and generosity of heart. General Pace is also a straight-talker, always speaking clearly and thoughtfully. He is a consummate professional who will also serve as a true leader, adviser, and spokesperson for the Department of Defense.  The depth and strength of General Pace's qualities and capabilities also come from his real-world experiences. Born in Brooklyn and raised in Teaneck, NJ, General Pace was commissioned in 1967. Soon after his graduation from the U.S. Naval Academy, he embarked on his stellar career and service in the Marine Corps. He served heroically in Vietnam, where he earned a Bronze Star in the line of fire.  As he rose through the ranks, General Pace has commanded recruiting stations and infantry battalions. At each posting he has brought a strong sense of purpose, strength, and insight. He has also served as an executive officer and chief of staff to high level officers before becoming one himself. In the early 1990s, he was deputy commander of our Marines in Somalia. In every one of his postings, higher ranking officials have wisely recognized his talents and skills and sought to put them to use.  General Pace will become the first marine to serve as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, just as he was the first marine to become the Vice Chairman. As Vice Chairman, he served the President, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, and Chairman Richard Myers superbly, overseeing the often complicated military requirements process and ensuring that the enormous staff of the Joint Chiefs runs smoothly. As a member of the Joint Chiefs, he contributed his wide-ranging insights and knowledge, as this important group tackled crises like the attacks of September 11 and the war in Iraq.  General Pace is devoted to his family--his wife Lynne and two children, Peter and Tiffany Marie and my wife Marcelle and I have enjoyed the time we have spent with them. We know that part of the dignity and strength that the general will bring to this new position comes from that incredible and invaluable family support.  I know that the entire Senate is proud of General Pete Pace and the Senate, like me, will want to wish him warm congratulations, deep appreciation and all best wishes in his new position.                          ____________________[Pages S10420-S10421]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]            THE PROMOTION OF MARINE CORPS GENERAL PETE PACE
