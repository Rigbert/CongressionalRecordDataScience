 President, the country is truly well served by having the Senator from North Dakota as ranking member. I don't know anyone who knows more about facts relating to our budget this year, last year, or in the last decade than the Senator from North Dakota. I am not being solicitous.  A good friend of ours from the State that was much closer to North Dakota than Delaware--from Wyoming, Senator Simpson--used to say in the Senate repeatedly, in his colloquial way: You know, everyone is entitled to their own opinion but not entitled to their own facts.  It seems as though some in the Senate think they are entitled to their own facts.  I will repeat some things that have been said here.
