President, yesterday we were reminded, again, of the lawlessness of the Bush-Cheney administration as it continues its abuse of ``signing statements'' as part of a systematic pursuit of power without the checks and balances inherent in our constitutional democracy. A most distinguished task force of the American Bar Association has now released a unanimous report highly critical of this President's practice as ``contrary to the rule of law and our constitutional system of separation of powers.'' I thank the distinguish panel of conservatives and moderates, or Republicans and Democrats for their thoughtful report.  Let me be clear, this is not some academic debate without consequences. I have been seeking to draw attention to this surreptitious power-grab for at least 4 years, since this President's unusual signing statement following enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley bill in 2002 to reign in corporate abuses that cost so many Americans their livelihoods and their retirement savings through Enron and other scandals.
