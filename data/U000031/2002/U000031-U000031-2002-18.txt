Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes.  Mr. Speaker, sometimes I think that the World Wide Web should be renamed perhaps the World's Wicked Web. I woke up this morning listening to the Today Show, and I heard this very sad case of a young girl in Danbury, Connecticut. I read from CNN: ``The body of a 13-year-old girl missing since Friday has been found. The FBI has arrested a Brazilian national living in Connecticut who allegedly met the girl on the Internet, the agency said Monday. Christina Long's body was found Monday. She had been missing since Friday evening.'' She had been contacted through a chat room on the Internet.  Last week in Kalamazoo, Michigan, we held a hearing on chat rooms. We know as parents that there is no better way to watch over our children than with parental involvement. The story, whether it be in Danbury Connecticut, or other communities across the country, is a nightmare waiting to happen in virtually anyplace in the country.  Last Friday, I visited an elementary school just outside of Kalamazoo, Northeastern Elementary School, where I spoke to about 80 or 90 sixth grade children. I asked the question, as I often do as I go to an elementary school, how many of you use the Internet on a fairly routine basis? They all raised their hands, every one of them.  I then asked the question: How many of you have seen something that is inappropriate coming into your house or your classroom on that Internet? And again, virtually every hand went up.  Mr. Speaker, what this legislation does is creates a new domain for the Internet. Like we have a dot-org and a dot-com and a dot-gov, we are now going to have a dot-kids. Actually, it may be a dot-kids dot-U.S. It may be a dot-Disney dot-kids; it may be a dot-Boy Scouts or dot-Girl Scouts, it may be a dot-games. But whatever it is, it will be aimed and earmarked towards children that are 12 and under. In essence, it will be a children's section of the library.  When my 10-year-old son, Stephen, goes to the library in my hometown, I know that that children's library in the basement of the Maud Preston Palenske Memorial Library has children's books and he is safe in that area. We know that as 10- and 12-year-olds and even 9-year-old children, they often have their own Internet identity name. They use the Internet for their school and home. They chat with their friends.  As parents, we want to make sure that they are safe, because that Internet will be their tool of learning for business and school the rest of their lives. But obviously, for so many of those young minds, they are not ready for some of those folks that would like to lure and prey on them.  That is what this legislation does. By setting up a new domain, we as parents will know that that road map for them is a safe, safe place.                              {time}  1030  This legislation, Mr. Speaker, is bipartisan. It passed in the subcommittee and full committee without dissent. We had great leadership from the author of the bill, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus), the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), the ranking member of the subcommittee, my chairman, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Tauzin), the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell), the ranking member, the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Terry) and other members of the subcommittee who were very involved in making sure this legislation passed and moved.  I would note that the bill has been endorsed by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the Family Research Council, the American Center for Law and Justice, the National Law Center for Children and Families and a Safe America for Everyone, SAFE. And I want to thank them all for their support.  Mr. Speaker, this legislation is needed. As parents, as members in a community, we know that we can stop some of this awful stuff that comes to our homes. Mr. Speaker, when someone rings the doorbell or knocks on a door, often as we go to that door we look through the peephole, we look through the windows to see who is there before they come in. On the Internet you are not able to do that.  In so many cases we see other folks masquerading maybe as 12 or 13 or 15-year-old children. Maybe they are in their 40s or 50s looking to prey on our kids. We had an arrest last week in Kalamazoo, and they found out just in 72 hours that that individual had 20 other victims that he will probably be charged with as he moved across county lines to try and seek and prey on kids just like this very sad story of the young girl in Danbury, Connecticut.  Mr. Speaker, as Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3833, the ``Dot Kids Implementation and Efficiency Act of 2002''. This bill was introduced by the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Shimkus, the gentleman from Massachusetts, the ranking member of the Telecommunications and Internet Subcommittee, Mr. Markey, and myself--and the bill has 40 bipartisan cosponsors.  Mr. Speaker, more and more parents have recognized that they are losing some control over what enters their home as their children spend more and more time on the home computer surfing the Internet. While the Internet is an excellent tool for children to learn, there are all sorts of inappropriate material that--with just one wrong click--comes right into your living room, den, or bedroom--wherever the computer is located. I visit a school every week in my district, and at every middle school I ask for a show of hands about how many kids use the Internet, and about every hand goes up. I then ask how many have seen inappropriate material--pornography or bad language--and virtually every time about 80 percent of the hands stay in the air. This has got to stop.  While there is no substitute for proper parental supervision, responsible parents want more tools to assist them in protecting their kids on the Internet. Filters are one solution, but we believe more must be done to help.  The ``Dot Kids Implementation and Efficiency Act of 2002'' (H.R. 3833), would enable the establishment of a kid-friendly space on the Internet. We have made passage of this important bipartisan legislation, a top priority of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and its Telecommunications and Internet Subcommittee, and I want to thank Chairman Tauzin and Ranking Member Dingell for their assistance in moving this legislation forward.  Just like ``.com'', or ``.gov'', or ``.org''--``.kids'' will be an Internet address code, but the difference is that only websites with content which is both ``not harmful to minors'' and ``suitable for minors'' could get access. Under the bill, a ``minor'' is defined as a person 12 years old and under. The ``.kids'' space would be a safe place devoted solely to material which is appropriate for kids--where parents could choose to send their kids. This is really no different in concept than the children's section at the public library--which is the only part of the library where kids are allowed to check out books.  More specifically, the ``.kids'' space would be housed within our country's Internet code, otherwise known as ``.us'', which would result in ``.kids.us.''. For instance, if the Boy Scouts of America, whose website currently is: www.scouting.org, decided to set up an additional mirror site in the ``.kids.us'' space itwould be: www.scouting.kids.us. The U.S. Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) would oversee the implementation of ``.kids.us'', and while the bill stipulates that only websites with content that is ``not harmful to minors'' and is ``suitable for minors'' can get into the ``.kids.us'' space, the written content standards and rules of the road would be developed and enforced by the private sector, under the direction of the registry which has the contract from the Department of Commerce to manage the ``.us'' country code.  While the Supreme Court has cited the First Amendment as the basis for striking down previous efforts by Congress to protect kids on the Internet, H.R. 3833 is drafted in a manner which is consistent with the First Amendment. First, the proposal doesn't affect anyone's ability to put whatever kind of speech they want on the World Wide Web, on a ``dot com,'' ``dot net,'' ``dot org'' or anywhere else. This bill only addresses a subset of Internet--the ``dot us'' space. Moreover, it doesn't even curtail speech throughout the entirety of the ``dot us'' space. Speech more appropriate for adults or teenagers will not be affected by this bill and can appear elsewhere in the ``dot us'' space. The bill solely says that if you want to operate in the ``dot kids'' area--a subset of the ``dot us'' country code domain--you have entered a kid-friendly zone--where the content is suitable for children 12 and under. Again, this is completely voluntary for parents to use if they wish and content providers to avail themselves of if they are so inclined.  Moreover, now more than ever, parents recognize the dangers posed to their children in Internet chat rooms, where pedophiles can prey on children right in the comfort of the family living room. This is why the bill also bans chat rooms and instant messaging in the ``.kids.us'' space--unless such can be done without jeopardizing the safety of kids, through effective monitoring for example. Also, hyperlinks, which would take kids outside of the ``.kids.us'' space, would be banned.  Mr. Speaker, I would note that this bill has been endorsed by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the Family Research Council, the American Center for Law and Justice, the National Law Center for Children and Families, and a Safer America For Everyone (SAFE), and I want to thank all of them for their support.  Again, I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois and the gentleman from Massachusetts for all of their hard work and perseverance on this bill, and I urge an ``aye'' vote on the bill on this measure which will help protect children and families on-line.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
