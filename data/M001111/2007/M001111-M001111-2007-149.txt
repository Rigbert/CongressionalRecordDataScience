 President, the Senator from Louisiana has raised a critically important issue with regard to the need of the disabled and homeless citizens in Katrina-impacted areas she knows so well. We are going to be developing a supplemental appropriations bill in a very short time which we anticipate will include provisions as it relates to Katrina. The Senator does have my commitment that I will work with her to see what we can do to address that critical need within the supplemental.                     Amendment No. 2795, Withdrawn
