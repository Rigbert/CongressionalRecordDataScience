 President, Senator Helms is not able to be here at this moment.  With regard to labor unions in America, let me say, on behalf of his amendment, we have had amendments that would guarantee that union members had an opportunity to consent to their money being used on causes to which they might object. That was voted down. We have had amendments on disclosure so that union members and the public could learn how union money is being spent. That has been voted down.  Senator Helms is now offering a very basic right to members, and that is notification. He hopes that if consent is a poison pill, and disclosure is a poison pill, maybe notification will not be. That is at the heart of the Helms amendment.  I certainly would urge all Members to support this very important amendment that provides basic fairness to members of organized labor.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
