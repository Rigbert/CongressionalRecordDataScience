 For 8 long years our Republican colleagues stood shoulder-to-shoulder with George Bush as our country accelerated its slide toward a third world infrastructure. The collapse of the bridge in Minnesota is perhaps the signal moment of the Bush administration. What did they do before and what have they done after for our infrastructure? Nothing.  They didn't believe in investing in our public infrastructure. Tax cuts, tax cuts, tax cuts. Tax cuts never built a single highway. Tax cuts never built a transit system. Tax cuts never replaced a bridge.  Tax cuts are not the answer to all of America's problems. We need to invest in our public infrastructure in this country. The most solid core point of this bill is what we are debating right now, more than $40 billion of investment in the future of America putting our highways and our bridges back in good repair, rebuilding our transit systems, beginning to provide new capacity, to get people more efficiently to work, to avoid the costs of congestion, the costs of the deficient services we suffer.  These are jobs. I heard someone, some bizarre Republican stand up earlier and say something about the difference between work and jobs. This is work that puts Americans to work, and it's jobs, and it rebuilds our country. I don't quite get what point that person was making. And it's not a tax cut. It's real investment.  I can justify borrowing money to build a bridge or a transit system that will serve the next two or three or four or five generations of Americans a lot more than I can justify a tax cut which is gone tomorrow and did nothing to rebuild our future.  They lack vision. In this we will buy American products. ``Buy American'' is the theme of transportation policy in this country. We will buy buses made in America. We will even start buying street cars for the first time made in America.  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.
