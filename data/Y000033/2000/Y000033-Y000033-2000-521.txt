Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Resources Committee and author of title XV of H.R. 5528 as passed by the House, I wish to make a statement to provide factual background and clarify congressional intent as to the meaning and implementation of that title.  The Secretary of Interior has created allocation pools for acreage entitlements of regional corporations under sections 14(h)(1) and 14(h)(8) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) and conveyances to one regional corporation under section 14(h)(1) may have the effect of reducing the entitlements of all other regional corporations under section 14(h)(8). Chugach Alaska Corporation (Chugach) currently has significant entitlement remaining under its section 14(h)(1) allocation and the Secretary believes Chugach is over-conveyed under its current section 14(h)(8) but allocations under section 14(h)(8) have not been finalized. In the event that any acreage ultimately conveyed to Chugach as a result of title XV would have the effect of reducing the section 14(h)(8) allocations of other regional corporations under current regulations, section 1506(a) provides that such reduction shall be charged solely against Chugach's final section 14(h)(8) allocation, notwithstanding such current regulations, or other applicable law.                          ____________________
