 But I do want to continue to correct a couple of things the Senator from Kansas has spoken about.  First, I was listening as he was quoting from the Department of Justice letter. And he may have a later letter, but those exact words that he was reading from appear in a November 15 letter that Senator Leahy received as chairman of the Judiciary Committee with objections from the Department of Justice.  But those objections are about the bill S. 1759, the bill that I said we have modified considerably as an amendment here, so that it does not do all of the things that have been attributed to it.
