 Mr. Chairman, for the first time since 1974, it appears that Congress will not adopt a budget when the same political party controls the House, the Senate, and the White House. In other words, in 28 years we have not been in this position of not being able to pass a budget.  Why can the Republican majority not fulfill one of the most basic tests of effective government, adopting a budget? Because they cling to the fiction that we can rein in record deficits and runaway debt by applying pay-as-you-go budget rules to mandatory spending only.
