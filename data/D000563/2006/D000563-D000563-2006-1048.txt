President, I thank Senators Kennedy, Kyl, and Cornyn, as well as Senator McCain and those who are responsible for putting this together.  This is a dramatic improvement over the original version of this amendment.  I associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from South Carolina. I think of these laws and amendments in human terms that we deal with every day in our Senate offices. Almost 80 percent of all of the case work requests for help that we receive in my offices in Illinois relate to immigration. Every day, we have new situations and new family challenges that we are forced to confront. Some of them are heartbreaking.  I think specifically of the Benitez family in Chicago. Mr. Benitez is an American citizen. He works hard. He has lived in this country for many years. He is a wonderful man. I see him in downtown Chicago regularly when I am going around. It is always good to see such a fine man who has worked so hard and who really believes in his family. His wife came to this country on a visa, overstayed the visa, married him, and continued to live in the United States undocumented.
