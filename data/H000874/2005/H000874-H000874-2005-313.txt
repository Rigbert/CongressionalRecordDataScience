 The GSE, the GSE bill was initially, our thought was that would be on the floor this coming week.                              {time}  1715  The gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank), the ranking Democrat on the Committee on Financial Services, is on the floor and has been very involved in this bill.  I am not sure you even know this, but the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank) informs me that there are very significant sums that would be available to the gulf area for housing in the GSE bill, which will be regular order, and the benefit would be that this money would be available, and we know we are going to have to spend money in that area.  Can you tell me why the GSE bill is not on the floor? This deals, as you know, with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  Mr. DeLAY. Well, we do understand that this bill came out of the Committee on Financial Services I think with a vote of 65 to 5.  It is a bill that is anticipated, and we really want to bring it to the floor. To be quite honest with you, we have some Members on this side of the aisle that are still wanting to negotiate some changes in that bill before we bring it to the floor; and we are in that process. As soon as we can get a consensus of where our Members are on that bill, then we will bring it to the floor.
