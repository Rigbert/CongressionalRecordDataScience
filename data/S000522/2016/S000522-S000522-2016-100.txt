I thank Mr. Rothfus very much for his leadership and for his very eloquent remarks.  William Wilberforce reminds us all that, through prayer, fasting, tenacity, and the pursuit of justice, he really was able to stop the slave trade.  Thankfully, in this Congress, we have so many leaders--men and women on the pro-life side--who stand up boldly and effectively, and we will win this.  I thank the gentleman for his leadership.  I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Olson), my good friend and colleague.                              {time}  1815
