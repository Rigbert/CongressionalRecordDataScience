Speaker, it is with great pride and respect that I take this opportunity to welcome home members of the 376th Engineer Battalion of Hammond, Indiana, and to honor them for their patriotism, their dedication, and their willingness to defend their country. These brave soldiers, known as the Men of Steel, recently returned to Northwest Indiana after completing several missions in Mosul, Iraq in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The 376th honorably provided security during the recent Iraqi elections, took part in reconstruction efforts within Iraqi cities, provided humanitarian support to the people of Iraq, and courageously disposed of improvised explosive devices. The members of the 376th Engineer Battalion will be recognized at a homecoming ball in their honor, which will take place on January 21, 2006, at the Dynasty Banquet Hall in Hammond, Indiana.  The people of this entire nation, as well as the citizens of Iraq, can be proud of the sacrifice and courage of these fine individuals: CPT Sean Begley, PV2 Alexander Baker, SPC Christopher Bennett, PV1 Adam Branson, SPC David Croyle, PV1 Joseph Gibbs, SPC Jaime Hoch, SPC Muain Issa, SPC Tobey Johnson, SGT Nicholas Kowalczyk, SPC Ashley Sharp, SPC Terry Specyal, SGT Jose Tovalin, SPC Aaron Vance, SPC Michael Vician, SGT Travis Wheatley, SFC William Johnson, SPC Luke Abbott, SPC Daniel Wiley, SPC Joseph Veyette, SPC Enrique Uribe, SSG Mark Tegtman, SPC William Sideris, SPC Aaron Santonelli, SPC Carlos Reyes, SPC Brian Panzik, SGT Donald Mull, PFC William Mills, SPC Angel Lozano, SPC Timothy Bishop, PFC Christopher Boger, SPC Steven Bramer, PV2 David Kuzmar, SPC Jason Loebbaka, SPC Thomas Martinez, PFC Brandon McCormick, SGT David Moake, SSG Stephen Otten, SGT Gershom Parr, SFC Melvin Pennington, SPC Daniel Rubalcava, SPC Vincent Lenart, SPC Allen Hughes, SGT Robert Jaso, SPC Matthew Gabrano, SGT Ryan Bood, SPC Jonathan Bright, SPC Corrie Covelli, SPC Ryan Eder, SGT Michael Guz, SGT Brian Brandenburg, SPC Joshua Buikema, SPC Jonathan Cuevas, SSG Thomas Kopanda, SPC Paul Gordon, SSG Matthew Hamater, PFC Michael Brunsman, and SPC Michael Coughlin.
