. House of Representatives passed the 19th Amendment, taking a monumental step toward giving women the right to vote.  Women have always played an instrumental role in shaping this country, yet lacked one of the most fundamental rights. It wasn't until 1919 that our nation righted this wrong and millions of women earned the right to vote, thereby gaining full citizenship.  A women's suffrage amendment was first introduced in Congress in 1878. It wasn't until 41 years later that both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate finally voted to approve the 19th Amendment. The effort then went on to the states, requiring the approval of three-quarters of state legislatures.  I am proud to say that the great state of Wisconsin led the way. Wisconsin made history by becoming the first state to ratify the 19th amendment, granting national suffrage to women. This early and important vote paved the way for other states to follow suit.  Today is a day to celebrate the achievements of the women who made great sacrifices for suffrage. I especially want to thank Speaker Pelosi, and Rebecca Kleefisch who served as Executive Director of the Centennial Commission, and all of the other members of Commission for their tireless efforts to make this day possible.                          ____________________
