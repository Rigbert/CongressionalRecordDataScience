President, this year marks the 100th anniversary of the Webfoot Warriors, the Reserve Officers' Training Corps program at the University of Oregon. As an alumnus of the University of Oregon Law School, I would like to commemorate this milestone. Reserve Officers' Training Corps, or ROTC, is a voluntary program offered at hundreds of schools across the country. Students who meet the eligibility requirements and stick with the program receive subsidized tuition and, after graduation, are commissioned as officers in the U.S. military. The ROTC curriculum consists of courses in military science and history as well as practical skills and leadership training.  The ROTC program we know today traces its roots to the National Defense Act of 1916, a bill signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson barely a year before the United States entered World War I. Like many other university administrators of the day, Prince Lucien Campbell, the University of Oregon's president at the time, was a supporter of the program. President Campbell established the first ROTC curriculum at the University of Oregon, placing a retired British military officer--the appropriately named Lieutenant Colonel John Leader--in charge. More than 100 students participated in the first drill in March 1916.  The University of Oregon ROTC program commissioned its first officers in 1919, after the Allied victory in World War I, and the unit has produced some truly top-notch officers in the decades since. In fact, the Army Cadet Command awarded the unit a General Douglas MacArthur Award for the 2014-2015 academic year, recognizing it as one of the top eight Army ROTC programs in the country. According to the unit's records, the University of Oregon has produced more general officers than any nonmilitary ROTC program in the country. The program also counts a total of 47 flag officers among its graduates.  As Oregonians, we have long taken pride in serving our State and this great country, and the Webfoot Warriors are hardly an exception. As then-President Campbell put it himself, ``the matter of military training in any school seems to me to be a training for better citizenship, rather than for war.'' Today I say thank you to all of the men and women of the Webfoot Warriors past and present, and I wish the University of Oregon ROTC program another 100 years of success.                          ____________________
