President. In all fairness to the Parliamentarian, the definition of relevancy, even as we define it may turn out to be a lot different when individual amendments are actually offered. I would object to the UC if it includes reference to relevancy until we have had a chance to look and determine whether my amendments or any others are irrelevant. Amendments have been written and a decision can be made.
