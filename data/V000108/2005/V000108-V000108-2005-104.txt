Speaker, it is my distinct honor to commend two of Northwest Indiana's most distinguished citizens, Mr. Bob Anadell and Mr. Timothy Sanders. On Saturday, April 23, 2005, they will be honored for their exemplary and dedicated service to the community. Their praiseworthy efforts will be recognized at the TradeWinds Gala 2005 banquet at the Radisson Hotel at Star Plaza in Merrillville, Indiana.  Bob Anadell has had many positive accomplishments throughout his career. He actively contributed to his community through participation in various programs aimed at improving opportunities for the people of Northwest Indiana. He has been a powerful member of the Northwest Indiana Building Trades, Secretary Treasurer of the IBEW State Conference, Vice-President of the Indiana State AFL-CIO, Trustee of the Lake Area United Way, Board of Directors of TradeWinds, Member of the Lake County Integrated Services Delivery Board, Chairman of the Board of Directors, Investment Committee, and Executive Committee of the Legacy Foundation, as well as Co-Chairman of the Heroes Committee of the American Red Cross.  Tim Sanders enjoyed serving the public for several years as Director of Senator Richard G. Lugar's regional office. In addition to serving Senator Lugar, Tim has also worked with Senators Dan Quayle and Dan Coats. Through skillful networking within the state and federal legislative agencies, he established solid relationships benefiting Northwest Indiana's businesses and constituents. Tim implemented public relations initiatives through television, radio, and print to provide information, gather support, and raise visibility on key issues. He has also extended his commitment to the community by serving on a number of Boards and Associations such as the St. Jude House, Lake Area United Way, American Heart Association, and the TradeWinds Rehabilitation Center. Although Tim has dedicated his time serving the community, he has never neglected to provide support and love to his family. Tim and his wife, Tania, have two children and three grandchildren.  Both of these men have spent years as dedicated members of the TradeWinds Board of Directors; each adding their individual business acumen and combined strength that has enabled TradeWinds to continue providing quality services for children and adults with disabilities.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Bob Anadell and Timothy Sanders. Without their enduring love and compassion for the community and children of all ages and abilities, TradeWinds would not be what it is today.                          ____________________
