President, Monday night in Saint Louis a dream season came to an end. The University of Illinois was defeated for only the second time this season as they fell to the University of North Carolina Tar Heels. But as painful as the loss was, it does not detract from a remarkable season.  Head coach Bruce Weber and his Illini should know there is nothing to be disappointed about. As much as I would have enjoyed seeing the Illini conclude their remarkable run with an NCAA championship, there is no doubting what the Illini have accomplished. The team tied an NCAA record with 37 victories. They made the first championship game appearance in the school's 100-year basketball history. They won regular-season and conference tournament Big 10 championships and were ranked first overall in the Associated Press poll since early in the season.  If I could pick one word to describe the Illini this season, it would be ``team.'' Rarely has a group of young men worked together as well as the Illini has. After Illinois defeated Louisville 72 to 57 on Saturday evening, Louisville head coach Rick Pitino said, ``I don't know if they necessarily had the greatest talent I've seen from a Final Four, but they're the best team I've seen in some time.''  The Illini are the ultimate team, and that is the ultimate compliment to coach Weber and his players.  Every man on the floor was capable of leading the team to victory, whether it was guards Dee Brown, Luther Head or Deron Williams, or forwards James Augustine or Roger Powell. Yet Illinois plays within head coach Bruce Weber's system and doesn't allow ego, personal statistical goals, or anything else to disrupt their teamwork.  Unfortunately, they came up short against North Carolina. But the State of Illinois is proud of their Illini. An orange hue has been cast across the State as Illinoisans got behind the team for their NCAA tournament run. So many people have enjoyed this tournament and they won't soon forget where they were when the Illini shocked Arizona, or when Roger Powell slam-dunked the rebound from his own three-point shot against Louisville.  I would like to congratulate B. Joseph White, who became the University's 16th president on January 31 of this year, and the administration, faculty, staff, student body, and fans of the University of Illinois on making it to the championship game of the 2005 NCAA tournament.  To the coaches, Illini players, and their families, thanks for the memories. Thanks for showing us what teamwork is all about.                          ____________________
