'  I just met a gentleman the other day who worked for Eastern Airlines for over a decade on the east coast and who had to move to Florida to completely change his occupation. He is now in his fifties, enrolled in a 5-year program in environmental agriculture, a highly skilled airplane mechanic who, if he is lucky, will get maybe $300 a year when he reaches 65 from that company for his years of employment there, much less than he would have expected to have gotten in his retirement years. So we have got people all over this country who have been robbed of their pension benefits.
