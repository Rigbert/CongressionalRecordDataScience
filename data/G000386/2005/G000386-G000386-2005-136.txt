 President, before we have the next rollcall on the Reed amendment, I have been asked by many Members if we could do what worked so successfully for Senator Specter on his bill by enforcing the 10-minute rule. The leader has asked me to say that is what we are going to do. So we will have regular order after the 10-minute rollcall vote, so people should stay around close to make sure they get their vote recorded.  We are going to enforce the Specter rule. If you don't like it, blame Specter.
