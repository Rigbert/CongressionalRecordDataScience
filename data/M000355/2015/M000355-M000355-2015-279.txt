 Several amendments were agreed to yesterday, and we expect more to be considered before we complete action on the bill. Senator Kirk and Senator Tester expect to wrap up consideration today, so any Senators with amendments to the bill should be talking to the two managers.  We will have a rollcall vote on the NDAA at approximately 11:20 a.m., and I hope to vote on passage of the MILCON-VA appropriations bill shortly thereafter.  If we complete action on NDAA, MILCON-VA, and send the long-term highway bill to conference later today, that will allow the Senate to adjourn for the Veterans Day holiday.                          ____________________
