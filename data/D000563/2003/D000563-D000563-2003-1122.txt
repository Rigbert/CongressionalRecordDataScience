President, those who vote no on this amendment have basically asked for the best of both worlds. They want all the positive publicity for reforming education, but they don't want to pay the bill. That is an abdication of responsibility to my State and every other State.  I urge Senators who believe in the President's program to stand with the program when it comes to providing the funds. This amendment will give them that chance to do so.  I yield the floor.
