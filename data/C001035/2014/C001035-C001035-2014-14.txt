President, I and the many other supporters of S. 2270 are pleased that this legislation has passed the Senate. It is critical that this legislation be enacted this year. We look forward to its enactment this year and working with regulators as they implement appropriate, tailored capital rules for insurers under their supervision.                          ____________________
