President, it is a great pleasure to wish the Town of Columbia Falls a very happy 150th birthday. Throughout this year, Columbia Falls will celebrate the generations of hard-working and caring people who have made it such a wonderful place to live, work, and raise families.  While this sesquicentennial marks Columbia Falls' incorporation, the year 1863 was but one milestone in a long journey of progress. It is a journey that began eons earlier, when the receding glaciers carved out the river known to Native Americans as the Wescogus and to those who came later as the Pleasant. In the decades before America won its freedom, the Pleasant River provided the wildlife that sustained the first settlers. In the years that followed, it became a great avenue of commerce in products from field and forest and a great shipbuilding industry thrived along its banks.  Natural resources are only the background for Columbia Falls' story. Such names as Judge Thomas Ruggles, Daniel Carleton, Elijah Hamlin, Henry Bucknam, and Mary Ruggles Chandler remind us of the determination, ingenuity, and hard work that built the town. The impressive representation of Columbia Falls landmarks on the National Registry of Historic Places and the town's ongoing effort to restore Union Hall demonstrate the high regard the residents of today have for those who came before.  In the year of Columbia Falls' incorporation, America was engaged in the Civil War. Many brave patriots from this community stepped forward to preserve our Nation and to secure the blessing of freedom for all, and they were remembered at the Columbia Falls Civil War Ball in April that launched this 150th anniversary celebration. Through their longstanding commitment to the inspiring Wreaths Across America Project, the people of Columbia Falls honor the heroes who have served our country throughout our history and bring distinction to our State.  This celebration is not just about something that is measured in calendar years. It is about human accomplishment. We celebrate the people who for more than a century and a half have pulled together, cared for one another, and built a great community. Thanks to those who came before, Columbia Falls has a wonderful history. Thanksto those who are here today, it has a bright future.                          ____________________
