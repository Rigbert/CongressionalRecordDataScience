 Ladies and gentlemen, we remember the difficult path we trod as a Nation to ensure the participation of all, and we ought to do everything we can to preserve it in our own day. It is not just history that we want to learn; it is the lesson for today that we must remember and learn.  I thank John Lewis for his leadership. I thank the thousands, black and white, young and old, rich and poor, who joined together to make America a better place.
