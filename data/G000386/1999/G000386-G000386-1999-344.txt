 President, I am joined today by Senator Burns introducing legislation to expand the student loan interest deduction. Specifically, my bill will repeal the sixty-month payment limitation and increase the income levels qualifying students for the tax deduction for student loan interest. I previously presented the elimination of the sixty-month student loan deductibility restriction in a bill in February. As a member of the Finance Committee, I have asked that both it and the income limit expansion I now propose be included in the Reconciliation bill that will be before the Senate this week. I am happy to report that both are in the committee reported bill.  In a move detrimental to the education of our nation's students, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 eliminated the tax deduction for student loan interest. Deeply troubled that this important relief was no longer available to young women and men trying to start their careers, since 1987 my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and I have sought to ease the heavy burden of paying back student loans by reinstating the tax deduction. In 1992, we succeeded in passing legislation to restore the deduction for student loan interest, only to be stymied by a veto as part of a larger bill with tax increases. After ten arduous years, our persistent work on behalf of America's students finally came to fruition when we succeeded in reinstating the deduction under the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. Our victory demonstrated Congress' sincere commitment to making educational opportunities available to all students and families across the nation, and confirmed our willingness to assist young Americans in acquiring the best education possible by easing the financial hardship they face.  While our endeavors in 1997 were progressive, we were unable to go as far as we wanted to go due to financial constraints. Because the nation was still in a fiscal crisis at that time, we were compelled to limit the deductibility of student loan interest to sixty payments, and to only those taxpayers with an adjusted gross income of between $40,000 and $55,000 filing individually or between $60,000 and $75,000 for married couples. Additionally, the deduction itself was phased in at $1000, and will cap out at $2500 in 2002.  In keeping the income limits for the deduction at such low income levels, we are letting a great opportunity to assist more young Americans pass us by. Setting the income cap at the current low mark does a disservice to some of our nation's most needy collegiate borrowers. A great number of students are forced to borrow heavily to acquire an education that will allow them to stay competitive in our global economy. The present income restriction punishes resourceful students who land jobs which pay salaries slightly above the meager cap, even though they may have been forced to borrow heavily to obtain their education due to limited means.  Currently, the deductibility of student loan interest is limited to a mere sixty loan payments, equivalent to five years plus time spent in forbearance or deferment. This payment limitation, like the income restriction, was put in place during our fiscal difficulties of 1997. Since we are now experiencing a great budget surplus with our booming economy, Congress now has the ability to expand on both of these areas where previously we were forced to scale back. As mentioned, I already introduced a bill, S. 471, that would eliminate the 60-month limit on student loan interest reductions.  Fortunately, our situation today is quite different than when we made our original improvements in 1997. Now, with our robust economy and budget surplus, we have a splendid opportunity to do what we were unable to do before. As the price of going to college has continued to spiral upward, student debt has risen to appalling levels. We must not shrink from our responsibility to provide additional relief to our students. We should repeal the sixty-month payment limitation. We should increase the income levels from $40,000 to $50,000 for single students, and, eliminating any marriage penalty, increase from $60,000 to $100,000 for married couples. The amount of the deduction would then be gradually phased out for taxpayers with incomes between $50,000 and $65,000 filing individually and between $100,000 and $115,000 for married couples. Let our actions clearly demonstrate that the United States Congress stands behindall of our nation's students in their efforts to better their lives.  By expanding the student loan interest deduction, we will bring vital relief to some of our most deserving borrowers seeking the American dream. Rather than penalizing resourceful students who find jobs with incomes above the present cap, we will be rewarding the hard work and ingenuity of our students. We must continue to support young Americans who land jobs with salaries slightly above our current threshold yet still needing financial assistance.  Excessive student debt is a major problem for many students. As people in a position to help them, Congress must seek out more ways to be of service to our young people. In this time of economic plenty, it is our duty to invest in our students' education, for to do so is an investment in America's future. A well-deducted workforce is vital to maintain competitiveness in an ever-changing global economy. By broadening the income limits to receive the tax deduction for student loan interest, we demonstrate our commitment to education and maintaining the position of the United States at the pinnacle of the free world.  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to relieve the excessive burdens on those trying to better themselves and their families through education by loosening the income limits to quality for the tax deduction for student loan interest payments and eliminating the sixty-month payment limitation.                                 ______                                       By
