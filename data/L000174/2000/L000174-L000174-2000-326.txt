President, I am delighted to support the confirmation of Jerry Lynch to the District Court for the Southern District of New York. Professor Lynch is the Paul J. Kellner Professor of Law at Columbia Law School, the outstanding law school from which he received his law degree in 1975. He began his legal career by clerking on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals for Judge Feinberg and then on the United States Supreme Court for Justice Brennan.  He served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York back in the early 1980's and as the Chief Appellate Attorney for that office. In 1990 he returned to the office at the request of President Bush's U.S. Attorney to head the Criminal Division of that office.  Even his opponents must describe him as ``a man of personal integrity and a man of considerable legal skill.'' That he is. He is also a person who served as a prosecutor during two Republican Administrations.  Professor Lynch is well aware that he has been nominated to the District Court and not to the United States Supreme Court and that he will be bound by precedent. He has committed to follow precedent and the law and not to substitute his own views. In his answers to the Judiciary Committee, he wrote:       There is no question in my mind that the principal      functions of the courts is the resolution of disputes and      grievances brought to the courts by the parties. A judge who      comes to the bench with an agenda, or a set of social      problems he or she would like to ``solve,'' is in the wrong      business. In our system of separation of powers, the courts      exist to apply the Constitution and laws to the cases that      are presented to them, not to resolve political or social      issues. The bulk of the work of the lower courts consists of      criminal cases and the resolution of private disputes and      commercial matters.  In fact, in specific response to written questions from Senator Sessions, Professor Lynch wrote that he understands that the role of a district court judge requires him to follow the precedents of higher courts faithfully and to give them full force and effect, even if he personally disagrees with such precedents.  His opponents excerpt a couple lines of text from a 1984 book review and a eulogy to his former boss, Justice Brennan, rewrite them and argue that their revisions of his words indicate a judicial philosophy that he will not enforce the Constitution but his own policy preferences. They are wrong.  I have read the articles from which opponents excerpted out of context a phrase here and a phrase there to try to construct some justification for opposing this nominee. In his 1984 book review, Professor Lynch was criticizing a book that defended the legitimacy of constitutional policymaking by the judiciary. That's right: Professor Lynch was on the side of the debate that criticized personal policymaking by judges and counseled judicial restraint.  Professor Lynch criticized the author for a ``theory justifying judges in writing their own systems of moral philosophy into the Constitution.'' Nonetheless, opponents of this nominee turn the review on its head, as if Professor Lynch were the proponent of the proposition he was criticizing.  These opponents take a throw-away line out of context from the book review and miss the point of the review. What his critics miss is the fact that Professor Lynch argued against the Supreme Court being the politically activist institution that the book he is criticizing seeks to justify. Professor Lynch argues against judges, even Supreme Court Justices, becoming moral philosophers. He writes, following the excerpt on which his critics rely:       [N]either of these claims has force when the Court speaks      through the medium of moral philosophy. First, there is      little reason to expect judges to be more likely than      legislators to reach correct answers to moral questions.      After all, judges possess no particular training or expertise      that gives them better insight than other citizens into      whether abortion is a fundamental right or an inexcusable      wrong. Disinterestedness alone does not determine success in      intellectual endeavor. . . .  Ignored by his critic is also the written answer that Professor Lynch furnished Senator Sessions explaining what he meant by the statement that is being misread and misinterpreted, again, by his opponents. Professor Lynch explained:       The quoted statement comes from a book review in which I      sharply criticize a book that makes the claim that courts      have authority to enforce moral principles of its own      choosing, a position I do not share. In the quoted passage, I      was attempting to explain why the Supreme Court is given      power to enforce the text of a written Constitution.  The other quote being criticized is taken from a short memorial to Justice Brennan, a man for whom Professor Lynch had clerked and whom he respected. The memorial was apparently written just after Justice Brennan's funeral. Professor Lynch wrote of Justice Brennan's humanity and his patriotism. Nonetheless, it appears that even this statement of tribute to a departed friend is grist for the mill of opponents looking for something they can declare objectionable.  Ignored by opponents is the direct response to Senator Sessions' question about the eulogy for Justice Brennan. Professor Lynch responded to Senator Sessions:       The statement quoted comes from a eulogy to Justice Brennan      on the occasion of his death. I do not believe that good      faith attempts to discern the original intent of the framers      are dishonest or dishonorable. Judges and historians daily      make honorable and honest attempts to understand the thoughts      of the framers.       Too often, however, the history that lawyers present to      courts is deliberately or inadvertently biased by the      position that lawyers as advocates would like to reach, and      such resort to partial and limited sources can be used to      support results that accord with policy preferences. While      Justice Brennan took positions that can be criticized as      activist, it     is generally agreed that he was forthright in stating his      approach.  Likewise ignored is Professor Lynch's statement to Senator Sessions: ``The judge's role is to apply the law, not to make it.''  Also ignored are the acknowledgments by Professor Lynch in the course of the memorial itself that the ``charge that Justice Brennan confused his own values with those of the Constitution does capture one piece of the truth'' and that the ``problem, and here is the heart of the argument against Brennanism, is that there will always be different interpretations of what those core shared values mean in particular situations.'' I commend Professor Lynch for his candor.  It is sad that Senators have come to oppose nominees and the Senate has refused to move forward on nominees because they clerked, as young lawyers just out of law school for a certain judge or because clients they represented during the course of their practice and while fulfilling their professional responsibilities had certain types of claims and charges against them or brought certain types of claims. That is what underlies the opposition to both this highly qualified nominee and to Fred Woocher, a nominee to an emergency vacancy on the District Court for the Central District of California.  Mr. Woocher participated in a confirmation hearing last November and has been denied consideration by the Judiciary Committee for more than six months. Mr. Woocher has had a distinguished legal career and is fully qualified to serve as a District Judge. But Mr. Woocher clerked for Justice Brennan after his academic studies at Yale and Stanford.  Apparently, Senators who are holding up consideration of Mr. Woocher likewise believe that those who do not favor the conservative activism of Justice Scalia or Chief Justice Rehnquist should oppose the appointment of people who clerked for such jurists. Certainly that is the point that they are establishing by their opposition to these outstanding nominees.  Any Senator is entitled to his or her opinions and to vote as he or she sees fit on this or any nominee. But the excerpts relied upon by opponents of Professor Lynch, from over 20 years of writing and legal work, do not support the conclusion that Professor Lynch is insensitive to the proper role of a judge or that he would ignore the rule of law or precedent. To charge that Judge Lynch would consider himself not to be bound by the plain words of the Constitution is to misperceive Jerry Lynch and ignore his legal career.  With respect to the unfounded charge that Professor Lynch would interpret the Constitution by ignoring its words, that is simply not true. Here is what Professor Lynch told Senator Thurmond at his confirmation hearing:       I believe, Mr. Chairman, that the starting place in      interpreting the Constitution is with the language of the      document. As with legislation passed by the Congress, it is      the wording of the Constitution that was ratified by the      people and that constitutes the binding contract under which      our Government is created.       In attempting to understand the language, it is most      important to look to the original intent of those who wrote      it and the context in which it was written. At the same time,      with respect to many of those principles, the Framers      intended to adopt very broad principles. Sometimes the      understanding of those principles changes over time.  In truth, the opposition to this nomination seems to boil down to the fact that Professor Lynch clerked for Justice Brennan, a distinguished and respected member of the United States Supreme Court, more than 20 years ago.  In light of the arguments made by the Senator of Alabama on the workload of the Federal Circuit, I wanted to add to the Record the letter from the Chamber of Commerce to the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts from last summer. Although these statistics are as out of date as those used by the Senator from Alabama, the letter makes several important points. The caseload of the Federal Circuit is not inflated by prisoner cases but is filled with complicated intellectual property cases and other complex litigation. I ask consent to print the August 1999 letter from the Chamber of Commerce in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                        Chamber of Commerce of the                                     United States of America,                                   Washington, DC, August 3, 1999.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     Chairman, Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the          Courts, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Grassley: This letter again urges that the      Judiciary Committee promptly consider the nomination of      Timothy Dyk for the Federal Circuit and that that nomination      be reported out of Committee before August recess. It has      been almost sixteen months since Mr. Dyk was first nominated      to the Federal Circuit, it has been nearly a year since he      was first voted out of Committee. So far as the Chamber is      aware, he is the only judicial nominee voted out of Committee      last year who has been scheduled for a second hearing. We      urge that a second hearing is unnecessary.       We understand that the principal concern about Mr. Dyk's      nomination now relates to the need to fill the vacancy. There      are now not one, but two vacancies on the Federal Circuit. We      recommend that Mr. Dyk's nomination be acted upon promptly so      that the Federal Circuit will not be seriously understaffed.       The question about the need to fill the vacancy was      considered in the March 1999 Report on the Appropriate      Allocation of Judgeships in the United States Courts of      Appeals. The Report generally agrees that ``the best measure      of when a court requires additional judges is how long it      takes, after an appeal is filed with a court, to reach a      final decision on the merits.'' (p.5) The Report also states      that: Over the last five years, the Federal Circuit's ``mean      disposition is the lowest of any circuit court. . . .''       But the Report's comparison between the Federal Circuit and      the other Circuits is a comparison of apples and oranges. The      Federal Circuit data appear to have been computed using a      ``mean'' or average number, while the data for the other      Circuits was computed using a median number. Over the most      recent five-year period (1994-1998), using median data, the      disposition time for the Federal Circuit exceeded that for      the Second, the Third and the Eighth Circuits. The most      recent data (for 1998) show that the median disposition time      for the Federal Circuit equals or exceeds that from four      other Circuits (the First, Third, Eighth and District of      Columbia). Moreover, the median disposition time for the      Federal Circuit increased 20%; from 7.9 months in 1994 to 9.5      months in 1998. These data directly support acting on the      pending nomination.       To be sure the Federal Circuit has a smaller numerical      caseload than other Circuits because the Federal Circuit, as      Congress prescribed, does not hear criminal or prisoner      cases. But it does have a heavy (and increasing) docket of      intellectual property cases and other forms of complex      litigation.       Congress intended to give the Federal Circuit exclusive      jurisdiction over patent cases, and to be the court of last      resort in the vast majority of those cases. (Supreme Court      Review is unlikely because there can be no conflict with      another Circuit). Under these circumstances, it is critical      to the Congressional design and to the business community      that the court not give short shrift to these important      cases. There is a substantial risk that if the Federal      Circuit is understaffed, and limited to ten judges, it will      not have time to give these cases the attention that they      deserve. The Chamber, as well as business-organizations such      as Eastman Kodak, Ingersoll Rand and Lubrizol, expressed this      concern to the Committee.       Finally, we understand Senator Grassley's concern that the      Federal Circuit does not have a formal mediation program. We      note that Mr. Dyk, in his first hearing, supported the      creation of such a program, and that he has extensive      experience in mediating intellectual property cases. He could      make it important to the Court in that area, and we urge that      the Court be allowed to secure the benefit of Mr. Dyk's      services as soon as possible.           Sincerely,                                                 Lonnie P. Taylor.
