 President, I rise today to discuss the Arctic national Wildlife Refuge or ANWR. As my good friend and colleague from Alaska Senator Stevens has outlined, oil and gas exploration in ANWR is not a new issue. In fact, it is an issue that was contemplated when Congress expanded the boundaries of the Arctic national Wildlife Refuge in 1980, by requiring the Department of Interior to prepare a detailed study on the Coastal Plain area and recommend how it should be managed.
