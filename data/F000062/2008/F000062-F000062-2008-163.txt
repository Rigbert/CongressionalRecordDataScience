 President, FISA has a law within it as to how you do electronic surveillance, and that law has specific provisions of what companies seeking to assist the Government must do. Essentially, what this amendment does is ask the FISA Court to review that compliance by the telecom companies to see that they complied with the elements of that part of FISA.  I think some Members have been able to look at the certification letter sent to telecoms, but most Members have not, and I think it is very important that the court have an opportunity to review these certifications and see if they are adequate under the provisions of the FISA law, and this is exactly what this amendment does.  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.
