Chairman, I appreciate the recognition and would explain the amendment to the membership. As I indicated in my opening remarks, I fully support the committee's bill. The chairman and members of the committee have done an excellent job. But we do not have the sufficient resources represented in the legislation.  My amendment would provide $1 billion additional, $750 million of whichwould be dedicated to programs at the Department of Energy, $250 million of which would be dedicated to water projects throughout the United States of America.  As I mentioned in my statement to the full committee when this legislation was being considered, when John Kennedy was President of the United States, almost 70 cents out of every $1 spent by the Federal Government was appropriated by the Appropriations Committee, and we made an investment in our economic infrastructure. We made an investment in our society. We made an investment in our future.  Today, less than 30 cents out of every $1 spent by the Federal Government is appropriated dollars, and we are failing in that investment responsibility.  The amendment I would offer would enhance the quality of the bill before us by doubling funding for biofuels and biorefineries. It would provide for clean coal programs. It would restore funding for petroleum, natural gas, geothermal technology programs, increase support for developing a full range of conservation technologies and help weatherize an additional 30,000 homes next year to provide immediate energy savings. We would also again provide $250 million to accelerate needed programs for flood control measures and also operation and maintenance.  I also believe that, unfairly, we have borrowed too much too long in this country and have burdened the next generation with the cost of that borrowing, and therefore, the amendment would be paid for by reducing the tax cut provided to the wealthiest in society in 2001, so that the amendment is also paid for.  I do think we need to make an investment in this society, and my amendment would do so. I would hope that the point of order is not sustained.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                             Point of Order
