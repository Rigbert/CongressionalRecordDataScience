Mr. Speaker, I am introducing today a resolution which states our belief that the Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is responsible for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. The resolution also calls for action by our government--especially in providing information--that could lead to the indictment of Milosevic for these crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague.  Those who have followed the course of Yugoslavia's violent disintegration know well how Slobodan Milosevic has stirred conflict in order to achieve, strengthen and maintain power during the early 1990s, the very years when all Europeans should have had the chance to celebrate newfound unity and freedom with the end of the Cold War and Communism's collapse. Threatened by democratic change, Milosevic played upon Serb grievance--some legitimate and some not--to encourage Serbs throughout former Yugoslavia to rally behind him and establish a ``Greater Serbia.'' He engaged in massive propaganda campaigns, spurring Serbs to hate Croats, Bosniacs and Albanians, or at least to view these neighboring peoples as threats. He put thugs into positions of power, ensuring support for his rule and a willingness to engage in the repression and ethnic cleansing. He supplied militants with heavy weaponry with which to bombard cities, towns, and villages throughout the region.  In testimony before the Helsinki Commission, which I co-chair with the primary Senate sponsor of this resolution, Alfonse D'Amato, many expert witnesses have testified to the deliberate nature of the attack on civilians in Croatia and in Bosnia. Mosques, hospitals, cultural institutions and even schools were specifically targeted for destruction. Intellectuals were targeted for incarceration and even execution. Women were targeted for the agony of being raped. Witnesses also told us of the systematic nature of the policy of ethnic cleansing. From valley to valley, region to region, the implementation of ethnic cleansing was so consistent that one can only conclude that it was directed and orchestrated by the political leaders.  There is only one person in such a position of power that he could have unleashed such devastation in Yugoslavia--Slobodan Milosevic. I believe that he is every bit as guilty of war crimes as the concentration camp guards, the snipers, and the rapists.  And now, Mr. Speaker, there is a new conflict in the former Yugoslavia, one in which Milosevic is again directly involved. In Kosovo, after years of repression of the largely Albanian population by Serbian authorities, there is now open conflict. With this conflict, innocent civilians are being killed, there are reports of detention centers, of rapes and the destruction of whole villages that indicate, at minimum, the open tolerance of such abuses by those in power in Belgrade, including Milosevic, if not the direction of such abuses. Last week we also received information indicating that distribution of basic food and humanitarian supplies has been hindered by Yugoslav and Serb officials. Mr. Speaker, using food as a weapon of war or intimidation can not be tolerated.  Of course, Mr. Milosevic remains in Belgrade, away from the scene of the crimes, and he denies association with those committing these crimes. He is a liar. In fact, he denied to me directly what I saw with my own eyes to be happening during the siege of Vukovar in Croatia. Unfortunately, he has escaped responsibility for the crimes by projecting himself as the ``peacemaker'', the one we supposedly need to achieve the Dayton Agreement which ended the Bosnian conflict, and the one with whom the Kosovar Albanians are being told to join at a negotiation table for dialogue. How many senior Administration officials have traveled repeatedly to Belgrade in order to cajole Milosevic to do this or to do that? He seems to be able to unravel progress if he wants. Does not our reliance on him as ``peacemaker'' help him maintain power at the expense of a democratic Serbia? Mr. Speaker, we can not overlook the criminal responsibility of a person like Milosevic, even when we find ourselves dependent on that person to implement policies the United States has set.  The resolution we are introducing does not address questions of United States policy towards Serbia; we plainly and simply call for justice. Mr. Speaker, I believe that indicating Milosevic is not only good justice; it is good policy. As long as Milosevic is in power in Belgrade and there is no democracy in Serbia, the Balkans will remain unstable. As long as we deal with Milosevic, we perpetuate his power.  I hope, Mr. Speaker, that this resolution will find broad, bipartisan support. I am pleased that I am joined by my colleagues Mr. Hoyer, Mr. Rohrbacher, Mr. Engel, Mr. King, Mr.Olver and Mr. McGovern as original cosponsors. Who can argue against providing information that could lead to the indictment of a person who may have committed war crimes? Who can argue against supporting the tribunal which can bring needed justice to South-Central Europe? That is what this resolution does, and the measure deserves quick and positive action by the House.                          ____________________
