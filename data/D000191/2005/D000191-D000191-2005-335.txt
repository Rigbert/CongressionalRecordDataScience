Speaker, I am placing an article from the July 25, 2005, Seattle Times newspaper into the Congressional Record because I think it is important that all of my colleagues understand the real world impact underfunding the VA is having on veterans suffering from mental disabilities.  To those who say that VA is adequately funded, I say read this article. Spending on VA mental health care services, adjusted for inflation, is $630 million below the level in 1996, despite an 11 percent increase in veterans seeking services. During that same 1996-2003 period, overall mental health staffing for the seriously mentally ill declined by 31 percent, and funding for drug and alcohol treatment dropped by 54 percent.  VA mental health professionals have been asked to cut back on the number of sessions offered to veterans on a monthly basis, to cut back on the time allotted for each session, lengthen the time between visits, and drop some patients altogether.  It is unacceptable to treat those who have served our country with such disdain. The President and Congress have found trillions of dollars to provide tax cuts to wealthy individuals and profitable corporations. And Congress and the President will send tens of billions of dollars to foreign governments this year. Clearly there is enough money to adequately provide for our veterans. The President and Congress have simply chosen not to make caring for veterans a priority. That has to change, immediately.                [From the Seattle Times, July 25, 2005]              VA Straining To Treat Post-Traumatic Stress                            (By Hal Bernton)       ABERDEEN--During counseling, Vietnam veteran Rod Chenoweth      always sits in the same place--a blue fabric couch carefully      positioned in a corner to give his body the protective cover      of a side and rear wall as he talks about his life.       He recounts an argument that left him seething in anger. He      talks about an evening flashback to the grenade that wounded      him in the leg and killed his 19-year-old buddy.       Chenoweth says the therapy, paid for by the Department of      Veterans Affairs VA), has helped pull him back from thoughts      of suicide and other self-destructive acts in a life scarred      by post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)--a war injury that      ranks among the most common and the most difficult to heal.       Starting in July, Chenoweth's sessions with Aberdeen      therapist Jack Dutro have been reduced from twice to once a      month, a cut that comes as thousands of Iraq war veterans      join those of previous wars in seeking treatment from the      strained VA.       ``I can understand that the new veterans need to be dealt      with,'' said Chenoweth, 56. ``But it's going to be tough.      Jack has been a lifesaver.''       The agency is required by law to take care of the war      wounds of all combat veterans.       But the agency's PTSD experts, in a report delivered last      fall to Congress, warned that the VA ``does not have      sufficient capacity to meet the needs of new combat veterans      while still providing for the veterans of past wars.''       Internal reports show the VA's mental-health network has      been frayed by years of staffing cuts and budgets that failed      to keep pace with the growth in patients.       According to an internal review of the agency's budget,      delivered to Congress in September, problems have been years      in the making:       Between 1996 and 2003, annual spending for treatment of the      serious mentally ill increased from $2.16 billion to $2.4      billion. But when those budgets were adjusted for inflation      in medical costs--the increased costs of salaries and      services--spending in 2003 was actually $630 million below      the 1996 level. Meanwhile, the number of veterans seeking      those services climbed by 11 percent.       During the same period, overall mental-health staffing for      the seriously ill declined by 31 percent.       Drug and alcohol treatment for the seriously mentally ill,      often a critical part of the program for those seeking PTSD      therapy, has been the hardest hit. Annual funding, adjusted      for inflation, dropped by 54 percent nationwide between 1996      and 2003.       ``It's been a perfect storm of rising needs and tight      resources,'' said Tom Schumacher, who directs a Washington      state effort to assist PTSD veterans.       The Northwest VA network has fared better than most of the      nation, avoiding many of the staff cuts that hit other      regions.       But the four-state region that includes Washington, Oregon,      Idaho and Alaska also is one of the busiest hubs of      treatment. The PTSD patient load alone has increased from      3,194 in 1996 to 4,671 in 2004.       To help manage the crunch, the VA Puget Sound Health Care      System earlier this year imposed new restrictions on PTSD      therapy for veterans who already have undergone at least six      months of treatment.       The VA guidelines now call for no more than once-a-month      individual therapy, or twice-a-month group therapy. Those      apply to Puget Sound-area clinics and a network of VA-funded      private therapists who work around the state.       Dr. Miles McFall, director of PTSD programs at the VA Puget      Sound, said that more frequent therapy does not necessarily      help, and those in trouble are welcome to check into an      inpatient VA hospital clinic.       ``Even if money was not an issue, this is what we should be      doing,'' he said. ``We care about our Vietnam vets. We're not      going to turn our backs on them.''       Other therapists say while some veterans can handle less      treatment, the more unstable ones may suffer setbacks.       ``Some of them are devastated and feel like they have been      abandoned one more time,'' said Jim Shoop, a Mount Vernon      counselor. He said his office is reducing service to more      than 50 vets with PTSD.                         a lifetime of trouble       Soldiers have always suffered from the mental wounds of      war.       But the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder only      emerged in 1979 in the aftermath of the Vietnam War as tens      of thousands of distraught veterans, suffering from      flashbacks, sleeplessness, anger and other symptoms, poured      into VA hospitals.       By 1988, the VA estimated that 479,000 vets suffered PTSD      symptoms.       For many of these vets, PTSD has meant a lifetime of      trouble.       Chenoweth served with the Marines in Vietnam from 1968 to      1969, when the U.S. sustained some of its heaviest      casualties. He turned 18 just before boarding the plane to      Asia and soon found himself fighting in villages where      anybody could be the enemy.       Chenoweth ended his tour of duty in a psychiatric hospital      in Oakland. But it wasn't until the late '80s--after more      than a dozen failed jobs, several more hospital stays and two      broken marriages--that he was diagnosed with PTSD.       ``The killing doesn't stop,'' Chenoweth said. ``You taste      it. You smell it. And you feel it. It uses all your senses.''       The numbers of older veterans seeking mental-health      treatment surged again in recent years, as new wars unfolding      on television in Iraq and Afghanistan added to their stress.       That, coupled with the influx of soldiers returning from      Iraq, has ratcheted up pressure on the VA system.                          more become eligible       In the '90s, the VA went through a dramatic overhaul,      moving away from a centralized hospital system as hundreds of      new clinics opened up around the country. Congress also      loosened eligibility requirements, so that more vets      qualified for services, and increased the agency's overall      health-care budget from $17 billion to more than $28 billion.       The transformation was lauded as a great success in an      Annals of Internal Medicine article last year.       But mental-health services often lost out as regional      administrators juggled budgets to pay for soaring caseloads,      new services and pricey new drugs.       Managers also sometimes balked at pouring money into      treatment for illnesses of the mind when compared with      physical illnesses that are often easier to measure and cure.       ``I regret to report that there are stigmas in the VA about      the mentally ill,'' Thomas Horvath, a psychiatrist who serves      as chief of staff at the agency's Houston medical center,      told Congress in 2004.       ``In this, we may be no worse than the rest of health care.      VA needs to do better.''       Sen. Patty Murray, who worked as a college intern in the      Seattle VA psychiatric ward, has helped lead the      congressional effort to boost funding for VA programs,      including mental health.       ``I have talked to soldiers who are returning, and a number      of them say `my marriage is much more difficult . . . I am      having trouble getting my head back in to work,' '' said      Murray, ``It's the beginning of trouble. And the fallout from      this 10, 15, 20 years from now is tremendous.''       The issue of VA funding has been rife with partisan      politics recently.       Murray, a Democrat, initially was rebuffed by the      Republican majority in an effort to gain emergency funding      for VA medical services.       VA administrators in June acknowledged a roughly $1 billion      budget shortfall, prompting Senate Republicans to do an      about-face and work with Murray to boost funding.       Congress is expected to approve an additional $975 million      to $1.5 billion to help dig the agency out of the hole for      this fiscal year.       If this money is equally divided within the agency, mental      health would receive less than $300 million.       This emergency cash would fall short of shoring up the      system.       To fully meet the needs of the seriously mentally ill, the      VA would require an infusion of as much as $1.6 billion,      according to a draft of the agency's strategic plan.       That estimate didn't assess the added costs of treating new      Iraq veterans.                         just good-enough care       There is no fixed formula for treating PTSD.       Instead, the VA offers general guidelines for addressing      the illness. This treatment may involve drugs that aid sleep      and reduce anxiety or help fight depression. It may include      classes in anger management and other coping skills.       Finally, there is therapy, which often enables the vet to      recount and come to terms with combat experiences.       Some patients may benefit from just a few classes and      counseling sessions. Others with chronic PTSD attend sessions      for months or years. Some patients do fine in group; others      do much better with individual therapy. But as budgets have      shrunk, some VA mental-health workers say, they have been      pressured to treat more people in less time.       In Portland, the VA mental-health clinic staff by January      had shrunk by 25 percent due to budget freezes, according to      an internal staff newsletter. The newsletter described the      Portland program as ``unquestionably underfunded.''       Therapists in Portland earlier this year were asked to      consider cutting individual sessions from 50 minutes to 30      minutes, and lengthen the time between visits, according to      an internal VA memorandum.       They say they were also asked to consider dropping some      patients altogether, after refilling their prescriptions and      referring them back to primary-care physicians.       Megan Streight, a VA spokeswoman, said the Portland VA does      not expect staff to cut back services for patients who need      therapy. She also said that some jobs have been filled. ``We      are confident that veterans continue to receive high-quality      mental-health care,'' Streight said.       But several Portland VA therapists expressed worries that      expanding caseloads combined with a smaller staff threaten      the quality of some care. All requested anonymity, concerned      that speaking publicly could cost them their jobs.       These therapists say they have been asked to try to      complete treatment of new patients in 10 or fewer counseling      sessions, even those recently returned from Iraq. Some of      these vets arrive at the VA with marriages already in turmoil      or broken. Others have isolated themselves at home, and      balked at returning to work. One, who came in after beating      his wife, had penned a suicide note.       One therapist said she has been reluctant to stick several      troubled Iraq vets in first-step classes of 20 or more that      teach coping skills. But her own caseload already runs to      several hundred patients, so she has no openings for more      one-on-one counseling. To make room for the Iraq veterans,      she asks some of her older veterans to come less often.       ``But what kind of message is that--that you're not as      important as the new guys coming in,'' she said.       The therapist says she needed to get used to the short-     staffed conditions.       ``I was told that there needed to be some changes made at      the hospital due to the lack of resources, and I was going to      have to adjust my thinking,'' said the therapist. ``You need      to give Just good-enough care.' ''       The Puget Sound VA's mental-health programs also have been      caught in the regionwide budget crunch, which included a      partial hiring freeze that replaces only one worker for every      five who leave their jobs.       ``We have to make the best use of resources that we can,''      said John Park, Puget Sound VA's director of health-care      planning, at an April 30 community meeting on mental health      sponsored by U.S. Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Seattle. ``You can      only cut so much of the budget before things get dicey.''                        sharing hopes and fears       Most PTSD patients in Puget Sound are seen in a specialized      program that includes clinics and in-patient care. The      program has a national reputation for research and treatment.       McFall, who heads that program, says he was able to snag a      special grant that allows him to add several more positions      to the 21-person clinic staff in the months ahead.       ``I want to say that the sky isn't falling. We can get      every Iraq veteran an appointment within a week,'' he said.       But the local VA policy to limit treatment for patients who      have had six months of therapy has caused a backlash. The      loudest protests have come from the state network of private-     practice therapists who are paid by the VA to treat vets with      chronic PTSD.       ``I believe that in order to do long-term recovery, I have      to do a lot of work,'' said Steve Akers, a Vietnam vet who is      an Everett therapist. Akers offers weekly group sessions, as      well as individual counseling.       At the group sessions, the vets spend 90 minutes sharing      hopes, fears and a few laughs before ending with a healing      circle where they all grasp hands on a wooden staff known as      a ``talking stick.''       One veteran of both the Vietnam and Gulf wars still lives      on a razor's edge. At his house, he has installed a perimeter      trip wire that sounds an alarm to warn of intruders, and      outside lights that can turn midnight into day along a 400-     foot driveway. The house is full of loaded guns, weapons his      wife fears might be inadvertently used in a combat flashback.       ``She doesn't want the one under the bed, and in every      room,'' the vet said during the session. ``But I've got to      live with myself. I don't feel secure.''       Akers opted to take things one step at a time, focusing on      a pistol in a bedroom drawer.       ``So, at one point, would you be willing to put the pistol      in one drawer, and the ammo in another? You'll still have      your safety factor but have to think to react.''       ``I could do that,'' the vet responded. ``But it will be      really hard for me. When they break in that door, they're      only going to do it once. ``       Under the new VA policy, the group's weekly meetings will      be reduced from twice a month to once a month.       Among the vets, that's the subject of much bitter debate.       ``I try not to take it personally,'' said the veteran with      the loaded gun. ``There is an intimacy here that is      incredible. I want to save it. And the fear, you know, is      that it's not going to last.''                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Pages E1638-E1639]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]    COMPELLING SERIES ABOUT VA FUNDING SHORTFALLS IN NORTHWEST PAPER                                 ______                                                          HON.

If this money is equally divided within the agency, mental      health would receive less than $300 million.       This emergency cash would fall short of shoring up the      system.       To fully meet the needs of the seriously mentally ill, the      VA would require an infusion of as much as $1.6 billion,      according to a draft of the agency's strategic plan.       That estimate didn't assess the added costs of treating new      Iraq veterans.                         just good-enough care       There is no fixed formula for treating PTSD.       Instead, the VA offers general guidelines for addressing      the illness. This treatment may involve drugs that aid sleep      and reduce anxiety or help fight depression. It may include      classes in anger management and other coping skills.       Finally, there is therapy, which often enables the vet to      recount and come to terms with combat experiences.       Some patients may benefit from just a few classes and      counseling sessions. Others with chronic PTSD attend sessions      for months or years. Some patients do fine in group; others      do much better with individual therapy. But as budgets have      shrunk, some VA mental-health workers say, they have been      pressured to treat more people in less time.       In Portland, the VA mental-health clinic staff by January      had shrunk by 25 percent due to budget freezes, according to      an internal staff newsletter. The newsletter described the      Portland program as ``unquestionably underfunded.''       Therapists in Portland earlier this year were asked to      consider cutting individual sessions from 50 minutes to 30      minutes, and lengthen the time between visits, according to      an internal VA memorandum.       They say they were also asked to consider dropping some      patients altogether, after refilling their prescriptions and      referring them back to primary-care physicians.       Megan Streight, a VA spokeswoman, said the Portland VA does      not expect staff to cut back services for patients who need      therapy. She also said that some jobs have been filled. ``We      are confident that veterans continue to receive high-quality      mental-health care,'' Streight said.       But several Portland VA therapists expressed worries that      expanding caseloads combined with a smaller staff threaten      the quality of some care. All requested anonymity, concerned      that speaking publicly could cost them their jobs.       These therapists say they have been asked to try to      complete treatment of new patients in 10 or fewer counseling      sessions, even those recently returned from Iraq. Some of      these vets arrive at the VA with marriages already in turmoil      or broken. Others have isolated themselves at home, and      balked at returning to work. One, who came in after beating      his wife, had penned a suicide note.       One therapist said she has been reluctant to stick several      troubled Iraq vets in first-step classes of 20 or more that      teach coping skills. But her own caseload already runs to      several hundred patients, so she has no openings for more      one-on-one counseling. To make room for the Iraq veterans,      she asks some of her older veterans to come less often.       ``But what kind of message is that--that you're not as      important as the new guys coming in,'' she said.       The therapist says she needed to get used to the short-     staffed conditions.       ``I was told that there needed to be some changes made at      the hospital due to the lack of resources, and I was going to      have to adjust my thinking,'' said the therapist. ``You need      to give Just good-enough care.' ''       The Puget Sound VA's mental-health programs also have been      caught in the regionwide budget crunch, which included a      partial hiring freeze that replaces only one worker for every      five who leave their jobs.       ``We have to make the best use of resources that we can,''      said John Park, Puget Sound VA's director of health-care      planning, at an April 30 community meeting on mental health      sponsored by U.S. Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Seattle. ``You can      only cut so much of the budget before things get dicey.''                        sharing hopes and fears       Most PTSD patients in Puget Sound are seen in a specialized      program that includes clinics and in-patient care. The      program has a national reputation for research and treatment.       McFall, who heads that program, says he was able to snag a      special grant that allows him to add several more positions      to the 21-person clinic staff in the months ahead.       ``I want to say that the sky isn't falling. We can get      every Iraq veteran an appointment within a week,'' he said.       But the local VA policy to limit treatment for patients who      have had six months of therapy has caused a backlash. The      loudest protests have come from the state network of private-     practice therapists who are paid by the VA to treat vets with      chronic PTSD.       ``I believe that in order to do long-term recovery, I have      to do a lot of work,'' said Steve Akers, a Vietnam vet who is      an Everett therapist. Akers offers weekly group sessions, as      well as individual counseling.       At the group sessions, the vets spend 90 minutes sharing      hopes, fears and a few laughs before ending with a healing      circle where they all grasp hands on a wooden staff known as      a ``talking stick.''       One veteran of both the Vietnam and Gulf wars still lives      on a razor's edge. At his house, he has installed a perimeter      trip wire that sounds an alarm to warn of intruders, and      outside lights that can turn midnight into day along a 400-     foot driveway. The house is full of loaded guns, weapons his      wife fears might be inadvertently used in a combat flashback.       ``She doesn't want the one under the bed, and in every      room,'' the vet said during the session. ``But I've got to      live with myself. I don't feel secure.''       Akers opted to take things one step at a time, focusing on      a pistol in a bedroom drawer.       ``So, at one point, would you be willing to put the pistol      in one drawer, and the ammo in another? You'll still have      your safety factor but have to think to react.''       ``I could do that,'' the vet responded. ``But it will be      really hard for me. When they break in that door, they're      only going to do it once. ``       Under the new VA policy, the group's weekly meetings will      be reduced from twice a month to once a month.       Among the vets, that's the subject of much bitter debate.       ``I try not to take it personally,'' said the veteran with      the loaded gun. ``There is an intimacy here that is      incredible. I want to save it. And the fear, you know, is      that it's not going to last.''                          ____________________
