Madam Speaker, people are hurting right now, in Atlanta and across the country. It is in times like this that we need to help our neighbor. Volunteerism in these tough times is critical; that is why I want to highlight the work Emory University, in my district, is doing. Emory University has a strong history of reaching out to the community and engaging in projects to help people in need. Emory students completed nearly 150,000 hours of service in 2008, partnering with more than 200 community partners on projects related to poverty, homelessness, medical services and environmental conservation. The University's dedication to service reflects the desire in many of our students across the nation to get involved in and give back to their communities. America's young people have always been an integral part of the success of our country, and I am especially proud of Emory University's dedication to service.  Each year, the Corporation for National and Community Service recognizes institutions of higher education for exemplary efforts to engage students in service learning, communitypartnerships, and volunteer service by publishing The President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll. At the top of the Honor Roll is a small group of institutions of higher education who are given the Presidential Award for General Community Service. I am proud to announce that Emory has been awarded the 2008 Presidential Award. This is the highest award possible for a college or university with respect to community service and student engagement. I want to recognize and thank Emory University for its commitment to giving back to the community and fostering a sense of service among its students.  Congratulations to Emory University on being honored as a recipient of the 2008 Presidential Award for General Community Service.                          ____________________
