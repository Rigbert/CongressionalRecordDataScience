Speaker, earlier today, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the Pledge of Allegiance is an unconstitutional endorsement of religion. This ruling treats any public religious reference as inherently evil and is an attempt to remove religious speech from the public arena from those who disagree.  This ruling is ridiculous, and I have introduced a resolution today with the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Pickering) that specifically states that the phrase ``one Nation, under God'' should remain in the Pledge of Allegiance, and that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals should agree to rehear this ruling en banc to reverse this constitutionally infirm and historically inaccurate ruling.  Members who wish to cosponsor this resolution should contact the Committee on the Judiciary at 5-3190. It is my hope that the House of Representatives will bring it up promptly.                          ____________________
