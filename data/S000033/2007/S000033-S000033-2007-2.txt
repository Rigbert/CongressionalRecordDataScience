 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 2771, the legislative branch appropriations bill; that the only amendment in order be a substitute amendment at the desk which is cosponsored by Senators Leahy, Coleman, Klobuchar, Snowe, Obama, Dole, Baucus, Sununu, Cantwell, Collins, Casey, Lieberman, Landrieu, Kerry, Kennedy, and Clinton--this amendment provides for $800 million in additional LIHEAP funding--that there be a time limitation of 30 minutes for debate equally divided in the usual form on the amendment; that upon the use of that time, the amendment be agreed to, the bill be read a third time, and the Senate, without any intervening action or debate, vote on passage of the bill, as amended.
