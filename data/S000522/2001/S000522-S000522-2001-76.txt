Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 211) commending Daw Aung San Suu Kyi on the 10th anniversary of her receiving the Nobel Peace Prize and expressing the sense of the Congress with respect to the Government of Burma, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 211       Whereas since 1962, the people of Burma have lived under a      repressive military regime;       Whereas in 1988, the people of Burma rose up in massive      prodemocracy demonstrations;       Whereas in response to this call for change, the Burmese      military brutally suppressed these demonstrations;       Whereas opposition leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi was placed      under house arrest after these demonstrations;       Whereas in the 1990 Burmese elections, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi      led the National League for Democracy and affiliated parties      to a landslide victory, winning 80 percent of the      parliamentary seats;       Whereas the ruling military regime rejected this election      and proceeded to arrest hundreds of members of the National      League for Democracy;       Whereas Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's freedom of speech was      restricted by the military regime;       Whereas in recognition of her efforts to bring democracy to      Burma, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize      on October 14, 1991;       Whereas Daw Aung San Suu Kyi remained under unlawful house      arrest until 1995;       Whereas even after her release, the Burmese military      regime, known as the State     Peace and Development Council (SPDC), has continued to ignore      the basic human rights of 48,000,000 Burmese citizens and has      brutally suppressed any opposition to its authority;       Whereas according to the State Department, the SPDC has      made no significant progress toward stopping the practice of      human trafficking, whereby thousands of people have been sent      to Thailand for the purpose of factory and household work and      for sexual exploitation;       Whereas the SPDC has forced civilians to work in      industrial, military, and infrastructure construction      operations throughout Burma, and on a large-scale basis has      targeted ethnic and religious minorities for this work;       Whereas a Department of Labor report in 2000 described the      human rights abuses of forced laborers, including beating,      torture, starvation, and summary executions;       Whereas the worldwide scourge of heroin and      methamphetamines is significantly aggravated by large-scale      cultivation and production of these drugs in Burma;       Whereas the Drug Enforcement Agency has reported that Burma      is the world's second largest producer of opium and opiate-     based drugs;       Whereas officials in Thailand have estimated that as many      as 800 million tablets of methamphetamine will be smuggled      into their country this year, contributing to the growing      methamphetamine problem in Thailand;       Whereas there are as many as a million internally displaced      persons in Burma;       Whereas the SPDC has severely restricted Daw Aung San Suu      Kyi's political activities;       Whereas in September 2000, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi was placed      under house arrest when she attempted to visit a National      League for Democracy party office on the outskirts of      Rangoon, and again when she attempted to travel by train to      Mandalay;       Whereas Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has recently begun talks with      the SPDC which are welcomed by the international community,      although the slow pace of the talks reflects on the SPDC's      sincerity to move toward national reconciliation;       Whereas the SPDC has recently allowed the National League      for Democracy to open some political offices, and has      released some political prisoners, although over 1,800 such      prisoners are believed to remain imprisoned;       Whereas with the exception of these positive developments      the SPDC has made little progress in improving human rights      conditions and restoring democracy to the country;       Whereas the SPDC has continued to restrict the political      power of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for      Democracy;       Whereas Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's struggle to assert the      rights of her people has spread beyond politics and into      popular culture, as evidenced by others championing her      cause, most notably the rock group U2 in their song ``Walk      On'', which is banned in Burma; and       Whereas, in the face of oppression, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi      has remained an outspoken champion of democracy and freedom:      Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That--       (1) the Congress commends and congratulates Daw Aung San      Suu Kyi on the 10th anniversary of her receiving the Nobel      Peace Prize, and recognizes her remarkable contributions and      tireless work toward bringing peace and democracy to Burma;       (2) it is the sense of the Congress that the President and      Secretary of State should continue to encourage the      Government of Burma to restore basic human rights to the      Burmese people, to eliminate the practice of human      trafficking, to address the manufacture of heroin and      methamphetamines, to continue the process of releasing      political prisoners, to recognize the results of the 1990      democratic elections, and to allow Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and      the National League for Democracy to enjoy unfettered freedom      of speech and freedom of movement; and       (3) it is the sense of the Congress that Daw Aung San Suu      Kyi should be invited to address a joint meeting of the      Congress at such time and under such circumstances as will,      in the judgment of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, advance rather than      endanger her continued ability to work within Burma for the      rights of the Burmese people.
