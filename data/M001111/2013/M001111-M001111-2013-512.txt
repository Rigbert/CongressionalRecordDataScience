 I understand his dedication, but I oppose this amendment. Over the last several years we have enacted $1.8 trillion in spending cuts on a bipartisan basis. We do not have any trouble cutting spending in this body right now. We do seem to have trouble locking in the revenue necessary to achieve a balanced revenue reduction. I recommend our colleagues oppose this amendment.  I ask for the yeas and nays.
