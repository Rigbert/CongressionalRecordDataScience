 President, I thank the Senior Senator from Colorado for raising the issue of highway ramps to improve safety on the roads in the Metro Denver area. Based on the Transportation Subcommittee's review of highways across the country, it is clear that Colorado, especially the Denver Metro area, has one of the fastest growth rates in the country and has specific transportation needs.  I support the Senator's request for assistance on the particular highway project he mentions, and will be happy to work with him to identify funding for this important safety and capacity project as we move towards Conference.
