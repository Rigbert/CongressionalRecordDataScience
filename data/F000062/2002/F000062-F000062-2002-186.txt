 President, on Thursday, Senator McConnell and I introduced legislation that had findings as well as bill language containing some sanctions. The title of the legislation is the Arafat Accountability Act. I do not want to argue that now, but I do want to point out, in a column in this morning's New York Times, Mr. William Safire, under the title ``Democrats vs. Israel,'' made a statement about this resolution, saying it has been blocked by Majority Leader Tom Daschle.  This is not true. Senator McConnell and I presented the bill on Thursday. We indicated we were not pushing for its passage at the present time, that we wanted time to go out and achieve a number of cosponsors. That was the reason for any delay. So I would like the record to clearly reflect that.                          ____________________
