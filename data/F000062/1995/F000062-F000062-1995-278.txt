 240 has a definition of forward-looking statement. It includes projections of revenues, statements about management's plans for the future, and statements about future economic performance of a company, among other things. Can you tell me where that definition came from?  Mr. D'AMATO. It came directly from rule 175. It is the SEC's own definition of forward-looking statements.
