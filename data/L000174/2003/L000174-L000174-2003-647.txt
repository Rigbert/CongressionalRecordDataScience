President, it was just 2 days ago we welcomed the Vice President to the Senate for debate scheduled by the majority. I said at that time that I am always glad to see the Vice President here, even though it is a rare appearance for a Vice President of either party.  I wish he had been here for debate about the impending war with Iraq. We are probably the only parliamentary body in the democratic world that has not had a major debate during the past few weeks on Iraq and the war. Or he might have been here for debate on terrorism or homeland defense or the need for action to stimulate the economy and improve the lives of the millions of Americans who have lost jobs over the last 2 years. Actually, there are more Americans losing jobs in a 2-year period than I think has occurred since I have been old enough to vote. Or the Senate might have been acting on a prescription drug benefit for seniors.  Apparently, we are not here to have that debate today nor did the majority schedule debate in the Senate on Tuesday on those important matters. Instead, we are here to hear again the arguments about Mr. Estrada. But not much has changed since last week or since this Tuesday. The administration's obstinacy continues to impede Senate consideration of this nomination.  The distinguished Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, pointed a way out of this impasse in a letter to the President on February 11. It is regrettable the President did not respond to that reasonable letter to resolve the issue. Instead, the letter sent this week to the distinguished majority leader, Senator Frist, was not a response to Senator Daschle's realistic approach, but a further effort to minimize the Senate's role in this process by proposing radical changes in Senate rules.  I have great respect for the Office of the Presidency, for whoever holds it. One thing I have learned in 29 years is that Presidents come and Presidents go. The Office of the Presidency exists with its responsibilities, its duties, its rules, its traditions. Just as Senators come and go. No Senator holds a seat for life. No Senator owns a seat in the Senate. But the Senate stays, and the Senate has its rights, and it has its privileges, and it also has its obligations. It has its constitutional duties.  I have been in the Senate with six different Presidents. I have never been in the Senate with a White House that seems to have less understanding of the role of the Senate or more of a desire to overturn well over 200 years of practice and procedures in the Senate. I have never known a White House that thinks more just for the moment and not for the long term.  This may be why we are fast approaching the point where, as some suggest, the White House may get half of its goal of regime change, but they may get it in Great Britain. But I digress.  The real double standard in the matter of the Estrada nomination is that the President selected Mr. Estrada in large part based upon his 4\1/2\ years of work in the Solicitor General's Office, as well as for his ideological views. The administration undoubtedly knows what those views are and have seen those work papers. They know what he did. They picked him based on that, but they said even though we picked him based on that, we do not want the Senate to know what it was. We in the Senate cannot read his work, the work papers that would shed the most light on why this 41-year-old should have a lifetime seat on the Nation's second highest court.  We are to a point where the White House simply says, trust us, we know what he wrote and how he thinks and will make decisions, but we do not want you to know what he wrote, just rubberstamp him.  Actually, I would remind them of that made-up quote that President Reagan used to such effect--I happen to agree with President Reagan on it--trust but verify. We would like to verify. President Reagan said, ``Trust but verify.'' They say, trust us. We say, let us verify.  So actually this whole matter is in the hands of the White House. They could move forward with Mr. Estrada easily if they wanted to. Instead, the White House has taken on the attitude that they want to carry out the responsibilities of the Presidency, as awesome as they are, but they also want to carry out the responsibilities of the Senate.  I think they have their hands full carrying out the duties of the White House, with the impending war. We have millions of Americans out of work. We have a stock market that has tanked. We have runaway budget deficits. This is an administration that inherited the largest surpluses in history, and they are about to create the largest deficits in history; an administration that inherited a robust stock market, and we are about to see the stock market go to an all-time low. They have enough to worry about. Let us worry about carrying out the duties of the Senate.  If they would simply cooperate, we could go forward with Mr. Estrada. I mention this because I do not want anybody to make a mistake. The control and the scheduling of whether there will be a vote on Mr. Estrada is in the hands of the White House.  There seems to be a perversion to require the Senate to stumble in the dark about Mr. Estrada's views when he shared these views quite freely with others, and when the administration selected him for this high office based on these views.  Justice Scalia wrote just last year:       Even if it were possible to select judges who do not have      preconceived views on legal issues, it would hardly be      desirable to do so. Proof that a Justice's mind at the time      he joined the Court was complete tabula rasa in the area of      constitutional adjudication would be evidence of lack of      qualification, not lack of bias.  It was just a week ago that I thanked the Democratic leader and assistant leader and Democratic Senators for speaking and voting in favor of preserving the integrity of the confirmation process. We are acting to safeguard our Constitution and the special role of the Senate in ensuring that our Federal courts have judges who will fairly interpret the Constitution and the statutes we pass for the sake of all Americans.  The administration's obstinacy continues to impede progress to resolve this standoff. The administration remains intent on packing the Federal circuit courts and on insisting that the Senate rubber-stamp its nominees without fulfilling the Senate's constitutional advice and consent role in this most important process. The White House could have long ago helped solved the impasse on the Estrada nomination by honoring the Senate's role in the appointment process and providing the Senate with access to Mr. Estrada's legal work. Past administrations have provided such legal memoranda in connection with the nominations of Robert Bork, William Rehnquist, Brad Reynolds, Stephen Trott and Ben Civiletti, and even this administration did so with a nominee to the EPA. Senator Durbin noted this week that the administration is giving Mr. Estrada bad advice. Instead, the administration should instruct the nominee to answer questions about his views--consistent with last year's Supreme Court opinion by Justice Scalia--and to stop pretending that he has no views.  The White House is using ideology to select its judicial nominees but is trying to prevent the Senate from knowing the ideology of these nominees when it evaluates them. It was not so long ago when then-Senator Ashcroft was chairing a series of Judicial Committee hearings at which Edwin Meese III testified:       I think that very extensive investigations of each      nominee--and I don't worry about the delay that this might      cause because, remember, those judges are going to be on the      bench for their professional lifetime, so they have got      plenty of time ahead once they are confirmed, and there is      very little opportunity to pull them out of those benches      once they have been confirmed--I think a careful      investigation of the background of each judge, including      their writings, if they have previously been judges or in      public positions, the actions that they have taken, the      decisions that they have written, so that we can to the      extent possible eliminate people eliminate persons who would      turn out to be activist judges from being confirmed.  Timothy E. Flanigan, an official from the administration of the President's father, and who more recently served as Deputy White House Counsel, helping the current President select his judicial nominees, testified strongly in favor of ``the need for the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate to be extraordinarily diligent in examining the judicial philosophy of potential nominees.'' He continued:       In evaluating judicial nominees, the Senate has often been      stymied by its inability to obtain evidence of a nominee's      judicial philosophy. In the absence of such evidence, the      Senate has often confirmed a nominee on the theory that it      could find no fault with the nominee.       I would reverse the presumption and place the burden      squarely on the shoulders of the judicial nominee to prove      that he or she has a well-thought-out judicial philosophy,      one that recognizes the limited role for Federal judges. Such      a burden is appropriately borne by one seeking life tenure to      wield the awesome judicial power of the United States.       Although the Senate Judiciary Committee has long recognized      correctly, in my view, that positions taken as an advocate      for a client do not necessarily reflect the nominee's own      judicial philosophy, a long history of cases in which a      nominee has repeatedly urged courts to engage in judicial      activism may well be probative of a nominee's own philosophy.  Now that the President is not a popularly elected Democrat but a Republican, these principles seem no longer to have any support within the White House or the Senate Republican majority. Fortunately, our constitutional principles and our Senate traditions, practices and governing rules do not change with the political party that occupies the White House or with a shift in majority in the Senate.  Along with this current impasse, the administration has shown unprecedented disregard for the concerns of Senators in taking other unprecedented actions, including renominating both Judge Charles Pickering, despite his ethical lapses, and Judge Priscilla Owen, despite her record as a conservative ``activist'' judge. Both were rejected by the Senate Judiciary Committee after fair hearings and open debate last year. Sending these re-nominations to the Senate is unprecedented. No judicial nominee who has been voted down has ever been re-nominated to the same position by any President. This morning the Republican majority took another unprecedented step in holding a hearing on the re-nomination of Judge Owen, whose nomination had been rejected earlier by the committee. The White House, in conjunction with the new Republican majority in the Senate, is choosing these battles over nominations purposefully. Dividing rather than uniting has become their modus operandi.  Among the consequences of this partisan strategy is that for the last month, the Senate has been denied by the Republican leadership meaningful debate on the situation in Iraq. I commend Senator Byrd, Senator Kennedy and the other Senators on both sides of the aisle who have nonetheless sought to make the Senate a forum for debate and careful consideration of our nation's foreign policy. The decision by the Republican Senate majority to focus on controversial nominations rather than the international situation or the economy says much about their mistaken priorities. The Republican majority sets the agenda and they schedule the debate, just as they have again here today.  One of the most disconcerting aspects of the manner in which the Senate is approaching these divisive judicial nominations is what appears to be the Republican majority's willingness to sacrifice the constitutional authority of the Senate as a check on the power of the President in the area of lifetime appointments to our Federal courts. It should concern all of us and the American people that the Republican majority's efforts to re-write Senate history in order to rubber-stamp this White House's Federal judicial nominees will cause long-term damage to this institution, to our courts, to our constitutional form of government, to the rights and protections of the American people and to generations to come. I have served in the Senate for 29 years, and until recently I have never seen such stridency on the part of an administration or such willingness on the part of a Senate majority to cast aside tradition and upset the balances embedded in our Constitution so as to expand Presidential power. What I find unprecedented are the excesses that the Republican majority and this White House are willing to indulge to override the constitutional division of power over appointments and longstanding Senate practices and history. It strikes me that some Republicans seem to think that they are writing on blank slate and that they have been given a blank check to pack the courts. They show a disturbing penchant for reading the Constitution to suit their purposes of the moment rather than as it has functioned for over 200 years to protect all American through checks and balances.  The Democratic Leader pointed the way out of this impasse again in his letter to the President on February 11. It is regrettable that the President did not respond to that reasonable effort to resolve this matter. Indeed, the letter he sent this week to Senator Frist was not a response to Senator Daschle's reasonable and realistic approach, but a further effort to minimize the Senate's role in this process by proposing radical changes in Senate rules and practices to the great benefit of this administration. A distinguished senior Republican Senator saw the reasonableness of the suggestions that the Democratic leader and assistant leader have consistently made during this debate when he agreed on February 14 that they pointed the way out of the impasse. Sadly, his efforts and judgment were also rejected by the administration.  More recently, in its edition for next Monday, March 17, a writer in The Weekly Standard suggests that other Senate Republicans, ``several veteran GOP Senate staffers'' and ``a top GOP leadership aide'' asked the White House to shown some flexibility and to share the legal memoranda with the Senate to resolve this matter, but were rebuffed. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the article from The Weekly Standard be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Weekly Standard, Mar. 17, 2003]  Filibuster Si, Estrada No!--The Great Republican Divide Over How To                    Fight for Bush's Judicial Nominee                           (By Major Garrett)       It's not clear whether the constitutional definition of      ``advice and consent'' will become a casualty of Miguel      Estrada's fight for a seat on the D.C. Circuit Court of      Appeals, but the possibility is serious and sobering. In a      55-44 vote, Democrats last week defeated a Republican attempt      to break their unprecedented partisan filibuster of Estrada's      nomination, opening the way for the simple-majority standard      for Senate confirmation of judicial nominees to be replaced      with a super-majority requirement. The Republic isn't there      yet. But it's close.       ``If we go very much further there will be obvious      consequences,'' said Sen. Jon Kyl, an Arizona Republican.      ``This standard will have to be applied to both parties and      by both parties. This is very close to the point where you      can't pull it back.''       The strain on the Constitution and Senate precedent is now      obvious. Less obvious is the toll the Estrada fight has taken      on the relationship between the new Senate GOP leadership      team and the Bush White House. While GOP senators are loath      to admit it, the Estrada debate has drifted on this long      because the White House and the GOP leadership could not      fashion a cohesive strategy.       Estrada is not the first fight new majority leader Bill      Frist would have chosen--at least not under the restrictions      imposed by the White House. Senate Republicans believe the      White House has severely limited their room to negotiate.       Early on, several veteran GOP Senate staffers warned the      White House and Justice Department to prepare for a brawl.      They then gingerly asked two questions: Would Estrada answer      more questions from Democrats? And was there any flexibility      in the     White House's objection to releasing the working memos      Estrada wrote while deputy solicitor general in the Clinton      Justice Department?       Senior Senate GOP staff told White House and Justice      Department officials that cutting a deal on limited      Democratic access to Estrada's working papers could lead to      his confirmation. The White House refused. There would be no      access to Estrada's working papers. Period. This adamantine      posture, in the eyes of some in the Senate GOP leadership      circles, handcuffed Frist.       ``There's some frustration,'' said a top GOP leadership      aide. ``From the very beginning we told them that was the      only way out and a face-saver for everyone. But it came down      to the fact that no one on the White House or Justice team      wanted to walk into the Oval Office and say to the president,      `You might have to give up these memos.' ''       The administration's position on the memos reflects its      deeply held ethic of aggressively defending executive branch      prerogatives. Though the White House has never      characterized the Estrada matter as one of executive      privilege (it is more akin to lawyer-client privilege), it      falls into the broad category of executive branch      muscularity. And while most Republicans generally support      this posture, some Bush allies on and off Capitol Hill      have come to question the administration's fastidiousness      in the Estrada fight.       ``I understand the principle, and I support it, but on this      one it feels belligerent,'' said a longtime Republican      lobbyist and ally of the Bush White House.       When a reporter last week asked Sen. Rick Santorum, the GOP      conference chairman, if opposition to divulging Estrada's      Justice Department memos was permanent, he snapped, ``Ask the      White House.''       Conservatives like Sen. Kyl see the Estrada fight as purely      ideological and strongly oppose cutting any deal on access to      his working papers.       ``It's a phony issue, a manufactured issue,'' said Kyl.      ``We want to win this, but you don't win it by breaking a      principle that has served this nation well for 200 years. And      if we deal on the papers, it will be something else.''       But Sen. Harry Reid, the Senate's No. 2 Democrat, has said      he will support Estrada if the papers are turned over and      nothing objectionable emerges. Enough Democrats to break the      filibuster would surely follow Reid, senior Democratic      sources say.       ``Their guy's not going to get confirmed without them,''      said a top Democratic lawyer who backs Estrada. ``This is not      complicated. The White House is not going to confirm him      without paying a price.''       If that price seems too high, the White House may want to      reexamine the price of the alternative, an increasingly      bitter filibuster fight. While protecting the privacy of      internal memos at the Justice Department, the White House may      be sacrificing the 50-vote majority as the historic benchmark      of constitutional fitness for the federal bench. Some Senate      Republicans believe a new 60-vote standard for judicial      appointments could severely hamper this president and all      future presidents. And some Senate Republicans wonder why      it's more important to protect executive privilege than a      president's power to have judicial nominees confirmed by      simple majority vote.       The White House wants the fight to drag out and political      pressure to build on centrist Democrats. The White House      likes the Hispanic dimension of the Estrada fight and is      counting on the weight of editorial and public opinion to      turn the tide.       But numerous Republican senators say the Estrada fight, for      all its constitutional implications, has yet to resonate with      the public. Democratic senators report no political backlash      at home and see it as their duty to defend Daschle.       ``This is an ideological fight, and this is a fight for      Daschle to be taken seriously,'' said a senior aide to a      Democratic senator who has teamed up with the White House on      economic policy. ``And my boss is with Daschle. He knows he's      taken, and will take, enough flak on fiscal policy. This is a      fight he's prepared to stick with.''       Absent a deal on the working memos, all Estrada can bank on      is White House and Republican promises to fight until they      prevail. But no one in the GOP Senate leadership or the Bush      White House can explain how or when that will happen.
