Speaker, most American families cannot leave their children a fortune. What we try to leave them is a set of values and an opportunity.  Last week, the Republican budget resolution closed the door of opportunity for millions of American kids. The Republican budget resolution cut college student loans by $18 billion. That is right. At a time when America needs a well-educated generation to lead us into the next century, at a time when our kids need the opportunity for education for a good-paying job, the Gingrich Republicans make the biggest cut in student loans in our Nation's history.  And why have the Republicans done this? Why are the Republicans increasing a student's cost of financing a college education by an average of $5,000? Because the Republican student loan cuts fill the Republican piggy bank to pay for tax breaks for the privileged few.  Cutting college student loans may be the Gingrich view of America. How does your family feel?                          ____________________
