Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend, my colleague, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak against this resolution. I rise to speak for peace. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God. Be they Christian, Jew, Muslim, Buddhist, Sikhs; be they white, black, yellow, red, or brown, blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.  Today, we must ask ourselves, are we peacemakers? Will we cast aside our fears, our prejudices, our hate and embrace peace? Will we sow the seeds of peace, or are we just another nation sewing the seeds of war?  War with Iraq will sow seeds in the desert sands of the Middle East and throughout the world. What fruit will our actions bear, not just for us but for our children? And not just for the children of our land, but for the children of the West and the Middle East and the world? For it is the children, our little boys and girls, who must live with the consequences of our war.  What do we gain? What do our children gain when we have destroyed another nation? What do we gain when we have killed hundreds and thousands of their men, women, and children; when hundreds of our sons and daughters have died?  War with Iraq will not bring peace to the Middle East. It will not make the world a safer, a better, a more loving place. It will not end the strife and hatred that breed terror. War does not end strife; it sows it. War does not end hatred; it feeds it.  War is bloody, it is vicious, it is evil, and it is messy. War destroys the dreams, the hopes and aspirations of people. As a great Nation and blessed people, we must heed the words of the spiritual, ``I am going to lay my burden down by the riverside. I ain't gonna study war no more.''  For those who argue that war is a necessary evil, I say that they are half right. War is evil, but it is not necessary. War cannot be a necessary evil because nonviolence is a necessary good. The two cannot coexist. As Americans, as human beings, as citizens of the world, as moral actors, we must embrace the good and reject the evil.  As Ghandi said, ``The choice is nonviolence or nonexistence.'' The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said, ``We must learn to live together as brothers and sisters, or perish as fools.'' There is something greater than military victory, bigger and greater than regime change and toppling governments. It is to this greater good that as a Nation and as a people we must aspire.  The scriptures say, ``What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?'' America's strength is not in military might but in our ideas. America ingenuity, freedom, and democracy have conquered the world. It is a battle we did not win with guns or tanks or missiles, but with ideas, principles and justice.  We must use our resources not to make bombs and guns but to solve the problems that affect humankind. We must feed the stomach, clothe the naked bodies, educate and stimulate the mind.  We must use our resources to build and not to tear down, to reconcile and not to divide, to love and not to hate, to heal and not to kill. This is the direction great nations should move.  War is easy, but peace, peace is hard. When we hurt, when we fear, when we feel vulnerable or hopeless, it is easy to listen to what is most base within us. It is easy to divide the world into us and them, to fear them, to hate them, to fight them, to kill them. War is easy, but peace is hard. Peace is right, it is just, and it is true. I know it is not easy to love thy enemy. No, peace is hard.  So we have war in Israel, and no peace. We have war in Kashmir, but no peace. We have war in Afghanistan, in Colombia, in Sudan and the Philippines, and no peace. It may be hard, it may be difficult, but the quest for peace is as old as the dawn of history and as fresh as the morning newspaper.                              {time}  1815  Mr. Speaker, my brothers and sisters, sometime, some place, leaders of a great Nation will have the courage to say, ``We will lay down the burden, the tools and the instruments of war. We will wage peace, not war.'' And that nation will be blessed, for they shall be called the children of God.
