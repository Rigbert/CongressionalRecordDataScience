 President, when Paducah Police Chief Brandon Barnhill announced last October that he would be retiring at the end of the year, we knew he would leave large shoes to fill. During his 20 years with the department, including the last 5 it at the helm, Brandon helped develop a statewide reputation for excellence. Now, as Brandon retires to pursue new opportunities, I would like to take a moment to thank him for his service to the city of Paducah and the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  Brandon graduated from Murray State University and earned a master's degree from Andrew Jackson University. It was at the Murray Police Department that Brandon began his noble vocation in law enforcement. He spent 3 years there before joining Paducah's police force in 1998.  Every day, Brandon wore the badge with pride. Out of love for his community, he faced down danger with integrity and professionalism. Our Commonwealth is blessed with an abundance of brave men and women who put themselves in harm's way to protect their fellow citizens, and Brandon fulfilled his duty with distinction.  It didn't take long for his potential to be recognized in Paducah. Promoted to detective the year after joining the department, Brandon continued to earn the respect of his colleagues both in Paducah and throughout the State. When the previous police chief announced his retirement in 2013, Brandon became the best choice to lead his colleagues to preserve the peace.  Brandon's leadership has helped place the Paducah Police Department among the most respected law enforcement organizations in Kentucky. One of his major initiatives was to strengthen the partnerships between the department and the local community. Brandon recently said he was particularly proud of the ``Chief's Community Forum,'' a way to receive feedback on the perception of policing in the city. Throughout his service, Brandon became an example of integrity and credibility in law enforcement, and the Kentucky Association of Chiefs of Police named him the Chief of the Year in 2016.  In recent years, I have had the privilege to work with Brandon to bring increased Federal law enforcement resources to Paducah in support of the work already being done there to combat the substance abuse epidemic. In 2018, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Federal Bureau of Investigation both committed to open new offices in Paducah and to dedicate assets to a partnership with State and local law enforcement. Brandon and the men and women of the Paducah Police Department were, of course, integral to this effort to keep our communities safe.  At his retirement celebration, Brandon was greeted with an outpouring of support and gratitude from the community he had spent two decades serving. I would like to take this opportunity to add my voice to those congratulating him for his remarkable success in Paducah. With his wife Renee and their children, Natalie and Reese, I wish him all the best in his next adventure. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in thanking Chief Brandon Barnhill for his leadership at the Paducah Police Department.                          ____________________
