 President, I thank the majority leader. As I indicated to the majority leader, this may be a unique bill not unlike the one my friend, the Presiding Officer, has on sex trafficking on which he has worked so hard. This doesn't even have those problems. This has 415 Members of the House voting for it; 3 voting against it; 71 cosponsors in the Senate. I am willing to predict, if we can agree to bring it up without amendment, we will get 85 to 95 votes. This is in the category of a no brainer. Henry Hyde is a sponsor of it. It is the Biden-Hatch bill.  The only point I make, and I will be brief, time is running out. The Violence Against Women Act expires this Sunday, September 30. It took me 8 years to get this thing done. It took 3 years after it was written just to get it considered. It took that long to get it passed. It has been in place for 5 years. There are no additional taxes required to pay for this bill because there is a trust fund that uses the salaries that were being paid to Federal officials who no longer work for the Federal Government; it goes into that fund.  As I said, if there was ever a no brainer, this one is it. Democrats like it; Republicans like it. As Senator Herman Talmadge from Georgia, said to me one night regarding another issue when I walked into the Senate dining room: What's the problem, Joe? I guess I looked down. He was chairman of the Agriculture Committee. I said: I'm having problems with such and such an issue. He said: What is the problem, son? I repeated; I thought he didn't hear me. He said: No, you don't understand. Republicans like it; Democrats like it. So just go and do it.  Well, that is where we are tonight. Democrats like the bill; Republicans like the bill; the House likes the bill; the Senate likes the bill; women like the bill; men like the bill, business likes the bill; labor likes the bill. So why don't we have the bill? And I have been hollering about this for 2 years now.  Hopefully, in light of what the majority leader said, maybe we will get to it. I was beginning to get a little despondent. I was even thinking of attaching the bill to the Presiding Officer's bill to make sure we get it done.  Today the Washington Post, in an editorial entitled ``Inexplicable Neglect,'' noted: ``There seems to be no good reason, practical or substantive, to oppose the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.''  I ask unanimous consent the totality of that editorial be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                          Inexplicable Neglect       There seem to be no good reason, practical or substantive,      to oppose reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.      Originally passed in 1994, the act provides money to state      and local institutions to help combat domestic violence. It      is set to expire at the end of the month. Its reauthorization      has overwhelming bipartisan support. But House and Senate      leaders have yet to schedule a vote.       Versions of the bill have been favorably reported by the      judiciary committees of both chambers. Both would expand      programs that during the past five years have helped create      an infrastructure capable of prosecuting domestic violence      cases and providing services to battered women. Since the      original act was passed, Congress has devoted $1.5 billion to      programs created by it. The House and Senate bills differ,      but both would authorize more than $3 billion in further      support during the next five years. There is room to debate      the proper funding level relative to other priorities, a      matter which will be determined later by appropriators; and      the programs won't end immediately if the act lapses, because      funds have been approved for the coming year. But failing to      reauthorize would send the wrong message on an important      issue and, more important, could threaten future      appropriations.       With time in the 106th Congress running out, the Violence      Against Women Act may become a casualty for neglect rather      than of active opposition. But that's no comfort. Congress      ought to find the time to pass it before leaving town.
