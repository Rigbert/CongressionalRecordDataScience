 Last night, we were unable to complete work on the State Department authorization bill. Therefore, on Monday, we will turn to the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Tsunami Relief. We did make progress, however, on the State Department bill, and it is still hoped that we can reach an agreement to limit amendments on that bill, and therefore make it possible for us to complete it.  That would allow the chairman and ranking member to work together to determine how much work remains on the bill prior to reaching final passage. In the meantime, and under the consent agreement, we will begin consideration of the appropriations bill at 3 p.m. on Monday. As announced last night, there will be a vote on Monday evening at approximately 5:15. That vote will likely be on a district judge, although it is possible that additional votes will occur on amendments to the supplemental at that time.  I will have further announcements on the Monday schedule at the close of business today. Let me say, for all of our colleagues, turning to the supplemental appropriations bill next week means we will have a very busy week, with lots of votes and potentially one or more evening sessions.  With that, I yield the floor.                          ____________________[Page S3341]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                SCHEDULE  Mr. McCONNELL.
