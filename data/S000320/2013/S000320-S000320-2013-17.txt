 President, to some extent, I want to repeat what Senator Mikulski just said. No. 1, this would avoid a government shutdown. That should appeal to everybody. I think it appeals to the American people. It should appeal to everybody in this body tonight.  No. 2, it enforces the Budget Control Act and sequester levels. I will say it again. It enforces the Budget Control Act and sequester levels. Granted, perhaps not everything is ideal, but what is here? There will be ample time to address some of the issues. Some of the issues that have been raised are bona fide issues that we were unable to address for one reason or another in this process. But I assure my colleagues--and I have been working with my colleagues and with Senator Mikulski's Democratic colleagues--that if we do not move forward, I am afraid there may be no future appropriations bills, which is not good for anyone in this legislative process.  We have lurched from crisis to crisis. The CR is running out. What we are asking to do is to fund the government until September 30.  I urge my colleagues to support cloture and move this process forward.  I thank the Chair.
