This bill will go to the President's desk. It has bipartisan support in the Senate. It should have bipartisan support today.  In the next administration I will work with the gentleman from Ohio and other Republicans and Democrats to rightfully craft even a better bill. This bill goes two steps in the right direction. I will be glad to take it the remaining half step to get it to be a good bill eventually with the President.  Again, I urge my colleagues to vote no on this motion to commit, and vote yes on final passage.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
