 So I don't expect all Senators to know as much about sanctions as the Senator from Oregon and I because we spend probably 20 percent of our time working on that in the Foreign Relations Committee. My friend from Massachusetts forgot more about HCFA than I will ever know. It took me a while to know what HCFA was. They set the rates for everything, and it affects the American people a heck of a lot more than sanctions policy.  There are discretionary sanctions available to the President of the United States. I emphasize ``discretionary.'' The comment made by the Secretary of State refers to those discretionary policies.
