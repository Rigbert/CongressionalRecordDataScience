Speaker, it is my distinct honor to commend these dedicated individuals who have made significant contributions to Northwest Indiana: Bob Anadell, Hannah Cherry, Nancy Kelly, and the members of the Hispanic Women's Forum of Northwest Indiana. These individuals will be honored by the Calumet Project at an awards luncheon for their dedication to justice and to the people of Northwest Indiana. The event will take place at the Social Hall of Our Lady of Perpetual Help Parish in Hammond, Indiana on Friday, November 18, 2005.  The Calumet Community Hero Award is being presented to Mr. Bob Anadell. Bob has had many positive accomplishments throughout his career with I.B.E.W. Local 697; he has also actively contributed to his community through participation in various programs aimed at improving opportunities for the people of Northwest Indiana. He has been a powerful member of the Northwest Indiana Building Trades, Secretary Treasurer of the IBEW State Conference, Vice-President of the Indiana State AFL-CIO, Trustee of the Lake Area United Way, Board of Directors of Trade Winds, Member of the Lake County Integrated Services Delivery Board, Chairman of the Board of Directors, Investment Committee, and Executive Committee of the Legacy Foundation, as well as Co-Chairman of the Heroes Committee of the American Red Cross.  Also receiving a Calumet Community Hero Award is Ms. Hannah Cherry. Ms. Cherry graduated from Maywood High School in Hammond, Indiana where she was one of three African Americans that year. Her passion has always been to improve the conditions in the city where she lives and to fight for justice for all people. Hannah is a lifetime member of the NAACP, a member of the Project Area Committee, and a charter member of the Neighborhood Action Council. She has also given her time and efforts selflesslyas a volunteer at St. Margaret's Hospital for almost twenty years. Hannah is a compassionate activist and she is being honored for her ongoing quest to see to it that justice prevails.  The third Calumet Community Hero Award is being presented to the Hispanic Women's Forum of Northwest Indiana. The forum was started in the early 1980's when a group of young Hispanic women came together with an idea to form an organization that would focus on mentoring fellow Hispanic women. The Forum's common goal was to make Hispanics in professional careers more visible in the community by stressing the importance of education. The Hispanic Women's Forum conducts a yearly luncheon where they honor young Hispanic women graduating from local high schools. Monetary awards are given to some of the young women based on a selection process. The Hispanic Women's Forum's longstanding commitment to improving the quality of life is truly inspirational and should be commended.  The final award, the Lifetime Achievement Award, is being presented to Nancy Kelly for her outstanding service to the Northwest Indiana Community. Nancy decided at a young age to be a local missionary in the service to her community. Mrs. Kelly was a volunteer and community organizer under Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley's administration. She moved to Gary, Indiana 30 years ago with her late husband. Mrs. Kelly dedicated herself to improving the quality of life for the residents in her community. She is the founder of the Horace Mann Ambridge Neighborhood Improvement Organization and she has served on the LCEOC board as well as numerous other boards. Mrs. Kelly's lifetime of service continues as she still serves with the Grand Calumet River Task Force. Along with her many other contributions to society, she was also honored with the Indiana Older Hoosier Award of the year. I am proud to commend Mrs. Kelly for her lifetime of service and dedication.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending these individuals for their outstanding contributions to Indiana's First Congressional District. Their hard work and dedication has improved the quality of life for the community and is worthy of the highest commendation.                          ____________________
