m. Immediately following that vote, a second vote will occur on the adoption of the IRS conference report.  Following those two back-to-back votes, it will be the leader's intention to begin the anti-agriculture sanctions legislation for India and Pakistan, hopefully under a brief time agreement. Following that legislation, it will be the leader's intention to begin the higher education bill under the consent agreement of June 25, 1998.  Therefore, several votes will occur during Thursday's session of the Senate, with the first two votes occurring back-to-back at 10 a.m.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
