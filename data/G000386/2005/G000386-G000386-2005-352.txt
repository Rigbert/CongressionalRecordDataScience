 President, I am going to speak against the amendment by the Senator from Arkansas, but I want to make clear that I do not object to the substance of the amendment. I am in a position where I have to have a reconciliation. I want to show sympathy for what she is talking about but defending what I have in my mark and also express--and I am summarizing now--that I hope somewhere between now and the final consideration of the reconciliation we are able to take out Katrina relief that I have in mine, do it more broadly, as Senator Baucus and I have tried to do, but right now I am not in a position to do that. I hope to move that along, and so today I am a little bit opposite of the Senator and a little bit opposite of Senator Baucus.
