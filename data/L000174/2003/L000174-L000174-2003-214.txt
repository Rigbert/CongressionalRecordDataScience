President, I had hoped that the Judiciary Committee would undertake a deliberate and careful review of information from partiesactually involved in class action litigation to provide a realistic picture of the benefits and problems with class actions. But instead of doing the work for America, we are proceeding with a special interest piece of legislation which has repeatedly failed to pass the Senate in recent years. Our Judiciary Committee did not carry out the kind of thorough and thoughtful legal analysis of this difficult issue it should have. The committee did not provide our fellow Senators with the assistance that they may want and need in this complex area.  I acknowledge the hard work and dedication of my friend, the senior Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, who took on an enormous task, attempting with her amendment to rectify some of the harms created by this bill. I appreciate the sincerity of her concern. I appreciate the genuine effort she made. But her amendment touches on only a sliver of the class action cases which this bill would affect--only when plaintiffs and primary defendants are from the same State--and even then it could cause harm.  At its core, this bill deprives citizens of the right to sue on State law claims in their own State courts if the principal defendant is a citizen of another State, even if that defendant has a substantial presence in the plaintiff's home State, and even if the harm done was in the plaintiff's home State. The amendment does not remedy that problem. It burdens the plaintiff even more.  I also want to recognize the sincere efforts made by my friend from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl. I may disagree with him about the nature of the problem. I may disagree with the appropriate solution in this area. But I do so respectfully. He has worked very hard, and I appreciate his efforts.  I would like to note the significant changes in the bill since it passed out of committee.  As originally drafted, this bill included mass tort claims along with class actions. It actually treated them like they were class actions.  One improvement the Judiciary Committee did manage to make to the bill was to strike that provision. We struck it. We voted on that, and we struck it. But somehow, mysteriously, after the bill left the committee with nobody voting, that was reversed. Now mass tort actions are again included in this bill.  Just in case anybody says this is what we voted out of committee, it is not. We changed that.  Now we find out how we actually get things changed in the committee because, apparently, our friends on the other side of the aisle could care less about what we actually did in committee. They just change it in the draft on the way over here. It is fascinating. I have never seen that in 29 years here. But I guess we live under new rules.  In the old days, we just lived under the Senator rules. But now we have rules outside the Senate rules. In fact, this bill is not the bill reported by the Judiciary Committee, S. 274. It is another bill--S. 1751--which was introduced last week. We didn't have hearings on that. We didn't have votes on that. I guess the special interest says, OK, as soon as you finish with the roads in Iraq, as soon as you finish the schools in Iraq, as soon as you finish giving the power grid to Iraq, as soon as you finish paying for the police officers in Iraq, as soon as you are finished with veterans' benefits for Iraq, before you do anything for American citizens, give us our special interest legislation, and we can just drop it in and go forward.  The special interest legislation will be subjected to the same shunting to a Federal court, and plaintiffs will endure the same unnecessary difficulties in making their claims and pursuing their remedies. But these mass tort cases are not class actions. They have not been analyzed under rule 23 standards or State law.  Mass tort actions have entirely different procedural vehicles to reach justice than class actions. They shouldn't be lumped in with class actions in any kind of class action bill, either this misguided attempt or a better wrought piece of legislation.  Some special interest groups are distorting the state of class action litigation by relying on a few anecdotes and an ends-oriented attempt to impede plaintiffs bringing class action cases. If we really want to correct things, we can and should take necessary steps to correct the problems in class action litigation. But simply shoving most suits into Federal court with the new one-sided rules isn't going to correct the real problems faced by plaintiffs and defendants. It will clog up the Federal courts, but it won't accomplish anything.  We forget that our State-based tort system remains one of the greatest and post powerful vehicles for justice anywhere in the world--no doubt around the world--as a vehicle for justice. It lets ordinary people ban together to take on powerful corporations--sometimes even their own government.  Defrauded investors, deceived consumers, victims of defective products, and environmental torts, and thousands of other ordinary people have been able to rely on class action lawsuits in their State court systems to seek and receive justice.  I remember when the Soviet Union broke up. A group of legislators from the Duma came in to see me, as they did several other Senators. One of them asked a question. They said: We have heard it is actually possible that citizens in your country can ban together and sue the government. I said that is true.  They said: We have heard further that not only do they sometimes sue the government, but there are times the government loses. They win.  I said: Oh, yes.  They said: You mean you don't fire the judge and make him do it over again?  I said: You don't understand our system. It is not the Soviet Union. Here in the United States, we are able to ban together to take on the government. If the government is wrong, the government is going to lose.  It was an eye-opener to them. Actually, it was a bit of an eye-opener to me because I realized those things we take for granted other countries haven't had the opportunity to have.  I am old enough to remember the civil rights battles of the 1950s and the 1960s and the impact of class actions in vindicating basic rights through our courts. When Congress sat back and did nothing, when Presidents sat back and did nothing, it was class action lawsuits that won.  The landmark Supreme Court decision of Brown v. Board of Education was a culmination of appeals from four class action cases, three from Federal court decisions in Kansas, South Carolina, and Virginia, and one from a decision of the Supreme Court of Delaware.  Only the Supreme Court of Delaware, the State court, got the case right by deciding for the African-American plaintiffs.  The State court justices understood they were constrained by the existing Supreme Court law but nonetheless held that the segregated schools of Delaware violated the 14th amendment. The Federal courts did not get it right; before any Federal court did so, a State court rejected separate and unequal schools. The U.S. Supreme Court, to their credit, joined in a unanimous decision in Brown v. Board of Education and closed down the highly discredited separate but equal idea, Plessie v. Ferguson. There was no separate but equal in the schools and they knew it--separate and unequal. The State courts realized that first in a class action suit and then the U.S. Supreme Court followed.  Many civil rights advocates, including the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, Leadership Council on Civil Rights, Mexican American Legal Defense and Education, and the National Asian Pacific Legal Consortium have written to Senators in opposition to this legislation. The civil rights advocates conclude this legislation ``would discourage civil rights class actions, impose substantial barriers to settling class actions and render federal courts unable to provide swift and effective administration of justice.''  I ask their letter, dated September 16, 2003, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                             Leadership Conference                                              on Civil Rights,                               Washington, DC, September 16, 2003. Oppose the Class Action Fairness Act of 2003: It Would Impose New and       Substantial Limitations on Access to Courts for Victims of                              Discrimination       Dear Senator: We, the 42 undersigned civil rights      organizations, write to express the opposition of the civil      rights community to S. 274, the Class Action Fairness Act to      2003, a bill that would substantially alter the      constitutional distribution of judicial power. If passed,      this bill would: remove most state law class actions into      federal court; clog the federal courts with state law cases      and make it more difficult to have federal civil rights cases      heard; deter people from bringing class actions; and impose      barriers and burdens on settlement of class actions.       Class actions are essential to the enforcement of our      nation's civil rights laws. They are often the only means by      which individuals can challenge and obtain relief from      systemic discrimination. Indeed, federal class actions were      designed to accommodate, and have served as a primary vehicle      for, civil rights litigation seeking broad equitable relief.       There are several reasons why the civil rights community is      troubled by this particular legislation:       This bill will overburden and create further unnecessary      delay in our federal courts. This bill will amend federal law      to extend federal jurisdiction to most state class actions,      overloading federal courts and inevitably delaying the      resolution of all cases in federal court, including many      civil rights claims. The effect of these provisions will be      particularly damaging in cases where civil rights plaintiffs      are seeking immediate injunctive relief to prohibit      discriminatory practices of a defendant.       The bill will burden the federal judiciary, rendering it a      less effectual mechanism by which plaintiffs may seek access      to justice. We strongly believe that S. 274 is an unnecessary      attempt to impose federal judicial regulation on matters of      law clearly committed to the states under our Constitution.      Indeed, the determination of state law tort, contract and      consumer cases is, unequivocally, not the responsibility of      the federal judiciary under the Constitution. The imposition      of such substantial new responsibilities on the federal      courts will further impair the ability of those courts to      carry out the essential functions they are intended to serve      under the  Constitution--the determination of matters      involving Federal interests, rights and responsibilities.      In short, true access to the Federal courts and to the      class action device to secure justice in matters where      Federal issues are at stake would be severely curtailed by      enactment of this legislation.       The bill could discourage people from bringing class      actions by prohibiting settlements that provide named      plaintiffs full relief for their claims. Now, for example, a      named plaintiff who sues an employer can receive a full award      of back pay, and in a proper case, obtain an order placing      him or her in the job denied because of discrimination, while      also affording all members of the class the opportunity to      share in available relief. However, under the guise of      protecting class members, the language of the proposed bill      prohibits courts from approving settlements that ``provide[]      for the payment of a greater share the award to a class      representative . . . than that awarded to the other class      members.'' This language is susceptible to the interpretation      that it prevents the award of positions or ``rightful place''      seniority to class representatives where the number of      vacancies for which class members were prevented from      competing by discrimination is less than the total number of      class members. If the price of trying to protect others is      the loss of the full measure of individual relief,      individuals will be deterred from becoming a class      representative. Thus, this provision would hinder, rather      than reform, civil rights class actions.       The bill could impose new, burdensome, and unnecessary      requirements on litigants and the Federal courts. It seeks to      impose inordinately difficult and costly notice requirements,      which will needlessly complicate and delay the settlement of      class actions. Specifically, the proposed bill would require      notice to Federal and state officials based on the residence      of all class members and would require a 120-day waiting      period. These additional, substantial and costly notice      requirements and built-in delays are not a matter of due      process, but are overly burdensome and improperly assume that      Federal and state officials have both proper interest in, and      a capacity to respond to, each and every class action.       For the reasons stated above, the proposed Class Action      Fairness Act of 2003 could discourage civil rights class      actions, impose substantial barriers to settling class      actions, and render Federal courts unable to provide swift      and effective administration of justice. The bill also      compromises delicate Federal/State relations by questioning      the competency of the state judiciary and overburdening our      already overworked Federal courts. In short, we believe the      impact of this legislation would be profound, and would      result in new and substantial limitations on access to the      courts for victims of discrimination. We, therefore, urge you      to reject this harmful legislation.
