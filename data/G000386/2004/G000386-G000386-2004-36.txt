S. but also includes an amount of tax liability attributable to such earnings. I believe that the formula is intended to produce an amount comparable to what would have been shown if the amount of earnings permanently invested offshore had been set forth on the financial statements. One shortcoming of the formula, which you have identified, is that the financial statements only take into account the incremental U.S. tax liability that would be incurred if the company repatriates its earnings, which would be the 35 percent rate reduced by any foreign tax credits. I think you raise a very good point that Congress should revisit in the future. In the meantime, I encourage the Department of Treasury to consider issuing guidance that permits taxpayers to more accurately reflect the actual amount of earnings permanently invested offshore.
