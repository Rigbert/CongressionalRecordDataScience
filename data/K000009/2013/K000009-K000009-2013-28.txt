Speaker, the Republican shutdown of government and their move to default on our debt are like forcing the wrong medicine on a sick patient--you might get them to take it, but it could kill them.  The only way America can pay back our Nation's debt is through economic growth and job creation, not bad medicine.  Let's not forget that we are still digging our way out from the Wall Street-induced Great Recession. Where did the $17 trillion of national debt come from? The Wall Street recession cost American households $19.2 trillion in lost wealth and the country 8.8 million jobs.  Under President Obama, we have had 42 consecutive months of job growth, leading to 7.5 million jobs being created, unlike in the Bush years when there wasn't a single job created. In fact, we lost over a half a million jobs. In the last 12 months of the Bush years, the country lost 4.6 million jobs. Let's not forget that America has accumulated an $8.4 trillion trade deficit since 1975 and that we have racked up $4 trillion in unpaid-for war spending.  So what is the Republican solution? Shut down the government. Don't pay the bills. The latest idea is to govern by supercommittee.  Mr. Speaker, we need to restore regular order, to move bills, to create jobs, and keep America's promises to our debtors. Let's nurse our Nation back to health, and stop continuing the economic pain with bad medicine.
