President, as we celebrate National Women's History month, I pay tribute to the countless contributions made by women, past and present, those heralded and those unknown to most, who have advanced the rights of women and enriched our Nation's history.  The month of March has been designated as National Women's History Month to illuminate the tremendous accomplishments of women throughout history. I salute my colleagues, Senator Barbara Mikulski and Senator Orrin Hatch for cosponsoring legislation over two decades ago declaring National Women's History Week. The celebration of women's history has since been expanded into a month long tribute to commemorate the many contributions of women.  This year's national theme, ``Celebrating Women of Courage and Vision,'' seeks to spark interest in the many remarkable stories of women's achievements in our schools and communities. We must strive to present history accurately, and in its entirety. History is not a womanless story and it should not be presented as such to our youth. It is imperative that we share the rich stories of women's struggles and achievements with all our children, but especially with our girls. With the benefit of strong female figures as role models, young women will have a fuller vision of what is possible in their lives.  The advancement of women in the last century has been nothing short of remarkable. At the beginning of the last century, women generally did not have the right to vote or own property. They could not hold most occupations, participate in the armed forces, or aspire to political office. But as long ago as 1872, a little known milestone in the fight for women's equality was achieved by the courageous actions of an Illinois woman.  Ellen Martin of Lombard, IL, understood her lack of legal entitlements in the late 1800s, but had the vision, the wits, and the determination to transcend the barriers around her. In the Presidential election of 1872, almost 50 years prior to the passage of the 19th Amendment, Martin and fourteen other Lombard women marched to the polls and demanded their right to vote. At the time, Lombard, Il, was governed by its local charter of incorporation, which inadvertently stated that ``all citizens'' rather than ``all male citizens'' had the right to vote.  Armed with a law book and her spectacles, Martin asserted her ``citizenship'' and demanded a ballot. Allegedly, the election judges were so shocked by the demand that one gentleman actually ``fell backward into a flour barrel.'' Ironically reminiscent of this year's unusual election, the votes of those 15 courageous women were extensively debated in the courts. But eventually, those 15 votes became the first women's votes ever to be counted in Illinois in an American Presidential election.  Ellen Martin refused to be held down by the social and political mores of the day. She had the courage to challenge and conquer the barriers that attempted to restrict her. And for her efforts, she won a small but important victory. Of course, it was not until 1920 that women's fundamental right to vote was expressly protected by the Constitution in the 19th Amendment. I am proud to say that Illinois was the first State in the Union to ratify that long overdue amendment, guaranteeing women a voice in the political arena.  There are many little known milestones, similar to the story of Ellen Martin's courage, which reveal the heroism of women throughout our history. These stories are important and they are powerful, but they can have little impact if they are not shared. Sadly, only 3 percent of our educational materials focus on women's contributions. Legislators in Illinois have recognized the need for the appreciation of the historical contributions of women and have mandated the teaching of women's history in K-12 classes. Only by recognizing the authentic contributions of women will educators be truly faithful to our national heritage.  Today, women play a central role in the Nation's political and economic arenas. I am privileged to work with 13 women Senators who provide powerful examples to young women across the Nation. At the State level, women currently hold 27.6 percent of the statewide executive offices across the country and 22.4 percent of State legislative positions. As Susan B. Anthony pointed out in 1897: ``There never will be complete equality until women themselves help to make laws.'' Women's representation in politics is not yet equal, but their increasing prominence signals a step in the right direction.  Today, women participate in our economy in record numbers, both in the workforce and as business leaders. Women own more than 9 million small businesses across the Nation, representing 38 percent of all small businesses nationwide. In Illinois, women own more than 250,000 firms. With their comprehensive participation, it is beyond dispute that women are vital to sustaining and improving our Nation's economy.  However, despite their strong presence in the workforce, women continue to earn less than men in this country. For every dollar a man earns, women on average earn only 73 cents. In Illinois, the wage gap is even larger: For every dollar earned by a man a woman earns only 69 cents. This wage gap persists despite the passage of the Equal Pay Act over three decades ago. Although the gap continues to shrink, the progress is painfully slow, shrinking by a rate of less than a half a penny a year. In order to facilitate the closure of this gap, I urge my colleagues to consider Senator Daschle's Paycheck Fairness Act, S. 77, of which I am a cosponsor. That bill would strengthen the enforcement mechanisms of the Equal Pay Act as well as recognize employer efforts to pay wages to women that reflect the real value of their contributions. The wage disparities between men and women have endured for far too long. We must approach the problem pro-actively and demand results.  The dedication of March as Women's History Month provides an excellentopportunity to celebrate the many contributions of women that have shaped our history as well as the powerful influence that women continue to exert not only as business leaders and politicians, but also as mothers, teachers, neighbors and vital members of the community. But as we ``Celebrate Women of Courage and Vision,'' let us not forget the battles that lie ahead for women as they continue to struggle for full equality. As Alice Paul, a female attorney in the early 1900s, eloquently noted: ``Most reforms, most problems are complicated. But to me there is nothing complicated about ordinary equality.'' Let us allow the simple principle of equality to guide us, as we strive to make history in further advancing the rights of women.                          ____________________
