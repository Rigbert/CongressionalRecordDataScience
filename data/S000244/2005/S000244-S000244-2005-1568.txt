Speaker, today Mr. Conyers, Mr. Smith of Texas, Mr. Berman, and I would like to commend and thank Alec French for his tremendous contribution as Minority Counsel to the Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property. During his five years of service to the Subcommittee, Alec was well-liked by the Members and his colleagues on both sides of the aisle. We are sad to see him leave our staff.  Without our system of copyright, trademark, and patent protection for innovations, consumers would not be able to enjoy movies, music, or new technology. Over the last five years, Alec was an invaluable member of our team and he played a crucial role in helping us to protect creative works and to establish the parameters of intellectual property rights. At the same time, Alec made sure that we listened to the needs of all parties involved, namely copyright owners and copyright users, so that decisions of policy were balanced appropriately.  Because of Alec's service, Congress was able to pass into law several bills on these issues, including the Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act of 2004, Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act of 2004, the Intellectual Property Protection and Courts Amendments Act of 2004, and the Small Webcaster Settlement Act of 2002. He also shepherded numerous bills that passed the House, including the United States Patent and Trademark Fee Modernization Act of 2004, the Piracy Deterrence and Education Act of 2004, Internet Freedom and Broadband Deployment Act of 2001, Patent and Trademark Office Authorization Act of 2002, Intellectual Property and High Technology Technical Amendments Act of 2001, and Madrid Protocol Implementation Act.  Alec also was instrumental in working with our third branch of the government, the Judiciary. He helped protect the privacy of judges and their staffs, made sure that judges were compensated fairly, and ensured that the courts would have the resources they need to continue serving the American public.  We thank Alec for his exceptional service to Congress and wish him the very best in his future endeavors.                          ____________________
