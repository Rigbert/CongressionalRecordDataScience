President, with the indulgence of the two leaders, I appreciate very much what the Democratic leader has said. He and I, and the distinguished majority leader, and Senator Hatch, and others, want to move judges whenever we have consensus. And I think we have shown we have.  In the 17 months we were in charge of the Senate, when we were the majority, we confirmed 100 of President Bush's nominees to the Federal judiciary. In the 16 months the Republicans have been in control, this will make another 64 we have confirmed. So it is around 164 between the 2 parties. It is a record that has not been matched for years and years and years.  But I am happy to accommodate the two leaders. I know the problems the two leaders have. I would not wish them on anybody else. The two leaders have been trying to schedule things, so I am happy to try to accommodate them and all Members.
