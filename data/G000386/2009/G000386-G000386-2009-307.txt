 President, I rise for the purpose of discussing an amendment that was filed yesterday that I hope I get an opportunity to offer. I am going to touch on these points, but I thought I would highlight a couple points about this amendment.  First of all, there is bipartisan agreement in this body there is a $290 billion tax gap--``tax gap'' meaning taxes that are owed but not collected. There is also an understanding that is not written that the IRS is not going to go after taxes unpaid, through their own employees, of under $25,000 a year. There is a feeling by some people in the IRS there ought to be more employees hired to go after the tax gap, but even if those additional employees are hired, they still will not go after those under $25,000.  Now, we have a program in place I wish to defend in my remarks. That program in place is the IRS contracting with private collection agencies to go after the money that is owed for those under $25,000; and to make the point, that program is working. But the bill before us, the Omnibus appropriations bill, contains a provision that would essentially kill the IRS private debt collection program, which the Senate, working through the Senate Finance Committee I serve on, only authorized a short period of 4 years ago. The IRS implemented that program only 2 years ago.  This program, which has never been fully operational in its brief 2-year period, allows the Internal Revenue Service to use private collection agencies to collect money owed to the Government. The program has many critics, and once again they are seeking to destroy the program before we have a chance to gauge how effective the program is.  Before I discuss the merits of the program, I wish to note that an appropriations bill is not the proper vehicle to nullify tax policy. The private debt collection program was created in a tax bill within the jurisdiction of our Finance Committee, and further legislation affecting the program should be done through the committee where the expertise is, the Finance Committee. Whether you would agree with the program, I think everyone could agree on the importance of the committee structure that we use in the Senate. In other words, a committee of jurisdiction where the expertise is ought to work to change a program if it needs to be changed or if it needs to be done away with, as basically the appropriations bill would do. I would assume members of the Appropriations Committee would not want--would not want--those of us on the Finance Committee making decisions against the expertise of the Appropriations Committee.  The IRS private debt collection program facilitates the collection of tax debts the IRS would not otherwise pursue. These liabilities amount to billions of dollars a year.  A Government Accountability Office report issued in June of 2008 reported the unpaid tax debt as of fiscal year 2007 to be about $290 billion, of which almost $185 billion was classified as nonpotentially collectible inventory and $25.5 billion was deemed potentially collectible but not in active collection status. The private debt collection agencies are only permitted to pursue debts taxpayers have conceded they owe.  Opposition to this program is surprising, since the Internal Revenue Service program is intended to run like similar programs at other agencies. In other words, the Department of Education uses private collection agencies to pursue delinquent student loans. The Treasury Department, which houses the Internal Revenue Service, also houses the Financial Management Service, and, ironically, the Treasury Department uses private debt collection agencies to collect small business loans.  So if it is OK for one branch of the Treasury Department to do that, why isn't it OK for the Internal Revenue Service to go after taxes owed but not paid? The only reason I can think of that private debt collection is so controversial at the Internal Revenue Service is simply the opposition to the program from the National TreasuryEmployees Union. The National Treasury Employees Union is comprised primarily of Internal Revenue Service employees, and according to that union's Web site, is the largest Federal sector union in the entire country.  The other Government agencies that use private debt collectors do not have as powerful a union fighting for more Government jobs. Yet this program does not threaten the jobs of revenue agents already working at the IRS. The tax debts the private collection agencies are targeting are debts the Internal Revenue Service is not even pursuing, and likely would not pursue even if additional revenue agents were hired.  In May 2007, Acting Commissioner Kevin Brown--now this is a Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service--when testifying before a subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee, confirmed that the Internal Revenue Service would not otherwise pursue these debts, even if the IRS were given additional resources. So the bottom line is this: There are no IRS jobs on the line. Rather, the National Treasury Employees Union believes the IRS should be hiring more union employees to do collections work.  In contrast, I believe if the IRS is going to hire more workers, it should be agents to do more exams--work that private contractors cannot do. Former IRS Commissioner Mark Everson stated in a letter to me on April 11, 2007, that a full-time revenue agent auditing individual tax returns historically brings in nearly $700,000 annually.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Commissioner Everson's letter be printed in the Record, as well as a followup letter I wrote to Treasury Secretary Paulson on this issue.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       Department of the Treasury,                                     Internal Revenue Service,                                   Washington, DC, April 11, 2007.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: This letter follows-up on a matter      that has been an ongoing concern to both the Internal Revenue      Service (IRS) and you for several years now, and that you      raised in a meeting with IRS senior executives on January 30,      2007. Specifically, you asked for information on the use of      official time by representatives of the National Treasury      Employees Union (NTEU).       Reducing the use of official time by NTEU representatives      has been a significant point of negotiations between the IRS      and NTEU for several years. Over time, the IRS has      established greater controls over time granted to union      officials to perform representational duties.       As illustrated by the enclosed chart, from 2002 through      2006, total annual NTEU time spent on union related      activities has decreased approximately 14 percent, from      729,988 hours to 630,539 hours. Per your request at the      January 30, 2007, meeting to quantify the data in terms of      full time equivalents (FTEs), this represents a reduction      from approximately 350 to 302 FTEs. To further quantify this      in terms of resource and revenue trade-offs, as you      requested, historically a full-time SB/SE revenue agent      auditing individual tax returns brings in nearly $700,000      annually.       While progress has been made, the IRS recognizes that more      needs to be done. The recent IRS-NTEU mid-term negotiations      in 2006 produced a broad range of means for achieving      operational efficiencies. These include simple time-     efficiencies such as increasing the number of meetings      conducted by phone and requiring stewards within the      commuting area to attend in-person meetings. Other measures      include establishing an annual cap of 850 hours of      representational time for the vast majority of stewards,      reducing the grievance procedure for performance appraisals      and mass grievances from a multi-step to a one-step process,      and streamlining NTEU's participation on various committees.       Reducing the amount of official time continues to be a      priority and we will seek significant additional improvements      in our upcoming contract negotiations. Please contact me      should you require additional information or a member of your      staff may call Robert Buggs, Chief Human Capital Officer. at      202-622-7676,           Sincerely,     Mark W. Everson.                                  ____                                                      U.S. Senate,                                         Committee on Finance,                                     Washington, DC, May 15, 2007.     Hon. Henry Paulson,     Secretary,     Department of Treasury,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Secretary: I am writing to you regarding an      ongoing concern that I have with respect to the amount of      official Internal Revenue Service (IRS) time used by      representatives of the National Treasury Employees Union      (NTEU). As you are aware, I have been a strong advocate of      using IRS resources in the most productive manner possible.       Based on information former Commissioner Everson provided      to me in a letter dated April 11, 2007, total NTEU time spent      on union related activities for 2006 equated to 302 full time      equivalents (FTEs). In terms of resource and revenue trade-     offs, the letter referenced a historical figure of a full-     time SR/SE revenue agent auditing individual tax returns      bringing in nearly $700,000 annually. Thus, according to IRS      figures, total NTEU time for 2006 represents approximately      $211,400,000 additional direct revenue that could have      potentially been brought into the United States Treasury.      This figure does not account for any increase in revenue that      would be gained indirectly through the increased audit      activity. At a time when this Committee is increasingly      looking at new methods of closing the tax gap, it is      imperative that we first ensure that the IRS is effectively      using its existing resources.       At the Senate Finance Committee's tax gap hearing on April      18, 2007, former Commissioner Everson stated that the IRS was      in the process of trying to renegotiate the NTEU agreement,      which would include a renegotiation of union activity time,      Former Commissioner Everson also stated that the amount of      time devoted to union activities is proportionately higher at      the IRS than it is in comparison to other departments and      agencies within the government. Without getting into whether      taxpayers should even be funding union activity, please      provide me with an analysis of IRS union activity time versus      union time for other governmental departments and agencies.      Please also quantify this analysis in terms of FTEs and the      number of agency or department employees who are represented      by the union. What is being done in the renegotiation process      to bring the IRS-NTEU agreement at least more in line with      practices elsewhere in the government?       Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I      would appreciate your response by May 25, 2007.           Cordially yours,                                              Charles E. Grassley,                                                   Ranking Member.
