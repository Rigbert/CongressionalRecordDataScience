 Biden):  S. 334. A bill to amend title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to encourage States to enact a law enforcement officers' bill of rights, to provide standards and protection for the conduct of internal police investigations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.        the law enforcement officers' bill of rights act of 1995 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill to establish a law enforcement officer's bill of rights. In every city and town, we rely on law enforcement officers to protect our safety. They put their lives on the line for us every single day.  And, often their jobs can be very difficult. The Constitution requires they conduct themselves appropriately, and they are subject to the laws and regulations set out by Congress as well as State and local regulatory bodies. They have to make snap decisions in high pressure situations. If they make the wrong decision, they can be subject to a lawsuit--for violation of the civil rights of a citizen.  While citizens have protection when a law enforcement officer engages in improper conduct, the police officer is often left without any legal rights when subject to disciplinary action. This bill aims to correct that unfairness.  The bill guarantees basic due process rights to law enforcement officers who are subject to investigation or interrogation for noncriminal disciplinary matters. And, let me emphasize that these rights do not apply in an emergency situation where the police officer is suspected of committing a crime or where that officer would be a threat to the safety or property of others. The bill reserves in the chief of police or other local officials the right to immediately suspend an officer who is suspected of committing a serious offense.  But, where there is no criminal conduct and no emergency situation, a police officer should have a right to be informed of his or her misconduct, to answer the charges, and to be represented by a lawyer or other appropriate person. These are basic due process rights that should be guaranteed to those on whom we rely to protect our safety.  Mr. President, there are some 475,000 State and local law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line for the rest of us. Let us give them their basic and fundamental rights.  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 334       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
