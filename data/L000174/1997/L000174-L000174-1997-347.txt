President, one of my duties as ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee is oversight of Immigration and Naturalization policy. It is a role to which I give the highest importance. My own grandparents came to the United States from Italy and Ireland for a better life.  I am pleased that on April 9 we will welcome another new citizen. Arturo Hale came to the United States from Mexico to attend the University of Minnesota, where he earned a doctorate in chemical engineering. He now works at Bell Laboratories, conducting research on optical fibers. I have had the pleasure of meeting Arturo on a few occasions. He has contributed to our Nation not only as a researcher and taxpayer, but as a caring, involved resident. He has shown that he accepts all the responsibilities of a citizen, and I am proud that he will now have the rights of a citizen as well.  On behalf of the Senate, I would like to welcome Arturo Hale as a citizen of the United States.                          ____________________
