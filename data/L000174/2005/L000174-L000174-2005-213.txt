President, I will tell the distinguished senior Senator from Missouri, first off, that he and the distinguished senior Senator from Washington State have been doing a wonderful job in moving this bill. It is a difficult bill. I know. I have watched it being put together in the Appropriations Committee. I know the two of them have worked extraordinarily hard. I mean to commend them, whether the distinguished Senator supports me and the Senator from Minnesota or not in our bipartisan amendment, number 2157, to restore funding to the Community Development Block Grants, Section 8 Housing Vouchers, and Public Housing Capital and Operating Funds. I think all of us should commend them for the work they have done and want to work with them to look for alternatives that will make our amendment acceptable to them. I suggest the absence of a quorum. I think the chairman will probably be pleased that I do.
