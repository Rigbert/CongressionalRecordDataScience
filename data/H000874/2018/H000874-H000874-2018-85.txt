Speaker, it would be inaccurate to say that this is a vote about process. It is a vote about substance.  In fact, Mr. Quigley's amendment is about one of the most pressing issues of our time. The Director of National Intelligence has said that there is a flashing red danger signal similar to the one that happened before 9/11.  This amendment responds by providing for us to partner with our States to slam the door in the face of the Russian bear or any other adversary who seeks to steal the integrity of our elections.  The flashing red light calls us to action. Surely we can rise above pandering to party and Putin to act on behalf of our freedom and our security.  We have sworn an oath to defend our Constitution and our liberty against all enemies foreign and domestic.  Mr. Speaker, you have the opportunity to do that today. Do so. Vote ``yes'' on this amendment for your country.
