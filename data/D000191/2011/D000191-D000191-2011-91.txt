Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Only inside the Washington, D.C. beltway could we be having this debate.  The taxpayers are demanding that we tighten our belts and save money. The Pentagon says, let's go ahead with the single engine procurement, which resulted from a competition, which is a quality engine.  Now, if that engine has problems, someone at the Pentagon should be fired. If there was problems with the original competition, a lot of people at the Pentagon should be fired. And maybe we ought to look at overhauling the procurement process.  But to say now, well, we've got a good engine. They want a competition. But we've got another company that really wishes it had won the competition but didn't win the competition, and now they still want to build an engine and the taxpayers should subsidize it, Which is what this is all about. It only costs $2.9 billion for them to develop an alternative engine. Only $2.9 billion. Inside the Washington, D.C. beltway that's not real money.  I guess the joke is, inside the Washington, D.C. beltway, how many jet engines does it take to fly a single engine fighter? Now, most Americans would think, well, that's probably not a joke, and it would be one. Right? No. It's two.  Now, if we need two on the ground, maybe we need two in the air. Maybe we ought to redesign the plane and put two engines in the tail, one from one company and one from the other. In case one flames out, we've got one left at least to bring the plane back. I mean, if we're so worried about reliability, maybe we just ought to start all over again. Come on, guys. Let's not be ridiculous here.  Two supply chains. Two sets of mechanics. Two sets of spare parts. Oh, wait a minute. This plane broke down over here and the mechanic there and the spare parts are for the other one. Oh, we've got to keep them sorted out by which engine they've got, where they are, where they'll fly in the world, what mission they'll go on, which mechanics we send, which supply chain we send for it.  No, this is not going to save money. This is not going to save money. If you did a crappy procurement, then fix it; but don't say let's do another procurement in the way the Pentagon always does things, which will inevitably be another cost overrun procurement.  So it won't only cost $2.9 billion to develop the alternative engine. We'll hear 6 months from now, a year from now, Oh, well, we thought we could develop an alternative for 2.9, but it will be 10. But don't worry. It will still bring down the overall cost.  Support this amendment. Support common sense. Stand up for the taxpayers, and stand up for the military which says we don't need a second engine for this plane. They are the guys who fly them.                              {time}  2040  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Rooney).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
