 President, I rise today to introduce the Farm and Ranch Risk Management Act of 1998. This bill gives farmers another tool to manage the risk of price and income fluctuations inherent in agriculture. It does this by encouraging farmers to save some of their income during good years and allowing the funds to supplement income during bad years. This new tool will more fully equip family farmers to deal with the vagaries of the marketplace.  Farming is a unique sector of the American economy. Although agriculture represents one-sixth of our Gross Domestic Product, it consists of hundreds of thousands of farmers across the nation. Many of whom operate small, family farms. These farms often support entire families, and even several generations of a family. And they work hard every day and produce the food consumed by the rest of the country, and around the world as well.  Yet farming remains one of the most perilous ways to make a living. The income of a farm family depends, in large part, on factors outside its control. Weather is one of those factors. For instance, I have heard on the Senatefloor recently that the income of North Dakota farmers dropped 98% last year because of flooding. Weather can totally wipe out a farmer. And, at best, weather can cause farmers' income to fluctuate wildly.  Another factor is the uncertainty of international markets. Iowa farmers now export 40% of all they produce. But what happens when European countries impose trade barriers on beef, pork and genetically-modified feed grain, as examples. And what happens when Asian governments devalue their currencies. Exports fall and farm income declines. Through no fault of the farmer, but because of decisions made in foreign countries.  Mr. President, the 1996 farm bill took planting decisions out of the hands of government bureaucrats and put them back into the hands of farmers. Farmers now have the ability to plant according to the demands of the market. The farmers I talk to are pleased with this change in philosophy. They would rather make their own decisions and rely on the market for their income, instead of the government.  But the sometimes volatile nature of commodity markets can make it difficult for family farmers to survive even a normal business cycle. When prices are high, farmers often pay so much of their income in taxes that they are unable to save anything. When prices drop again, farmers can be faced with liquidity problems. This bill allows farmers to manage their income, to smooth out the highs and lows of the commodity markets.  In that way, this bill is complementary with the philosophy of the new farm program. Business decisions are left in the hands of farmers, not bureaucrats at the Department of Agriculture, and not elected officials. The farmer decides whether to defer his income for later years. The farmer decides when to withdraw funds to supplement his operation.  Mr. President, I will take just a moment to explain how the bill works. Eligible farmers are allowed to make contributions to tax-deferred accounts, also known as FARRM accounts. The contributions are tax-deductible and limited to 20% of the farmer's taxable income for the year. The contributions are invested in cash or other interest-bearing obligations. The interest is taxed during the year it is earned.  The funds can stay in the account for up to five years. Upon withdrawal, the funds are taxed as regular income. If the funds are not withdrawn after five years, they are taxed as income and subject to an additional 10% penalty.  Essentially, the farmer is given a five-year window to manage his money in a way that is best for his own operation. The farmer can contribute to the account in good years and withdraw from the account when his income is low.  This bill helps the farmer help himself. It is not a new government subsidy for agriculture. It will not create a new bureaucracy purporting to help farmers. The bill simply provides farmers with a fighting chance to survive the down times and an opportunity to succeed when prices eventually increase.  Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues for supporting this bill, especially Senator Baucus, the lead Democratic cosponsor. I look forward to working with him on the Finance Committee to ensure passage of this important effort for our farmers.
