President, today I am introducing a bill to make the Impact Aid Program a Federal entitlement.  Over the past few years, the need for a change in the delivery of Impact Aid payments to eligible school districts has become increasingly clear. Impact Aid was originally designed to compensate a local school district for financial losses caused by a Federal presence in that district, whether due to a military base or to other designated Federal land in the community. Congress met its obligation and fully funded the program for the first twenty years of its existence. When the funding was cut in 1971, appropriations for Impact Aid were allocated for school districts according to a need-based formula. In subsequent years, multiple changes in the law have revised and further complicated both the formula and the additional factors that determine funding for each district. The result of these numerous revisions has been large payment disparities for the same types of students in different districts, as well as inherent flaws in reimbursements due to how school districts are defined in different states.  I have consistently defended increased appropriations for Impact Aid not only because it is a vital source of revenue for many local school districts, but also because it constitutes a clear-cut Federal responsibility. When the Federal Government's presence in a community detracts from the local tax base, which often comprises nearly 90 percent of local schools' funding, we must compensate for the lost funds. When we do not do so, the children suffer the consequences.  Despite increases in the past few years, Impact Aid remains substantially under-funded. We can no longer ignore the inequity this causes in educating our students. It is for this reason that I have introduced this bill today. When this legislation becomes law, Congress will be required to meet its obligation to the children and the schools that have been negatively impacted for so long. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting our local schools by permanently fully funding the Impact Aid program.                          ____________________
