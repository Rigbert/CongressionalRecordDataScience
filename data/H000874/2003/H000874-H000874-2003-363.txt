I would only observe that we certainly on this side, whatever happens in the Senate, would hope and expect that regular order would be followed and that a conference would occur in which the minority, both in the Senate and the House, for that matter, would have an opportunity to make its observations and opinions clear on either alternative, or portions of each.  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will yield further, we are always interested in protecting the rights of the minority.
