Mr. Chairman, this amendment assures that if a new quota becomes available in certain Alaska fisheries, a portion of it will be distributed to a vessel which currently has no qualifying catch history. This amendment corrects an inequity without taking quota from existing vessels. If no new quota is made available through the normal management process, then the additional vessel does not receive any quota.
