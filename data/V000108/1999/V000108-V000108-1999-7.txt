Speaker, the form of the resolution is as follows:       Calling upon the President to abstain from renegotiating      international agreements governing antidumping and      countervailing measures.       Whereas under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, the      Congress has power and responsibility with regard to foreign      commerce and the conduct of international trade negotiations;       Whereas the House of Representatives is deeply concerned      that, in connection with the World Trade Organization      Ministerial meeting to be held in Seattle, Washington, and      the multilateral trade negotiations expected to follow, a few      countries are seeking to circumvent the agreed list of      negotiation topics and reopen debate over the WTO's      antidumping and antisubsidy rules;       Whereas strong antidumping and antisubsidy rules are a      cornerstone of the liberal trade policy of the United States      and are essential to the health of the manufacturing and farm      sectors of the United States;       Whereas it has long been and remains the policy of the      United States to support its antidumping and antisubsidy laws      and to defend those laws in international negotiations;       Whereas the current absence of official negotiating      objectives on the statute books must not be allowed to      undermine the Congress' constitutional role in charting the      direction of United States trade policy;       Whereas under present circumstances, launching a      negotiation that includes antidumping and antisubsidy issues      would affect     the rights of the House and the integrity of its proceedings;       Whereas opening these rules to renegotiation could only      lead to weakening them, which would in turn lead to even      greater abuse of the world's open markets, particularly that      of the United States;       Whereas, conversely, avoiding another divisive fight over      these rules is the best way to promote progress on the other,      far more important issues facing the WTO members; and       Whereas it is, therefore, essential that negotiations on      these antidumping and antisubsidy matters not be reopened      under the auspices of the WTO or otherwise:       Now, therefore, be it resolved, That the House of      Representatives calls upon the President:       (1) not to participate in any international negotiation in      which antidumping or antisubsidy rules are part of the      negotiating agenda;       (2) to refrain from submitting for congressional approval      agreements that require changes to the current antidumping      and countervailing duty laws and enforcement policies of the      United States; and       (3) to enforce the antidumping and countervailing duty laws      vigorously in all pending and future cases.
