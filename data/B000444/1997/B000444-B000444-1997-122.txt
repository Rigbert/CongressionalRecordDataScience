 President, the Senator from North Carolina has been kind enough to give me the minute to respond.  The Lugar amendment does not have one single penny more in it than this bill. We do pay all of our allies the arrearages that we owe them with the bill in the way it is drawn up. The administration has supported this compromise we have come up with.  This basically is the way to get the job done. But I emphasize, there is not one additional penny in the Lugar amendment. There is no distinction in how we get paid. The principle is, should there be any conditions placed on the United Nations? This bill does place conditions they can meet. The Senator, on principle, says none shouldbe there. If you wish to put conditions at all, you should vote with us. If you want no conditions, vote with him. But it is the same amount of money.  I urge that you vote ``no'' on the Lugar amendment.
