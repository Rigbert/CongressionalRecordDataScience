 President, Bill Richardson has engaged in successful diplomacy with some of the world's most recalcitrant regimes and rebels. His humanitarian concern for individuals and his commitment to advance this country's interests have led him to countries like North Korea, Cuba, Iraq, Serbia, Nigeria, Burma, Haiti, and Sudan. My colleagues will recall that he negotiated the release of an American helicopter pilot in North Korea, three Red Cross workers in Sudan, and two Americans imprisoned in Iraq.  Two weeks ago, Congressman Richardson came before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and outlined how the United Nations should be used to advance American interests, while streamlining its bureaucracy and reforming its structure. I ask unanimous consent that his statement before the committee be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Statement by Representative William Richardson Before Senate Foreign                           Relations Committee       Mr. Chairman, distinguished Members of the Committee, it is      a pleasure to meet with you this morning. I would like to      begin by expressing my gratitude to President Clinton for      nominating me to this important and challenging position. I      am deeply honored by his trust and deeply conscious of the      fact that, if confirmed, I will be representing the United      States, and the interests and values of its people to the      world. This is a heavy responsibility that I do not undertake      lightly. But I assure you that, if I am confirmed, America      will have no more forceful advocate of its views and no more      forceful defender of its sovereign interests.       I would also like to thank you, Mr. Chairman, as well as      Senator Biden, for moving forward so expeditiously with my      nomination. I was very encouraged by the calls for bi-     partisan cooperation on U.S. foreign policy at Secretary      Albright's confirmation     hearing, and I look forward, if confirmed, to working with      you in the same spirit.       I also extend my appreciation to Senators Domenici and      Bingaman, and Representatives Gilman, Hamilton and Menendez,      for their kind introductions. It has been my privilege to      work with these distinguished individuals. In my tenure in      the Congress, I have also come to know a number of the      members of this Committee. I have seen how deeply committed      you are to advancing the interests of the America people. I      thank all of the members of the Committee for the courtesies      you have extended to me during the last few weeks.       I would like as well to express my great admiration and      respect for the work of my predecessor, whose resolve,      frankness, and just plain good sense made her four years at      the U.N. such a resounding success. If confirmed, I hope to      profit from her example and to work closely with her as a      member of the President's foreign policy team.       Finally, I wonder if I might take a brief moment to      introduce my wife Barbara.       Mr. Chairman, I am proud of my long-standing commitment to      public service. For seven terms in the House of      Representatives, I have sought to demonstrate that commitment      by serving my constituents and my country to the best of my      abilities. Those fourteen years of service, I believe,      provide me with a perspective and a sensitivity to issues      that will strengthen my working relationship with you, this      Committee, and the Congress.       We share a love for our nation and a determination to      preserve and strengthen America's global leadership, to      promote our goals of world peace and security. We want a      better world for our generation, our children's generation      and all those who follow.       The good news is that we live at a time of remarkable      promise. Our nation is at peace. Our economy is strong. And      our most fundamental beliefs are ascendant, as more countries      and peoples than ever before enjoy the advantages of open      societies and open markets. But we also face a host of      threats--from rogue states and the spread of weapons of mass      destruction to terrorism, drug trafficking and environmental      degradation--that can all too easily undermine our hard-won      gains and our hopes for the next century.       I believe the U.N. is at a crossroads--and so is America's      leadership in the institution. Both the U.N. and the U.S.      face fundamental choices: for the United Nations, to adapt      fully to new demands and changing times, or to suffer the      erosion of support from nations and peoples. For the United      States, the choice is to sustain our leadership in a      reformed, effective U.N. or lose our voice in an institution      that has helped us advance American interests for half a      century. The U.N. must do its part. But we too must make the      right choice. Let me explain why:       As a global power with global interests, the United States      must lead in seizing the opportunities and meeting the      challenges of this new era. And to lead, we must have all the      tools of leadership at our disposal. Sometimes, when our      vital interests are at stake, we have to be willing and able      to act alone. That's why we are determined to maintain a      strong military, and an assertive, well-funded diplomacy.       But the U.S. can't do everything; nor should we try. As      President Clinton has put it, ``we cannot sustain our      leadership or our goals for a better world alone.'' That is      why the U.N. is  essential: not as an independent actor on      the world stage, but as an instrument that helps us      mobilize the support of other nations for goals the      American people support. Without it, we would face, more      and more often, the stark choice between acting alone and      doing nothing.       I know there are some who question whether our      participation in the U.N. serves American interests. The      question is a fair one--but the answer is clear: America's      most fundamental interests are best served by our active,      hard-headed leadership in the U.N.; they will be set back if      we drop out--either in the literal sense or by failing to      shoulder our fair share of responsibilities.       The values that inform the U.N. Charter are also American      values; the Charter's sentiments and, in many ways, its very      words echo the ideals so familiar to generations of      Americans: ``to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights,      in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal      rights of men and women.'' This should be no surprise given      the role that Americans played in conceiving and drafting the      U.N. Charter.       But U.S. participation in the U.N. is not merely a question      of values. U.S. participation has made a positive difference      in meeting an extraordinary range of challenges around the      world. It enables us to build international support for our      foreign policy goals at a lower price; during the Gulf War,      this multiplier effect meant that the international community      shared the costs and responsibility of defeating Iraq. We see      peace in Cambodia, El Salvador, Angola, Namibia and      Mozambique thanks in no small part to the powerful      combination of effective U.S. leadership and sustained U.N.      engagement.       Mr. Chairman, I have seen for myself how the United Nations      can help us further America's interests: today, IAEA      inspectors help to verify that North Korea is living up to      its commitment not to produce nuclear weapons; in remote      parts of Sudan to which Americans have little or no access, I      have seen how U.N. affiliated organizations help protect and      feed the innocent victims of a terrible humanitarian      disaster. In Burma, I have seen how the nations of the world      at the U.N. General Assembly and led by the United States,      have brought hope to embattled democrats by justly condemning      a repressive regime.       As the President said last week, ``our well-being at home      depends on our engagement around the world.'' U.N. agencies      contribute to the safety and security of Americans; they even      protect U.S. jobs: the ICAO's aviation safety and security      standards disproportionately benefit Americans (who make up      40 percent of all international air travelers); labor      standards set by the ILO help ensure that U.S. exports remain      competitive overseas; trademark and copyright protections      overseen by the World Intellectual Property Organization      protect billions of dollars in U.S. exports of movies,      software, music, books, and industrial inventions; the FAO      and the WHO set international food product safety and quality      standards that benefit our agricultural exporters as well as      our consumers.       Increasingly, we use U.N. bodies to gain international      support for addressing such dangerous transnational scourges      as terrorism, crime, and narcotics trafficking. We work with      and through the U.N. to achieve our objectives on human      rights, the environment, and child labor--all issues of great      importance to the American people. The U.N. has helped bring      the world together in caring for refugees, feeding starving      children, eradicating smallpox and battling AIDS. If we can      maintain our leadership within the organization, this will      continue to be so.       During the last several years, Secretary Albright worked      tirelessly on U.N. reform, and she produced results: a new      Secretary General was appointed, committed to accelerate the      pace and widen the scope of reform; the U.N. was persuaded to      adopt no-growth budgets--both currently and for the      foreseeable future--and to reduce the number of people      working in the U.N. Secretariat by several hundred.      Furthermore, we have persuaded the regional economic      commissions to begin initial re-prioritizing, and we have      taken at least the first steps toward streamlining the      specialized agencies.       Make no mistake, the U.N. has serious problems to surmount.      There should, for example, be better coordination of its      activities, consolidation of related programs and bodies, and      elimination of redundancies and low-priority activities. The      specialized agencies must learn to live within their means.      And the whole U.N. system must take a page from the business      community's handbook and learn to do more with less. The      High-Level Working Group on U.N. reform proposed by President      Clinton at the 49th General Assembly to address key economic,      social and administrative issues has made little progress,      and changes so far at the specialized agencies have been ad      hoc and tentative.       Secretary General Kofi Annan has publicly committed himself      to achieving the kind of reform that will make the U.N. more      effective. His appointment presents us with an opportunity to      push for reform and solve our arrears problems. He appears      receptive to changing the way the U.N. operates; in his      public remarks since being appointed he has stressed the need      to make the U.N. ``leaner, more efficient and more      effective.'' I know his words have been applauded up here on      the Hill and I was very encouraged by the series of meetings      he held last week here in Washington--in particular by his      meeting with you, Mr. Chairman, and members of the committee.      His job will be a difficult one, but with will and effort, it      can be done. If confirmed, I will press relentlessly to make      sure that reforms are undertaken, both in the U.N. and the      specialized agencies, and that our priorities are key factors      in U.N. decision-making. At the same time, I'll ask your      support for America's leadership in the U.N.--and for      fulfilling the commitments that will enable us to lead.       Mr. Chairman, as a member of Congress, I know perfectly      well that while our constituents want to see America involved      in the world, they are not interested in seeing tax dollars      wasted on programs that are inconsistent with American      interests or values. A central part of my job will be to make      this reality absolutely clear to the U.N. and its 184 other      members.       In four years, I hope this Administration will be able to      say that by working with you and other key committees in      Congress we: Helped the U.N. and its specialized agencies      make the transition to smaller and more efficient      organizations; put our U.N. assessments on a sustainable      financial footing that preserves U.S. influence within the      U.N. system; paid America's debt to the U.N.; and rebuilt      bipartisan support in the United States for continued      American leadership within and through the U.N.       To accomplish these far-reaching changes, we envision a      reform package consisting of five elements: Maintaining at      least zero growth in the U.N. budget, streamlining the U.N.      Secretariat in terms of personnel and organizational      structure, streamlining the U.N.'s ``big three'' affiliated      agencies: the Food and Agriculture Organization, the      International Labor Organization, and the World Health      Organization, negotiating lower U.S. scales of assessment for      the U.N. regular budget, the budgets of affiliated agencies,      and the U.N. peacekeeping budget, and negotiating the kind of      Security Council reform that preserves its efficiency and      protects the prerogatives of the current Permanent Members,      while adding Germany and Japan.       To see these reforms implemented, however, I will need the      help of the Congress.     The administration is prepared--even eager--to work with you      to help achieve our U.N. goals. But our efforts are      increasingly hampered by international resentment over our      arrears. As the U.N. cleans its house, we must do our part.      Our U.N. debt continues to hurt our efforts to press for      reform and damages our influence in the U.N. and its      affiliated agencies. The United States needs to get out of      debt and stay out of debt. As the President said just last      week ``We cannot expect to lead through the United Nations      unless we pay what we owe.''       For that reason, at the same time as I make America's case      at the U.N. I will be making the case to the Congress and the      American people that a reformed, effective U.N. serves our      interests in concrete ways and that our arrears have harmed      our ability to press for reform. As Secretary Christopher      used to say, ``we can't reform and retreat at the same      time.''       Clearly, the Administration and the Congress must work      together on a bipartisan basis to advance U.S. interests      through a reformed United Nations. In addition to my      commitment to pressing for U.N. reform, I also pledge to you      to make every effort to reinforce the unfailing commitment of      the American people to democracy and human rights around the      world.       I believe that one of my highest responsibilities will be      to confer, cooperate, and consult with the Congress across      the board on the widest range of U.N.-related issues, both in      Washington and in New York. If confirmed, I will welcome your      advice, Mr. Chairman, and that of every member of this      Committee and of the Congress. I extend to you individually      and collectively a standing invitation to come to New York      and see for yourselves what we are doing there. My door will      always be open.       On one thing we can all agree: the U.N. can and must do      better and since we are part of the U.N. we must together be      part of the solution. If, with your consent, I am confirmed,      I can pledge to you that you will find no one more committed      to getting the job done.       Thank you very much.
