Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I recognize the Gary Chamber of Commerce as the organization celebrates the 6th annual Lakeshore Classic basketball tournament. In honor of this historic event, the Gary Chamber of Commerce is hosting a celebratory event and basketball tournament on Friday, November 29 and Saturday, November 30 at the Genesis Convention Center in Gary, Indiana.   The Lakeshore Classic will not only recall a remarkable moment in basketball history but will also remind us of the profound effect it had on society for generations to come. In 1955, the Indianapolis Crispus Attucks High School and the Gary Roosevelt High School basketball teams faced off in an astonishing game that left the sport of basketball changed forever. It was the first time in the history of our nation that two African American highschool teams would compete for a state championship. The game was historic and extraordinary, setting records that would remain for decades. The final score, 97 to 74, would make history as the most collective points ever scored in a championship game.   At the time, the impassioned players who participated in this game may have been thought of as the ``forgotten Hoosiers'' but are today honored with great prestige and have left an indelible mark on the game of basketball. I would like to take this time to recognize the members of the historic 1955 Gary Roosevelt team that have inspired the Lakeshore Classic. Those deceased, Maurice Everett, Arthester McCruiston, Johnnie Ford, Charles Ford, James Guyden, Vann Ligon, James Eubanks and Coach John D. Smith have since passed on, but their contributions will never be forgotten. Surviving members include Wilson ``Jake'' Eison, Jerome Morgan, Randolph Williams, Jerome Ward and Dr. Dick Barnett.   Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in recognizing the Gary Chamber of Commerce, the organizers and sponsors of the 6th annual Lakeshore Classic, and the players who inspired the event. Their noteworthy commitment, leadership, and contributions have inspired generations to come. For enriching the quality of life in Northwest Indiana and throughout the country, they are to be commended.                          ____________________
