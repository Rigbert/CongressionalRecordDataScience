Just to respond briefly, the gentleman raised the potential for fraud or misusing the vouchers as food stamps are often misused or at times misused.  I would submit to you that cash lends itself to misuse to a greater degree than a voucher. The voucher would be harder to sell and to peddle on some kind of black market than the misuse of cash. So we would be more apt to target the money towards the child with the voucher.  Mr. McDERMOTT. Reclaiming my time, that is a value judgment about these young women which I do not think you have a right to make. I do not think you have any evidence to support that.
