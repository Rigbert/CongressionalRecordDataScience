This is a nomination that should not have taken the Senate 5 months to consider--5 months--after it was reported by the Judiciary Committee on a strong bipartisan vote of 16 to 3. The Republicans who voted for him: Senator Hatch, Senator Kyl, Senator Graham, and Senator Cornyn--are not people who are apt to give an easy pass to somebody who is not qualified.  In fact, he is a well-respected judge who has served for 14 years on the Federal bench as a district court judge; and before that, 8 years as a Maryland State court judge.  Then, for an impartial review of who this person is--not a partisan review but an impartial review--the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary rated his nomination ``well-qualified.'' That is the highest rating they can give to anybody. So there is no surprise Judge Davis enjoys the strong support of his home State Senators: Senator Mikulski and Senator Cardin. In fact, Senator Cardin chaired his confirmation hearing back on April 21, and he has been a strong advocate for Senate action on his nomination.  While it is not surprising, it is nonetheless disappointing the Senate has been prevented from considering this nomination for 5 months by Republican objections. I am not surprised because Senate Republicans began this year threatening to filibuster President Obama's judicial nominations before he had made a single one. They have followed through with that threat by obstructing and stalling the process, delaying for months the confirmation of well-qualified, consensus nominees. Last week, the Senate was finally allowed to consider the nomination of Judge Irene Berger, who has now been confirmed as the first African-American Federal judge in the history of West Virginia. The Republican minority delayed consideration of her nomination for more than 3 weeks after it was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee. When her nomination finally came to a vote, it was approved by an overwhelming vote of 97-0. That follows the pattern that Republicans have followed all year with respect to President Obama's nominations. I expect Judge Davis to be confirmed by a bipartisan majority, but only after a 5-month stall.  Last year, with a Democratic majority, the Senate reduced circuit court vacancies to as low as 9 and judicial vacancies overall to as low as 34, even though it was the last year of President Bush's second term and a presidential election year. That was the lowest number of circuit court vacancies in decades, since before Senate Republicans began stalling Clinton nominees and grinding confirmations to a halt. In the 1996 session, the Republican-controlled Senate confirmed only 17 judges and not a single circuit court nominee. Because of those delays and pocket filibusters, judicial vacancies grew to over 100, and circuit vacancies rose into the mid-thirties.  When I served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee during President Bush's first term, I did my best to stop this downward spiral that had affected judicial confirmations. Throughout my chairmanship, I made sure to treat President Bush's judicial nominees better than Republicans had treated President Clinton's nominees. In fact, during the 17 months I chaired the Judiciary Committee in President Bush's first term, we confirmed 100 of his judicial nominees. At the end of his Presidency, although Republicans had run the Judiciary Committee for more than half his tenure, more of his judicial nominees were confirmed when I was the chairman than in the more than 4 years when Republicans were in charge.  Instead of building on that progress, Senate Republicans are intent on turning back the clock to the abuses they engaged in during their years of resistance to President Clinton's moderate and mainstream judicial nomination. The delays and inaction we are seeing now from Republican Senators in considering the nominees of another Democratic President are regrettably familiar. Their tactics have resulted in a sorry record of judicial confirmations this year--less than a handful--with 10 judicial nominees currently stalled on the Senate Executive Calendar.  By November 9 in the first year of the Presidency of George W. Bush, the Senate had confirmed 17 circuit and district court judges, four circuit court nominees and 13 district court nominees. By contrast, Judge Davis is only the second circuit court nomination Republicans have allowed to be considered all year. When his nomination is confirmed, it will only bring the total to five--less than one third of what we had accomplished by this time in 2001. I know because in the summer of 2001, I began serving as the chair of the Judiciary Committee. We achieved those results with a controversial and confrontational Republican President after a mid-year change to a Democratic majority in the Senate. We did so in spite of the attacks of September 11; despite the anthrax-laced letters sent to the Senate that closed our offices; and while working virtually around the clock on the PATRIOT Act for 6 weeks. By comparison, this year, the Republican minority has this year allowed action on only four judicial nominations to the Federal circuit and district courts. Judge Davis will be the fifth, and only the second circuit court judge.  Now we face this. Look at the chart I have in the Chamber. It is outrageous what is happening, the few nominees they are allowing through. This is not for lack of qualified nominees. There are 10 such nominees who have been reported by the Judiciary Committee on the Senate Executive Calendar. Had those nominations been considered in the normal course we would be on the pace I set in 2001 when fairly considering the nominations of our last Republican President.  Even though as Democrats we treated President Bush far more fairly than they had treated President Clinton, even though we tried to turn back the clock from when there were 60 judges Republicans pocket-filibustered during President Clinton's time, even though in 17 months Democrats confirmed 100 of President Bush's nominations, it looks as though, as far as President Obama is concerned: President Obama nominates them, then they have tostall them. Rather than continued progress, we see Senate Republicans resorting to their bag of procedural treats to delay and obstruct. They have ratcheted up the partisanship and seek to impose ideological litmus tests.  The obstruction and delays in considering President Obama's nominations is especially disappointing given the extensive efforts of President Obama to turn away from the divisive approach taken by the previous administration. He has reached out to Members of both parties to select mainstream, well-qualified nominees. I have been at some of those meetings. I know the job he has done in reaching out to both Democrats and Republicans.  In a recent column, Professor Carl Tobias wrote about President Obama's approach:       Obama has emphasized bipartisan outreach, particularly by      soliciting the advice of Democratic and Republican Judiciary      Committee members, and of high-level party officials from the      states where vacancies arise, and by doing so before final      nominations. Obama has gradually, but steadily, put forward      his nominees, typically naming a few on the same day. This      approach compares favorably with the approach of the two      prior administrations, which often submitted large packages      on the eve of Senate recesses, thus complicating felicitous      confirmation. To date, Obama has nominated 23 well-qualified      consensus candidates, who are diverse in terms of ethnicity,      gender and ideology. This is sufficient quantitatively and      qualitatively to foster prompt confirmation.  I will ask that a copy of Professor Tobias's column be printed in the Record following my statement.  Professor Tobias makes this point well and it is substantiated by the bipartisan support from Republican home State Senators for the President's nominees. Indeed, since he made these observations the President has nominated two North Carolinians for vacancies on the Fourth Circuit after consulting with both Senator Hagan and Senator Burr.  His first nomination of Judge David Hamilton of Indiana to the Seventh Circuit came to the Senate with the strong endorsement of Senator Lugar, the senior Republican in the Senate. Senator Lugar praised the ``thoughtful, cooperative, merit-driven'' process he and Senator Bayh took in consulting on that nomination. Despite the bipartisan endorsement from his home State Senators, Judge Hamilton's nomination is the subject of a Republican filibuster and has been stalled since it was reported to the Senate in June.  Federal judicial vacancies, which had been cut in half while George W. Bush was President have already more than doubled since last year. There are now 98 vacancies on our Federal circuit and district courts, including 22 circuit court vacancies. Justice should not be delayed or denied to any American because of overburdened courts, but that is the likely result of the stalling and obstruction.  Despite the fact that Senate Republicans had pocket filibustered President Clinton's circuit court nominees, Senate Democrats opposed only the most extreme of President Bush's ideological nominees and worked to reduce judicial vacancies. That had led to a reduction in vacancies in nearly every circuit during President Bush's administration. One of the circuits where we succeeded in reducing vacancies was the Fourth Circuit, the circuit to which Judge Davis has been nominated.  After Senate Republicans had refused to consider any of President Clinton's four Fourth Circuit nominees from North Carolina, vacancies on the Fourth Circuit had risen to five. All four of President Clinton's nominees from North Carolina to the Fourth Circuit were blocked from consideration by the Republican Senate majority. These outstanding nominees included United States District Court Judge James Beaty, Jr., United States Bankruptcy Judge J. Richard Leonard, Professor Elizabeth Gibson, and North Carolina Court of Appeals Judge James Wynn. Had either Judge Beaty or Judge Wynn been considered and confirmed, he would have been the first African-American judge appointed to the Fourth Circuit. The failure to proceed on those nominations was never explained. Indeed, Senate Republicans refused to consider any of President Clinton's highly qualified circuit court nominations from any of its States in the Fourth Circuit during the last 3 years of his administration. That resulted in five continuing vacancies.  What followed was an effort by President Bush to pack the Fourth Circuit with ideologues. He nominated a political operative from Virginia for a vacancy in Maryland who was caught stealing from a local store and pleaded guilty to fraud. There was his highly controversial nomination of William ``Jim'' Haynes II to the Fourth Circuit who as general counsel at the Department of Defense was an architect of many discredited policies on torture and who never fulfilled the pledge he made to me under oath at his hearing to supply the materials he discussed in an extended opening statement regarding his role in developing these policies and their purported legal justifications.  Mr. Haynes nomination led the Richmond Times-Dispatch to write an editorial in late 2006 entitled ``No Vacancies,'' about President Bush's counterproductive approach to nominations in the Fourth Circuit. The editorial criticized the administration for pursuing political fights at the expense of filling vacancies. According to the Richmond Times-Dispatch:       The president erred by renominating . . . and may be      squandering his opportunity to fill numerous other vacancies      with judges of right reason.  President Bush insisted on nominating and renominating Terrence Boyle, despite the fact that as a sitting U.S. district judge and while a circuit court nominee, Judge Boyle ruled on multiple cases involving corporations in which he held investments. President Bush should have heeded the call of North Carolina Police Benevolent Association, the North Carolina Troopers' Association, the Police Benevolent Associations from South Carolina and Virginia, the National Association of Police Organizations, the Professional Fire Fighters and the Paramedics of North Carolina. Law enforcement officers from North Carolina and across the country opposed to the Boyle nomination. Civil rights groups opposed the nomination. Those knowledgeable and respectful of judicial ethics opposed the nomination. Ultimately, President Bush withdrew the Boyle nomination.  I mention these ill-advised nominations because so many Republican partisans seem to have forgotten the reasons these ideological nominations did not proceed.  We did break the logjam in North Carolina. I worked to break through the impasse and to confirm Judge Allyson Duncan of North Carolina to the Fourth Circuit when President Bush nominated her. From the summer of 2001 through 2002, I presided over the consideration and confirmation of three Fourth Circuit judges nominated by President Bush. And in the Presidential election year of 2008, one of the final appellate court judges confirmed by the Senate was another Fourth Circuit nominee. Despite the confrontational approach taken by President Bush and additional retirements on the Fourth Circuit, we ended up reducing the vacancies on the Fourth Circuit during the course of his administration.  Despite our good efforts, the right wing seems intent on repeating its mistakes of the past and obstructing President Obama's nominees to the Fourth Circuit. That appears to be why Judge Davis has been delayed for months. That appears to be why they are resisting consideration of the nomination of Justice Barbara Keenan from Virginia. And that appears to be why following the announcement last week of the nominations of Judge James Wynn and Judge Albert Diaz to Fourth Circuit vacancies, the head of a right wing group urged Republican Senators to obstruct the nominees saying: ``I will predict . . . that life will not be made easy for these two nominees'' the same way when the heads of the Republican Party said they should block Eric Holder for Attorney General, and they did. They delayed him for weeks. Finally, when we did get to vote, he got more votes than any of the last four Attorneys General.  The Senate is finally being allowed to consider Judge Davis's nomination. He has had a long and distinguished legal career. During the last 14 years, he served as Federal district judge in Maryland. He has been a State judge. He has been a Federal prosecutor. He received his bachelor's degree from the University of Pennsylvania. He graduated cum laude with his JD from theUniversity of Maryland School of Law, where he still teaches classes as an adjunct faculty member.  I congratulate Judge Davis and his family on what I know will be his confirmation. I apologize to him for these unnecessary delays for such a very fine man. I applaud the senior Senator from Maryland, Ms. Mikulski, and my Senate partner from Maryland, Mr. Cardin, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, for their work.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the article by Professor Tobias to which I referred be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:   With Obama Proceeding Reasonably To Fill Federal Judgeships, the                         Bottleneck Is the Senate                            (By Carl Tobias)       A growing drumbeat of commentary has recently criticized      President Barack Obama for not acting quickly enough to fill      the 96 present vacancies on the federal appellate and      district courts. However, as I shall explain, closer      evaluation of the record compiled by President Obama shows      that these criticisms are actually unwarranted, and that      responsibility should more properly be assigned elsewhere. In      particular, blame should now be placed at the Senate's door.            Obama's Approach: Generally a Wise and Good One       Many observers have voiced numerous criticisms of Obama      Administration judicial selection. Some have suggested that      the President should nominate candidates more swiftly and in      greater numbers. Others have criticized the nominees' age      (saying they are too old), experience (saying there are too      many judges among them), and ideological perspectives (saying      they are too liberal or, in some instances, too      conservative). A few observers have also compared the number      of nominees (23) whom Obama has submitted with the number      (95) whom President George W. Bush had submitted at the      identical juncture of his administration.       Yet careful analysis of Obama's record shows that these      criticisms lack merit. Before Obama won the election, he had      already started planning for appointments. And when he was      elected, Obama quickly installed as White House Counsel      Gregory Craig, a respected attorney with much pertinent      expertise, who immediately enlisted several talented lawyers      to identify judicial designees. The administration also      capitalized on Vice President Joseph Biden's four decades of      Senate Judiciary Committee experience in the nomination      process. Accordingly, the selection group anticipated and      carefully addressed contingencies that might arise when      choosing judges. For example, it compiled ``short lists'' of      excellent candidates for possible Supreme Court vacancies,      should one arise.       Obama has emphasized bipartisan outreach, particularly by      soliciting the advice of Democratic and Republican Judiciary      Committee members, and of high-level party officials from the      states where vacancies arise, and by doing so before final      nominations. Obama has gradually, but steadily, put forward      his nominees, typically naming a few on the same day. This      approach compares favorably with the approach of the two      prior administrations, which often submitted large packages      on the eve of Senate recesses, thus complicating felicitous      confirmation. To date, Obama has nominated 23 well-qualified      consensus candidates, who are diverse in terms of ethnicity,      gender and ideology. This is sufficient quantitatively and      qualitatively to foster prompt confirmation.       Often before, and invariably following, nominations, the      administration and senators have cooperated. To facilitate      approval of nominees, Obama worked closely with Senators      Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the Judiciary Committee chair, who      schedules hearings and votes, and Harry Reid (D-Nev.), the      Majority Leader, who arranges floor consideration, and      their GOP analogues, Senators Jeff Sessions (Ala.) and      Mitch McConnell (Ky.).       Thus, the committee has swiftly assessed nominees, with      thorough questionnaires and hearings and prompt votes.      Indeed, Leahy convened hearings so fast that GOP members      complained they lacked sufficient preparation time, and he      quite reasonably responded with another session for a      nominee. The Real Problem Here Lies More with the GOP Senate Minority Than the                                President       The Democratic panel majority, thus, has expedited review,      but the Republican minority has delayed processing. For      instance, it routinely delays committee votes for a week with      no or minimal explanation.       This recently happened with four California District Court      nominees, three of whom the panel then unanimously approved.      And, last week, Senator Sessions held over Virginia Supreme      Court Justice Barbara Keenan, even though he had praised the      jurist's qualifications at her hearing two weeks earlier and      despite the fact that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the      Fourth Circuit, to which she was nominated, desperately needs      more judges, as the court is operating with five of its 15      judgeships vacant. In fairness, yesterday, Sessions explained      that Keenan's responses to some GOP written questions were      inadequate, but that she promptly furnished more complete      answers that were satisfactory, again lauded the jurist as a      ``fine nominee,'' and supported the panel decision to vote      her out without objection.       The committee has approved 14 federal court nominees, and      the real bottleneck has been Senate floor action. Of those 14      nominees, only five have received floor debate and      confirmation; nine are pending without GOP consent to      consider them. Senator Reid has attempted to cooperate with      Senator McConnell and Republicans--but to no avail. For      example, McConnell insisted that the Senate consider no lower      court nominees until it had confirmed Supreme Court Justice      Sonia Sotomayor, which delayed the process until September.       The unanimous consent procedure allows one senator to stop      the entire body, and anonymous holds have delayed specific      nominees' consideration. Reid has been reluctant to employ      cloture, which forces votes, mainly because this practice      wastes valuable floor time. However, on Tuesday, Reid took      the unusual step of invoking cloture to secure a floor vote      on Southern District of West Virginia Judge Irene Berger. She      is the third uncontroversial judicial nominee on whom Reid      has been forced to seek cloture. Indeed, the GOP has      ratcheted up the stakes with the unprecedented action of      placing holds on noncontroversial nominees.      Obama's Nomination Record Thus Far Is Strong Given Unusual                              Circumstances       The fact that Obama has nominated only 23 persons thus far      to fill federal judgeships is not attributable to the White      House or the Senate majority. Nor is the fact that of these,      the Senate has confirmed only four lower court nominees.      Justice David Souter's May resignation meant that filling his      vacancy was a top priority, and that process consumed three      months, during which lower court selection had to be      temporarily frozen. The administration has, of course, also      encountered the ``start-up'' costs of instituting a new      government. Cabinet appointments consumed months, and the      Senate has yet to confirm several Assistant Attorneys General      nominees and many of the 93 U.S. Attorney nominees. There has      also been a pressing need for the Obama Administration to      address myriad intractable complications left by earlier      administrations, such as the deep, continuing recession;      Guantanamo; and the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts.       For all these reasons, recent criticisms of President Obama      for submitting judicial nominees too slowly are unfounded.      Nor should the Senate Judiciary Committee majority be blamed:      The panel majority has expedited its nominee processing, but      the minority's virtually automatic reliance on holds has      caused some delay. The true bottleneck, however, has been the      nearly complete lack of floor consideration.       Senate Republicans must stop delaying floor action on the      President's well-qualified nominees--nominees who typically      have the blessing of the relevant states' senators. And, if      Republicans in the Senate continue to delay, Senate Democrats      should invoke cloture and related practices that will      facilitate expeditious approval of Obama's nominees.
