 President, today I wish to offer my congratulations to an outstanding young man and athlete, the University of Louisville Cardinals' quarterback, Lamar Jackson. On December 10 of last year, Cards fans watched with excitement as Jackson was awarded the Heisman Memorial Trophy, the first in the history of my alma mater. The award is given to the most outstanding player in college football, and Jackson surely has earned it.  We have known for quite some time that Lamar Jackson would be breaking many records. Here are just a few. Jackson was the first player in NCAA Division I history to pass for 3,300 yards and run for 1,500 yards in one season. He holds the Atlantic Coastal Conference, ACC, record for most touchdowns in a single season with 51. Only a sophomore, Jackson is the youngest player ever to win the Heisman Trophy at 19 years old, and he is the University of Louisville's first ever Heisman Trophy finalist. The impressive list goes on and on.  It is clear that Lamar Jackson is a truly spectacular athlete. He has earned his spot in the pantheon of college football greats. It is easy to cheer when the quarterback hurdles a defender to score or runs between some of the best defenses in the Nation. His drive and dedication are traits we all admire, and just wait until you hear where it all started.  In an interview, Jackson said ``[e]verything I do, I do for my mother.'' At an early age, Jackson's mother, Felicia Jones, sparked his interest in football, and she pushed him to be his best ever since. When Lamar and his younger brother were just learning the game, their mom would put on pads in the backyard and run plays with them. She became an active part of all of his teams, all the way to the University of Louisville. He said, ``She would tell me the bad things I did. She wouldn't really tell me the good things I did. And I'd say `All right, Mom. I've got to go fix it.'''  Lamar Jackson's story is just beginning. Under the guidance of some of the best coaches in all of college sports and an athletic director with a strategic vision for the future, the Cardinals are positioned to make a real impact in college football. With the Heisman Trophy already on the shelf, we can only wait and see what Lamar Jackson does next year. As an avid fan of UofL football, I know I can hardly wait.  I would like to join with Cards fans across the Nation to congratulate the entire University of Louisville Cardinals football team and staff on an exciting season and especially congratulate the 2016 Heisman Trophy winner, Lamar Jackson. He has truly made it great to be a Louisville Cardinal.                          ____________________
