President, the recent shootings outside a school in Jonesboro, Arkansas, that left four young students and a teacher dead and scores of others wounded in both body and mind are shocking. Just over the last few months, we have seen deadly shootings carried out by juveniles in rural communities in Kentucky, in Mississippi and now in Arkansas. Clearly, juvenile crime is not just an urban problem. These shootings leave scars on the loved ones of those killed and injured and on the communities involved that take a long time to heal.  We may never fully comprehend how such crimes against children could be executed by other children. But one thing should be clear: The issue of juvenile crime should not be used for cheap grandstanding or short-sighted political gain. We need to find constructive approaches to this problem that builds upon past successes and respects the proper roles of State, local and Federal authorities.  In the last session, and again at the beginning of this session, I have spoken about the need to address the nation's juvenile crime problem on a bipartisan basis. Politicizing the juvenile crime problem does a disservice to the citizens in this country who want constructive responses.  I have spoken about the need to address the flaws in the juvenile crime bill, S. 10, which the Judiciary Committee voted on last summer. In floor statements and in the extensive minority views included in the Committee report, I have outlined those areas in which this bill needs significant improvement.  In short, the bill reported by the Committee to the Senate would mandate massive changes in the juvenile justice systems in each of our States, and it would invite an influx of juvenile cases in Federal courts around the country. The repercussions of this legislation would be severe for any State seeking federal juvenile justice assistance. The bill also removes core protections that have been in pace for 25 years to keep juvenile offenders out of adult jails and away from the harmful influences of seasoned adult criminals.  The need for significant improvements to this bill is no secret. Virtually every editorial board to consider the bill has reached the same conclusion. Just in recent days, the Philadelphia Inquirer concluded that the bill ``is fatally flawed and should be rejected.'' On Monday, March 23, the Los Angeles Times described the bill as ``peppered with ridiculous poses and penalties'' and taking a ``rigid, counterproductive approach.'' The Chattanooga Times, on March 14, labeled the bill ``misguided'' with ``flaws so far-reaching that the bill requires substantial surgery.'' The Houston Chronicle, on March 10, observed that this bill ``at the very least, needs serious rethinking.'' The Legal Times, on March 2, called S. 10 ``the crime bill no one likes.'' The St. Petersburg Times, on February 23, described the bill as ``an amalgam of bad and dangerous ideas.'' A February 10 opinion piece in the Baltimore Sun described S. 10 as a ``radical'' and ``aberrant bill.''  The criticisms leveled at S. 10 are, unfortunately, well-deserved. Consequently, eight months after this bill was voted out of Committee, the Committee held a belated hearing on some of the new controversial mandates in the bill. At that hearing, on March 9, Senator Sessions announced a number of changes that he planned to make to the new juvenile record-keeping and fingerprinting mandates in the bill. I had recommended a number of these changes during Judiciary Committee mark-up of the bill, and I am pleased that, finally, my cautions are being heeded.  I will be glad to see removed the requirement of photographing every juvenile upon arrest for an act that would have been a felony if committed by an adult, and the new fingerprinting and record-keeping mandates limited to felony acts that occur in the future.  I continue to oppose the imposition of these new requirements as mandates. These mandates will cost States more to implement than they can hope to receive in federal assistance. Those who believe that $250 million over 5 years, or $50 million per year, will be sufficient to pay for the record-keeping mandates in S. 10 have not studied the comprehensive report recently released by the National Center for Juvenile Justice and that the bill, as currently drafted, would cost the states far more than that, especially through its new fingerprinting and record-keeping mandates.  Many of the States are way ahead of the federal government in finding innovative ways to address juvenile crime and need resource assistance, and not bullying, from Washington. They need help to do what they decide is the right balance.  While it is a better practice to hold hearings and examine issues before legislation is voted on and reported out of committee, I look forward to working with Senators Hatch and Sessions to improve this package, now that the bill has been reported but finds itself off the main track and stalled on a siding. I again urge the sponsors of this legislation not to politicize the important issue of juvenile crime but to work in an open, fair and bipartisan way to make S. 10 a better bill that will truly do what we all say we want it do to: Reduce youth crime.                          ____________________
