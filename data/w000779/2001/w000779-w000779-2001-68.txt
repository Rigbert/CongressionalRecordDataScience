Naming the Eugene courthouse in the city that Wayne Morse loved and called home would be an appropriate way to honor the independence and integrity of our former Senate colleague.  I find it especially fitting to be here today to honor one of the Senate's great independents. Without going into too much detail of the last few months of the Senate's history, the act of moving one's seat on the Senate floor is not a new concept, and Wayne Morse may have done it most famously.  In January 1953, Senator Morse walked into this very Chamber carrying a folding chair that he would place in the center of the aisle, thereby removing himself from either major party as an Independent. Again in 1956, he moved his chair to become a Democrat. He was subsequently overwhelmingly re-elected by the voters of Oregon. The independence displayed by Senator Morse throughout his 24-year service in the Senate was always rewarded by Oregonians who showed their continuing faith in his ability to truly represent their interests, no matter their party label.  It would benefit us all to follow the principles Wayne Morse lived by in politics today. Senator Morse would have had little sympathy for the world of the sound byte. Wayne Morse did not just talk; he worked on the issues that our citizens care about most: education; resources; health care; and justice for all. To paraphrase an old saying, he was ``unbought and unbossed.'' He, instead, set the bar for integrity and truly embodied the Oregon spirit. I can't imagine a better tribute to Senator Morse's independence and integrity than to name a United States courthouse to honor his legacy.  Senator Morse never forgot where he came from. He could never wait to return to his house in Eugene, at 595 Crest Drive, an address I remember well because I worked as a campaign aide for two of his Senate Campaigns. It was during this time that he got me interested in working with the elderly and started me in public service, which ultimately led me here to the Senate floor. I was given the high honor of being elected to serve in the Senate seat he had held more than 30 years after he was last reelected by the people of Oregon.  Known as the ``Tiger of the Senate'' for his eloquently outspoken and vigorously independent views, Senator Morse worked diligently on the behalf of the American family. He pushed the Senate to improve education and create a better future for American children by passing the New Frontier and Great Society bills, supporting federal aid to public schools and universities, and implementing scholarship programs for low-income students.  It is, therefore, only right that the Federal courthouse that we will build in Eugene, OR be named after Senator Morse. This courthouse will represent his respect for the law, his love for that city, and the future he envisaged for the people of his home State. Naming this courthouse after Senator Wayne Morse will promote and honor the legacy of Oregon's illustrious, maverick leader.  I am especially pleased to be joined by my colleague from Oregon, Senator Smith, in introducing this bipartisan legislation to designate the new Eugene Federal courthouse as the Wayne Lyman Morse Federal Courthouse. I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation.                          ____________________
