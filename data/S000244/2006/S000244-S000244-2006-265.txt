Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4772, the Private Property Rights Implementation Act, to help all Americans defend their property rights.  We are all painfully aware of one Supreme Court decision that threatens to deny Americans their constitutionally protected property rights. I refer to the notorious case of Kelo vs. The City of New London, in which the Supreme Court held that a city can take private property from one citizen and give it to a large corporation for ``economic development'' purposes. I led the charge to correct that terrible decision by introducing H.R. 4128, which passed the House of Representatives by the overwhelming bipartisan margin of 376-38. However, that bill now languishes in the other body despite overwhelming popular support.  Unfortunately, the Supreme Court's recent disregard for constitutionally protected private property is not confined to the Kelo decision. In the case of Williamson County v. Hamilton Bank, which was reaffirmed last term in the case of San Remo Hotel v. City and County of San Francisco, the Supreme Court upheld a set of procedural rules that effectively prohibit property owners from ever getting into Federal court to have their Federal property rights claims heard on the merits. I applaud the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) for authoring this vital legislation which will allow property owners to finally have their Federal property rights protected by the Federal courts.  This bipartisan legislation was reported out of the House Judiciary Committee by a voice vote on July 12, and I hope that this bill will receive similar bipartisan support on the floor today.  I urge my colleagues to defend the private property rights of all Americans by supporting this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
