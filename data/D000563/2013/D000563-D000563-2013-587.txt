 Pending before the Senate is S. 743. This is the Marketplace Fairness Act cosponsored by myself, Senator Enzi, Senator Heitkamp, Senator Alexander, and others. This matter is now pending before the Senate, and we are asking all Members with amendments to please bring them to the floor. I know the Senator from Arkansas has heard that call, and that is why he is here. We want to move this forward and have an active debate on this issue. We are asking our colleagues not to put it off. If we want to wrap this up in a timely fashion, we need their cooperation. So I urge all offices, if you have an amendment, please come to the floor and discuss it with Senator Enzi and me.  I yield the floor.
