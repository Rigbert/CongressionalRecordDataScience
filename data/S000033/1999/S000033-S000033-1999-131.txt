 Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Vento) very much for organizing this special order, and I want to go on record in agreeing with the remarks that the gentleman has made, as well as the comments of the ranking member of the committee, the gentleman from New York (Mr. LaFalce), and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kanjorski). I think what they had to say is appropriate, and I am in agreement with it.  Mr. Speaker, we see on the television virtually every night and we read in the newspapers that the economy is booming, and some people say it has never been so good. But when I speak to working families in the middle class in the State of Vermont they have a slightly different interpretation of what is going on in the economy. Because for many of those people, they are working longer hours for lower wages than they were 20 years ago. And while we are all delighted that Bill Gates saw a $40 billion increase in his wealth last year, that is really not the case for most the people in the State of Vermont. They are struggling hard to keep their heads above water.  One of the major problems we face in the State of Vermont has to do with affordable housing. If anything, that crisis is becoming more acute not only in my State but in States throughout this country. So it is very clear to me that one of the important tools that we have to build affordable housing, and to have the banks throughout this country play a responsible role in their communities is what we have done through the Community Reinvestment Act, which, in fact, is working extremely well in this country today and which must not be weakened.  I would agree with the gentleman from New York (Mr. LaFalce) in his remarks of a few moments ago that if CRA is weakened, we should not pass any banking legislation that does that, and I would strongly urge the President to veto any legislation which weakens CRA.  Mr. Speaker, I recently took part in a ribbon cutting celebration to commemorate the successful redevelopment of the Applegate Housing Development in Bennington, Vermont. The successful redevelopment project involved the efforts of many good people and organizations, including the residents, who in fact came together through a strong tenants' association. A nonprofit housing developer, civic leaders, the people in Bennington and their local government played a very positive role in this effort, as well as government officials and local banks. And the CRA was a vital part of that effort.  Until recently, Applegate was an apartment complex where the plumbing water backed up into the bathtubs, vacancy rates exceeded 50 percent, and crime was a serious problem. Today,Applegate is a completely renovated community where families can live in peace and comfort and children have the kind of opportunities to which they are entitled.                              {time}  2000  The truth of the matter is that the State of Vermont has a network of excellent community banks that is working with local nonprofit housing developers to build and rehabilitate housing for the benefit of low- and moderate-income families. CRA helps them make an important part the American dream, a decent and safe place to live accessible to all Vermont.  The CRA encourages federally insured financial institutions to provide deposit and credit services throughout the communities in which they do business, including low- and moderate-income areas, and it is working. I think that there should not be major disagreement in this body that we simply do not want to see banks lend to institutions and businesses that are running off to Mexico or China and investing in those countries. We want to see banks reinvest in our communities. And that is what the CRA process is about.  The CRA is helping to rebuild the economies of the stressed communities. It is making homeownership accessible to more Americans. It is helping to start small businesses and to create decent paying jobs. Since it was passed in 1977, CRA is credited with lending $1 trillion in loans to low- and moderate-income communities. And this is a significant achievement.  CRA is good for consumers, and it is good for communities. It is also good for the banking business because it encourages financial institutions to look for business opportunities they might otherwise miss.  Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned earlier, not everyone in our society is benefiting from the growth in our economy. An estimated 10 million Americans lack decent, affordable housing. It is not uncommon in the State of Vermont and, I dare say, in Minnesota to find families paying 40, 50 or more percent of their limited income for housing. That is not affordable housing.  In rural America, more than 9 million people are living in poverty. Rural communities across the country cannot get the development funds or the consumer credit they need, and in urban areas the lack of affordable housing leaves more and more working Americans without homes.  Instead of dismantling the CRA, as some in Congress would have us do, we must strengthen it. Congress is once again considering a bill to quote, unquote modernize the financial services system. But that bill fails to modernize the CRA to preserve its effectiveness in the changing financial system. The changes taking place in today's financial marketplace threaten to make it even more difficult for low- and moderate-income families to get the bank services they need and deserve. Without access to private capital that the CRA provides for low- and moderate-income consumers and communities, homes will not be renovated, small businesses will not be started, new jobs will not be created, and neighborhoods will not be rebuilt.  We need to save the CRA from those in Congress who would tear it down. I urge my colleagues to resist any effort to weaken the CRA.  Again, I want to thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Vento) for his leadership role in this.
