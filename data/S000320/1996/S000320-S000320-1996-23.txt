 Bond, Mr. Grams, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Santorum, Mrs. Frahm, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Helms, and Mr. Bennett) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:                            S. Con. Res. 72       Whereas it is incumbent upon the Congress to oppose any      action that would have the effect of undermining the rule of      law or the faith of the American people in our jury system;       Whereas on May 28, 1996, former business partners of the      President were convicted of a total of 24 felony counts by a      jury of 12 Arkansas residents;       Whereas Susan McDougal and Jim Guy Tucker have been      sentenced for their crimes by a Federal district judge in      Little Rock, Arkansas, and their codefendant James McDougal      is awaiting sentencing by the same judge;       Whereas on September 4, 1996, Susan McDougal was held in      contempt of court for refusing to answer questions before a      Federal grand jury relating to (1) the knowledge of the      President with respect to the fraudulent transactions for      which she was convicted, and (2) the truthfulness of the      testimony of the President at her trial;       Whereas in a televised interview broadcast on September 23,      1996, the President stated that any request for a      Presidential pardon made by James or Susan McDougal or Jim      Guy Tucker would be reviewed in the normal course, thereby      leaving open the possibility that one or more pardons might      indeed be issued at some later date;       Whereas any Presidential pardon of James or Susan McDougal      or Jim Guy Tucker would seriously undermine the confidence of      the American people in our criminal justice system, by      essentially nullifying felony convictions of friends and      associates of the President rendered by a jury of 12 Arkansas      residents on charges initially brought by a grand jury      comprised of 23 other Arkansans; and       Whereas the September 23, 1996, remarks by the President      could be construed by his recently convicted friends and      associates as offering them an inducement to refuse to      testify honestly and openly about matters under investigation      by Federal law enforcement authorities: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring, That it is the sense of the Congress that the      President should categorically disavow any intention of      issuing a Presidential pardon to James or Susan McDougal or      Jim Guy Tucker, and thereby affirm the principle that, in the      system of justice in the United States, no person is above      the law.
