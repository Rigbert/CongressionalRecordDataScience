 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until 10 a.m., Wednesday, May 7. I further ask that following the prayer and the pledge, the morning hour be deemed to have expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then begin a period of morning business until 12 noon, with the time equally divided between the two leaders or their designees, and that statements be limited to 10 minutes each.  I further ask unanimous consent that at 12 noon the Senate proceed to executive session and begin consideration of Executive Calendar No. 6, the NATO expansion treaty, as provided under the previous order.
