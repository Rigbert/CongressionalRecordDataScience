 President, the bill that I and Senator Levin are introducing today, the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1995, is an amendment to subchapter IV of chapter 5 of title 5 of the United States Code, a law which I sponsored in 1989. That law, also titled the ``Administrative Dispute Resolution Act,'' was designed to encourage Federal agencies to streamline dispute resolution processes through the use of alternative dispute resolution techniques instead of litigation. In other words, it would reduce our litigation process. These techniques--often collectively referred to as ADR--include mediation, arbitration, conciliation, fact-finding and minitrials, among others.  Since the implementation of the 1989 act, both Federal agencies and private parties have realized significant time and cost savings by avoiding the litigation quagmire, while sacrificing little in fairness and party satisfaction. Almost all the Federal agencies now have some sort of ADR framework in place, and most have enjoyed significant degrees of success. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency now uses mediation and arbitration processes to resolve superfund, Clean Water Act and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act disputes. The EPA and the private parties involved expressed great satisfaction with the efficiency and fairness of these techniques for the resolution of complex regulatory issues.  Not only are ADR techniques more efficient, they are also far less costly than litigation. One agency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, has estimated a savings of $13 million in legal costs in the last 3 years alone. Even better, the Resolution Trust Corporation estimated it saved $114 million over the last 4 years. Nor are these cost savings realized only in the Government. NRC, a private computer company, reduced it's pending lawsuits from 263 to 28 and cut the cost of outside attorneys' fees by half over a period of 10 years through the use of ADR techniques. Also, a contractor was able to deliver a completed rocket testing facility to the Air Force 3 months ahead of schedule and $12 million under budget by using ADR. In fact, the contractor was so satisfied with past ADR outcomes that it released all further claims against the Government.  Despite these gains, much work still remains in integrating ADR techniques into the Federal Government. Many agencies lag behind in adopting ADR programs into their daily routines. This lag is at least partially due to institutional misgivings about the new and unfamiliar. However, it is also due to legitimate concerns about confidentiality, fairness and quality assurance. It is these latter concerns that our new bill seeks to address. Based largely on an extensive and thorough analysis by the Administrative Conference of the United States, this bill modifies and clarifies the 1989 ADR Act, making ADR more attractive to both Federal agencies and private parties for solving regulatory disputes. At this time I would like to briefly summarize how the proposed act will accomplish this goal.  First, the bill removes the term ``settlement negotiations'' from the group of ADR techniques listed in the 1989 act. This will not decrease the effectiveness of the act as ``settlement negotiations'' are not and have never been covered by the act as they do not use third party ``neutrals'' in resolving conflicts. Thus, abolition of the term merely eliminates widespread agency confusion as to whether ``settlement negotiation'' is a statutorily supported ADR technique, and does not decrease the scope of the original act.  Second, the bill addresses agency confidentiality concerns by exempting all dispute resolution communications from Freedom of Information Act disclosure. Although these communications have always been confidential by implication, this amendment to the 1989 act makes that confidentiality express and clear.  Third, the bill makes it easier for agencies to acquire ``neutrals'' by streamlining competitive procedures for obtaining expert services and by allowing the acquisition of ``neutrals'' from nonprofit organizations.  Fourth, the bill eliminates the requirement that the validity of all contract claims under $100,000 be certified by the contractor. This change brings the 1989 ADR Act into conformance with the certification levels in the Contracts Disputes Act, thus encouraging the use of ADR techniques in many small disputes where they may be particularly appropriate.  Fifth, the bill authorizes the use of ``any alternate means of dispute resolution under the act or other mutually agreeable procedures'' for resolving claims. This greatly expands the range of available ADR techniques, above and beyond those listed in the statute, provided that both parties in the dispute agree to the method ultimately used.  Sixth, the bill orders the Chairman of the Administrative Conference of the United States to study the benefits and problems of Federal ADR use and report these findings to Congress 3 years after this bill is enacted. This will allow Congress to reassess the value of ADR methods at that time and make appropriate changes.  Finally, the bill permanently authorizes the ADR Act by striking the sunset provision presently in the law.  Mr. President, there has been much progress in the implementation and use of ADR techniques in the Federal Government since I first introduced the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act in 1989. Passage of this amendment to the act will further this progress by eliminating the remaining statutory barriers to ADR use and by clarifying statutory language. I hope my colleagues will join Senator Levin and I in this effort.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1224       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
