President, we have found, especially in this administration, time and again that when crimes have been committed, when scandals have erupted, it is not because the Congress found them out, it is because the press found them out.  Abu Ghraib, one of the worst scandals in the history of this country, something that hurt us throughout the world--we didn't find out about it because questions were asked in this body or the other body; we found out because the press found it out. We found out through the press and subsequently through our own investigations the scandals of politicizing law enforcement by this administration through the prosecutors' offices.  If we do not have the ability for our press to seek out these things, then we are all hurt. Any administration, Republican or Democratic, is going to be perfectly willing to give us all the press releases in the world saying all the wonderful things they have done. What I have found--and I have been through six administrations--is that they rarely want to talk about when they make a mistake. That is what we need a free press for.  My parents had a small newspaper in Waterbury, VT. I grew up in a family who revered the first amendment, revered it for the right to know, for the public's right to know. What has set this Nation apart from virtually any other nation on Earth is that our press is free, our press is open, our press can ask questions, and our press can point out mistakes--whether it is mistakes of Members of Congress or mistakes of the administration.  We need this shield law. Let's not use any more excuses for one more filibuster. If you really believe in having the shield law, vote for it. If you are against it, vote against it. But don't hide behind some parliamentary maneuver of a filibuster.  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.
