DECLARATION OF POLICY TO RENEW AMERICAN                    NEIGHBORHOODS.       The Congress hereby declares that--       (1) the Federal Government has a responsibility to promote      the general welfare of the Nation--       (A) by using Federal resources to aid families and      individuals seeking affordable homes that are safe, clean,      and healthy and, in particular, assisting responsible,      deserving citizens who cannot provide fully for themselves      because of temporary circumstances or factors beyond their      control;       (B) by working to ensure a thriving national economy and a      strong private housing market; and       (C) by developing effective partnerships among the Federal      Government, State and local governments, and private entities      that allow government to accept responsibility for fostering      the development of a healthy marketplace and allow families      to prosper without government involvement in their day-to-day      activities;       (2) the Federal Government cannot through its direct action      alone provide for the housing of every American citizen, or      even a majority of its citizens, but it is the responsibility      of the Government to promote and protect the independent and      collective actions of private citizens to develop housing and      strengthen their own neighborhoods;       (3) the Federal Government should act where there is a      serious need that private citizens or groups cannot or are      not addressing responsibly;       (4) housing is a fundamental and necessary component of      bringing true opportunity to people and communities in need,      but providing physical structures to house low-income      families will not by itself pull generations up from poverty;       (5) it is a goal of our Nation that all citizens have      decent and affordable housing; and       (6) our Nation should promote the goal of providing decent      and affordable housing for all citizens through the efforts      and encouragement of Federal, State, and local governments,      and by promoting and protecting the independent and      collective actions of private citizens, organizations, and      the private sector to develop housing and strengthen their      own neighborhoods.                      TITLE I--GENERAL PROVISIONS     SEC. 101. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.       The purpose of this Act is to promote safe, clean, and      healthy housing that is affordable to low-income families,      and thereby contribute to the supply of affordable housing,      by--       (1) deregulating and decontrolling public housing agencies,      which in this Act are referred to as ``local housing and      management authorities'', and thereby enable them to perform      as property and asset managers;       (2) providing for more flexible use of Federal assistance      to local housing and management authorities, allowing the      authorities to leverage and combine assistance amounts with      amounts obtained from other sources;       (3) facilitating mixed income communities;       (4) increasing accountability and rewarding effective      management of local housing and management authorities;       (5) creating incentives and economic opportunities for      residents of dwelling units assisted by local housing and      management authorities to work, become self-sufficient, and      transition out of public housing and federally assisted      dwelling units;       (6) recreating the existing rental assistance voucher      program so that the use of vouchers and relationships between      landlords and tenants under the program operate in a manner      that more closely resembles the private housing market; and       (7) remedying troubled local housing and management      authorities and replacing or revitalizing severely distressed      public housing developments.

(3) Full participation.--No local housing and management      authority may limit or restrict the capacity or offices in      which a member of such board or body may serve on such board      or body solely because of the member's status as a resident      member.

(4) Failure of LHMA's to comply with conversion      requirement.--If the Secretary determines that--       (A) a local housing and management authority has failed      under paragraph (1) to identify a building or buildings in a      timely manner,       (B) a local housing and management authority has failed to      identify one or more buildings which the Secretary determines      should have been identified under paragraph (1), or       (C) one or more of the buildings identified by the local      housing and management authority pursuant to paragraph (1)      should not, in the determination of the Secretary, have been      identified under that paragraph,     the Secretary may identify a building or buildings for      conversion and take other appropriate action pursuant to this      subsection.       (5) Cessation of unnecessary spending.--Notwithstanding any      other provision of law, if, in the determination of the      Secretary, a building or buildings meets or is likely to meet      the criteria set forth in paragraph (1), the Secretary may      direct the local housing and management authority to cease      additional spending in connection with such building or      buildings, except to the extent that additional spending is      necessary to ensure safe, clean, and healthy housing until      the Secretary determines or approves an appropriate course of      action with respect to such building or buildings under this      subsection.       (6) Use of budget authority.--Notwithstanding any other      provision of law, if a building or buildings are identified      pursuant to paragraph (1), the Secretary may authorize or      direct the transfer, to the choice-based or tenant-based      assistance program of such authority or to appropriate site      revitalization or other capital improvements approved by the      Secretary, of--       (A) in the case of an authority receiving assistance under      the comprehensive improvement assistance program, any amounts      obligated by the Secretary for the modernization of such      building or buildings pursuant to section 14 of the United      States Housing Act of 1937, as in effect immediately before      the date of enactment of this Act;       (B) in the case of an authority receiving public housing      modernization assistance by formula pursuant to such section      14, any amounts provided to the authority which are      attributable pursuant to the formula for allocating such      assistance to such building or buildings;       (C) in the case of an authority receiving assistance for      the major reconstruction of obsolete projects, any amounts      obligated by the Secretary for the major reconstruction of      such building or buildings pursuant to section 5(j)(2) of the      United States Housing Act of 1937, as in effect immediately      before the date of enactment of this Act; and       (D) in the case of an authority receiving assistance      pursuant to the formulas under section 204, any amounts      provided to the authority which are attributable pursuant to      the formulas for allocating such assistance to such building      or buildings.       (c) Extension of Deadlines.--The Secretary may, for a local      housing and management authority, extend any deadline      established pursuant to this section or a local housing      management plan for up to an additional 5 years if the      Secretary makes a determination that the deadline is      impracticable.       (d) Compliance With Plan.--The local housing management      plan submitted by a local housing and management authority      (including any amendments to the plan), unless determined      under section 108 not to comply with the requirements      under section 107, shall be binding upon the Secretary and      the local housing and management authority and the      authority shall use any grant amounts provided under this      title for eligible activities under subsection (a) in      accordance with the plan. This subsection may not be      construed to preclude changes or amendments to the plan,      as authorized under section 108(e) or any actions      authorized by this Act to be taken without regard to a      local housing management plan.     SEC. 204. DETERMINATION OF GRANT ALLOCATION.       (a) In General.--For each fiscal year, after reserving      amounts under section 112 from the aggregate amount made      available for the fiscal year for carrying out this title,      the Secretary shall allocate any remaining amounts among      eligible local housing and management authorities in      accordance with this section, so that the sum of all of the      allocations for all eligible authorities is equal to such      remaining amount.       (b) Allocation Amount.--The Secretary shall determine the      amount of the allocation for each eligible local housing and      management authority, which shall be--       (1) for any fiscal year beginning after the enactment of a      law containing the formulas described in paragraphs (1) and      (2) of subsection (c), the amount determined under such      formulas; or       (2) for any fiscal year beginning before the expiration of      such period, the sum of--       (A) the operating allocation determined under subsection      (d)(1) for the authority; and       (B) the capital improvement allocation determined under      subsection (d)(2) for the authority.       (c) Permanent Allocation Formulas for Capital and Operating      Funds.--       (1) Establishment of Capital Fund Formula.--The formula      under this paragraph shall provide for allocating assistance      under the capital fund for a fiscal year. The formula may      take into account such factors as--       (A) the number of public housing dwelling units owned or      operated by the local housing and management authority, the      characteristics and locations of the developments, and the      characteristics of the families served and to be served      (including the incomes of the families);       (B) the need of the local housing and management authority      to carry out rehabilitation and modernization activities, and      reconstruction, production, and demolition activities related      to public housing dwelling units owned or operated by the      local housing and management authority, including backlog and      projected future needs of the authority;       (C) the cost of constructing and rehabilitating property in      the area; and       (D) the need of the local housing and management authority      to carry out activities that provide a safe and secure      environment in public housing units owned or operated by the      local housing and management authority.       (2) Establishment of Operating Fund Formula.--The formula      under this paragraph shall provide for allocating assistance      under the operating fund for a fiscal year. The formula may      take into account such factors as--       (A) standards for the costs of operating and reasonable      projections of income, taking into account the      characteristics and locations of the     public housing developments and characteristics of the      families served and to be served (including the incomes of      the families), or the costs of providing comparable services      as determined in accordance with criteria or a formula      representing the operations of a prototype well-managed      public housing development;       (B) the number of public housing dwelling units owned or      operated by the local housing and management authority; and       (C) the need of the local housing and management authority      to carry out anti-crime and anti-drug activities, including      providing adequate security for public housing residents.       (3) Development under negotiated rulemaking procedure.--The      formulas under this subsection shall be developed according      to procedures for issuance of regulations under the      negotiated rulemaking procedure under subchapter III of      chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code, except that the      formulas shall not be contained in a regulation.       (4) Report.--Not later than the expiration of the 18-month      period beginning upon the enactment of this Act, the      Secretary shall submit a report to the Congress containing      the proposed formulas established pursuant to paragraph (3)      that meets the requirements of this subsection.       (d) Interim Allocation Requirements.--       (1) Operating allocation.--       (A) Applicability to 50 percent of appropriated amounts.--     Of any amounts available for allocation under this subsection      for a fiscal year, 50 percent shall be used only to provide      amounts for operating allocations under this paragraph for      eligible local housing and management authorities.       (B) Determination.--The operating allocation under this      subsection for a local housing and management authority for a      fiscal year shall be an amount determined by applying, to the      amount to be allocated under this paragraph, the formula used      for determining the distribution of operating subsidies for      fiscal year 1995 to public housing agencies (as modified      under subparagraph (C)) under section 9 of the United States      Housing Act of 1937, as in effect before the enactment of      this Act.       (C) Treatment of chronically vacant units.--The Secretary      shall revise the formula referred to in subparagraph (B) so      that the formula does not provide any amounts, other than      utility costs and other necessary costs (such as costs      necessary for the protection of persons and property),      attributable to any dwelling unit of a local housing and      management authority that has been vacant continuously for 6      or more months. A unit shall not be considered vacant for      purposes of this paragraph if the unit is unoccupied because      of rehabilitation or renovation that is on-schedule.       (D) Increases in income.--The Secretary may revise the      formula referred to in subparagraph (B) to provide an      incentive to encourage local housing and management      authorities to increase nonrental income and to increase      rental income attributable to their units by encouraging      occupancy by families with a broad range of incomes,      including families whose incomes have increased while in      occupancy and newly admitted families. Any such incentive      shall provide that the local housing and management authority      shall derive the full benefit of an increase in nonrental      income, and such increase shall not directly result in a      decrease in amounts provided to the authority under this      title.       (2) Capital improvement allocation.--       (A) Applicability to 50 percent of appropriated amounts.--     Of any amounts available for allocation under this subsection      for a fiscal year, 50 percent shall be used only to provide      amounts for capital improvement allocations under this      paragraph for eligible local housing and management      authorities.       (B) Determination.--The capital improvement allocation      under this subsection for an eligible local housing and      management authority for a fiscal year shall be determined by      applying, to the amount to be allocated under this paragraph,      the formula used for determining the distribution of      modernization assistance for fiscal year 1995 to public      housing agencies under section 14 of the United States      Housing Act of 1937, as in effect before the enactment of      this Act, except that Secretary shall establish a method for      taking into consideration allocation of amounts under the      comprehensive improvement assistance program.       (e) Eligibility of Units Acquired from Proceeds of Sales      Under Demolition or Disposition Plan.--If a local housing and      management authority uses proceeds from the sale of units      under a homeownership program in accordance with section 251      to acquire additional units to be sold to low-income      families, the additional units shall be counted as public      housing for purposes of determining the amount of the      allocation to the authority under this section until sale by      the authority, but in any case no longer than 5 years.     SEC. 205. SANCTIONS FOR IMPROPER USE OF AMOUNTS.       (a) In General.--In addition to any other actions      authorized under this title, if the Secretary finds pursuant      to an annual financial and performance audit under section      432 that a local housing and management authority receiving      grant amounts under this title has failed to comply      substantially with any provision of this title, the Secretary      may--       (1) terminate payments under this title to the authority;       (2) withhold from the authority amounts from the total      allocation for the authority pursuant to section 204;       (3) reduce the amount of future grant payments under this      title to the authority by an amount equal to the amount of      such payments that were not expended in accordance with this      title;       (4) limit the availability of grant amounts provided to the      authority under this title to programs, projects, or      activities not affected by such failure to comply;       (5) withhold from the authority amounts allocated for the      authority under title III; or       (6) order other corrective action with respect to the      authority.       (b) Termination of Compliance Action.--If the Secretary      takes action under subsection (a) with respect to a local      housing and management authority, the Secretary shall--       (1) in the case of action under subsection (a)(1), resume      payments of grant amounts under this title to the authority      in the full amount of the total allocation under section 204      for the authority at the time that the Secretary first      determines that the authority will comply with the provisions      of this title;       (2) in the case of action under paragraph (2), (5), or (6)      of subsection (a), make withheld amounts available as the      Secretary considers appropriate to ensure that the authority      complies with the provisions of this title; or       (3) in the case of action under subsection (a)(4), release      such restrictions at the time that the Secretary first      determines that the authority will comply with the provisions      of this title.

(b) Operating Assistance.--No portion of any public housing      development operated with amounts from a grant under this      title or operating assistance provided under the United      States Housing Act of 1937 may be disposed of before the      expiration of the 10-year period beginning upon the      conclusion of the fiscal year for which the grant or such      assistance was provided, except as provided in this Act.       (c) Capital Improvements Assistance.--Amounts may be used      for eligible activities under section 203(a)(2) only for the      following housing developments:       (1) Low-income developments.--Amounts may be used for a      low-income housing development that--       (A) is owned by local housing and management authorities;       (B) is operated as low-income rental housing and produced      or operated with assistance provided under a grant under this      title; and       (C) is consistent with the purposes of this title.     Any development, or portion thereof, referred to in this      paragraph for which activities under section 203(a)(2) are      conducted using amounts from a grant under this title shall      be maintained and used as public housing for the 20-year      period beginning upon the receipt of such grant. Any public      housing development, or portion thereof, that received the      benefit of a grant pursuant to section 14 of the United      States Housing Act of 1937 shall be maintained and used as      public housing for the 20-year period beginning upon receipt      of such amounts.       (2) Mixed income developments.--Amounts may be used for      mixed-income developments, which shall be a housing      development that--       (A) contains dwelling units that are available for      occupancy by families other than low-income families;       (B) contains a number of dwelling units--       (i) which units are made available (by master contract or      individual lease) for occupancy only by low- and very low-     income families identified by the local housing and      management authority;       (ii) which number is not less than a reasonable number of      units, including related amenities, taking into account the      amount of the assistance provided by the authority compared      to the total investment (including costs of operation) in the      development;       (iii) which units are subject to the statutory and      regulatory requirements of the public housing program, except      that the Secretary may grant appropriate waivers to such      statutory and regulatory requirements if reductions in      funding or other changes to the program make continued      application of such requirements impracticable;       (iv) which units are specially designated as dwelling units      under this subparagraph, except the equivalent units in the      development may be substituted for designated units during      the period the units are subject to the requirements of the      public housing program; and       (v) which units shall be eligible for assistance under this      title; and       (C) is owned by the local housing and management authority,      an affiliate controlled by it, or another appropriate entity.     Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, to      facilitate the establishment of socioeconomically mixed      communities, a local housing and management authority that      uses grant amounts under this title for a mixed income      development under this paragraph may, to the extent that      income from such a development reduces the amount of grant      amounts used for operating or other costs relating to public      housing, use such resulting savings to rent privately      developed dwelling units in the neighborhood of the mixed      income development. Such units shall be made available for      occupancy only by low-income families eligible for residency      in public housing.     SEC. 222. FAMILY ELIGIBILITY.

(b) Income Mix Within Developments.--A local housing and      management authority may establish and utilize income-mix      criteria for the selection of residents for dwelling units in      public housing developments that limit admission to a     development by selecting applicants having incomes      appropriate so that the mix of incomes of families occupying      the development is proportional to the income mix in the      eligible population of the jurisdiction of the authority, as      adjusted to take into consideration the severity of housing      need. Any criteria established under this subsection shall be      subject to the provisions of subsection (c).       (c) Income Mix.--       (1) LHMA income mix.--Of the public housing dwelling units      of a local housing and management authority made available      for occupancy after the date of the enactment of this Act not      less than 35 percent shall be occupied by low-income families      whose incomes do not exceed 30 percent of the area median      income, as determined by the Secretary with adjustments for      smaller and larger families, except that the Secretary, may      for purposes of this subsection, establish income ceilings      higher or lower than 30 percent of the median for the area on      the basis of the Secretary's findings that such variations      are necessary because of unusually high or low family      incomes.       (2) Prohibition of concentration of low-income families.--A      local housing and management authority may not comply with      the requirements under paragraph (1) by concentrating very      low-income families (or other families with relatively low      incomes) in public housing dwelling units in certain public      housing developments or certain buildings within      developments. The Secretary may review the income and      occupancy characteristics of the public housing developments,      and the buildings of such developments, of local housing and      management authorities to ensure compliance with the      provisions of this paragraph.       (d) Waiver of Eligibility Requirements for Occupancy by      Police Officers.--       (1) Authority and waiver.--To provide occupancy in public      housing dwelling units to police officers and other law      enforcement or security personnel (who are not otherwise      eligible for residence in public housing) and to increase      security for other public housing residents in developments      where crime has been a problem, a local housing and      management authority may, with respect to such units and      subject to paragraph (2)--       (A) waive--       (i) the provisions of subsection (a) of this section and      section 225(a);       (ii) the applicability of--       (I) any preferences for occupancy established under section      223;       (II) the minimum rental amount established pursuant to      section 225(b) and any maximum monthly rental amount      established pursuant to such section;       (III) any criteria relating to project income mix      established under subsection (b);       (IV) the income mix requirements under subsection (c); and       (V) any other occupancy limitations or requirements; and       (B) establish special rent requirements and other terms and      conditions of occupancy.       (2) Conditions of waiver.--A local housing and management      authority may take the actions authorized in paragraph (1)      only if authority determines that such actions will increase      security in the public housing developments involved and will      not result in a significant reduction of units available for      residence by low-income families.       (e) Loss of Assistance for Termination of Tenancy.--A local      housing and management authority shall, consistent with      policies described in the local housing management plan of      the authority, establish policies providing that a family      residing in a public housing dwelling unit whose tenancy is      terminated for serious violations of the terms or conditions      of the lease shall--       (1) lose any right to continued occupancy in public housing      under this title; and       (2) immediately become ineligible for admission to public      housing under this title or for housing assistance under      title III--       (A) in the case of a termination due to drug-related      criminal activity, for a period of not less than 3 years from      the date of the termination; or       (B) for other terminations, for a reasonable period of time      as determined period of time as determined by the local      housing and management authority.

(b) Availability of Criminal Records.--A local housing and      management authority may request and obtain records regarding      the criminal convictions of applicants for, or tenants of,      public housing as provided in section 646 of the Housing and      Community Development Act of 1992.       (c) Notification of Application Decisions.--A local housing      and management authority shall establish procedures designed      to provide for notification to an applicant for admission to      public housing of the determination with respect to such      application, the basis for the determination, and, if the      applicant is determined to be eligible for admission, the      projected date of occupancy (to the extent such date can      reasonably be determined). If an authority denies an      applicant admission to public housing, the authority shall      notify the applicant that the applicant may request an      informal hearing on the denial within a reasonable time of      such notification.       (d) Confidentiality for Victims of Domestic Violence.--A      local housing and management authority shall be subject to      the restrictions regarding release of information relating to      the identity and new residence of any family in public      housing that was a victim of domestic violence that are      applicable to shelters pursuant to the Family Violence      Prevention and Services Act.

SEC. 225. FAMILY RENTAL PAYMENT.       (a) Rental Contribution by Resident.--       (1) In general.--A family shall pay as monthly rent for a      dwelling unit in public housing the amount that the local      housing and management authority determines is appropriate      with respect to the family and the unit, which shall be--       (A) based upon factors determined by the authority, which      may include the adjusted income of the resident, type and      size of dwelling unit, operating and other expenses of the      authority, or any other factors that the authority considers      appropriate; and       (B) an amount that is not less than the minimum monthly      rental amount under subsection (b)(1) nor more than any      maximum monthly rental amount established for the dwelling      unit pursuant to subsection (b)(2).     Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, the      amount paid by an elderly family or a disabled family for      monthly rent for a dwelling unit in public housing may not      exceed 30 percent of the family's adjusted monthly income.      Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, the      amount paid by a family whose head (or whose spouse) is a      veteran (as such term is defined in section 203(b) of the      National Housing Act) for monthly rent for a dwelling unit in      public housing may not exceed 30 percent of the family's      adjusted monthly income. In determining the amount of the      rent charged under this paragraph for a dwelling unit, a      local housing and management authority shall take into      consideration the characteristics of the population served by      the authority, the goals of the local housing management plan      for the authority, and the goals under the comprehensive      housing affordability strategy under section 105 of the      Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (or any      consolidated plan incorporating such strategy) for the      applicable jurisdiction.       (2) Exceptions.--Notwithstanding any other provision of      this section, the amount paid for monthly rent for a dwelling      unit in public housing may not exceed 30 percent of the      family's adjusted monthly income for any family who--       (A) upon the date of the enactment of this Act, is residing      in any dwelling unit in public housing and--       (i) is an elderly family; or       (ii) is a disabled family; or       (B) has an income that does not exceed 30 percent of the      median income for the area (as determined by the Secretary      with adjustments for smaller and larger families).       (b) Allowable Rents.--       (1) Minimum rental.--Each local housing and management      authority shall establish, for each dwelling unit in public      housing owned or administered by the authority, a minimum      monthly rental contribution toward the rent (which rent shall      include any amount allowed for utilities), which--       (A) may not be less than $25, nor more than $50; and       (B) may be increased annually by the authority, except that      no such annual increase may exceed 10 percent of the amount      of the minimum monthly rental contribution in effect for the      preceding year.     Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a local housing and      management authority may, in its sole discretion, grant an      exemption in whole or in part from payment of the minimum      monthly rental contribution established under this paragraph      to any family unable to pay such amount because of severe      financial hardships. Severe financial hardships may include      situations where the family is awaiting an eligibility      determination for a Federal, State, or local assistance      program, where the family would be evicted as a result of      imposition of the minimum rent, and other situations as may      be determined by the authority.       (2) Maximum rental.--Each local housing and management      authority may establish, for each dwelling unit in public      housing owned or administered by the authority, a maximum      monthly rental amount, which shall be an amount determined by      the authority which is based on, but does not exceed--       (A) the average, for dwelling units of similar size in      public housing developments owned and operated by such      authority, of operating expenses attributable to such units;       (B) the reasonable rental value of the unit; or       (C) the local market rent for comparable units of similar      size.       (c) Income Reviews.--If a local housing and management      authority establishes the amount of rent paid by a family for      a public housing dwelling unit based on the adjusted income      of the family, the authority shall review the incomes of such      family occupying dwelling units in public housing owned or      administered by the authority not less than annually.       (d) Review of Maximum and Minimum Rents.--       (1) Rental charges.--If the Secretary determines, at any      time, that a significant percentage of the public housing      dwelling units owned or operated by a large local housing and      management authority are occupied by households paying more      than 30 percent of their adjusted incomes for rent, the      Secretary shall review the maximum and minimum monthly rental      amounts established by the authority.       (2) Population served.--If the Secretary determines, at any      time, that less than 40 percent of the public housing      dwelling units owned or operated by a large local housing and      management authority are occupied by households whose incomes      do not exceed 30 percent of the area median income, the      Secretary shall review the maximum and minimum monthly rental      amounts established by the authority.       (3) Modification of maximum and minimum rental amounts.--     If, pursuant to review under this subsection, the Secretary      determines that the maximum and minimum rental amounts for a      large local housing and management authority are not      appropriate to serve the needs of the low-income population      of the jurisdiction served by the authority (taking into      consideration the financial resources and costs of the      authority), as identified in the approved local housing      management plan of the authority, the Secretary may require      the authority to modify the maximum and minimum monthly      rental amounts.       (4) Large lhma.--For purposes of this subsection, the term      ``large local housing and management authority'' means a      local housing and management authority that owns or operates      1250 or more public housing dwelling units.       (e) Phase-In of Rent Contribution Increases.--       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), for      any family residing in a dwelling unit in public housing upon      the date of the enactment of this Act, if the monthly      contribution for rental of an assisted dwelling unit to be      paid by the family upon initial applicability of this title      is greater than the amount paid by the family under the      provisions of the United States Housing Act of 1937      immediately before such applicability, any such resulting      increase in rent contribution shall be--       (A) phased in equally over a period of not less than 3      years, if such increase is 30 percent or more of such      contribution before initial applicability; and       (B) limited to not more than 10 percent per year if such      increase is more than 10 percent but less than 30 percent of      such contribution before initial applicability.       (2) Exception.--The minimum rent contribution requirement      under subsection (b)(1)(A) shall apply to each family      described in paragraph (1) of this subsection,      notwithstanding such paragraph.     SEC. 226. LEASE REQUIREMENTS.       In renting dwelling units in a public housing development,      each local housing and management authority shall utilize      leases that--       (1) do not contain unreasonable terms and conditions;       (2) obligate the local housing and management authority to      maintain the development in compliance with the housing      quality requirements under section 232;       (3) require the local housing and management authority to      give adequate written notice of termination of the lease,      which shall not be less than--       (A) the period provided under the applicable law of the      jurisdiction or 14 days, whichever is less, in the case of      nonpayment of rent;       (B) a reasonable period of time, but not to exceed 14 days,      when the health or safety of other residents or local housing      and management authority employees is threatened; and       (C) the period of time provided under the applicable law of      the jurisdiction, in any other case;       (4) require that the local housing and management authority      may not terminate the tenancy except for violation of the      terms or conditions of the lease, violation of applicable      Federal, State, or local law, or for other good cause;       (5) provide that the local housing and management authority      may terminate the tenancy of a public housing resident for      any activity, engaged in by a public housing resident, any      member of the resident's household, or any guest or other      person under the resident's control, that--       (A) threatens the health or safety of, or right to peaceful      enjoyment of the premises by, other residents or employees of      the local housing and management authority or other manager      of the housing;       (B) threatens the health or safety of, or right to peaceful      enjoyment of their premises by, persons residing in the      immediate vicinity of the premises; or       (C) is criminal activity (including drug-related criminal      activity) on or off such premises;       (6) provide that any occupancy in violation of the      provisions of section 105 shall be cause for termination of      tenancy; and       (7) specify that, with respect to any notice of eviction or      termination, notwithstanding any State law, a public housing      resident shall be informed of the opportunity, prior to any      hearing or trial, to examine any relevant documents, records      or regulations directly related to the eviction or      termination.

(3) Eligibility of near-elderly families.--If a local      housing and management authority determines that there are      insufficient numbers of elderly families to fill all the      units in a development (or portion of a development)      designated under paragraph (1) for occupancy by only elderly      families, the authority may provide that near-elderly      families may occupy dwelling units in the development (or      portion).

(g) Resale.--       (1) Authority and limitation.--A homeownership program      under this section shall permit the resale of a dwelling unit      purchased under the program by an eligible family, but shall      provide such limitations on resale as the authority considers      appropriate (whether the family purchases directly from the      authority or from another entity) for the authority to      recapture--       (A) from any economic gain derived from any such resale      occurring during the 5-year period beginning upon purchase of      the dwelling unit by the eligible family, a portion of the      amount of any financial assistance provided under the program      by the authority to the eligible family; and       (B) after the expiration of such 5-year period, only such      amounts as are equivalent to the assistance provided under      this section by the authority to the purchaser.

(d) Consultation.--A local housing and management authority      may demolish or dispose of a public housing development (or      portion of a development) only if the authority notifies and      confers regarding the demolition or disposition with--       (1) the residents of the development (or portion); and       (2) appropriate local government officials.       (e) Use of Proceeds.--Any net proceeds from the disposition      of a public housing development (or portion of a development)      shall be used for--       (1) housing assistance for low-income families that is      consistent with the low-income housing needs of the      community, through acquisition, development, or      rehabilitation of, or homeownership programs for, other low-     income housing or the provision of choice-based assistance      under title III for such families;       (2) supportive services relating to job training or child      care for residents of a development or developments; or       (3) leveraging amounts for securing commercial enterprises,      on-site in public housing developments of the local housing      and management authority, appropriate to serve the needs of      the residents.

(g) Right of First Refusal for Resident Organizations and      Resident Management Corporations.--       (1) In general.--A local housing and management authority      may not dispose of a public housing development (or portion      of a development) unless the authority has, before such      disposition, offered to sell the property, as provided in      this subsection, to each resident organization and resident      management corporation operating at the development for      continued use as low-income housing, and no such organization      or corporation purchases the property pursuant to such offer.      A resident organization may act, for purposes of this      subsection, through an entity formed to facilitate      homeownership under subtitle D.       (2) Timing.--Disposition of a development (or portion      thereof) under this section may not take place--       (A) before the expiration of the period during which any      such organization or corporation may notify the authority of      interest in purchasing the property, which shall be the 30-     day period beginning on the date that the authority first      provides notice of the proposed disposition of the property      to such resident organizations and resident management      corporations;       (B) if an organization or corporation submits notice of      interest in accordance with subparagraph (A), before the      expiration of the period during which such organization or      corporation may obtain a commitment for financing to purchase      the property, which shall be the 60-day period beginning upon      the submission to the authority of the notice of interest; or       (C) if, during the period under subparagraph (B), an      organization or corporation obtains such financing commitment      and makes a bona fide offer to the authority to purchase the      property for a price equal to or exceeding the applicable      offer price under paragraph (3).

The Secretary may establish a      minimum allocation amount, in which case only the local      housing and management authorities that, pursuant to the      formula, are provided an amount equal to or greater than the      minimum allocation amount, shall receive an allocation.       (2) Regulations.--The formula under this subsection shall      be established by regulation issued by the Secretary.      Notwithstanding sections 563(a) and 565(a) of title 5, United      States Code, any proposed regulation containing such formula      shall be issued pursuant to a negotiated rulemaking procedure      under subchapter of chapter 5 of such title and the Secretary      shall establish a negotiated rulemaking committee for      development of any such proposed regulations.       (b) Allocation Considerations.--       (1) Limitation on reallocation for another state.--Any      amounts allocated for a State or areas or communities within      a State that are not likely to be used within the fiscal year      for which the amounts are provided shall not be reallocated      for use in another State, unless the Secretary determines      that other areas or communities within the same State (that      are eligible for amounts under this title) cannot use the      amounts within the same fiscal year.       (2) Effect of receipt of tenant-based assistance for      disabled families.--The Secretary may not consider the      receipt by a local housing and management authority of      assistance under section 811(b)(1) of the Cranston-Gonzalez      National Affordable Housing Act, or the amount received, in      approving amounts under this title for the authority or in      determining the amount of such assistance to be provided to      the authority.       (3) Exemption from formula allocation.--The formula      allocation requirements of subsection (a) shall not apply to      any assistance under this title that is approved in      appropriation Acts for uses that the Secretary determines are      incapable of geographic allocation, including funding for the      headquarters reserve fund under section 112, amendments of      existing housing assistance payments contracts, renewal of      such contracts, assistance to families that would otherwise      lose assistance due to the decision of the project owner to      prepay the project mortgage or not to renew the housing      assistance payments contract, assistance to prevent      displacement from public or assisted housing or to provide      replacement housing in connection with the demolition or      disposition of public housing, assistance for relocation from      public housing, assistance in connection with protection of      crime witnesses, assistance for conversion from leased      housing contracts under section 23 of the United States      Housing Act of 1937 (as in effect before the enactment of the      Housing and Community Development Act of 1974), and      assistance in support of the property disposition and      portfolio management functions of the Secretary.       (c) Recapture of Amounts.--       (1) Authority.--In each fiscal year, from any budget      authority made available for assistance under this title or      section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (as in      effect before the enactment of this Act) that is obligated to      a local housing and management authority but remains      unobligated by the authority upon the expiration of the 8-     month period beginning upon the initial availability of such      amounts for obligation by the authority, the Secretary may      deobligate an amount, as determined by the Secretary, not      exceeding 50 percent of such unobligated amount.       (2) Use.--The Secretary may reallocate and transfer any      amounts deobligated under paragraph (1) only to local housing      and management authorities in areas that the Secretary      determines have received less funding than other areas, based      on the relative needs of all areas.

(4) Increase.--The Secretary may increase the fee if      necessary to reflect the higher costs of administering small      programs and programs operating over large geographic areas.       (b) Fee for Preliminary Expenses.--The Secretary shall also      establish reasonable fees (as determined by the Secretary)      for--       (1) the costs of preliminary expenses, in the amount of      $500, for a local housing and management authority, but only      in the first year that the authority administers a choice-     based housing assistance program under this title, and only      if, immediately before the date of the enactment of this Act,      the authority was not administering a tenant-based rental      assistance program under the United States Housing Act of      1937 (as in effect immediately before such date of      enactment), in connection with its initial increment of      assistance received;       (2) the costs incurred in assisting families who experience      difficulty (as determined by the Secretary) in obtaining      appropriate housing under the programs; and       (3) extraordinary costs approved by the Secretary.       (c) Transfer of Fees in Cases of Concurrent Geographical      Jurisdiction.--       (1) In general.--In each fiscal year, if any local housing      and management authority provides tenant-based rental      assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act      of 1937 or housing assistance under this title on behalf of a      family who uses such assistance for a dwelling unit that is      located within the jurisdiction of such authority but is also      within the jurisdiction of another local housing and      management authority, the Secretary shall take such steps as      may be necessary to ensure that the local housing and      management authority that provides the services for a family      receives all or part of the administrative fee under this      section (as appropriate).

Subtitle B--Choice-Based Housing Assistance for Eligible Families     SEC. 321. ELIGIBLE FAMILIES AND PREFERENCES FOR ASSISTANCE.       (a) Low-Income Requirement.--Housing assistance under this      title may be provided only on behalf of a family that--       (1) at the time that such assistance is initially provided      on behalf of the family, is determined by the local housing      and management authority to be a low-income family; or       (2) qualifies to receive such assistance under any other      provision of Federal law.       (b) Income Targeting.--Of the families initially assisted      under this title by a local housing and management authority      in any year, not less than 50 percent shall be families whose      incomes do not exceed 60 percent of the area median income,      as determined by the Secretary with adjustments for smaller      and larger families. The Secretary may establish income      ceiling higher or lower than 30 percent of the area median      income on the basis of the Secretary's findings that such      variations are necessary because of unusually high or low      family incomes.       (c) Income Targeting.--Of the families initially assisted      under this title by a local housing and management authority      in any year, not less than 40 percent shall be families whose      incomes do not exceed 30 percent of the area median income,      as determined by the Secretary with adjustments for smaller      and larger families. The Secretary may establish income      ceiling higher or lower than 30 percent of the area median      income on the basis of the Secretary's findings that such      variations are necessary because of unusually high or low      family incomes.       (d) Reviews of Family Incomes.--       (1) In general.--Reviews of family incomes for purposes of      this title shall be subject to the provisions of section 904      of the Stewart B.

(2) Procedures.--Each local housing and management      authority administering housing assistance under this title      shall establish procedures that are appropriate and necessary      to ensure that income data provided to the authority and      owners by families applying for or receiving housing      assistance from the authority is complete and accurate.       (e) Preferences for Assistance.--       (1) Authority to establish.--Any local housing and      management authority that receives amounts under this title      may establish a system for making housing assistance      available on behalf of eligible families that provides      preference for such assistance to eligible families having      certain characteristics.       (2) Content.--Each system of preferences established      pursuant to this subsection shall be based upon local housing      needs and priorities, as determined by the local housing and      management authority using generally accepted data sources,      including any information obtained pursuant to an opportunity      for public comment as provided under section 107(e) or under      the requirements applicable to comprehensive housing      affordability strategy for the relevant jurisdiction.       (f) Portability of Housing Assistance.--       (1) National portability.--An eligible family that is      selected to receive or is receiving assistance under this      title may rent any eligible dwelling unit in any area where a      program is being administered under this title.      Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a local housing and      management authority may require that any family not living      within the jurisdiction of the local housing and management      authority at the time the family applies for assistance from      the authority shall, during the 12-month period beginning on      the date of initial receipt of housing assistance made      available on behalf of the family from that authority, lease      and occupy an eligible dwelling unit located within the      jurisdiction served by the authority. The authority for the      jurisdiction into which the family moves shall have the      responsibility for administering assistance for the family.       (2) Source of funding for a family that moves.--For a      family that has moved into the jurisdiction of a local      housing and management authority and that, at the time of the      move, has been selected to receive, or is receiving,      assistance provided by another authority, the authority for      the jurisdiction into which the family has moved may, in its      discretion, cover the cost of assisting the family under its      contract with the Secretary or through reimbursement from the      other authority under that authority's contract.       (3) Authority to deny assistance to certain families who      move.--A family may not receive housing assistance as      provided under this subsection if the family has moved from a      dwelling unit in violation of the lease for the dwelling      unit.       (4) Funding allocations.--In providing assistance amounts      under this title for local housing and management authorities      for any fiscal year, the Secretary may give consideration to      any reduction or increase in the number of resident families      under the program of an authority in the preceding fiscal      year as a result of this subsection.       (g) Loss of Assistance Upon Termination of Tenancy.--A      local housing and management authority shall, consistent with      the policies described in the local housing management plan      of the authority, establish policies providing that an      assisted family whose tenancy is terminated for serious      violations of the terms or conditions of the lease shall--       (1) lose any right to continued housing assistance; and       (2) immediately become ineligible for housing assistance      under this title or for admission to public housing under      title II--       (A) in the case of a termination due to drug-related      criminal activity, for a period of not less than 3 years from      the date of the termination; and       (B) for other terminations, for a reasonable period of time      as determined by the local housing and management authority.       (h) Confidentiality for Victims of Domestic Violence.--A      local housing and management authority shall be subject to      the restrictions regarding release of information relating to      the identity and new residence of any family receiving      housing assistance who was a victim of domestic violence that      are applicable to shelters pursuant to the Family Violence      Prevention and Services Act. The authority shall work with      the United States Postal Service to establish procedures      consistent with the confidentiality provisions in the      Violence Against Women Act of 1994.       (i) Denial of Assistance to Criminal Offenders.--In making      assistance under this title available on behalf of eligible      families, a local housing and management authority may deny      the provision of such assistance in the same manner, for the      same period, and subject to the same conditions that an owner      of federally assisted housing may deny occupancy in such      housing under subsections (b) and (c) of section 642 of the      Housing and Community Development Act of 1992.       (j) Availability of Criminal Records.--A local housing and      management authority may request and obtain records regarding      the criminal convictions of applicants for housing assistance      under this title and assisted families under this title to      the same extent an owner of federally assisted housing may      obtain such records regarding an applicant for or tenant of      federally assisted housing under section 646 of the Housing      and Community Development Act of 1992.     SEC. 322. RESIDENT CONTRIBUTION.       (a) Amount.--       (1) In general.--An assisted family shall contribute on a      monthly basis for the rental of an assisted dwelling unit an      amount that the local housing and management authority      determines is appropriate with respect to the family and the      unit, but shall not be less than the minimum monthly rental      contribution determined under subsection (d).       (2) Exceptions for certain current residents.--     Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the amount paid by an assisted      family for monthly rent for an assisted dwelling unit, may      not exceed 30 percent of the family's adjusted monthly income      for any family who--       (A) upon the date of the enactment of this Act, is an      assisted family and--       (i) is an elderly family; or       (ii) is a disabled family; or       (B) has an income that does not exceed 30 percent of the      median income for the area (as determined by the Secretary      with adjustments for smaller and larger families).     Any amount payable under paragraph (3) shall be in addition      to the amount payable under this paragraph.       (3) Excess rental amount.--In any case in which the monthly      rent charged for a dwelling unit pursuant to the housing      assistance payments contract exceeds the applicable payment      standard (established under section 353) for the dwelling      unit, the assisted family residing in the unit shall      contribute (in addition to the amount of the monthly rent      contribution otherwise determined under paragraph (1) or (2)      of this subsection for such family) such entire excess rental      amount.       (b) Limitation.--Notwithstanding any other provision of      this section, the amount paid by an assisted family that is      an elderly family or a disabled family, for monthly rent for      an assisted dwelling unit bearing a gross rent that does not      exceed the payment standard established under section 353 for      a dwelling unit of the applicable size and located in the      market area in which such assisted dwelling unit is located,      may not exceed 30 percent of the family's adjusted monthly      income.       (c) Limitation.--Notwithstanding any other provision of      this section, the amount paid by an assisted family whose      head (or whose spouse) is a veteran (as such term is defined      in section 203(b) of the National Housing Act) for monthly      rent for an assisted dwelling unit bearing a gross rent that      does not exceed the payment standard established under      section 353 for a dwelling unit of the applicable size and      located in the market area in which such assisted dwelling      unit is located may not exceed 30 percent of the family's      adjusted monthly income.       (d) Minimum Monthly Rental Contribution.--       (1) In General.--The local housing and management authority      shall determine the amount of the minimum monthly rental      contribution of     an assisted family (which rent shall include any amount      allowed for utilities), which--       (A) shall be based upon factors including the adjusted      income of the family and any other factors that the authority      considers appropriate;       (B) shall be not less than $25, nor more than $50; and       (C) may be increased annually by the authority, except that      no such annual increase may exceed 10 percent of the amount      of the minimum monthly contribution in effect for the      preceding year.       (2) Hardship exception.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a      local housing and management authority may, in its sole      discretion, grant an exemption in whole or in part from      payment of the minimum monthly rental contribution      established under this paragraph to any assisted family      unable to pay such amount because of severe financial      hardships. Severe financial hardships may include situations      where the family is awaiting an eligibility determination for      a Federal, State, or local assistance program, where the      family would be evicted as a result of imposition of the      minimum rent, and other situations as may be determined by      the authority.       (e) Treatment of Changes in Rental Contribution.--       (1) Notification of changes.--A local housing and      management authority shall promptly notify the owner of an      assisted dwelling unit of any change in the resident      contribution by the assisted family residing in the unit that      takes effect immediately or at a later date.       (2) Collection of retroactive changes.--In the case of any      change in the rental contribution of an assisted family that      affects rental payments previously made, the local housing      and management authority shall collect any additional amounts      required to be paid by the family under such change directly      from the family and shall refund any excess rental      contribution paid by the family directly to the family.       (f) Phase-In of Rent Contribution Increases.--       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), for      any family that is receiving tenant-based rental assistance      under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 upon      the initial applicability of the provisions of this title to      such family, if the monthly contribution for rental of an      assisted dwelling unit to be paid by the family upon such      initial applicability is greater than the amount paid by the      family under the provisions of the United States Housing Act      of 1937 immediately before such applicability, any such      resulting increase in rent contribution shall be--       (A) phased in equally over a period of not less than 3      years, if such increase is 30 percent or more of such      contribution before initial applicability; and       (B) limited to not more than 10 percent per year if such      increase is more than 10 percent but less than 30 percent of      such contribution before initial applicability.

(b) Amount.--For a market area, the rental indicator      established under subsection (a) for a dwelling unit of a      particular size and type in the market area shall be a dollar      amount that reflects the rental amount for a standard quality      rental unit of such size and type in the market area that is      an eligible dwelling unit.       (c) Effective Date.--The Secretary shall cause the proposed      rental indicators established under subsection (a) for each      market area to be published in the Federal Register with      reasonable time for public comment, and such rental      indicators shall become effective upon the date of      publication in final form in the Federal Register.       (d) Annual Adjustment.--Each rental indicator in effect      under this section shall be adjusted to be effective on      October 1 of each year to reflect changes, based on the most      recent available data trended so that the indicators will be      current for the year to which they apply, in rents for      existing rental dwelling units of various sizes and types in      the market area suitable for occupancy by families assisted      under this title.

(2) Powers of receiver.--If a receiver is appointed for a      local housing and management authority pursuant to subsection      (b)(5), in addition to the powers accorded by the court      appointing the receiver, the receiver--       (A) may abrogate contracts that substantially impede      correction of the substantial default or improvement of the      classification;       (B) may demolish and dispose of assets of the authority in      accordance with subtitle E of title II;       (C) where determined appropriate by the Secretary, may      require the establishment of one or more new local housing      and management authorities, to the extent permitted by State      and local law; and       (D) except as provided in subparagraph (C), shall not be      subject to any State or local laws relating to civil service      requirements, employee rights, procurement, or financial or      administrative controls that, in the determination of the      receiver, substantially impede correction of the substantial      default or improvement of the classification.

(f) Liability.--If the Secretary takes possession of an      authority pursuant to subsection (b)(2) or a receiver is      appointed pursuant to subsection (b)(5) for a local housing      and management authority, the Secretary or the receiver shall      be deemed to be acting in the capacity of the local housing      and management authority (and not in the official capacity as      Secretary or other official) and any liability incurred shall      be a liability of the local housing and management authority.       (g) Effectiveness.--The provisions of this section shall      apply with respect to actions taken before, on, or after the      effective date of this Act and shall apply to any receivers      appointed for a public housing agency before the date of      enactment of this Act.

SEC. 702. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.       The Congress hereby finds that--       (1) the Federal Government has a responsibility to promote      the general welfare of the Nation--       (A) by using Federal resources to aid families and      individuals seeking affordable homes that are safe, clean,      and healthy and, in particular, assisting responsible,      deserving citizens who cannot provide fully for themselves      because of temporary circumstances or factors beyond their      control;       (B) by working to ensure a thriving national economy and a      strong private housing market; and       (C) by developing effective partnerships among the Federal      Government, State and local governments, and private entities      that allow government to accept responsibility for fostering      the development of a healthy marketplace and allow families      to prosper without government involvement in their day-to-day      activities;       (2) there exists a unique relationship between the      Government of the United States and the governments of Indian      tribes and a unique Federal responsibility to Indian people;       (3) the Constitution of the United States invests the      Congress with plenary power over the field of Indian affairs,      and through treaties, statutes, and historical relations with      Indian tribes, the United States has undertaken a trust      responsibility to protect Indian tribes;       (4) the Congress, through treaties, statutes, and the      general course of dealing with Indian tribes, has assumed the      responsibility for the protection and preservation of Indian      tribes and for working with tribes and their members to      improve their socio-economic status so that they are able to      take greater responsibility for their own economic condition;       (5) providing affordable and healthy homes is an essential      element in the special role of the United States in helping      tribes and their members to achieve a socio-economic status      comparable to their non-Indian neighbors;       (6) the need for affordable and healthy homes on Indian      reservations, in Indian communities, and in Native Alaskan      villages is acute and the     Federal Government should work not only to provide housing      assistance, but also, to the extent practicable, to assist in      the development of private housing finance mechanisms on      Indian lands to achieve the goals of economic self-     sufficiency and self-determination for tribes and their      members; and       (7) Federal assistance to meet these responsibilities      should be provided in a manner that recognizes the right of      tribal self-governance by making such assistance available      directly to the tribes or tribally designated entities.     SEC. 703. ADMINISTRATION THROUGH OFFICE OF NATIVE AMERICAN                    PROGRAMS.

(c) Certification.--A certification under the procedures      authorized by this section shall--       (1) be in a form acceptable to the Secretary,       (2) be executed by the chief executive officer or other      officer of the recipient of assistance under this title      qualified under regulations of the Secretary,       (3) specify that the recipient has fully carried out its      responsibilities as described under subsection (a), and       (4) specify that the certifying officer (A) consents to      assume the status of a responsible Federal official under the      National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and each provision      of law specified in regulations issued by the Secretary      insofar as the provisions of such Act or such other      provisions of law apply pursuant to subsection (a), and (B)      is authorized and consents on behalf of the recipient of      assistance and such officer to accept the jurisdiction of the      Federal courts for the purpose of enforcement of the      certifying officer's responsibilities as such an official.
