Speaker, I come to the House floor this evening to talk again about the Republican raid on Social Security a year ago to cover their growing deficits because of the Bush administration tax breaks to the upper crust that created no new jobs. Where did they get the money to do it?  This first chart goes back about a year to June 18 of last year. At that point, they had taken from Social Security's' trust funds over $218,095,890,410, or about $775 per American. We just asked the Department of the Treasury to give us the update. Now, this year already, clocking the Republican raid on Social Security to cover their tax breaks mainly to the top earners in this country, they have now taken $498,863,013,099, or about $1,714.24 per American. That is nearly a half a trillion dollars just as of May 20, just as of this week.  Now, Social Security is a financial lifeline for 46 million Americans, but the Republicans continue to play a game of fiscal ``chicken'' with the Federal deficit. They are borrowing from Social Security's trust funds to give tax breaks aimed at next year's elections.  Let us make one thing clear: Americans might have elected some Republicans into this House and the other body, but they did not give them a mandate to rob Social Security.  Now, this past March, the Republican leadership of this House voted on a budget that will give us deficits as far as the eye can see. I thought that this particular editorial cartoon from the Rocky Mountain News was particularly illustrative, with this giant deficit that is being created for the future as a result of the type of tax program that they have put in place, with absolutely no jobs being yielded, but in fact giving us a debt that will kill jobs and weaken Social Security and Medicare, just when 77 million baby boomers start to retire.  Earlier this month, the same House Republicans voted a $550 billion, more than half-a-trillion, in tax breaks, mostly to the wealthiest 1 percent of earners in this country, and there is no requirement that money be invested in this country. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Federal Government has run a deficit of approximately $202 billion in the first 7 months of this fiscal year. And where do we think they are getting the money from? Where does the money exist? In our Social Security trust funds.  Now that amount of debt that has been added this year is $138 billion more than the same period last year, so it is getting worse. The Congressional Budget Office now expects that the government will end up this year with a deficit of over $300 billion.  What is the biggest reason for this most radical fiscal reversal in American history and the raid that is going on on Social Security? The Bush tax program aimed at the next election, not the next generation.  What is the effect of this burgeoning public debt? They are mortgaging Social Security's future payouts. They are forcing our country to cover the rest of their borrowing with more dependence on foreign investors who buy our debt bonds, starting with China and Japan and then Saudi Arabia, and they are taking away independence for this Republic and for the American people and a lot less independence for future generations.  I am no longer surprised, but I am amazed at how President Bush and his fellow Republicans are so eager to chip away at Social Security, weaken Social Security, and ultimately play roulette with our people's Social Security trust funds, which we voted seven times to put in the Social Security lockbox. They are raiding the lockbox.                              {time}  1730  The American people deserve better. Working families deserve better. Your grandmothers and grandfathers deserve better. They have earned a secure retirement.  We have to get back to the fiscal basics and put Social Security first. Would you rather have $300 today, or Social Security for all of your retirement tomorrows? Congress is the protector of Social Security, the primaryprotector. It is the people's program, intended by President Roosevelt and its authors to allow generations of retirees to live with independence and dignity.  It is time for the Republican Party to stop the raid on Social Security, which as of today, again, amounts to, as of May 20, 2003, out of the trust funds, your trust funds, $498,863,013,699 or $1,714.24 for each single American who has paid into the system.                          ____________________
