 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues, I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by a high school student from Canaan Memorial High School in Vermont, who was speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       Mr. Houle: Congressman Sanders, imagine if you will a world      where you have personal choice and freedom to express your      inner thoughts and soul through forms of art and media. It      would be a world where if someone was offended, they would      make the choice not to listen, but they would not try to      suppress your right to express it. In this world everyone      respects an individual's right to free expression and speech.       Recently K-Mart has said they refuse to sell CDS with      offensive lyrics. This is blatant censorship. When someone      tries to take away your right to hear something, it is      censorship.       There have been many incidents in the United States      recently in which censorship has become a factor. For      example, in Arizona Newt Gingrich calls for the closing of      the Flag Art Exhibit. In Florida a Cuban scholar's visit was      canceled after a citizens protest. In Utah a printing company      refused to reproduce photos for a women's magazine. In      Michigan a ``Where Do Queers Come From'' exhibit at a local      college was closed. And finally in Kentucky, ``Blasphemous      art'' caused an outcry at the University of Kentucky. In      school libraries Ernest Hemingway's novels are banned as are      several good pieces of literature. Around the world films are      banned and are censored. Film festivals and exhibitions are      censored as well.       Our grounds for this censorship is broad and well-defined,      but are speculative and opinionated. Unfortunately, opinions      vary and freedom of speech is a right, but unfortunately      rights are being ignored and opinions are preordained.       As you can see, censorship is alive and well in America      where our First Amendment right is supposed to be enforced.      It has gotten so bad around the world that the life of Salman      Rushdie was threatened for writing The Satanic Verses. It's      gotten so bad that we've had to turn to a porno king, Larry      Flynt as a savior of the First Amendment right.       Basically what it comes down to is if it offends you, you      can always turn the other cheek. Pornography even has its      value. Some people just cannot live without their      pornography, and if it was not for pornography they could be      doing much worse things.       If you deny someone's right to see something or say      something that they want to say, that eventually they are      just going to explode.       I myself do not want a burned flag, but I think if someone      wants to protest that way it should be allowed because I know      myself I do not pledge allegiance to the flag, I pledge      allegiance to the country.       In conclusion, one can censor a work of art but not the      idea. The idea will fester and come out in a much more      explosive, sometimes more violent way.       Thank you for your time, Congressman Sanders. We hope you      help us fight for the cause in your position of leadership.                               ____________________
