Speaker, I very much appreciate the gentleman yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, I want to rise as someone who had the great honor and privilege of serving with Congressman Pickle. He served with great distinction, with great commitment to this country, obviously outstanding service to the State of Texas.  But he was a national legislator and brought credit to himself and to our country and to this House as a Member. I am privileged and honored to be among his friends, his former colleagues, and supporters of this legislation.
