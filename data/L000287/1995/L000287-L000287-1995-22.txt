Madam Speaker, the day you have longed for is here. You have brought the U.S. Government to a halt and the verge of default. I hope you are happy.  And why has it come to this. Why are our national parks closed, why can't senior citizens or veterans apply for Social Security or veteran benefits, why can not people get their passports? Because you have not done your work. You have been so busy pursuing your extremist ideological agenda that you have ignored the business of the people. And now you want to blame the President.  Well, the President is right and the American people agree. The President will not give in to your drastic proposals: Your extremist plans to cut Medicare, destroy our environment, defund education and give tax breaks to the rich while raising taxes on working families.  Stop playing the blame game, Madam Speaker. Stop blackmailing the President. Show some leadership. Send the President a clean bill and he will sign it, and let us get on with the business of governing.  The American people are watching and waiting.                          ____________________
