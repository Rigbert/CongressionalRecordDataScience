You know, we had a dispute in my State between FERC and the State, and the State prevailed because the State demonstrated that the project approved by FERC would have caused the decimation of a fishery. The State had wildlife concerns, and also would have very detrimental effects on a very, very heavily used river in terms of whitewater rafting.  So I am not assured by the idea that these faceless, nameless bureaucrats at FERC are going to be the protectors of the 50 States' sovereign water rights. So I would reluctantly rise in objection to the amendment, as I understand it. I have hardly been given the opportunity to review it.
