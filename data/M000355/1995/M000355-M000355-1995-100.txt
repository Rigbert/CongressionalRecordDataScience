  Now, I personally support, in concept, what the Senator from North Carolina is trying to do.  What I am mystified by is why it is not possible, on the assumption that my friend from Massachusetts and other Democrats support this bill, why it is not possible to reach an agreement that would take this issue off of this bill and have it dealt with free standing. It seems to me it serves everybody's interest, the Senator from North Carolina, the Senator from Massachusetts. Certainly it serves my interest, because I would like to see this bill become law.  I am mystified as to why we are not able to work out an agreement, particularly since the Senator from North Carolina generally offered to allow--how many nominees?
