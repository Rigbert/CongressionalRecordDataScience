 President, this amendment is an overkill. My colleague and I are the first ones to say Berkeley made a huge mistake. Berkeley apologized for that mistake. Following all of this, the recruiting station wrote a letter to the University of California and thanked them for their steadfast service and accommodation of the recruiting center.  Essentially, what the Senator is trying to do is punish by rescinding any congressionally directed spending item for Berkeley, any entities located in such city, such as the Roberts Center which treats paralyzed veterans, and to transfer such funds to the Marine Corps.
