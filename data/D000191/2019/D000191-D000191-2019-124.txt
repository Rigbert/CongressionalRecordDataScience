 In 2017, Oregon State University Professor Dr. William Ripple published ``World Scientists' Warning to Humanity: A Second Notice,'' which has been endorsed by more than 15,000 scientists from 184 countries. He outlined the irrefutable proof of the damage climate change has caused over the last twenty-five years. He also provided effective steps we can take to combat climate change.  I urge my colleagues to read his report and take action before it is too late.          The Scientists' Warning to Humanity: A Second Notice   (By William J.

These scientists called on humankind to curtail      environmental destruction and cautioned ``a great change in      our stewardship of the Earth and the life on it is required,      if vast human misery is to be avoided.'' In their manifesto,      they showed that humans were on a collision course with the      natural world. They expressed concern about current,      impending, or potential damage on planet Earth involving      ozone depletion, freshwater availability, marine fishery      collapses, ocean dead zones, forest loss, biodiversity      destruction, climate change, and continued human population      growth. They proclaimed that fundamental changes are urgently      needed to avoid the consequences our present course would      bring.       The authors of the 1992 declaration feared humanity was      pushing the Earth's ecosystems beyond their capacity to      support the web of life. They described how we are fast      approaching the many limits of what the planet can tolerate      without substantial and irreversible harm. They pleaded that      we stabilize the human population, describing how our large      numbers--swelled by another 2 billion people since 1992, a      35% increase--exert stresses on the Earth that can overwhelm      other efforts to realize a sustainable future (Crist et al.      2017). They implored that we cut greenhouse gas (GHG)      emissions and phase out fossil fuels, staunch deforestation,      and reverse the trend of collapsing biodiversity.       On the 25th anniversary of their call, we look back at      their warning and evaluate the human response by exploring      available time-series data. Since 1992, with the exception of      stabilizing the stratospheric ozone layer, humanity has      failed to make sufficient progress in generally solving these      foreseen environmental challenges and, alarmingly, most of      them are getting far worse (Figure 1, supplemental table S1).      Especially troubling is the probability of catastrophic      climate change due to rising GHGs from burning fossil fuels      (Hansen et al. 2013), deforestation (Malhi et al. 2008), and      agricultural production, particularly from farming ruminants      for meat consumption (Ripple et al. 2014). Moreover, we have      unleashed a mass extinction event, the sixth in roughly 540      million years, wherein many current life forms could be      annihilated or at least committed to extinction by the end of      this century.       Humanity is now being given a second notice as illustrated      by these alarming trends (Figure 1). We are jeopardizing our      future by not reigning in our intense but highly uneven      material consumption and by not perceiving continued rapid      population growth as a primary driver behind many ecological      and even societal threats (Crist et al. 2017). By failing to      adequately promote family planning, implement carbon taxes,      incentivize renewable energy, and set aside substantial      swaths of habitat in well-protected reserves, humanity is not      taking the urgent steps needed to safeguard our imperiled      biosphere.       As most political leaders respond to pressure; scientists,      media influencers, and lay citizens must insist that their      governments take immediate action, as a moral imperative to      current and future generations of human and other life. With      a groundswell of organized grassroots efforts, dogged      opposition can be overwhelmed and political leaders compelled      to do the right thing. It is also time to re-examine and      change our individual behaviours, including limiting our own      reproduction (to replacement level, at most) and drastically      diminishing our consumption of fossil fuels, meat, and other      resources.       The rapid global decline in ozone-depleting substances      shows that we can make positive change when we act      decisively. We have also made advancements in reducing      extreme poverty and hunger. Other notable progress (which      does not yet show up in the global datasets in Figure 1)      includes: the rapid decline in fertility rates in some      regions attributable to investments in girls' and women's      education, the promising decline in the rate of deforestation      in parts of the Amazon (which might still be reversed), and      the rapid growth in the renewable-energy sector. We have      learned much since 1992, but the advancement of urgently      needed changes in environmental policy and human behavior is      still far from sufficient.       Sustainability transitions come about in diverse ways and      all require civil-society pressure and evidence-based      advocacy, political leadership, and a solid understanding of      policy instruments, markets and other drivers. A dozen      examples of diverse and effective steps humanity can take to      transition to sustainability include: 1) prioritizing the      enactment of connected reserves for a significant proportion      of the world's terrestrial and marine habitats, 2)      maintaining nature's ecosystem services by halting conversion      of forests, grasslands, and other native habitats; 3)      rewilding regions with native species, especially apex      predators, to repair damaged ecosystems; 4) developing and      adopting adequate policy instruments to redress the current      poaching crisis and the exploitation and trade of threatened      species; 5) reducing food waste through education and better      infrastructure; 6) promoting dietary shift towards mostly      plant-based foods; 7) further reducing fertility rates by      ensuring women have access to education, family-planning      services, especially where such resources are still lacking;      8) increasing outdoor nature education for children; 9)      developing progressive tax incentives for reducing      overconsumption; 10) reducing the consumption rate of raw      commodities by banning planned obsolescence of goods; 11)      devising and promoting new green technologies and massively      adopting renewable energy sources; and 12) estimating a      scientifically defensible, sustainable human population size      for the long-term while rallying nations and leaders to      support that vital goal.       To prevent widespread misery and catastrophic biodiversity      loss, humanity must practice a more environmentally      sustainable alternative to business-as-usual. This      prescription was well articulated by the world's leading      scientists twenty-five years ago, but in most respects, we      have not heeded their warning. It is about to be too late to      shift course away from our failing trajectory, and time is      running out. We must recognize, in our day-to-day lives and      in our governing institutions, that the Earth with all its      life is our only home.                          ____________________
