Speaker, this week is American Education Week and I would like to take this opportunity to recognize and honor all the men and women across the country who serve as Education Support Professional, ESP, in our Nation's public schools. Education Support Professionals are essential school employees who interact daily with students, staff and parents.  Public School drivers are essential school employees who interact with students, teachers, parents and the community every day. Bus drivers are the first and final link in the daily chain of events for every student in a school district.  Standards of performance for bus drivers in a given day will include but not be limited to: checking all safety and communications equipment on the bus at the beginning and end of each day, protect children from unsanitary conditions, returning lost and found student personal property, manage emergency situations, handle and stabilize student behavior which may put them and other students or staff at risk.  Take a moment to appreciate and recognize this fine group of Americans who are dedicated, loyal and committed to our future and the educational enhancement of all public school students.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E2424]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                HONORING EDUCATION SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS                                 ______                                                          HON.
