President, those of us working constructively to extend the USA PATRIOT Act have repeatedly offered to enter into a short-term extension while we work out the differences and improve this reauthorization legislation. The extension we are passing for 6 months is a commonsense solution that allows us to take a few more weeks to get this right for all Americans.  A majority of Senators--Republicans, Democrats, those Senators who voted for cloture, those who voted against cloture on the conference report that failed to pass the Senate--have joined on a letter urging the Republican leader to act on this commonsense offer by calling up a short-term extension bill.  As soon as it became apparent that the conference report filed by the Republican leadership would be unacceptable to the Senate, I joined on Thursday, December 8, in urging a 3-month extension to work out a better bill. On the first day the Senate was in session, Monday, December 12, Senator Sununu and I introduced such a bill, S. 2082. Wesent out a Dear Colleague letter to other Senators on December 13 and that bipartisan bill now has 47 cosponsors.  We offered this solution before the vote on the Senate floor last Friday. Contrary to the false claims and misrepresentations by some, there is no effort to do away with the PATRIOT Act. That is just not true. Along with others here in the Senate, I am seeking to mend and extend the PATRIOT Act, not to end it. There is no reason why the American people cannot have a PATRIOT Act that is both effective and that adequately protects their rights and their privacy.  Republican and Democratic Senators joined together last week to say we can do better to protect Americans' liberties while ensuring our national security is as strong as it can be.  Every single Senator--Republican and Democratic--voted in July to mend and extend the PATRIOT Act. I have joined with Senators of both parties in an effort to enact a short-term extension so that we can keep working to improve the bill. This is standard operating procedure in the Congress where we pass extensions in the nature of continuing resolutions regularly. The Sununu-Leahy bill to provide a 6-month extension, S. 2167, accomplishes this purpose. I thank the majority leader and Democratic leader for their leadership in passing this measure.  A clear majority of the Senate, Republican and Democrats, have come together and requested a short-term extension. These are Senators who voted for cloture and Senators who voted against cloture in an effort to improve the long-term extension of the PATRIOT Act. These are Republicans and Democrats.  No Democratic Senator opposes extending the PATRIOT Act. All of the 52 Senators who signed the letter to the majority leader urged its extension.  Our Nation is a democracy, founded on the principles of balanced government. We need to restore checks and balances in this country to protect us all and all that we hold dear. Our Congress and our courts provide checks on the abuse of executive authority and should protect our liberties.  We need to write the law so that Congress has provided its check in the law and so that courts can play their role, as well. All Americans need to take notice and need to demand that their liberties be maintained. We can do better and must do better for the American people.  Just this week, we celebrated the 214th anniversary of the passage of the Bill of Rights, the first 10 amendments to the Constitution of the United States. These amendments ensure some of our most vital freedoms, including the freedom of speech, religion and press in the first amendment. Within these amendments is also the right ``to be secure in our persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.'' The Bill of Rights made clear not only the rights of the American people, but also the limitations on the power of government.  Just as we cannot allow ourselves to be lulled into a sense of false security when it comes to our national security, we cannot allow ourselves to be lulled into a blind trust regarding our freedoms and rights. We must remain vigilant on both counts or we stand to lose much that we hold dear.  In arguing for reauthorization of the USA PATRIOT Act, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales sought to assure us that ``concerns raised about the act's impact on civil liberties, while sincere, were unfounded.'' I am not reassured, however.  We need only pick up a morning newspaper to see how the overreaching of the Bush administration plagues our efforts to uphold democracy at home and throughout the world. We have seen secret arrests and secret hearings of hundreds of people for the first time in U.S. history; the abuse of detainees in U.S. custody; detentions without charges and denial of access to counsel; and the misapplication of the material witness statute as a sort of general preventive detention law. Such abuses harm our national security as well as our civil liberties because they serve as recruiting tools for terrorists, intimidate American communities from cooperating with law enforcement, and, by misusing limited antiterrorism resources, make it more likely that real terrorists will escape detection.  We have learned that the Pentagon maintains a secret database containing information on a wide cross-section of ordinary Americans. It keeps track of people like those in Vermont who planned peaceful protests of military recruiters, including one organized by Veterans for Peace. It monitored the activities of an antiwar group that met at the Quaker Meeting House in Lake Worth, FL, a year ago to plan a protest against military recruiting at local high schools.  Similarly, the FBI also engages in monitoring other ordinary, law-abiding citizens. Records show that the FBI kept information on Greenpeace, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, and on students and peace activists who attended a conference at Stanford University in 2002. In a similar story, a student at the University of Massachusetts/Dartmouth reportedly was visited by Federal agents in October, after he requested a copy of Mao Tse-Tung's tome on Communism called, ``The Little Red Book'' through the University's interlibrary loan program. If the FBI is investigating what book a college senior is borrowing, what is it that they are not investigating that they should be?  The New York Times reports that after September 11, 2001, when former Attorney General John Ashcroft loosened restrictions on the FBI to permit it to monitor Web sites, mosques, and other public entities, ``the FBI has used that authority to investigate not only groups with suspected ties to foreign terrorists, but also protest groups suspected of having links to violent or disruptive activities.'' For example, recently disclosed agency records show that FBI counterterrorism agents have conducted surveillance and intelligence-gathering operations on groups concerning the environment, animal cruelty, and poverty relief.  Now we are learning that President Bush has, for more than 4 years, been secretly authorizing warrantless surveillance of Americans inside the United States. In fact, he acknowledges issuing secret Presidential orders to authorize such warrantless surveillance more than 30 times since September 11, 2001.  The U.S. Supreme Court has consistently held for nearly 40 years that the monitoring and recording of private conversations constitutes a ``search and seizure'' within the meaning of the fourth amendment, extending as far back as the 1967 case, Katz v. United States. It was because of concerns over unconstitutional surveillance of Americans in the 1960s and 1970s that Congress enacted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in 1978 to provide a legal mechanism for the Government to engage in searches of Americans in connection with intelligence gathering. Unless pursuant to a criminal search warrant issued by a judge on a showing of probable cause, FISA warrants are the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance and the interception of electronic communications may be undertaken pursuant to the rule of law.  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act has been amended over time, and it has been adjusted several times since 9/11. Indeed, much of the PATRIOT Act includes FISA amendments. The law has been further amended since the PATRIOT Act, as well.  Congress allows the FISA Court to operate in secret and authorizes the Government to begin immediate surveillance in an emergency situation, so long as it seeks a warrant from the FISA Court within 72 hours. In addition, Congress has provided that following a declaration of war, the President may authorize electronic surveillance without a court order for a period not to exceed 15 days.  There has never been a leak reported out of the FISA Court. Furthermore, it has never been alleged that FISA's emergency procedures are inadequate or that FISA ties the hands of law enforcement. If the Bush administration believed that FISA was inadequate, it should have alerted Congress to these flaws. It did not. Instead, it worked with me and with others in the days following 9/11 to amend FISA. I chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee at that time, apparently the same time that the Bush administration began surveillance outside FISA. I was not informed of the President's secret eavesdropping program while I chaired the Judiciary Committee in 2001 and 2002. I read about it for the first time in the press last week. Spying on Americans without safeguards to protect against the abuse of government power is unnecessary, and it is wrong.  Over the last week, we have learned of long-term, widespread eavesdropping on Americans by the Bush administration without compliance to the law, without court oversight, and without congressional authorization. Compounding that already troubling discovery were new, disturbing reports that the FBI has been monitoring U.S. advocacy groups working on behalf of the environment and civil rights issues, Quaker meetings and students checking out books to write school papers. This is all too reminiscent of the dark days when a Republican President compiled ``enemies lists'' and eavesdropped on political opponents and broke into doctors' offices and used the vast power of the executive branch to violate the constitutional rights of Americans.  I was elected to the Senate in the aftermath of Watergate and the White House plumbers and the secret wars that led to the impeachment articles being considered against President Nixon. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was passed in 1978 as part of the reform and reaction to those abuses. As I have noted, this law has been extensively updated in accordance with the Bush administration's requests in the aftermath of 9/11 and has been modified further in the last 4 years with respect to so-called lone wolf terrorists. Neither in the first year of his Presidency or in the aftermath of 9/11 or in the 4 years since enactment of the PATRIOT Act has President Bush come to Congress and asked us for authority to engage in the kind of extensive surveillance on Americans by the National Security Agency that The New York Times reported and the President has now confirmed that he secretly ordered and has reaffirmed more than 30 times.  We are a nation of laws, and the fact that no person is above the law is a bedrock principle upon which this Nation was founded and one we are defending and fighting for abroad. This type of covert spying on American citizens and targeted groups on American soil betrays that principle.  The chairman of the Judiciary Committee has the right instinct and was right to announce that we need hearings and an explanation, and the American people deserve an accounting for this troubling revelation. Earlier this week, I joined with Senators Reid and Rockefeller in requesting specific information from the Bush administration on its covert spying operations domestically. I cannot emphasize strongly enough how important it is for the Bush administration to cooperate with Congress on this matter. No one should be able to conduct secret, illegal spying programs on our soil with no accountability to Congress or the American people.  Congress has passed laws that established a legal way to eavesdrop on al-Qaida and other potential terrorist organizations. Internationally that monitoring should have been done more effectively before 9/11 by this administration. We have established legal authority in emergency circumstances for the Attorney General to proceed first so long as he promptly seeks court approval thereafter. We even provided a 15-day window after a declaration of war. This program has apparently been going on for not 4 days or 14 days but for more than 4 years. That is not pursuant to or consistent with FISA. In the PATRIOT Act and other actions since 9/11, Congress has created additional authorities. But it is Congress that passes laws. The President cannot simply declare when he wishes to follow the law and when he chooses not to.  What happens to the rule of law if those in power abuse it and only adhere to it selectively? What happens to our liberties when the Government decides it would rather not follow the rules designed to protect them?  The Bush administration, in secret legal justifications for a secret eavesdropping program, apparently argues that when the Congress authorized the use of force in September 2001 to attack al-Qaida in Afghanistan, it authorized warrantless searches and eavesdropping on Americans. I voted for that authorization. This program is not what I voted for. Congress did not sign a blank check. The power to eavesdrop on Americans is not even authority that the Bush administration asked for from Congress.  I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee when the President's program was undertaken, and I was never informed of the program or its purported legal justification. In this, as with its detention and interrogation practices, this administration has chosen to go it alone. That is wrong, and it is corrosive to our system of checks and balances.  This is a Government with three co-equal branches. As Justice O'Connor reminded the Bush administration, even wartime does not give the President a blank check with regard to power. As I said last week, the same lawyers who advised the President that he was above the law when it came to torture, in a memorandum the Bush administration has had to disavow and withdraw when it was brought to light, have apparently advised the Bush administration that this President has authority to conduct warrantless surveillance of Americans. That is wrong. Accountability is sacrificed when there is rampant unilateralism.  No one can just ignore the law or the constitutional limits on Executive authority that protect Americans' liberties. Accordingly, I urge the Bush administration to make public its purported legal justification for what I view as an illegal program of spying on Americans without court approval. I urge them not just to recite bumper sticker slogans or conclusory statements that they view their actions as consistent with the self-serving rewriting of the law they have secretly made amongst themselves, but to provide that legal justification in the light of day so that Congress and Americans can consider it. Provide and post the legal memoranda.  Al-Qaida knows that we eavesdrop and wiretap. Whether we do so legally, whether we protect the liberties of Americans by respecting the constitutional requirements for court-issued warrants, these aspects are of little concern to terrorists but matter greatly to Americans. I expect that when the supposed legal underpinnings for the President's eavesdropping program are examined, they, too, will be withdrawn and disavowed by this administration. I also expect that they will be rejected by an honest review in Congress, in the courts, and certainly by the American people. I ask that a copy of a letter to the President of which I referred be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                Washington, DC, December 20, 2005.     The President,     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: Your recent acknowledgement of the      existence of a highly-classified program to conduct      electronic surveillance on U.S. citizens and permanent      residents without obtaining a court order as required by law      has raised a number of troubling issues in the minds of the      American people. That is why Democrats and Republicans have      called for prompt and thorough congressional investigation of      this program. We write to ask that you immediately provide      Congress with additional details on the extent and scope of      this program, your legal justification for your actions, and      your efforts to inform Congress about this program.       The relevant law governing surveillances, the Foreign      Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (``EISA''), could not      be clearer on the need to obtain a court order for such      surveillance. It also provides for emergency procedures and      for authorization of electronic surveillance during a time of      war, with reasonable time limits beyond which a court order      must be obtained. We are deeply troubled by your assertions      that the Constitution and the Authorization for Use of      Military Force passed by Congress following the 9/11 attacks      provide you justification for contravening a statute's clear      language. In your public statements to date, you have not      made a convincing legal argument for the authority to do so.       In addition, public statements by several of the handful of      Members of Congress who were provided a briefing on this      program indicate that insufficient information was provided      to them under ground rules that did not enable Congress to      conduct satisfactory oversight. There are questions whether      your Administration has properly complied with the National      Security Act of 1947 requirement to keep the appropriate      committees of jurisdiction ``fully and currently informed of      the intelligence activities of the United States.''       It is important for Congress to review these matters. We      respectfully ask that you cooperate fully to provide all      necessary information on all relevant aspects of this      program, including presidential orders, supporting legal      opinions, complete descriptions of actions taken under the      program, and other information, to the appropriate oversight      committees.       As Congress begins to examine this program in greater      detail, it is clear Congress and the American people need      immediately to understand at least four issues:       (1) Under what specific legal authorities did you authorize      warrantless electronic surveillance of American citizens and      permanent residents inside the United States?       (2) Given your assertion that the FISA is insufficient in      providing appropriate authority and procedures to protect      Americans from terrorism, what specific powers or authorities      are insufficient and why, in the four years since the 9/11      attacks, has your Administration not proposed correcting      modifications?       (3) You have stated that you authorized the NSA to      intercept the international communications of people with      known links to al Qaeda and related terrorist organizations.      Have you ever authorized the interception, without a warrant,      of purely domestic communications, or communications of      people without known links to al Qaeda and related terrorist      organizations?       (4) Could you please provide additional information on the      legal and other justifications for limiting briefings on      these matters to a handful of Members of Congress, as well as      information on the dates, attendance, and issues discussed at      these briefings, so it can be determined whether you complied      with the letter and spirit of the National Security Act of      1947?           Sincerely,     Harry Reid,       Democratic Leader.     John D. Rockefeller IV,       Vice Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence.     Patrick Leahy,       Ranking Democrat, Committee on the Judiciary.
