 ECTC provides education and training to all types of Kentuckians to prepare them to succeed in a constantly changing world.  ECTC is a member of the Kentucky Community and Technical College System. It provides accessible and affordable education and training through academic and technical associate degrees; diploma and certificate programs in occupational fields; pre-baccalaureate education; adult, continuing and developmental education; customized training for business and industry; and distance learning.  ECTC has its roots in the founding of the Elizabethtown Community College, which first opened its doors in 1964 to 355 students from 11 counties. Meanwhile, Elizabethtown Technical College was founded in 1965 through a bond issue by the Elizabethtown Independent School Board. ECTC was formed by the consolidation of the two schools in 2004, following historic legislation in 1997 that established the Kentucky Community and Technical College System.  For five decades, ECTC has enriched the lives of citizens by providing access to quality, affordable academic, technical and community education programs, and by partnering with communities to enhance the economic vitality of the region. A comprehensive college with regional reach, ECTC now offers certificates, diplomas and associate degrees through 34 academic and technical programs on the Elizabethtown, Springfield, Leitchfield and Fort Knox campuses, and at extended campus sites throughout its 12-county service area.  Enrollment has grown steadily from 355 students in 1964 to 7,000 today, and thousands of alumni have distinguished themselves through service to their professions and communities.  During the 2014-2015 academic year, the college will celebrate 50 years of educational excellence and service to Kentuckians. I want to be among the many who congratulate ECTC for 50 years of outstanding service in education to the central Kentucky region. I want to commend the school for 50 years of educating Kentuckians, and thank its president/CEO, Dr. Thelma J. White, for her extraordinary leadership of the institution.                          ____________________
