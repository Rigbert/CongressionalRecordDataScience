 President, I rise today to discuss the importance of music education in a child's educational journey. As a former music student myself, I believe every student should have access to this valuable area of study.  Three quarters of Americans have been involved in a music program during their time in school. Over half of those participants continue their involvement with music after the 12th grade. This is a testament to the positive impact of music education and why we must continue to provide our students with opportunities to pursue these programs.  Music education also provides students with the opportunity to express creativity and to develop skills that will benefit them throughout the rest of their lives. In addition to its inherent cultural value, music education provides a variety of unique avenues for intellectual growth. We also know that musical training has a profound impact on other skills including speech and language, memory and attention, and even the ability to convey emotions vocally.  I believe music and other arts are among society's most compelling and effective pathways for offering our children rich and fulfilling educational experiences. It is also important that we acknowledge the music educators who have instilled many generations of students with the gift of music. For these reasons, I am proud to introduce a resolution today recognizing June 24, 2011 through June 28, 2011 as National Music Education Week.                          ____________________
