Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank the Speaker for her very eloquent remarks and for her tenacity in promoting human rights and respect for the rule of law in all of China, including and especially with today's focus on Xinjiang, where, unfortunately, XiJinping is conducting massive, massive crimes against humanity against the Muslim Uighurs. So I thank her for that leadership.  I thank Chairman Engel, Ranking Member McCaul, Brad Sherman, and Ranking Member Ted Yoho for their deep and abiding commitment to the suffering people of Xinjiang as well.  I would also like to express my special thanks to the 128 bipartisan cosponsors of my bill, the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2019, H.R. 649, comprehensive human rights legislation that I introduced earlier this year with lead Democratic cosponsor Tom Suozzi to address the massive crimes against humanity committed by the Chinese Government against the Uighurs.  The legislation would require the administration to categorize and report on the human rights abuses being committed by the Chinese Communist Party each and every day, take specific steps to sanction Chinese officials for these abuses, especially through the use of the Magnitsky Act, and stop, to the greatest extent possible, the Chinese Government's efforts to create a high-tech police and surveillance state.  With endorsement of our bill 12 months ago and cosponsorship by the Speaker herself, as well as endorsement by the Washington Post, which said, a full year ago, ``This has become''--that is to say, the situation in Xinjiang--``one of the world's most urgent human rights crises. Congress should pass the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act.'' Today the Senate bill is before us, and I encourage my colleagues and the cosponsors of H.R. 649 to vote for it.  Mr. Speaker, at a congressional hearing that I cochaired last year, Mihrigul Tursun recounted her horrifying ordeal with torture, sexual abuse, and detention in one of China's mass internment camps in Xinjiang.  She broke down weeping, telling us that she pleaded with God to end her life. Her Chinese jailers restrained her to a table, increased the electrical currents coursing through her body, and mocked her belief in God. She was tortured simply for being an ethnic Uighur and a Muslim in China.  There are millions of stories like this waiting to be told about the crimes against humanity being committed each and every day by the Chinese Government against the Uighurs, the Kazakhs, and the Turkic Muslims.  Given that this year is the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, maybe we should not be surprised by the cruelty and brutality of the Chinese Communist Party. But the size and scale of what is happening in Xinjiang is audaciously repressive, even by China's low standards:  The mass internment of millions of people on a scale that has not been seen since the Holocaust; children ripped from the warm embrace of their families to be indoctrinated in communist ideology and forced to renounce their religious culture and language; rape, sexual abuse, and forced abortions of women being held in internment camps; forced labor on a scale that allows Chinese companies to profit from modern-day slavery.  That atrocities such as these can exist in the 21st century is astounding and enormously sad.  We cannot be silent. We must demand an end to these barbaric practices and accountability from the Chinese Government. We must say ``never again'' to the cultural genocide and the atrocities suffered by the Uighurs and others in China.  Chinese authorities initially denied the existence of mass internment camps, Mr. Speaker, and even now portray them as vocational training centers. What a cruel joke. They employed lies, censorship, and economic coercion to stifle discussion of their crimes.  But documents obtained by The New York Times and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists have exposed the brutality behind Beijing's plans to radically and coercively transform the culture and religion of ethnic Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other Muslims in China.  The leaked internal papers show detailed plans to intern between 1 million and 3 million Uighurs in modern-day concentration camps, where they are subjected to severe human rights abuses and Orwellian indoctrination efforts for those ``whose thinking has been infected.''  At the same time, Beijing instituted plans to erase the influence of Islam in western China, bulldozing mosques and shrines, severely throttling all religious practice, and forcing camp detainees to renounce their faith.  The leaked documents also show that Xi Jinping himself has directed the crackdown, saying that the Communist Party must put ``the organs of dictatorship'' to work and show--his words--``absolutely no mercy'' in dealing with the Uighurs and other Muslims.  In one speech exposed by the leaked documents, President Xi Jinping says, ``The weapons of the people's democratic dictatorship must be wielded without any hesitation or wavering.''  In 2017, he told thousands of police officers and troops standing at attention to prepare for ``a smashing, obliterating offensive.''  According to the documents, Communist Party officials who were reluctant to carry out Xi's draconian policies were investigated and expunged--and worse:  ``Secret teams of investigators traveled across the region, identifying those who were not doing enough. In 2017, the party opened more than 12,000 investigations into party members in Xinjiang.''  Xi Jinping has created, Mr. Speaker, one of the worst human rights tragedies on the face of the Earth. Xi Jinping and his government are directly responsible--directly responsible--for these crimes against humanity.  Our hope is that a reckoning is coming, but only if the international community stands up to China. I would note with some sadness, notably absent are voices from many Muslim countries, and I have raised it myself with many leaders of Muslim countries.                              {time}  1730  They have not been as critical of China as they ought to be. They need to speak out and to do it boldly and very clearly.  I do want to commend the Trump administration for its actions over the past several years. They have issued strong statements and, according to the U.S. Commerce Department just last month, 28 government agencies and businesses were placed on the Entity List and barred.  The way the Secretary of Commerce put it: `` `The U.S. Government and Department of Commerce cannot and will not tolerate the brutal suppression of ethnic minorities within China,' said Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. `This action will ensure that our technologies, fostered in an environment of individual liberty and free enterprise, are not used to repress defenseless minority populations.' ''  These are important steps. This legislation, however, takes the next step. More must be done. Chinese officials, as I said earlier, need to be held accountable for crimes against humanity, including Global Magnitsky and international sanctions and U.N. investigations.  Those who tortured Mihrigul Turson should know that justice is coming for them as well. And the Chinese Government companies profiting from forced labor need to be barred from selling their products made so horribly by forced labor from coming into this country.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
