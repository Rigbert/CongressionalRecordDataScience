Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I appreciate the gentleman's comments and I appreciate his support, and it is more than just beaches. It is fisheries, ecosystems that are critical to the food chain in the Gulf of Mexico. This is more than just beaches, and beaches are important. And I represent a lot of beaches and they are beautiful, and we welcome all of you to come.
