 President, I rise today to introduce a bill with Senator Allen that would allow hybrids to access High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes.  California and other States, such as Arizona, Colorado, and Georgia, do not want to risk losing their Federal highway dollars by acting without a waiver from the Department of Transportation to implement laws permitting hybrid vehicles to use HOV lanes.  Virginia has decided to take that risk because the benefit of having more fuel efficient cars on the roads is greater.  This bill would allow the Department of Transportation to grant such a waiver to States.  The purpose of this bill is to encourage Americans to buy and drive hybrids, which provide an innovative solution to help reduce our thirst for gasoline.  Allowing hybrids into HOV lanes is a low-cost and quick incentive to promote the use of hybrids.  Hybrid vehicles are more fuel efficient than cars powered by internal combustion engines and they emit fewer greenhouse gases that lead to global warming.  Burning less gas can also help us to gain independence from foreign sources of energy.  The cost of hybrid technology will decrease by bringing more hybrids into the market.  And, people can make smarter, more fuel efficient, less polluting choices while getting to and from work faster.  Several States, including my State of California, have acted on their own to permit hybrid vehicles to use HOV lanes.  Current Federal law, however, only grants States the flexibility to allow electric or natural gas powered vehicles to drive in the HOV lanes with a single passenger.  Right now, there are approximately 20,000 high-mileage hybrid car owners in California waiting to take advantage of a State law that went into effect on January 1, 2005. This State law, sponsored by assemblywoman Fran Pavley, allows hybrid vehicles that get 45 miles-per-gallon or better to use diamond or HOV lanes until 2008.  As California has 40 percent of the Nation's carpool lanes, high-mileage hybrid owners stand to gain a significant benefit for driving these cars.  Some critics have expressed concerns that HOV lanes will get overloaeded, but each State can stop the program if congestion becomes a problem.  Hybrids only account for a fraction of the cars sold today--43,435 hybrids out of a total of 16.7 million vehicles were sold in 2003!  If States want to act to encourage their citizens to drive more fuel efficient, less polluting vehicles, we need to give them the tools to do so.  It is my hope that Congress will pass this bill quickly so that hybrid drivers in California, Georgia, Colorado and elsewhere can take advantage of the HOV lanes.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 553       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. HOV-LANE EXEMPTION FOR LOW-EMISSION AND HYBRID                    VEHICLES       Section 102(a)(2) of title 23, United States Code, is      amended--       (1) by striking the first sentence and inserting the      following:       ``(A) In general.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a State      may permit a vehicle with fewer than 2 occupants to operate      in high occupancy vehicle lanes if the vehicle is--       ``(i)(I) certified as meeting the inherently low-emission      vehicle evaporative emission standard under part 88 of title      40, Code of Federal Regulations (or a successor regulation)      (including a vehicle produced before or during the 2004 model      year that meets that standard); and       ``(II) labeled in accordance with section 88.312-93(c) of      title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (or a successor      regulation); or       ``(ii) a motor vehicle that--       ``(I) draws propulsion energy from onboard sources of      stored energy produced or stored by--       ``(aa) an internal combustion or heat engine using      combustible fuel; and       ``(bb) a rechargeable energy storage system that provides      at least 5 percent of the maximum available power; and       ``(II) meets such other requirements or criteria as may be      specified by the State.''; and       (2) in the second sentence, by striking ``Such permission''      and inserting the following:       ``(B) Revocation.--The permission under subparagraph (A)''.                                 ______                                       By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Grassley,         Mr. Feingold, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Levin,         Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Corzine, and Mr. Dayton):  S. 555. A bill to amend the Sherman Act to make oil-producing and exporting cartels illegal; to the Committee on the Judiciary.  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleagues--Senators Kohl, Leahy, Grassley, Feingold, Snowe, Schumer, Durbin, Levin, Boxer, Wyden, Corzine, and Dayton--to introduce the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act of 2005 (NOPEC). This legislation would give the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission legal authority to bring an antitrust case against the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).  Every consumer in America knows that gasoline prices have reached record highs recently. Likewise, the price of home heating oil has dramatically increased. These price increases have been acutely painful to people in my home State of Ohio.  Moreover, the rise in jet fuel prices is crippling our already weak airline industry. One of the main reasons that many U.S. airlines have not been able to make a profit has been due to skyrocketing jet fuel costs. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2004, Continental Airlines' jet fuel costs were $453 million, which was a 48 percent increase compared to last year, and Delta's jet fuel costs were $385 million, which was 76 percent increase compared to last year. No wonder so many U.S. airlines are teetering on the edge of bankruptcy or are already in bankruptcy.  What is the cause of these high gas and fuel prices? There are a number of factors at play, but there is clear agreement among industry experts about the primary cause of high gas and fuel prices--and that is the increase in imported crude oil prices. Who sets crude oil prices? OPEC does. The unacceptably high price of imported crude oil is a direct result of price fixing by the OPEC nations to keep the price of oil unnaturally high.  OPEC's hunger for ill-gotten gains is astounding. It seems its appetite can never be satisfied. For example, despite the fact that oil prices recently hit the historic high of $55 a barrel, OPEC members met in December 2004 and decided to cut the output of oil by another 1 million barrels. When demand is high and supplies are cut, that means prices will increase. Nonetheless, OPEC cut production. This is an outrage.  OPEC is probably the most notorious example of an illegal cartel in the world today. It is an affront to the principle that markets should be free. Nation after nation has adopted antitrust laws that make it illegal to fix prices. In 1998, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, then composed of 29 member nations, issued a formal recommendation denouncing price fixing. OPEC's continued actions, in ongoing defiance of American and international antitrust norms, should not be tolerated.  Until now, however, OPEC has effectively received a ``free pass'' from prosecution under U.S. antitrust laws. For over two decades, enforcement has been constrained by two related court opinions. In 1979, a Federal district court found that OPEC's price-setting decisions were ``governmental'' acts. As a result, they were given sovereign status and protected by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. Subsequently, in 1981, a Federal court of appeals declined to consider the appeal of that antitrust case based on the so-called ``act of state'' doctrine, which holds that a court will not consider a case regarding the legality of the acts of a foreign nation.  Our bill would effectively reverse these decisions. It makes it clear that OPEC's activities are not protected by sovereign immunity and that the Federal courts should not decline to hear a case against OPEC based on the ``act of state'' doctrine. As a result, under NOPEC, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission could bring an antitrust enforcement action against OPEC's member nations. This bill would force OPEC to begin pricing in a competitive, free-market manner or face the possibility of civil or criminal antitrust prosecution.  Senator Kohl and I have introduced this bill three times before--in 2000, 2001, and 2004. We intend to keep fighting for American consumers and businesses so that they will not be fleeced by OPEC in the future.  NOPEC says to OPEC: When you want to do business with America, you must abide by our antitrust laws and the rules of the free market. And when OPEC, one day, abides by the rules of the free market, we will all see lower oil and gas prices.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 555       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``No Oil Producing and      Exporting Cartels Act of 2005'' or ``NOPEC''.     SEC. 2. SHERMAN ACT.       The Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. 1 et seq.) is amended by adding      after section 7 the following:     ``SEC. 7A.
