I am troubled, though, about where we are with the national security letters. Yes, they existed for years, but they were greatly expanded with the PATRIOT Act. We know that. I am also concerned as we consider this kind of legal language that there will be a chilling effect on the exercise of the right to counsel, and I get that again without being able to go into the details because of my examination of the issue. I am not going to debate the Senator's good-faith efforts; they have always been to try to strike a balance. But I am concerned that something that even the Government--the executive branch admits this is a tool that should be used carefully, at a time, as I said, when you open the morning newspaper and every day you see another effort to not strike this balance. I think we ought to stay at this national security letter issue and deal with concerns raised here with respect to secrecy and exercise of right to counsel.  My good friend from Pennsylvania and I have worked together on so many issues, and I want him to know of my desire to do it and my respect for his ability to get into some of these technical questions in a fashion that is almost unparalleled.
