President, earlier this month I introduced the Railroad Crossing Delay Reduction Act, S. 1015, with my colleagues, Senators Levin and Stabenow.   This legislation would accelerate efforts at the U.S. Department of Transportation to address the issue of rail safety by requiring the Secretary of Transportation to issue specific regulations regarding trains that block automobile traffic at railroad crossings. Currently, there are no Federal limits on how long trains can block crossings. The Railroad Crossing Delay Reduction Act would simply minimize automobile traffic delay caused by trains blocking traffic at railroad grade crossings.  In northeastern Illinois, there are frequent blockages at rail crossings. These blocked crossings prevent emergency vehicles, such as fire trucks, police cars, ambulances, and other related vehicles from getting to their destinations during the times of need. This is a serious problem and one I hope to address by passage of this important legislation.  Blocked rail crossings also delay drivers by preventing them from getting to their destinations. Motorists, knowing they will have to wait for a train to move at blocked crossings, sometimes try to beat the train or ignore signals completely. This is a threat to public safety, and one that must stop. Motorists must act responsibly, but we can reduce the temptation by reducing delays.  Trains stopped for long periods of time also tempt pedestrians to cross between the train cars. I've heard from local mayors in my State that children, in order to get home from school, cross between the rail cars. This is a terrible invitation to tragedy.  Trains blocking crossings cause traffic problems, congestion, and delay. These issues are very real. They are serious. And more importantly, they are a threat to public safety. To address these problems, I've introduced with my colleagues the Railroad Crossing Delay Reduction Act. I'm hopeful this legislation will provide for a safer Illinois and a safer Nation. I urge my colleagues to join the effort to reduce blocked rail-grade crossings by cosponsoring and supporting S. 1015.                          ____________________
