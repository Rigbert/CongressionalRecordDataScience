 President, today I am introducing the Child Support Penalty Fairness Act. This important legislation will remedy a flaw in federal child support laws that could cost California $4 billion annually.  On April 30, the Department of Health and Human Services announced its intent to reject the State of California's plan for child and spousal support because California does not have a centralized ``State Disbursement Unit'' that distributes child support collections to families. The mandatory penalty for this failure is loss of all federal child support administrative funding, which amounts to $300 million a year.  In addition, because the 1996 welfare reform law requires states to have an approved child support plan in order to receive the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families block grant, California could lose its entire TANF block grant of $3.7 billion a year.  In other words, California faces a $4 billion annual penalty for its failure to operate a State Disbursement Unit.  This so-called ``nuclear penalty'' is completely unjust and out of proportion. It will devastate the State of California's ability to serve low-income children and families--both families on welfare, and families who need child support so that they can stay off welfare. The penalty also will cripple the State's budget, seriously harming the largest economy in this nation.  I am not questioning the value of a State Disbursement Unit, or California's need to develop one. On the contrary, I am urging Governor Davis and the State legislature to come up with a plan to develop a State Disbursement Unit as quickly as possible. But I do not believe that poor families should be severely punished because the State has not gotten its act together.  Moreover, California's failure to develop a State Disbursement Unit is a direct result of its failure to develop a statewide computer system that tracks child support cases--and California is already paying a penalty for the computer failure.  The computer system penalty, which Congress established just last year, is fair and proportionate. More importantly, it rises over time, giving California a powerful incentive to get a computer system up and running. If California does not have a computer system in place by 2002, it will lose over $109 million annually in federal funds.  It is simply unfair to levy a $4 billion penalty against California for not having a State Disbursement Unit, when the State's failure to establish the unit is a direct result of a computer failure for which the State is already being penalized.  The Child Support Penalty Fairness Act would provide that States could not be penalized for failure to develop centralized disbursement units, if they are already paying a penalty for computer-related problems.  Under this bill, California would still have to pay a significant penalty for its computer-related troubles. Moreover, if California gets a statewide computer system in place, but still fails to operate a centralized disbursement unit, the State would be subject to additional severe penalties. This provides powerful incentive for the State to develop both a computer system, and a central disbursement unit, quickly.  I believe that this bill is proportionate and fair. It will prompt the State of California to develop a State Disbursement Unit in a timely fashion, without placing aid to low income children and families at risk. It is simply the right thing to do. I hope that my colleagues will take up and pass the Child Support Penalty Fairness Act as quickly as possible.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1033       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
