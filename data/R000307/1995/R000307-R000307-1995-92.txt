Speaker, I thank the distinguished minority leader of the Committee on Agriculture for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, S. 178, the CFTC Reauthorization Act of 1995, was adopted in the other body on February 10. The bill is a simple one-line reauthorization that provides authority for appropriations through the year 2000.                              {time}  1600  The Committee on Agriculture on Tuesday reported companion legislation by a voice vote and the presence of a quorum. Since the bills are identical and have no opposition, they are identical and have no opposition in either body, we are considering S. 178 so that we may expedite the reauthorization of the Commission.  Mr. Speaker, S. 178, the CFTC Reauthorization Act of 1995 was adopted in the other body February 10, 1995. The bill is a simple one-line reauthorization providing authority for appropriations for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission through the year 2000 at such sums as may be necessary. The Committee on Agriculture on Tuesday reported companion legislation by voice vote in the presence of a quorum. Since the bills are substanially identical and had no opposition in either body, we are considering today S. 178 so that we may expedite the reauthorization of the Commission.  Mr. Speaker, this is the first time in the 20-year history of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission there has not been, in conjunction with a CFTC reauthorization, either significant amendments to the Commodity Exchange Act or outright questions about whether or not the CFTC should continue to exist.  The CFTC is a mature regulatory organization that is overseeing the most innovative and efficient markets in the world--our futures markets, where risk management concepts were born and the price discovery process provides U.S. commerce and industry the information necessary to compete in a global economy. The CFTC has reached regulatory parity with every other Federal regulator, and I would point out to my colleagues has done so with minimal resources and a staff of approximately 550 full-time employees.  Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to adopt S. 178 today and move it on to the White House, where, I am certain, the President will sign the bill.  Mr. de la GARZA. I thank the gentleman for his comments.  Mr. Speaker, I support the legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I commend the distinguished chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Mr. Roberts, as well as the chairman, Mr. Ewing, and ranking minority member, Mr. Rose, of the Risk Management and Specialty Crops Subcommittee for their leadership in providing for the expeditious consideration of S. 178, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Reauthorization Act of 1995. This Senate bill is identical to H.R. 618 which was reported unanimously from the Committee on Agriculture without amendment. The bill authorizes [[Page H4380]] appropriations to carry out the Commodity Exchange Act for each fiscal year through 2000 and I strongly support its passage.  In the legislative activity leading up to the enactment of the Futures Trading Practices Act of 1992 (FTPA; Public Law 102-546), Congress considered and ultimately enacted a number of new responsibilities and authorities for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission [CFTC]. Those changes were designed to enhance the effectiveness of our futures regulatory system, while accommodating the evolutionary processes which are transforming world financial markets. Our philosophy has been and should continue to be that fair markets are efficient markets, and that a sound, rational and independent regulatory system contributes to their efficiency.  The CFTC has made extraordinary progress in carrying out the mandates of the 1992 Act. The Commission's pace demonstrates clearly that it shares the same sense of importance that we had in Congress when those important changes to the Commodity Exchange Act were adopted.  As a few examples, since the FTPA was enacted the CFTC has: Approved final rules exempting swap transactions, hybrid securities, and energy contracts meeting specified criteria from the exchange-trading and other requirements of the CEA; Approved final rules prohibiting dual trading on high-volume contract markets that do not have adequate systems for monitoring trading activity; Proposed rules to allow existing futures exchanges to sponsor trading among entities meeting qualifying criteria with relief from some of the regulatory strictures that otherwise would apply; and Approved final rules regarding procedures for exchange emergency actions.  In addition, the Commission has submitted five mandated reports to Congress. Notable among these was The Study of Swaps and Off-Exchange Derivatives--one of the more complete and informative discussions of that issue available.  Meanwhile, our Nation's futures markets have continued to grow and innovate. During fiscal year 1994 alone, the Commission approved trading in 28 new futures and options contracts. Futures and options volume on the exchanges increased by 27 percent to 510 million trades in fiscal year 1994 from the fiscal year 1993 level of 402 million.  While the increased use of U.S. futures exchanges demonstrates the confidence that financial risk managers have in these markets, trading on offshore futures markets--which in many cases trade contracts similar to those on U.S. exchanges--has grown even more rapidly. In its report to Congress, A study of the Global Competitiveness of U.S. Futures Markets, April 1994, the CFTC noted U.S. exchanges' declining share of global futures trading. That trend is largely explained as the initial growth stage in the relatively new, foreign futures markets rather than a reflection of significant cost advantages. It should, however, make us aware in our regulatory policy decisions that we need to balance our efforts to ensure that the markets are sound and fair, with a recognition of the potential for excessive regulatory burdens to disadvantage U.S. futures markets vis-a-vis their foreign competitors.  In their efforts to modernize and to comply with trade monitoring requirements in the Commodity Exchange Act, U.S. exchanges continue to work towards the development and implementation of automated audit trail systems. These systems promise to greatly enhance the ability of exchange and Commission enforcement officials to prevent fraud and punish cheaters.  Finally, Commission Chairman Schapiro, other Commissioners, and Commission staff continue to be actively engaged in interagency policy coordination regarding securities and securities derivatives markets, over-the-counter derivatives, and other matters of importance in market regulation. In this effort, the Commission has rightfully asserted itself as the expert regulatory agency where derivative markets are concerned.  Given the agency's substantial progress in carrying out the will of Congress expressed through the FTPA, I strongly support passage of this bill to extend the Commission's reauthorization through fiscal year 2000.  Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection.
