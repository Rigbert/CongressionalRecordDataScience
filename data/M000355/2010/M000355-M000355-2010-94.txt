 President, I indicated to the majority leader that I was going to propound a unanimous consent request at this time.  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to the consideration of the Defense authorization bill; provided further that amendments be offered in an alternating fashion between this aisle and that; that the first 20 amendments offered be Defense-related amendments within the jurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee, with no amendment related to immigration in order during the first 20 amendments.  Before the Chair rules, this is an important bill and the Senate should consider the way we have done it every year. There are many controversial issues related to the underlying bill that need to be debated and voted on by the Senate. Our view is we should start work on the bill and tackle the relevant Defense issues before we divert into unrelated measures.
