President, I believe you will find similar support for each of the other programs under this umbrella.  I challenge each Member to go back to their State and find one community that has not reaped the benefits of a CDBG investment. I challenge each member to visit with their local community action groups and hear how they use the Community Services Block Grant to support the neediest in their communities.
