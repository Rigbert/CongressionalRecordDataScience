President, would the chairman support my request that the General Accounting Office review this project, including the questions I have raised in this letter, and report back to this committee and to the House National Security Committee within 30 days?  Mr. McCAIN. Like my colleague on the Armed Services Committee, I am a firm supporter of the BRAC process, and I am concerned that the Army's recommendations to the Commission may have caused it to make a decision based on false assumptions. I am particularly troubled that American taxpayers may be paying for unnecessary military housing when, as my colleague and the Department itself hasindicated, there is similar housing available at other installations. I would urge the chairman to lend his support to this inquiry.
