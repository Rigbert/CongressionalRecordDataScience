Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 made it unlawful for employers to knowingly hire or employ aliens not eligible to work and required employers to check the identity and work eligibility documents of all new employees. Under this Act, if the documents provided by an employee reasonably appear on their face to be genuine, the employer has met its document review obligations.  The easy availability of counterfeit documents has made a mockery of the Immigration Reform and Control Act.                              {time}  2145  Fake documents are produced by the millions and can be obtained cheaply.  Congress responded to this dilemma in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 by instituting employment eligibility confirmation pilot programs for volunteer employers that were to last for 4 years.  Under the basic pilot, the Social Security numbers and alien identification numbers of new hires are checked against Social Security Administration and Immigration and Naturalization Service records in order to weed out documents containing counterfeit numbers and real numbers used by multiple individuals. Operation of the pilot program commenced in November of 1997 and expires this month.  The 1996 Act required that the INS provide a report to Congress on the operation of the pilot programs within 3 months after the end of the third and fourth year in which the programs are in effect. The reports were to, one, assess the benefits of the pilot programs to employers and the degree to which they assist in the enforcement of the rules regarding the employment of aliens; and, two, to include recommendations on whether or not the pilot program should be continued or modified.  The INS has not complied. That is no surprise. The agency provided Congress with no report after the third year of operation of the basic pilot program, despite being mandated to do so by law, and there is no assurance that one will be provided within the time limits specified by law after the fourth year of operation. The INS' failure to obey the law and to provide the reports as required by law is unfortunately a frequent failing of this agency. It can only be hoped that once the immigration functions of the Justice Department are restructured and the INS is abolished will such negligence and/or malfeasance be a thing of the past.  In any event, Congress must now decide upon the reauthorization of the basic pilot program in the absence of the agency reports, required by law, on the program. We have received word from industry implementing the basic pilot program that it has been a great success and that industry representatives favor a 2-year extension of the program.  The committee has received no adverse comment regarding the basic pilot program. In light of the continuing relevance of the original goals of the basic pilot program, and the evidence of its successful operation, we all should support a 2-year extension. H.R. 3030, introduced by our colleague, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Latham), provides that extension.  I can only hope that when we are again called upon to consider the merits of this pilot program we will have in hand an evaluation of the program's operation from the Justice Department. The INS is supposed to enforcethe law. The Justice Department is the agency in the executive branch to ensure that the law is being enforced; and unfortunately, the law is not being complied with, and the reports we asked for in 1996 by law have not been submitted by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3030; and let me say that I hope at the end of 2 years the immigration service will read laws passed by Congress and signed by the President so that once again the Congress is not put in this embarrassing situation of legislating without required reports.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
