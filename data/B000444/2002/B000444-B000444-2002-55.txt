  Does the Senator actually believe the President would veto this? I mean, the President speaks so glowingly and lovingly--and I believe he means it--about our veterans and our responsibilities and our obligations. If you laid out to the American people what we are talking about here, they would understand this just does not make sense.  Most people--who are not veterans, who are not disabled, who do not participate in any way--I think assume the law is as you and Senator Reid and myself and others are trying to change it.  I ask the Senator, A, do you really believe the President would veto this? And, B, what is the real reason for the veto? I mean, is there something I am missing here?
