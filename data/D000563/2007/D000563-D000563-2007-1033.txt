(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) the safety and integrity of the United States food      supply is vital to the public health, to public confidence in      the food supply, and to the success of the food sector of the      Nation's economy;       (2) illnesses and deaths of individuals and companion pets      caused by contaminated food--       (A) have contributed to a loss of public confidence in food      safety; and       (B) have caused significant economic loses to manufactures      and producers not responsible for contaminated food items;       (3) the task of preserving the safety of the food supply of      the United States faces tremendous pressures with regard to--       (A) emerging pathogens and other contaminants and the      ability to detect all forms of contamination; and       (B) an increasing volume of imported food, without adequate      monitoring and inspection;       (4) the United States is increasing the amount of food that      it imports such that--       (A) from 2003 to the present, the value of food imports has      increased from $45,600,000,000 to $64,000,000,000; and       (B) imported food accounts for 13 percent of the average      Americans diet including 31 percent of fruits, juices, and      nuts, 9.5 percent of red meat and 78.6 percent of fish and      shellfish; and       (5) the number of full time equivalent Food and Drug      Administration employees conducting inspections has decreased      from 2003 to 2007.       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate      that--       (1) it is vital for Congress to provide the Food and Drug      Administration with additional resources, authorities, and      direction with respect to ensuring the safety of the food      supply of the United States;       (2) additional Food and Drug Administration inspectors are      required if we are to improve Food and Drug Administration's      ability to safeguard the food supply of the United States;      and       (3) because of the increasing volume of international trade      in food products the Secretary of Health and Human Services      should make it a priority to enter into agreements, including      memoranda of understanding, with the trading partners of the      United States with respect to food safety.     SEC. 6. ANNUAL REPORT TO CONGRESS.       The Secretary of Health and Human Service shall, on an      annual basis, submit to the Committee on Health, Education,      Labor, and Pensions and the Committee on Appropriations of      the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the      Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives a      report that includes, with respect to the preceding 1-year      period--       (1) the number and amount of food products imported into      the United States, aggregated by country, and type of food,      if any;       (2) a listing of the number of inspectors of imported food      products and the number of inspections performed on such      products; and       (3) aggregated data on the findings of such inspections,      including data related to violations of the Federal Food,      Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 201 et seq.), and      enforcement mechanisms used to follow-up on such findings and      violations.                          ____________________
