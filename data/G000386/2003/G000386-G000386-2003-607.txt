 I am very glad that such a compromise has been worked out. I am very happy with the team of people both on and off the committee who have put it together. I would like to emphasize one thing about the amendment. I am sure it has been stated very well by other sponsors, but this is meant to bring temporary--and I want to stress ``temporary''--fiscal relief to the States. I have heard from my State and many others about the difficult budget situations they are currently experiencing. This amendment will help to bring temporary relief to all States during this difficult fiscal time.  It is important for the Senate to successfully pass a strong growth bill, andthis amendment helps to achieve that goal. Numerous Senators have indicated that State fiscal relief is a key component of this growth package. Some of my colleagues believe strongly that we should direct some State fiscal relief through the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage Program or something we call around here by the acronym FMAP. This is the funding structure for Medicaid. This amendment uses a temporary adjustment in the FMAP formula.  Some of my colleagues feel strongly about giving flexible grants to the States and localities. This amendment also uses flexible grants to those States and localities. Many Members both on and off the Finance Committee have worked hard to reach this agreement. As I stated in the Finance Committee markup, I believe all Senators should have an opportunity to weigh in. The amendment before us reflects the hard work of many Senators who care deeply about State fiscal relief. It is a good compromise. For these reasons, I am going to vote for this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.  I want to state a couple more times, just so it is not forgotten, to any State and local people listening or who will read about it or for sure will be reminded about it a year or so from now: This is meant to be temporary.
