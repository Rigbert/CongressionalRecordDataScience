Speaker, pursuant to the rule just recently adopted, I call up the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 63) disapproving of the decision of the President announced on January 10, 2007, to deploy more than 20,000 additional United States combat troops to Iraq, and ask for its immediate consideration.  The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.  The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 63       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring),  That--       (1) Congress and the American people will continue to      support and protect the members of the United States Armed      Forces who are serving or who have served bravely and      honorably in Iraq; and       (2) Congress disapproves of the decision of President      George W. Bush announced on January 10, 2007, to deploy more      than 20,000 additional United States combat troops to Iraq.
