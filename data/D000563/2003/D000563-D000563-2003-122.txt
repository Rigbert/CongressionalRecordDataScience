Why would we on the Democratic side of the aisle approve any executive appointment of someone who is going in the executive branch and from that point forward will never speak to us again? Now, if we are being asked by this administration to approve people to hold offices within this administration who have not answered all the questions in committee and having been approved on the Senate floor will from that point forward never communicate with us again, then, frankly, I think we are derelict in our responsibility.  So I say to the administration, think this through. If they are saying that the people we appoint in the Senate are not going to answer the questions propounded by Democratic Senators, then, frankly, I think it is untoward of them to suggest that we should just approve all of these appointments.  I think it is fair game for the President to fill vacancies, and I have supported the overwhelming majority of the President's requests. But if the policy is once approved by the Senate, these executive appointments, these people working in these agencies, will refuse to take telephone calls or answer letters of inquiry from Members of the Senate, refuse to be held accountable for their actions as public officials, then I think we are derelict inour responsibility to the people we represent.
