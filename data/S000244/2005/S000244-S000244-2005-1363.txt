Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.  Mr. Speaker, this bill does not make a decision on whether or not the feeding tube should be reinserted. It does not make a final decision on the issues that are being decided in Florida. What it does do is that it says that a Federal court, a judge, will review the Federal constitutional and legal rights that belong to Terri Schiavo, and that Federal judge will make a decision on Federal issues, and that is all the bill does.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith).
