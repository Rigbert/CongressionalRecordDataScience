 President, I see my friend from Arizona is still on the floor. In terms of subsidies, I point out again, because the argument was made, there is a little thing called the central Arizona water project. That is 3.5 billion bucks that my mom is helping to pay for. She will never drink a drop of the water, but Arizona needs it. It is $3.5 billion needed, badly needed--$3.5 billion.  But our country needs Amtrak as well, on the west coast and on the east coast. I yield whatever time I have left.  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.
