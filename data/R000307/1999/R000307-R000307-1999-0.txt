President, I rise in strong support of the Environment and Public Works Committee legislation to name the Old Executive Office Building after one of Kansas' sons, former President Dwight David Eisenhower.  Although Congress is portrayed in the press as mired in gridlock over budget caps and campaign finance reform, the Senate does rise above the daily political battles and pass commonsense bipartisan legislation that the American public is often unaware of because it lacks the sizzle for front page headlines or evening news sound bites.  The Senate passage of S. 1652 formally recognizes former President Eisenhower's dedication and faithfulness to the United States. This Kansan rose from his commission as a second lieutenant of Infantry at West Point to Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, where he directed one of the most ambitious invasions in military history.  At the end of his military career, Eisenhower embarked on his successful candidacy for President of the United States. Eisenhower's biographer, Stephen Ambrose, wrote in his introduction to ``Eisenhower The President'' that ``Dwight Eisenhower is one of only two Republicans (the other was Grant) to serve two full terms as President. Along with the two Roosevelts, he is the only twentieth-century President who, when he left office, still enjoyed wide and deep popularity. And he is the only President in this century who managed to preside over eight years of peace and prosperity.''  America liked Ike.  We in Kansas are always honored when we can share our admiration for Dwight David Eisenhower with the rest of the Nation including the Dwight David Eisenhower National Highway System and the Eisenhower Presidential Center in Abilene, Kansas.  My own family has strong ties to Ike and the Eisenhower years. My father, Wes, played a key role in Eisenhower's presidential nomination and his election. He served as Republican national chairman for Ike.  Naming the Old Executive Office Building after former President Eisenhower is fitting because this building is almost as historic as the White House. Former Presidents Theodore and Franklin D. Roosevelt, Taft, Johnson, Ford, and Bush, and Eisenhower himself, all had offices in this building before becoming President. This ornate building is one of the most impressive buildings in Washington and some believe its style epitomizes the optimism and exuberance of the post-Civil War period when it was constructed. Throughout his government career, Ike also conveyed these feelings to his troops and the American people therefore this recognition is well-deserved.  I am glad that my Senate colleagues agreed to expedite the passage of this bill and hope the other body takes quick action. It builds on last week's celebration in Kansas of former President Eisenhower where the State of Kansas made his birthday Dwight D. Eisenhower Day in Kansas. More importantly, our state leaders provided schools with curricula on Eisenhowerto teach and remind children of this great leader.  For my colleagues reading and information, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial from the Topeka Capital Journal be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               Dwight D. Eisenhower Finally Gets His Day       It is not hyperbole at all to say this: Dwight D.      Eisenhower stands as one of the 20th century's towering      figures--and among what may have been history's most heroic      generation, he was a giant.       This Kansas-reared man's memory is still celebrated today      in the hamlets of Europe he helped free from Nazi oppression      and occupation as supreme Allied commander in World War II.       Meanwhile, in a wax museum dedicated to all the U.S.      presidents in Gettysburg, Pa., Eisenhower's likeness has been      lifted out of its chronological place and given its own      spotlight for visitors to appreciate. His life, his career,      his achievements, his impact on the world were that      significant.       Yet, the state that claims him, and which he claimed as a      youth and at his death in 1969, has done precious little to      observe his honored place in history.       Until now.       This week, Abilene, site of the Eisenhower Library and      Museum, feted the 34th president in a three-day celebration      ending today with a conclusion of a Veterans of Foreign Wars      vigil at 8 a.m., wreath layings at 10:30 and 11 a.m., a      children's bicycle parade at 1:30 and the unveiling at 2 p.m.      of a statute of a boyish Eisenhower at the downtown mini-     park.       Thursday, on his birthday and officially Dwight D.      Eisenhower Day in Kansas, schoolchildren released balloons,      heard music and speeches (including one by Ike's      granddaughter, Anne Eisenhower) and celebrated with a      birthday party and concert that night.       Just as important, curricula on Eisenhower was sent to      schools statewide.       It's hard to believe we've gone this long before      proclaiming a day for Eisenhower--the state's most famous and      celebrated figure.       ``He really is a world-renowned figure,'' said state Sen.      Ben Vidricksen, R-Salina, who sponsored the legislation      leading to this long-overdue observance.       Though born in Denison, Texas, Eisenhower spent his      formative years in Abilene, Kan., where they regard him as a      local boy who grew to become a hero.       ``He was a wonderful role model,'' said Kim Barbieri,      education specialist with the Eisenhower Foundation.       ``Even his critics never questioned his honesty and      sincerity,'' said one author. ``As a general, he commanded      the greatest army in history. As a president, he dedicated      himself to fighting for peace.''       Indeed, though a product of the military, Eisenhower once      warned the American people to guard against ``the acquisition      of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the      military-industrial complex.''       Though his was one of the poorer families in Abilene, it      was predicted in the Abilene High School year-book in 1909      that Eisenhower would go on to be president--Dwight's      brother, Edgar Eisenhower, that is. Dwight was supposed to go      on to be a history professor at Yale.       The prediction was off slightly, of course. And because of      that, the world is a better place--and millions of people are      free today.
