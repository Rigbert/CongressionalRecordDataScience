 I wish to thank all of our colleagues.  As we move forward on this appropriations bill, we will be open for amendments. I know there are Members who have a number of issues they would like for us to consider. I urge them to bring their amendments to Senator Collins and me, the managers of this bill, as soon as possible so we can begin to work our way through them.  So as we go to recess for caucus lunches, I ask Members to please work with both of us so we can manage this bill in a responsible way and then move to final passage.  I appreciate all of the work of my ranking member Senator Collins as well as the members of the committee and all of the Senators who are working with us to move this bill forward.  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.                          ____________________
