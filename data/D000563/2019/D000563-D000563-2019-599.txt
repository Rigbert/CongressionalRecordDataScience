President, it is hard to imagine that the U.S. Congress was once guarded by a lone watchman, but when the legislative branch of our government moved from Philadelphia to Washington, DC, that was the case. His name was John Golding. He was charged with protecting the U.S. Congress. A generation later, after several incidents, President John Quincy Adams asked that a Capitol Police Force be created. It was created with four officers working 15-hour shifts. Today, there are over 2,000 officers and civilians who work for the Capitol Police.  When you put it in perspective, 3 million to 5 million people from all over America and all over the world come to this building complex each year to personally witness the foundation--at least on the congressional side--of our democracy. We want to make certain they are safe.  We know we live in a dangerous world. The threats facing Congress today are far different than at the time of John Golding. Our exposure to risk is higher, as we learn every day and every week about horrible shooting incidents that occur. One, of course, did occur in the Capitol not that many years ago. We know we have the best protection possible in this increasingly dangerous world thanks to the dedicated, talented, and committed men and women of the Capitol Police Force.  There is an important reason why I have been able to do my job as the Democratic whip for 14 years. It is because R.D. Moore, a member of the Capitol Police team, has led my security detail during that period of time. At the end of this month, R.D. is retiring after 39 years of service to his country and more than 30 years with the U.S. Capitol Police.  Renoard Moore joined the Capitol Police in 1988, after serving 9 years in the U.S. Army. He also served with the Dignitary Protection Division, protecting the Senate and House leadership.  In 2005, when I joined the Senate leadership, R.D. became part of not just my Senate family but my family. As a team leader, he has been responsible for keeping the detail up-to-date on the logistics of every event and making critical decisions for the safety and security of our office team. Simply put, R.D. has been an important part of my life every day that he has been willing to put his life on the line for me. He has become an honorary Illinoisan in the process due to countless trips he has made back to my home State. There is even reason to believe we have made him a Cubs fan, but I am not going to say that with certainty.  Even with his commitment to duty, R.D. has always found time for his own family, putting thousands of miles on his car each year to travel across the country to Kentucky, Michigan, and other places to visit his mother, his siblings, and his cousins. Whether it was in Michigan, Kentucky, or North Carolina, he found the time for family. No matter where he was, R.D. was always willing and able to respond to a phone call or email from his extended family.  I am going to miss R.D. personally, and our office is also going to miss him. He is a caring, larger than life presence and one of the best known members of the Capitol Police detail here on Capitol Hill. If someone had a rough day, R.D. was always there with a piece of wrapped candy and a smile. If any of us needed advice on new technology, R.D. always seemed to be on top of it, whether it was the latest smartwatch or smartphone or something else that I basically didn't understand. His great sense of humor was a calming influence in the most stressful of times that we faced. He always took his job seriously, but he never took himself seriously.  As R.D. Moore retires this week, I want to thank him personally and wish him well. I do it personally and on behalf of my wife, Loretta, my entire family, and the entire Durbin Senate staff. He is a dedicated law enforcement professional who should be remembered in the Capitol, along with all of his colleagues on the Capitol Police who each and every day come to work, put on their badges, and risk their lives to keep this building and the people who come here safe. I want to congratulate Special Agent R.D. Moore on a job well done.                       Remembering Richard Lugar  Mr. President, I want to take a moment to celebrate the life of an exceptional American, a statesman, a gentleman, and a friend. Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana passed away yesterday. He was a man of great intellect and accomplishment and very little ego. He possessed an overabundance of the best qualities of American character.  He was a problem-solver. He believed that America can and must be a force for good in the world, and he was a visionary who had a genius for devising thoughtful, effective solutions to complex problems before many people even knew they existed.  When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, many people believed naively that the threat of nuclear Armageddon that had haunted the world for nearly 50 years was over, but Senator Lugarknew better. Working with Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, then chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a Democrat, Senator Lugar crafted a bipartisan response, the Soviet Threat Reduction Act of 1991, to prevent the huge arsenals, once controlled by the Soviet Union, from falling into the hands of terrorists and other murderers.  The bill created the CTR Program, the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, within the Department of Defense, better known as Nunn-Lugar, and led to the deactivation of more than 7,600 nuclear warheads. Before Nunn-Lugar, there were enough nuclear weapons and materials in the former Soviet Republic to destroy a good portion of the world. Much of these armaments of nuclear Armageddon were housed in ramshackle, degraded facilities watched over by guards who hadn't been paid in months and were sometimes drunk on duty. It was like a fire sale for terrorists and madmen. Under Nunn-Lugar, Dick Lugar urged America to actually pay off our old adversary to secure these nuclear stockpiles, and America and the world were safer as a result.  Sadly, today, leaders in both the White House and the Kremlin seem to be rushing to discard the nuclear arms agreements and rebuild nuclear arsenals. That is absolutely the last thing in the world we should see happening. We can only hope that the inspiration and success of Nunn-Lugar will cause them to rethink this. The state of our world is perilous enough without reigniting a nuclear arms race.  I want to make a personal note. I am deeply and personally grateful to Senator Richard Lugar for agreeing, in 2010, to be one of the two Republican cosponsors of the DREAM Act. It is a bill that I introduced many years ago to give those undocumented young people brought here as infants and toddlers and children a path to legal status and citizenship. It is the kind of thing that when you ask the American people whether it is the right thing to do, they don't hesitate. Republicans, Democrats, Independents--they believe these young people should have a chance to go to school, make America a better place, and not worry about their citizenship status.  It was always difficult to find Republicans to join me in this effort, except for Dick Lugar. Dick Lugar time and again stepped up and said: I am going to do this. America was recovering from the great recession at that time, and anti-immigrant sentiment was already strong and growing. It was being exploited, as we see today, almost on a daily basis.  Standing up for these Dreamers, who were not legal in the United States and couldn't vote in the United States, was an act of political decency and courage--just what you might expect from Senator Dick Lugar of Indiana. And 2 years later, after 36 years as a Senator and a statesman, Senator Lugar lost his seat in a primary challenge to a tea party firebrand. Analysts suggested that his support for Dreamers was one of the reasons he was defeated.  After that election, Dick Lugar defended his support for the DREAM Act and other decisions that may have hurt him in the primary, and he said: ``[Those] were the right votes for our country.'' He added: ``I stand by them without regrets.''  Dick Lugar was also a cosigner of a letter, which I sent to then-President Barack Obama. When we couldn't pass the DREAM Act, Senator Lugar joined me in sending a letter to the President, asking if there was anything he could do by Executive order that might give these young people a chance--just a chance--to prove themselves and become part of America's future. Dick Lugar and I were the two cosigners of that letter that went to the President.  It was that letter and the thought behind it which led to the creation of DACA, a program that 790,000 of these young people signed up for. They paid their filing fees; they went through their criminal background checks; they checked all the boxes; and they were given, under the DACA Program, 2 years to go to school in the United States and work in the United States without fear of deportation. It had to be renewed every 2 years, but it was Dick Lugar who stuck his neck out to help me with that letter as well. When others just wouldn't join me, he did and did it willingly. I will never forget him, and neither should anyone else.  Our friend Dick Lugar is gone, but he left a legacy of courage, decency, civility, service, and statesmanship that we would all do well to emulate and for which I am personally grateful. Dick Lugar was the best of the U.S. Senate on a bipartisan basis. This Republican colleague of mine was someone I came to respect time and again because he always put country before politics.  Loretta and I got to know his wife Char. Char and he were married when they met in college and became fast friends and built a family around that friendship and their love--a wonderful couple, great to be with and to spend many hours together. I extend my condolences, along with Loretta's, to Char, Senator Lugar's beloved wife of more than 60 years; to their sons, Mark, Bob, John, David, and their families; and to Senator Lugar's many friends.  When I think of an internationalist hailing from the Midwest who could stand there smack-dab in the middle of this country with all of that flatland and look in every direction and see how important the rest of the world was to us, I think of Dick Lugar, and I think of the contribution he made to the State of Indiana and to America and to the U.S. Senate every day of his public service.  Most people don't know that he also had a passion for planting trees. It was one of the things we used to talk about. He would buy farmland and plant trees. I think it is a suitable metaphor for his life that planting a tree is like planting a good idea. Maybe it will not come to full growth in your lifetime, but if it is good solid stock, it is going to be something that is a legacy for generations to come.  Senator Dick Lugar's contribution to Indiana, to America, and to the U.S. Senate planted many trees that will benefit future generations to come.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ernst). The clerk will call the roll.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.
