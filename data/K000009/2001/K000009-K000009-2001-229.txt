Speaker, on June 20, 2001 the House passed H. Res. 124 recognizing the importance of children in the United States and supporting the goals and ideals of American Youth. This piece of legislation was adopted by a unanimous vote of 424-0. I commend the U.S. House of Representatives on passing the resolution and believe that we all share the desire,to secure the safety and well being of all children in our great nation and abroad.  More than a decade ago, the largest group of world leaders ever convened for the World Summit for Children to discuss their responsibility to children. At the end of the World Summit, 71 heads of state and other world leaders signed the World Declaration on Survival, Protection and Development of Children. The standards and obligations adopted place children center stage in the quest for a just, respectful and peaceful society.  The leaders attending the summit also adopted a Plan of Action to achieve a set of precise, time-bound goals, including: Improving living conditions for children and their chances for survival by increasing access to health services; reducing the spread of preventable diseases; creating more opportunities for education; providing better sanitation and greater food supply; and protecting children in danger.  To date, 192 states have ratified or signed the convention. The convention was ratified more quickly and by more countries than any previous human rights agreement. Unfortunately, the United States is not among the 192 nations that have joined in this historical convention, and no other industrialized nation has failed to make this legal commitment to children.  As a Member of the United States Congress I am saddened and embarrassed that our great nation has not ratified this historical convention. Our nation's children are our future. The Convention on the Rights of the Child embodies the very principles our country was founded upon and only enforces the rights afforded to all children born in our great nation of life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.  Ratification clearly signals a state's commitment to uphold standards of the convention and to respect, protect and fulfil the rights of children around the world. The House of Representatives commitment to the well being of our nation's children is exemplified through the unanimous passage of H. Res. 124. I urge the United States Senate, which has the sole power to ratify treaties, to act soon on this important matter and stand up for the rights of children worldwide.                          ____________________
