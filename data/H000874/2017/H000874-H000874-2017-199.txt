Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that comment. The gentleman is certainly correct, we have very substantial disagreements. We believe the Affordable Care Act is working.  I was pleased to see the administration, at least in the short-term, indicate that they will not take actions to undermine it or sabotage it without passing a replacement, without having the ability to give to the American people an option. I think the administration did the right thing. I hope they will continue to do the right thing in making payments consistent with the law.  We will have a very significant debate on that bill. Therefore, I would urge the majority leader if, in fact, the majority leader is going to bring that bill to the floor at some point in time, that significant notice be given so that not only Members of Congress, but that the American people can have the opportunity to assess the ramifications--in our perspective, the very serious adverse ramifications--that the passage of the American Health Care Act would have on the health care and the cost to every American of health insurance.  The President, as you know, has indicated that he wants to make sure--and he said he would support a program where every American has insurance, not access to insurance. He has made comments numerous times during the course of the campaign and since he has been President of the United States that his program would provide for every American to have health insurance at a lower cost with better quality.  I have told the people that, if he sends such a bill down, I would be inclined to support such a bill. He has not, of course, sent such a bill down.  So, Mr. Leader, the bottom line is I am simply saying that this will be a very controversial item and deserving of very significant debate, discussion. Hopefully, we will get significant notice as to when the majority leader expects to bring it to the floor so that we could be prepared for that debate.  I yield to the gentleman.                              {time}  1145  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  And yes, we have had a lot, ample debate already, through committee and part of the floor, but it is our anticipation that we will give you plenty of notification.  We have already posted the amendment to make sure everybody has the ability to read it, and it has already been there 3 days. It is just 8 pages long, and we have provided the 3 days already. But we will give you, as soon as it is scheduled for the floor, notice of it coming.
