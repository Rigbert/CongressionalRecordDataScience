 President, I would like to say a few words about a staffer I will be very sad to lose tomorrow. Denzel McGuire is one of the most genuine people you will ever meet. She always has a smile on her face and a ready joke, and she is the only Senate staffer I know of who can plan on--listen to this--a personal birthday song from Speaker Boehner every year. She also has a determination that is as strong as steel. She is a master at negotiating. And all Members--even the Speaker--have learned it is wise to stay in her good graces.  Denzel has worked for some of the most respected Members of this body, including Jon Kyl and Judd Gregg. She has taken on some of the thorniest issues over her more than 20 years here in Congress.  In this job you get accustomed to hearing bad news, but what I tell people is that if I have to hear bad news from someone, I would rather have it come from Denzel. She always has a plan moving forward, and there is usually a joke slipped in there as well.  Denzel is too modest to say so herself, but she has been in the middle of a lot of big legislative battles around here. She has been in the mix on pretty much everything you could imagine that has to do with budgets and government funding issues--in other words, pretty much everything. She has also worked a lot of late nights. She has plenty of war stories, but she has never lost her optimism or her good humor. Now, that is no mean feat.  I am really going to miss Denzel, but she has more than earned a break, and I wish her nothing but the best as she moves on to the next chapter in her life. I am sure she will be a great success.                          ____________________
