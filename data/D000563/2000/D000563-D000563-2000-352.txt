President, at the National Rifle Association convention, when it was brought up as an issue that so many young people are killed every single day by gunfire in America, in addition to those who are not so young, the people at the National Rifle Association dismissed it and said these are teenage gang bangers and drug criminals and you just have to expect, in the culture in which they live, they are going to kill one another.  As I read this list of people ranging in age from 80 years to 18, it is clear that the victims of gun violence are not just those who were involved in crime in the inner city. Frankly, it involved Americans across the board; Americans--black, white, and brown--of virtually every age group. To dismiss this, as the National Rifle Association did, as something we should not care about I think is evidence of their insensitivity to this issue of gun violence.
