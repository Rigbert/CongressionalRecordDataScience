Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Lowey and rise in opposition to this bill.  Our Nation really needs to be on an even keel to produce steady economic growth in this country. This bill doesn't help that.  I agree, America must have a strong defense, but a nation has to be strong at home to be strong abroad. You can't shortchange the home front. A nation at home must be secure, without wild stock market swings, to be strong abroad.  A nation at home must be strong, without a massive drug epidemic here at home, to be strong abroad.  This bill can't produce a steady economy with consistent job growth because it fails to dedicate sufficient resources here at home: to education, to healthcare, to employment and retraining, for Head Start, for energy independence, for law enforcement, and for localities savaged by the drug epidemic and shortchanged on treatment.  Our ship of state needs to be on an even keel, not the wild fluctuations in this resolution. This bill tilts in the wind far, far starboard, and that is not a setting that can assure a steady ship of state to maintain a steady growth economy.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the resolution.
