 I respectfully request my friend answer two questions while he is getting ready to respond: Did or did not Dr. Browne say: ``I am confident that a fully supported and sustained program will enable us to continue to maintain America's nuclear deterrent without nuclear testing''? I will give him that. Secondly, would he be able to respond and tell me how I am wrong, that when all three Directors were asked, ``Are you on board with this treaty?'' and every single one answered: ``Yes.''
