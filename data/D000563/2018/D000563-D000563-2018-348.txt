I support the marchers. I will continue to work for meaningful action to help reduce gun violence. I am going to keep doing everything I can to put the safety of our kids and our neighborhoods ahead of the gun lobby's agenda.  I don't have any obligation to the National Rifle Association whatsoever, but I do have an obligation to a granddaughter living in Brooklyn, NY, in the first grade, who has been warned about what to do if a shooter comes into her classroom.  I hope my colleagues from across the aisle will join me. It is time to take a stand and show leadership. America is waiting.  I yield the floor.
