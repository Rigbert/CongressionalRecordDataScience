      As Congress begins debate on managed care reform      legislation, we would like to emphasize our confidence in      states' achievements in managed care and ask that any      legislation you consider preserve state authority and      innovation. We applaud the Republican Leadership's efforts to      complement the states' reforms by expanding managed care      protections to self-insured plans without preempting state      authority.       Historically, regulating private insurance has been the      responsibility of the states. Many, if not all of the ideas      under consideration now in Congress, have been considered by      states. Because the saturation of managed care is different      throughout the nation, each state has its own unique issues      relative to its market place. We have concerns about the      unintended consequences of imposing one-size-fits-all      standards on states which could result in increasing the      number of uninsured and increasing health care costs.       As Governors, we have taken the reports of abuses in      managed care seriously and have addressed specific areas of      importance to our citizens.  That is exactly the issue before us. We do need to act to protect those consumers who are beyond the reach of State regulation. We do not and should not act to preempt the good work done by our States.  Another issue that is before us, raised by the Kennedy one-size-fits-all approach, is what if a State has made an affirmative decision not to act in one of the areas which Senator Kennedy would impose upon that marketplace? What if the legislature, perhaps even a legislature controlled by the Senator's own party, has reached the decision that a particular mandate is not appropriate for that State and would increase health care costs?
