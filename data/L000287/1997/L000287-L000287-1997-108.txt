Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the dean of the Texas delegation for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, many people have noticed and taken note of the incredible rise and the success story that was the life of Congressman Frank Tejeda. I will not recount that incredible story of triumph over adversity. My colleagues from Texas have done that most eloquently. I just want to take amoment to reflect and to share a story of a trip I took last year to San Antonio. It is a story which I believe lends insight into the kind of man that Frank Tejeda was.  I went to Texas on just a few days' notice. In spite of that, Frank put together a luncheon at which more than 100 leaders of the San Antonio African-American community turned out. An impressive demonstration of organizational skill, I thought to myself.  In the hour or two that I spent with those people from San Antonio, I realized that these people had not turned out to hear from me but to hear and see their Congressman, their friend, their brother, Frank Tejeda.  Frank was not just respected in his community. He was not just liked. What I discovered on my trip to San Antonio was that Frank was loved by the people in his district. Frank was what every Member of Congress wants to be: He was a true representative of the people. Frank understood his community because he was a part of that community. They were always on his mind and in his soul.  Mr. Speaker, we will all miss Frank Tejeda. In a time when people toot their own horns, especially here in Washington, he was quiet. He was a quiet man, a sincere man, a reflective and thoughtful man.                              {time}  1515  Mr. Speaker, I will miss Frank, the House will miss Frank, and the Nation will miss Frank. There are not enough people like Frank Tejeda. God bless him and his family.
