President, today I recognize the accomplishments of BG James J. D'Agostino, U.S. Air Force, assistant adjutant general for air and deputy commanding general, of the Rhode Island National Guard. General D'Agostino is retiring on August 5, 2006, with over 38 years of active military service in war and peace. I have been pleased to know General D'Agostino for many years.  Brigadier General D'Agostino has served in a variety of field and staff assignments. His military career began in 1967 when he enlisted in the U.S. Army. After completing infantry training, he served with distinction during the Vietnam war in four separate military campaigns. After serving in Vietnam, he was transferred to the Army Reserve and was honorably discharged as a sergeant in 1973.  In 1974, Brigadier General D'Agostino joined the 143rd Civil Engineering Flight of the Rhode Island Air National Guard. Three years later, he graduated from the Air National Guard Academy of Military Science and was commissioned a first lieutenant. Shortly thereafter, he assumed the duties of base civil engineer for the 281st Combat Communications Group in Coventry, RI. Twenty-one years later, in 1999, he was transferred to the U.S. Property and Fiscal Office for Rhode Island as the supervisory logistics management specialist. Within 2 years, Brigadier General D'Agostino was selected to be the fiscal officer for Rhode Island, where he served through September 2005. In October 2005, he transitioned to his current position as the assistant adjutant general for air and deputy commanding general of the Rhode Island National Guard.  You have to cast a very large net to truly capture everything Brigadier General D'Agostino has done to improve the Rhode Island National Guard. I would like to highlight some of his greatest accomplishments. During his 21-year tenure as the only ``one person'' base civil engineering officer in the Air National Guard, he completely rebuilt both the Coventry and North Smithfield Air National Guard stations. He planned and effected a comprehensive program of military construction which has since cut operating and maintenance costs by nearly 50 percent. Additionally, he more than tripled the size of the North Smithfield Air National Guard, station, which provided, for the first time, a realistic environment for unit-wide, in-garrison field training. For his outstanding performance he was recognized as Rhode Island's Federal Professional Employee of the Year in 1997.  In 1998, Brigadier General D'Agostino prepared the critical project book for what was at that time the single largest military construction project in the Rhode Island National Guard, the $16 million C-130J aircraft hanger. Rhode Island's 143rd Airlift Wing was subsequently the first Air Force unit to receive the C-130J and appropriately, they performed superbly as they deployed the first C-130Js during the global war on terrorism in Iraq. Today, that hanger supports the Rhode Island Air National Guard's five C-130J aircraft.  And finally, Brigadier General D'Agostino's has been a critical supporter of energy conservation. While rebuilding Rhode Island's bases, he strictly adhered to using energy efficient air conditioning units, lighting fixtures, and appliances. Additionally, he has implemented various energy conservation programs that further enhance energy efficiency. Between these and other cost saving measures, an estimated reduction of over 50 percent has been achieved in operating and maintenance costs.  While carrying the full load of his professional career, Brigadier General D'Agostino has been affiliated with at least 30 professional and military organizations. He has and continues to serve in many prominent positions, where his work has paralleled his military successes.  Brigadier General D'Agostino, currently serves as the chairman of the board at the Society for Human Advancement through Rehabilitation Engineering Foundation, with which he has been actively involved for over 20 years. The society has enabled hundreds of individuals with disabilities to communicate via custom-made computer systems utilizing voice synthesizers and other specialized equipment.  As a past president of the National Guard Association of Rhode Island, Brigadier General D'Agostino created and still chairs its scholarship awards program, which has awarded almost $40,000 in scholarships. Additionally, he also served for several years as a trustee for the Rhode Island Air National Guard's McGown-Roberts Scholarship Fund, the primary educational fundraising vehicle for Air National Guard personnel. In 2002, the National Guard Association of the United Statesawarded him its coveted Meritorious Service Award for his contributions to his State and Nation.  Brigadier General D'Agostino is surrounded by a wonderful family. Together with his wife of almost 30 years, Frances, he has raised two children, Christopher and Alisa, of which they are very proud. He and Frances have been a remarkable example of husband and wife in service to the Air Force, to the Rhode Island National Guard, and to the Nation. Anyone who has enjoyed their friendship, treasures their company and their kindness.  Through Brigadier General D'Agostino's considerable efforts, the men and women of the Rhode Island National Guard have truly world-class facilities in which to accomplish their critical work. His consistent exceptional performance and exemplary character have secured his reputation as one of Rhode Island's most respected military officers.  The Rhode Island National Guard has never been stronger and more connected to the Army and Air Force. Brigadier General D'Agostino has set the groundwork for current and future Rhode Island National Guard facilities. His dedication to excellence and his unsurpassed devotion to duty, honor, and country have marked his distinguished service over 38 years.                          ____________________[Pages S8534-S8535]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS                                 ______                                             TRIBUTE TO BRIGADIER GENERAL JAMES J.
