Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to congratulate Our Lady of Consolation Roman Catholic Church in Merrillville, IN, in celebration of its 50th anniversary as a parish last Sunday, October 5, 1997. The anniversary celebration began with a Mass of thanksgiving, which was celebrated by Bishop Dale J. Melczek. Following the Mass, there was a banquet in the parish hall.  A parish of humble beginnings, Our Lady of Consolation, which was established as Immaculate Heart of Mary in 1947, celebrated its first Mass on October 5, 1947, in a town fire station. The parish was founded by Father Alvin Jasinski under the direction of the Fort Wayne Diocese to serve the needs of the growing Catholic population of Independence Hill, a section of what is now Merrillville, IN. In November 1947, 1 acre of land, which included a store and other buildings, was purchased as a more suitable site for the church. Many parishioners contributed their time, talent, money, and materials to transform the store into the first Immaculate Heart of Mary Church. Land for a permanent church site was acquired and a building fund was begun under the guidance of Father Leo Ambruster in the early 1960's. With the determination and patience of the parishioners, the cornerstone of the new church was blessed on August 27, 1967, only several years after the purchase of the land. The church was dedicated by Bishop Andrew Grutka as Our Lady of Consolation.  Our Lady of Consolation derived its name from the 2d century writer, St. Ignatius of Antioch. St. Ignatius was the first to express devotion to Mary as ``Consoler of the Afflicted.'' In the 17th century, when an outbreak of bubonic plague ravaged and decimated the Luxembourg population, the people prayed to Mary, Consoler of the Afflicted, for relief in their anguish and fear of death. Bishop Grutka decided to change the parish name from Immaculate Heart of Mary Church to Our Lady of Consolation since Holy Trinity Church in Gary, IN, built a statute commissioned ``Christ the Consoler.'' The bishop stated it was appropriate that Christ the Consoler have a Mother of Consolation.  In recent years, Our Lady of Consolation has flourished under the guidance of Father Joseph Vamos who arrived at the parish in 1987. In 1988, the cornerstone was laid for a parish activity center, which consists of a chapel used for weekday Mass, small weddings, and funerals, a parish office, large social and banquet hall, fully equipped kitchen, and six large classrooms. The classrooms are being utilized for faith formation program classes, small parish meetings, and a preschool serving approximately 40 children. The entire parish complex, which also consists of a rectory, was paid for within 3 years of its construction. Currently, the parish has taken on other initiatives, which include the redecoration of the church, the purchase of a new sacristy, the addition of an atrium entry way to the parish center, and the installation of stained glass windows in the chapel. The recent prosperity of Our Lady of Consolation may be attributed to both the foresight of past parish pastors, as well as the success of the parish's annual festival. The annual festival is a tradition that dates back to the early days of the parish in Independence Hill.  Although Our Lady of Consolation has changed drastically over the years, some aspects have remained the same. For instance, some of the original members of the small church in Independence Hill are still parishioners. Also, the Holy Name Society and the Altar and Rosary Sodality, which were founded in the very beginning of the church's history, still work for the betterment of the church today. Other organizations within the parish include an Over 55 Club, a parish youth group, and a newly formed Knights of Columbus Good Shepherd Council. The original parish consisted of under 100 families. Today, the number is over 1,000.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me today in commending the parish family of Our Lady of Consolation, under the guidance of Father Joseph Vamos, as they celebrate the 50th anniversary of their founding. All past and present parishioners and pastors should be proud of the numerous contributions they have made out of the love and devotion they have displayed for their church.                          ____________________
