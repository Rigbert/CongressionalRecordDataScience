Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 1082) condemning the decision by the city of St. Denis, France, to name a street in honor of Mumia Abu-Jamal, the convicted murderer of Philadelphia Police Officer Danny Faulkner.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 1082       Whereas on the night of December 9, 1981, Police Officer      Danny Faulkner was shot and killed in cold blood during a      traffic stop in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;       Whereas in the process of arresting the driver of a car      traveling the wrong way down a one-way street, the driver's      brother appeared from across the street and proceeded to open      fire on Officer Faulkner while his back was turned away; the      driver's brother was identified as Mumia Abu-Jamal;       Whereas Mumia Abu-Jamal struck Officer Faulkner four times      in the back with his gun; although seriously injured, Officer      Faulkner returned fire, striking his attacker; undeterred,      Mumia Abu-Jamal stood over Officer Faulkner and shot him in      the face, mortally wounding him; Mumia Abu-Jamal attempted to      flee, but collapsed several feet from the slain Officer      Faulkner, murder weapon in hand;       Whereas Mumia Abu-Jamal was charged and convicted of first      degree murder by a jury of his peers; although Mumia Abu-     Jamal has had numerous legal appeals, including appeals to      the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court of Appeal, the      Pennsylvania State Supreme Court, and the United States      Supreme Court, his conviction has been upheld each time;       Whereas on April 29, 2006, the municipal government of St.      Denis, a suburb of Paris, dedicated a street in the honor of      Mumia Abu-Jamal;       Whereas December 9, 2006, marks the 25th anniversary of      Officer Danny Faulkner's murder at the hand of Mumia Abu-     Jamal; and       Whereas the official recognition and celebration of a      convicted murderer of a United States police officer is an      affront to law enforcement officers across the Nation: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--       (1) condemns the murder of Philadelphia Police Officer      Danny Faulkner;       (2) urges the municipal government of St. Denis to take      immediate action to change the name of Rue Mumia Abu-Jamal      and, if such action is not taken by the municipal government      of St. Denis, urges the Government of France to take      appropriate action against the city of St. Denis to change      the name of Rue Mumia Abu-Jamal; and       (3) commends all police officers in the United States and      throughout the world for their commitment to public service      and public safety.
