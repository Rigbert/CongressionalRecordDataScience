 President, I ask unanimous consent that an outstanding column by George Will on the subject we have been debating for the last 9 days, from this morning's Washington Post, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the column was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 29, 2001]                        The Senate's Comic Opera                          (By George F. Will)       The overture for the Senate's campaign finance opera--opera      bouffe, actually--was indignation about President Bush's      decision against cutting carbon dioxide emissions. Reformers      said the decision was a payoff for the coal industry's      campaign contributions. But natural gas interests, rivals of      the coal interests, suffered from Bush's decision--yet they      gave Republicans more money ($4.8 million) last year then      coal interests gave ($3.37 million).       The ``reforming'' senators began their reforming by      legislating for themselves an even stronger entitlement to      buy television time at a discount, and by voting themselves a      right to take larger contributions (up to $6,000, rather than      just $1,000) when running against a rich, self-financing      opponent. The Supreme Court says the only permissible reason      for limiting political speech by limiting money is to prevent      corruption or the appearance thereof. The Senate did not      explain why it is corrupting to take $6,000 when running      against an opponent with a net worth of X but not corrupting      when running against an opponent with net worth of 10 times      X.       The Senate refused to ban, as nine states do, lobbyists      from contributing to legislators when the legislature is in      session. John McCain, at last noticing the Constitution, and      this inhibition on political giving is constitutionally      problematic, presumably because it restricts the rights to      political expression and to petition for redress of      grievances.       Constitutional scrupulousness is a sometime thing for      McCain, who once voted to amend the First Amendment to      empower government to do what his bill now aims to do--ration      political communications. For example, his bill would      restrict broadcast ads by unions and corporations and groups      they support in the two months before a general election or      30 days before a primary if the ads mention a candidate.       In a cri de coeur revealing the main motive for many      ``reform'' politicians--a motive having nothing to do with      corruption or the appearance of it--Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.)      said: ``I'm suffering an independent expenditure missile      attack, and I don't have my shield.'' Campaign finance reform      is primarily an attempt by politicians to shield themselves      from free speech--from, that is, the consequences of the      shield James Madison wrote to protect the people from      politicians: ``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the      freedom of speech.''       Last Saturday McCain's partner, Wisconsin Sen. Russell      Feingold, delivered the Democrats' response to President      Bush's weekly radio address. With the reformer's      characteristic hyperbole, Feingold attempted to reconnect      reform with ``corruption.'' He said: ``Members of Congress      and the leaders of both political parties routinely request      and receive contributions for the parties of $100,000,      $500,000, $1 million.''       Well. There are 535 members of Congress. In the last two-     year (1999-2000) election cycle, there were 1,564      contributions of $60,000 or more from individuals and      organizations. So all those legislators supposedly      ``routinely'' receiving such contributions for their parties      receive, on average, fewer than two a year. The total value      of all 1,564 was $365.2 million, a sum equal to one-     fourteenth the amount Procter & Gamble spent on advertising      during the same period.       The New York Times accurately and approvingly expresses      McCainism: ``Congress is unable to deal objectively with any      issue, from a patients' bill of rights to taxes to energy      policy, if its members are receiving vast     open-ended donations from the industries and people      affected.'' Oh. If only people affected by government would      stop trying to affect the government--if they would just shut      up and let McCain act ``objectively.''       If you doubt that reformers advocate reform because they      believe that acting ``objectively'' means coming to      conclusions shared by the New York Times, read ``Who's Buying      Campaign Finance Reform?'' written by attorney Cleta Mitchell      and published by the American Conservative Union Foundation.      It reveals that since 1996, liberal foundations and soft      money donors have contributed $73 million to the campaign for      George Soros, founder of drug legalization efforts and other      liberal causes, has contributed $4.7 million, including more      than $600,000 to Arizonans for Clean Elections--more than 71      percent of the funding of ACE.       Soros and seven other wealthy people founded and funded the      Campaign for a Progressive Future. One of those people,      Steven Kirsch, contributed $500,000 to campaign ``reform''      groups in 2000--and $1.8 million against George W. Bush.      Another reformer, Jerome Kohlberg, donated $100,000 to a      group that ran ads saying ``Let's get the $100,000 checks out      of politics.''       Let's be clear. These people have and should retain a      constitutional right to behave in this way, putting the      bouffe in the opera bouffe.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, a professor of law at the University of Kentucky College of Law also wrote an excellent op-ed piece in the Lexington-Herald Leader in my home State on Tuesday, essentially echoing many of the arguments a number of us have made against the underlying bill over the last 9 days. I ask unanimous consent that article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           [From the Lexington-Herald Leader, Mar. 27, 2001]               Campaign Finance Bill Treads on Our Rights                          (By Paul Salamanca)       I've heard it said that more than a hundred legal academics      agree that the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill      does not violate the First Amendment. I'm not one of them.       Believe it or not, political parties are expressive      associations. The First Amendment protects one's right to      speak freely, to write freely, to assemble peaceably and to      petition the government for redress of grievances (in other      words, to complain). The first, second and fourth of these      precious, hard-fought liberties are most effectively      exercised through association.       That's because almost all of us--me included--are too busy,      too poor or too inarticulate to speak effectively by      ourselves. But when we pool our time, talent and treasure, we      can move mountains, expressively speaking. And the third of      these liberties, peaceable assembly, explicitly protects      association.       Because political parties are dedicated to the discussion      and formulation of ideas, and to the identification and      promotion of people who will implement those ideas, the First      Amendment protects the American Civil Liberties Union, the      Sierra Club, the National Association for the Advancement of      Colored People and the National Right to Life Committee. Like      these associations, the Democratic and Republican parties are      expressive. Thus, limitation on the amount of money people      can give to political parties is constitutionally      indistinguishable from a limitation on the amount of money      people can give to the ACLU or the NAACP.       The upshot of this is simple: The giving of ``soft money''      to political parties is an exercise of First Amendment      rights, and a flat ban on soft money is unconstitutional.       One argument to the contrary is that soft money is a weak      form of bribery. But this argument operates from the      implausible assumption that political parties are, in fact,      the government. But this cannot be true. If an association      formed to criticize the government is, in fact, the      government, then we have a case of a shark trying to eat      itself.       Another provision of McCain-Feingold would ban or sharply      limit advertising by private groups that refers to a      candidate by name. This too would violate the First      Amendment. At its core, the First Amendment is designed to      facilitate discussion of political issues and candidates by      the ultimate sovereign in the United States: ``We the      People.'' So, if the First Amendment doesn't protect a      group's right to say ``Vote for X because of X's position on      such-and-such issue,'' it wouldn't be worth the toner it      takes to print it.       Thus, issue advertising, so much maligned these days, is an      important form of advocacy. In fact, it's the most effective      form of speech available to non-profit expressive      associations, such as the NAACP.       To preclude such groups from running ads that refer to      candidates before elections--or to impose so many regulations      on their ability to do so that many would give up trying--     would seriously interfere with free speech.       There are those who say that issue ads--ads that end by      saying something like ``Please call X and tell X that such-     and-such a policy is bad'' (in other words, the very ads that      McCain-Feingold would limit or ban)--are nothing more than      thinly veiled pieces of express advocacy.       But this couldn't be a more cruel irony because non-profits      would love to expressly advocate the election of X or the      rejection of Y without mincing words. The only reason they      don't is fear of overly aggressive interpretation of existing      federal law by the Federal Election Commission.       Indeed, this state of affairs gives rise to two distinct      anomalies. First, people watching TV are annoyed by issue ads      that don't come right out and express a preference, when the      associations running the ads would dearly love not to mince      words. Second, people, like Sens. John McCain and Russ      Feingold can use this annoyance, which itself is the product      of federal regulation, to justify further regulation of      speech.       And make no mistake: McCain-Feingold would regulate speech.      To the extent the bill would fall short of literally banning      issue advertising, it would accomplish about the same thing,      at least with regard to small associations and associations      whose members want to remain anonymous, by imposing onerous      accounting and reporting requirements on issue advertisers.       McCain-Feingold is unconstitutional. If it passes Congress,      the president should veto it--with or without paycheck      protection, with or without a severability clause. And      Kentucky's senior senator, Mitch McConnell is right to oppose      it.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there is much not to like in the Harkin amendment and one provision that has some appeal. I will talk about the provision that has some appeal at the end.  As I understand the Harkin amendment, it is taxpayer funding with a little different twist. What the Senator from Iowa has shrewdly done is suggest that the spending limit in his amendment is voluntary.  What in fact happens is, you have candidate A and candidate B. Let's assume candidate A, who is a well-known incumbent who doesn't need to spend as much to get his message home, is up against an unknown challenger, and that unknown challenger knows he needs to spend more to have a chance to win. As soon as that unknown challenger encroaches above the Government's specified spending limit, the Treasury of the United States provides $2 out of our tax money for every $1 the noncomplying candidate gets to spend. In other words, a hammer comes down on a noncomplying candidate just as soon as they encroach above the Government-specified speech limit--hardly voluntary.  That is sort of like a robber putting a gun to your head and saying: I would like to have your wallet but you, of course, really don't have to give it to me.  If you choose to exercise your right to speak beyond the Government-prescribed limit, bad things happen to you. The Federal Treasury of the United States gives you $2 for every $1 your opponent is spending to bludgeon you into submission.  The second part of the Harkin amendment is interesting in that it relies on volunteered tax money to provide the funding. This is different from the Presidential system where, as we know, we are able, if we choose, to check off $3 of tax money we already owe and to divert it away from things such as children's nutrition and food stamps and other worthwhile activities into a fund to pay for the Presidential elections. As I understand the Harkin checkoff, the taxpayer is actually asked to volunteer an additional sum of money from his return.  I predict to my friend from Iowa, there is going to be darn little participation in that. We know what the checkoff rate has been among taxpayers when it doesn't even add to their tax bill. The high water mark was in 1980, when it was slightly under 30 percent of taxpayers. There has been a steady trend downward to the point last year there were 11.8 percent of taxpayers volunteering money they already owed--it didn't add to their tax bill; it was money they already owed--to go to pay for buttons and balloons and campaign commercials and national conventions.  My colleagues get the drift. There is not a whole lot of interest on the part of the American taxpayer to pay for our political campaigns. In fact, we have a huge poll on that every April 15. The most massive poll ever taken on any subject is taken on the subject of using tax dollars for political campaigns. That poll is taken every April 15 on our tax return. Even when it doesn't add to our tax bill, about 10 percent of Americans choose to participate; 90 percent choose not to.  I say to my friend from Iowa, I don't think this will be a very reliable source of funds if the taxpayer actually has to ante up and provide money for a candidate he doesn't know. The chances of an American taxpayer choosing to donate money to a nameless candidate is virtually nil, I suggest.  A slightly differently nuanced version of taxpayer funding than we had before us earlier, the Kerry amendment, got 30 votes. I hope this amendment will get no more than 30 votes.  We have come a long way on this subject. Earlier in the Senate careers of the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Iowa and myself, we were actually debating taxpayer funding of elections and spending limits for campaigns on the floor of the Senate. That kind of bill actually passed the Senate in 1993. We have come a long way.  It is noteworthy that the underlying McCain-Feingold bill does not have any PAC ban in it. It doesn't have any tax money in it. It doesn't have any spending limits on candidates in it. We have come a long way.  Now all we are debating is whether or not we are going to destroy the great national parties, which I think is a terrible idea. We will get back to that issue later.  The Senator from Iowa sort of resurrects one of the golden oldies, one of the ideas from the past that sort of moved right on out of the public debate, by offering once again an opportunity for the taxpayers to subsidize candidates. There is a serious constitutional problem in the Treasury of the United States bludgeoning a noncomplying candidate who chooses to speak as much as he wants to with a 2-for-1 match out of the Treasury, $2 out of the Treasury for every $1 the poor challenger is trying to raise to get his name out. It seems to me that has serious constitutional problems.  There is one provision in the amendment of the Senator from Iowa I do find intriguing, and I commend him for it. That is the importance of the principle of nonseverability in this kind of debate. As I think our colleagues may remember--if they don't, let me remind them--the last three campaign finance reform bills that cleared the Senate, that actually got out of this body, had nonseverability clauses in them. In fact, on this subject of campaign finance, it is more common to have nonseverability clauses in them than out of them. The norm has been to have nonseverability clauses in campaign finance reform bills.  The Senator from Iowa--I commend him for this--links his amendment to the Snowe-Jeffords language in a nonseverability clause. And I commend the Senator from Iowa for doing that because it is a clear understanding that these kinds of bills are fraught with constitutional questions--fraught with them. And it is entirely appropriate to have linkages within these bills. It doesn't necessarily have to apply to the whole bill. And the amendment that the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Frist, will be offering early today does not link the whole bill. But it is entirely common and appropriate to add nonseverability clauses in these kinds of bills. I commend the Senator from Iowa for recognizing that principle. Even though I don't like the substance of his amendment, I do think the recognition of the importance of that principle is worthy of commendation. I commend him for that.  Mr. President, beyond that, I find not much to like about the amendment of the Senator from Iowa. I hope it will not be approved. I don't know if we will have other speakers on this side. For the moment, I reserve the remainder of my time, which is how much?
