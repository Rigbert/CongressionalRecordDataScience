President, Senator Merkley and I have come today together to discuss our resolution honoring the heroes of the Portland attack. On May 26 in Portland, our hometown, our community lost two very brave people: Ricky Best and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche. They stood up courageously against terrorism and for core American and Oregon values of tolerance and freedom.  Along with Micah David-Cole Fletcher, who was seriously injured, these three extraordinary Samaritans stepped in to protect two girls who were being terrorized on public transit by a man menacing them because he thought they were Muslim. These three Oregon heroes did not run when they saw danger. Instead, these three advanced toward the danger.  I paid my respects last week at the beautiful memorial that my fellow Portlanders created at the transit station where this attack occurred. I can assure my colleagues that the message of the memorial could not be more clear: The heroes of Portland stood up to terror, and we ought to be willing to call out the hate and the evil they confronted.  So today, I join with our friend and colleague Senator Merkley to expressour deepest condolences to the families, the friends of the victims, so that we can all make clear how much we appreciate them and how grateful we are--and we all are--to be able to stand with the two girls who were being terrorized and to support all community efforts to overcome hatred and bigotry and violence.  As a son of parents who fled the Nazis, I know full well what hate speech is all about. There must be zero tolerance for hate speech and violence because otherwise you give it room to fester and grow. Hate speech and violence must have no place in Oregon or anywhere else in our great Nation.  With these three Oregon heroes forever in our memories, we must and we will recommit to fighting hate, violence, and terrorism every chance that we have. We urge adoption of this important resolution.  I yield to my friend and colleague Senator Merkley.
