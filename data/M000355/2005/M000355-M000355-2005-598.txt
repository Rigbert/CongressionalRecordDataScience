 As we are beginning to learn, the President has selected one of the foremost legal minds of his generation. Many of my colleagues have already spoken Judge Roberts' praises onthis floor, and I agree with all of them. Judge Roberts possesses a keen intellect, an open mind, very importantly, a judicious temperament, and a sterling reputation for integrity. He will faithfully apply the Constitution, not legislate from the bench. He should be confirmed in time for the Court to operate at full strength by October 3.  Looking to recent history, and looking more specifically to the most recent Supreme Court nominations of Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, I would think that I should not have cause to worry how this nominee will be treated.
