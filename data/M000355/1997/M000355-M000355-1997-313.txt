 President, the American workplace has changed drastically since the enactment of the Fair Labor Standards Act--nearly 60 years ago. In those days, for example, a small percentage of working mothers toiled in the fields, factories, and general stores. Today, nearly 70 percent of mothers with children under the age of 6 are now working.  The constant refrain of both mothers and fathers in the nineties is: ``There's just not enough hours in the day.''  Well, the U.S. Senate can't put more hours in a day, but we can give workers more choices on how to spend those hours each day.  The time has come to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. I am proud to be a cosponsor of S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act.  Taking a look at this bill that Senator Ashcroft has so skillfully put together and advocated. I think that the Family Friendly Workplace Act is one of the best opportunities we've had in a long time to make a substantial contribution to America's working families. This bill is based on the comments and experiences of men and women who know the difficulty of balancing work and family.  Recently, a good friend of mine, Bill Stone, from Louisville, KY, my hometown, testified in support of S. 4 at a hearing before the Employment and Training Subcommittee of the Labor Committee upon which I serve. Bill runs the Louisville Plate Glass Co. Approximately three-fourths of this company's Louisville work force is paid on an hourly basis and would be directly impacted by S. 4.  As Bill explained to our subcommittee, he said, ``S. 4 will give a new and greatly needed measure of flexibility to our employees who are trying to meet the demands of raising children in single-parent or two-worker families. It will also,'' Bill stated, ``be a huge benefit to our employees who are pursuing training or educational activities.''  Now, let us take a look, Mr. President, at the compensatory time off provided for under the bill. If an employee at the Louisville Plate Glass Co. has to work overtime, then compensatory time off allows him to choose if he wants to be compensated with time-and-a-half pay or time-and-a-half time off.  A recent poll by Money magazine found that 66 percent of the American people would rather have their overtime in the form of time off than in hourly wages. And an astonishing 82 percent of people support legislation to allow workers to have this type of choice and flexibility.  The findings of this survey point to one conclusion, as explained by Ann Reilly Dowd of Money magazine. She put it this way. She said, ``People are considering time much more precious than money right now.'' And that is an enormous change in our society, Mr. President. Moreover, as Ms. Dowd concluded, ``it seems that people are working so hard and being so torn between the mounting demands of their job and their family life that they really, really want more free time and they, particularly, want more flexible schedules.''  The Senate has a responsibility to respond to this overwhelming national need for choice and flexibility in the workplace.  Passing comptime legislation is just the first step in our response. Unfortunately, comptime alone is not enough. A bill that only includes comptime provisions will only include a small percentage of workers who actually work overtime.  S. 4 also includes two important provisions for workers who typically do not get the opportunity to work overtime. In most cases these workers are women.  For example, nearly three out of four workers reporting overtime pay aremen. In order to accommodate working mothers, as well as other employees who do not regularly work overtime, S. 4 includes the biweekly work program and the flexible credit hours program.  If a working mother chooses to work 45 hours in week 1 so that she can work 35 hours the next week and have 5 hours to spend on a school field trip with her children, then the biweekly work program allows her to do that without sacrificing either pay or vacation time. Or if an employee chooses to work extra time in any one workweek, then flexible credit hours allows him or her to put those additional hours in the bank, so to speak, and take paid time off at a later date.  Compensatory time off, the biweekly work program and flexible credit hours have two things in common: choice and paid time off. Simply put, this bill just makes good sense. It is about nothing more than giving options to employees.  The Family Friendly Workplace Act gives employees the opportunity to get paid time off at virtually no cost to the employer. Everybody wins.  The opponents of the Family Friendly Workplace Act argue that our country's employees will not be able to handle this flexibility. The skeptics argue that the employees will be coerced.  First, let me say, Government employees have had comp and flextime privileges for years--Government employees have had that right--and there is virtually no hard evidence to support the potential horror stories conjured up by opponents of S. 4.  Second, our bill contains strong penalties for any employer who forces an employee to accept time over money.  Diane Buster, an hourly employee from my hometown of Louisville, KY, recently spoke very passionately to the need for S. 4. She explained that       . . . for the last 15 years I have been in the full-time      work force bound by an archaic law, the Fair Labor Standards      Act, passed in 1938 when only about 20 percent of women      worked . . . [Under this law], the privilege of compensatory      time is denied to hourly employees in private business while      it is permitted to salaried employees in the private sector      and to employees of the Federal Government.  Ms. Buster ultimately concluded that ``this seems patently unfair and smacks of elitism, if not discrimination. A vote for fairness seems in order.''  The Paducah Sun in my State issued a similar statement a few weeks ago in an editorial that concluded that ``the comp time bill ought to be passed * * * The language guarantees the right of workers to take overtime pay if they desire, so labor's objection that the companies can't be trusted is only so much old-school us-against-them thinking.''  Finally, I would like to point out that in Government settings union leaders routinely demand that employers allow flexible scheduling provisions as part of a collective bargaining agreement. I must confess that it strikes me as a little bit odd that union leaders are now fighting to block all hourly employees from receiving the very benefit they seek for their own union employees.  In the words of The Courier-Journal, which is our largest State newspaper, ``[Comptime] looks like a win-win situation. Workers and employers would get more flexibility in working out schedules, and neither side would be forced to participate. What's Bill Clinton scared of?'' said the Courier-Journal.  The answer to that newspaper's question, sadly enough, may be that the President and the union bosses are simply playing politics at the expense of the American worker.  The presidents of the UAW, the Steelworkers, and the Machinists wrote a letter to President Clinton on April 28 of this year that sums up the politics which threaten to block S. 4. I would like to quote from that letter. This is what the union bosses had to say:       Politically, any compromise with Senate Republicans on the      comp time legislation . . . would undermine the Democratic      Party's political base among working men and women, and      jeopardize our ability to energize workers to achieve the      goal of electing a Democratic House and Senate [in 1998].  That pretty well says it all, Mr. President. That pretty well says it all. You have to give them points for candor.  Mr. President, there may be some valid arguments out there for genuine debate on S. 4, but it is surely not those arguments. We should not block legislation that is good for the American worker and the American workplace simply because it may ``undermine the Democratic Party's political base'' and ``jeopardize [the] ability to energize [campaign] workers.''  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the statements of Bill Stone and Diane Buster and the editorials of the Paducah Sunday and the Courier Journal be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Statement by William A. Stone Before the Subcommittee on Employment and                       Training, February 13, 1997       My name is William A. Stone, I am President of Louisville      Plate Glass Company in Louisville, Kentucky. We are the      majority stockholder in two Atlanta glass manufacturing      firms, Tempered Glass, Inc. and Insulating Glass of Georgia.      I am the Chief Executive Officer of both Atlanta companies.      Louisville Plate Glass is a member of the U.S. Chamber of      Commerce, the world's largest business federation      representing an underlying membership of more than three      million businesses and organizations of every size, sector,      and region. I am a member and former Chairman of the      Chamber's Labor Relations Committee. I also served on the      Chamber's Small Business Council and Board of Directors for      five years.       Our companies manufacture architectural glass products      primarily for commercial buildings and employ about 116      people in three locations. I purchased the Louisville Plate      Glass Company 25 years ago. We had only 19 employees at the      time. Now, approximately 110 people are employed by these      companies, with about 40 working in Louisville and the others      in Atlanta. Approximately three-fourths of the Louisville      workforce are paid on an hourly basis and record their work      hours on a time clock. They are primarily production workers,      truck drivers, and shipping personnel.       The average Louisville employee usually works about 10      overtime hours per week. The truck drivers usually work more      overtime hours than the employees in the plant. Our hourly      employees are scheduled to work five days per week and, when      extra work is necessary, they prefer to work longer days      during the week than to work on Saturday. However, sometimes      it is necessary to schedule some employees to work on a      Saturday. If an employee is unable to report for work, he or      she must use accumulated vacation time or other paid time      off, if any is available.       We have had few, employees ask to take time off without      pay, and instead be scheduled or allowed to work extra hours      during the same pay period as their absence in order to earn      the pay they would have received had they not missed work.      They do not even bother to ask for this arrangement because      they know that in most cases, the necessary arrangements      cannot be made within the well-known restrictions of the Fair      Labor Standards Act (FLSA).       Today you are considering The Family Friendly Workplace Act      (S. 4). This bill provides that hourly employees can, with      their employers' agreement, earn time off instead of overtime      pay so they can take time off to attend to personal or family      business. I am here to tell you that passage of this bill      will provide many employees, like those of Louisville Plate      Glass, with what they perceive as a new and very valuable      benefit. If this bill becomes law, my company will      immediately make every effort to allow our employees to      earn compensatory or ``comp'' time. I have no doubt at all      that almost all, if not all, of our employees will ask to      be able to earn time off instead of, or in addition to,      overtime pay for the extra hours that they work. They will      quickly see that with even modest amounts of accrued comp      time, they will be able to attend to personal and family      business without suffering a loss in pay because of their      absence.       Of course, it would be not only unwise but essentially      unworkable to allow employees with accrued comp time to use      that accrued time whenever they pleased. Our production and      shipping schedules, with our limited staff, will not permit      extended or frequent worker absences without reasonable      notice and arrangements. I am confidant that we will be able      to make the necessary arrangements for most employees to use      their accrued time off most of the time.       The comp time arrangement envisioned in S. 4 will give a      new and greatly needed measure of flexibility to our      employees who are trying to meet the demands of raising      children in single-parent or two-worker families. It will      also be a huge benefit to our employees who are pursuing      training or education activities. In fact, with the FLSA      changes embodied in S. 4, especially comp time, there would      little or no need for most of the provisions of the Family      and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Few employees would opt for      partially paid leave under the FMLA when they could use      accumulated compt time and receive their normal paychecks      even though they were absent.       Employees in the public sector have been able to use comp      time for over ten years. I understand that federal government      employees have had this benefit for even longer. There is      absolutely no reason that private-sector workers, like those      at Louisville Plate     Glass and other businesses large and small, should not have      the comp time benefit that the government saw fit to provide      to its own employees long ago. It's time that family-friendly      employers in the private sector be permitted to have the      flexibility to work with employees to meet not only their      workforce needs but the needs of their employees as well.       In my years of involvement in public policy, I have always      been able to see that, no matter how contentious the issue,      the other side had legitimate points. However, in this case      there does not seem to be any legitimate reason not to allow      private-sector employees the same opportunity for flexibility      that their brothers and sisters in the public sector enjoy.       Thank you for the privilege of allowing me to speak on      behalf of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on this important      issue. I would be happy to answer any questions.                                                                    ____                       Statement by Diane Buster       My name is Diane Buster, I reside in Louisville, Kentucky      where I work as Administrative Assistant to the Executive      Director of a small, local, not-for profit corporation. Why,      you may wonder, would I get up at 4:00 a.m., take a day off      without pay and travel here to speak on the issue of      workplace flexibility? Why? Because I am passionate about the      need for the passage of the Work and Family Integration Act.       As part of the labor force in this country for almost      thirty years, always in position where I have been paid an      hourly wage, I have lobbied in every position I have had for      flexibility to manage my home, family and personal life.      Always the price I paid for that flexibility was a lesser      wage and less responsibility as I settled for part-time work      to enable me to manage the demands of my responsibilities as      homemaker and mother in addition to my work duties.       For the last 15 years I have been in the full-time work      force bound by an archaic law, The Fair Labor Standard Act,      passed in 1938 when only about 20% of women worked as      compared to the almost 60% of women currently in the labor      force. This act mandates that I may only work 40 hours per      week and that, should I exceed that amount of hours in any      seven contiguous days, my employer is required to pay me one      and one half times my normal wage, even though I would prefer      to be allowed time off in lieu of the overtime pay. This law,      I'm told, applies to hourly workers whose duties are not self      directed. Tell me I'm not self directed when I am the only      one left in the office when the non-classified staff,      privileged to direct their own schedule, has all left early      to attend family functions, shop, play golf or indulge in      some similar recreation!       As a working mother and grandmother, with family all      residing out of state, helping out in emergency situations      and caring for the needs of my immediate family members would      be infinitely more possible with a bank of compensatory time      to draw on to use for such emergency care needs. The meager      budget of the small non-profit corporation where I work,      whose staffing needs fluctuate, would quite obviously be      better off not having to pay me overtime wages, permitting me      compensatory time when the workload is less. In know I am not      alone, but one of thousands of workers for whom the stress of      balancing the demands of work, home, personal and family      needs would be greatly alleviated by having more control over      my work schedule. Small businesses, the backbone of our      communities, who are being choked to death, forced to adhere      to laws and restrictions which make no sense for their time      and place in our economy today, would also be enormously      helped by being able to predicate their work schedules on the      specific demands of their particular business.       As the law currently stands, the privilege of compensatory      time is denied to hourly employees in private business while      it is permitted to salaried employees in the private sector      and to employees of the Federal government. This seems      patently unfair and smacks of elitism, if not discrimination.      A vote for fairness seems in order.       Passage of the Work and Family Integration Act will, I      believe, immensely help to alleviate stress for the working      population and greatly assist small businesses.                                                                    ____                  [From the Paducah Sun, Feb. 7, 1997]                             Pass Comp Bill       Opposition by some congressional Democrats and their      supporters in organized labor to a plan to allow compensatory      time off for hourly workers in lieu of overtime pay has an      odd ring to it.       The bill pushed by the GOP Congress, and endorsed by      President Clinton, would give employees the option of taking      the time, at the rate of 1\1/2\ hours for each overtime hour,      if the employer agrees. Workers would be able to bank time      for personal use, as many obviously would prefer. Many      companies also would rather give the employees time off      instead of the extra money.       Unions have criticized the idea as an attack on the      traditional 40-hour work week. The don't trust employers not      to pressure their employees to take the time off rather than      the overtime compensation.       But the real reason for the political opposition to the      plan is revealed in this statement by Rep. Lynn Woolsey,      Democrat of California: ``It will be flexible for the      employer. We must ensure that the employee has 100 percent      choice.'' Translation: The legislation is wrong because it      doesn't force the employer to do anything. Never mind that      the bill would give the worker a potential choice the      existing law denies him completely.       The family leave issue, it is recalled, was      enthusiastically embraced by Democrats as a great step      forward for working families. The law gives workers the      option of taking 12 weeks unpaid leave to deal with family      needs. In other words, they voluntarily give up money in      exchange for time off and flexibility, just as the comp time      bill would do.       So what's the difference? It is the mandate issue. Under      family leave, the company has no choice but to allow the      absence. To liberals, providing an avenue where an employee      and his boss can work out a mutually satisfactory arrangement      is not good enough. In fact, the whole idea apparently is so      obnoxious to them they would rather leave matters as they are      and give the worker no legal option for a more flexible work      schedule.       The comp time bill clearly ought to be passed. Salaried and      government employees already have the privilege, so why not      extend it to hourly workers? The language guarantees the      right of workers to take the overtime pay if they desire, so      labor's objection that the companies can't be trusted is only      so much old-school us-against-them thinking.       The late Paul Tsongas once made a trenchant observation to      the effect that too many of his fellow Democrats love jobs      but hate employers. Rep. Woolsey and others have done their      part in proving him right.                                                                    ____               [From the Courier-Journal, Mar. 22, 1997]                         It's ``Comptime'' Time       What's so scary about ``comptime''?       In the debate leading up to its passage by the U.S. House      of Representatives this week, a bill offering new flexibility      on wages and working hours was denounced by some opponents as      a threat to freedom, fairness and the American way.       And President Clinton has warned that he'll veto it in its      present form. That's a formidable threat since the bill      passed by only 12 votes in the House. (All five of Kentucky's      Republican members voted for it. Democrat Scotty Baesler      voted against.)       We're puzzled by Mr. Clinton's opposition. The bill doesn't      endanger the 40-hour work week at the heart of the Fair Labor      Standards Act of 1938. All it says is that, if workers and      their employers agree, comptime can be substituted for      overtime pay. An employee who works, say, 45 hours in a week      would have the option of getting paid time-and-a-half for the      five hours or of getting 7\1/2\ hours of comp time.       At the end of the year, any accrued comp-time would be      converted to overtime pay. And the total amount of comptime      during a year couldn't exceed 160 hours.       Employers could choose not to participate in a compensatory      time agreement or, if they were in one, could withdraw after      30 days notice. Workers could withdraw at any time by      submitting a written request. (In unionized work places, work      schedules and rules for overtime would be set by contract.)       This looks like a win-win situation. Workers and employers      would get more flexibility in working out schedules, and      neither side would be forced to participate.       What's Bill Clinton scared of?  Mr. McCONNELL. I challenge my colleagues to enact this simple, sensible legislation. The family friendly workplace is about nothing more than choice and paid time off. S. 4 is the Federal Government at its best--benefits for working families with no Federal mandates and no excessive costs for small businesses. I also particularly commend Senator Ashcroft for his leadership in developing this important legislation.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
