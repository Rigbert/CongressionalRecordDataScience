President, I am proud to submit today a bipartisan resolution to designate May 15, 2007, as National Peace Officers Memorial Day. Joining me in the submission of this resolution are Senators Specter, Reid, Biden, Grassley, Cornyn, and Stabenow. I thank them for their leadership in recognizing the sacrificesthat law enforcement officers make each day for the American people.  This is now the eleventh year running that I have been involved in the submission of this resolution to keep alive in the memory of all Americans the sacrifice and commitment of those law enforcement officers who lost their lives serving their communities. For many years I submitted this worthy resolution with my old friend and our former colleague Senator Campbell, a former deputy sheriff who was a true leader on this issue. Both Senator Campbell, and I, as a former prosecutor, witnessed firsthand the risks faced by law enforcement officers every day while they serve and protect our communities.  I also want to thank each of our Nation's law enforcement officers for their commitment to the safety and protection of their fellow citizens. They are the real-life heroes; too many of whom too often make the ultimate sacrifice. It is important to support and respect our State and local police officers and all of our first responders, and to recognize their role in upholding the rule of law and keeping our Nation's citizens safe and secure.  Currently, more than 870,000 men and women who guard our communities do so at great risk. After the hijacked planes hit the World Trade Center in New York City on September 11, 2001, 72 peace officers died while trying to ensure that their fellow citizens in those buildings got to safety. That act of terrorism resulted in the highest number of peace officers ever killed in a single incident in the history of our country, and is a tragic reminder of how important it is for the Congress to provide all of the resources necessary to protect officers in the line of duty.  Since the first recorded police death in 1792, there have been more than 17,900 law enforcement officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice. We are fortunate in Vermont that we rank as the State with the fewest officer deaths in history, with 19 recorded; however, that is 19 deaths too many. In 2006, 147 law enforcement officers died while serving in the line of duty, well below the decade-long average of 165 deaths annually, and a drop from 2005 when 156 officers were killed. A number of factors contributed to this reduction, including better equipment and the increased use of bullet-resistant vests, improved training and advanced emergency medical care. I hope as the 110th Congress moves forward that all Senators can work together to ensure that all of our law enforcement officers have the full support and resources of the Federal Government.  I am proud of the work I have been involved in to help make it safer on the beat for our officers. Back in 1998, Senator Campbell and I authored the Bulletproof Vest Grant Partnership Act in response to the tragic Carl Drega shootout on the Vermont-New Hampshire border, in which two state troopers who lacked bulletproof vests were killed. Since then, we have successfully reauthorized this program three more times: in the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000, in the State Justice Institute Reauthorization Act of 2004, and most recently as part of the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005. It is now authorized at $50 million per year through fiscal year 2009 to help State, tribal and local jurisdictions purchase armor vests for use by law enforcement officers. I have already begun to work with my colleagues to make sure that the Bulletproof Vest Partnership grant program is fully funded this year. Bulletproof vests have saved the lives of thousands of officers and are a fundamental line of defense that no officer should be without. I know I am not alone in calling for the Senate to fully fund the Bulletproof Vest Partnership program and I truly hope my colleagues will agree that it is critical that we provide the funding authorized for this program. Hundreds of thousands of police officers are counting on us.  I am also pleased to join with Senator Reed and others to introduce the Equity in Law Enforcement Act, which will provide parity in Federal benefits for law enforcement officers working in private educational institutions and for our Nation's rail carriers. Among these benefits are access to grants under the Bulletproof Vest Partnership, and survivor benefits. All of the men and women who serve our society as law enforcement officers should be equally entitled to all of the benefits the Federal Government provides, no matter where they serve.  National Peace Officers Memorial Day will provide the people of the United States, in their communities, in their State Capitals, and in the Nation's Capitol, with the opportunity to honor and reflect on the extraordinary service and sacrifice given year after year by our police forces. During the week of May 8-15, more than 20,000 peace officers are expected to gather in Washington to join with the families of their fallen comrades. I hope all Senators will join me in honoring their service by passing this important bipartisan resolution.                          ____________________
