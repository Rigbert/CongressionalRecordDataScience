 Madam Speaker, the Delaware River is the last free-flowing river in the eastern United States. Approximately 330 miles in length, the river flows along four State boundaries and provides water to nearly 10 percent of the Nation's population. The upper and middle Delaware River regions have already received wild and scenic designation; and in 1992, Congress authorized a study of the lower Delaware region to determine its viability for the wild and scenic designation.  The study concluded that 14 segments were eligible for the wild and scenic classification. S. 1296 would designate eight of these segments as wild and scenic. According to S. 1296, the Secretary of Interior will continue working with the local river municipalities and within 3 years of the enactment of this bill may designate any of the remaining segments in the management plan as wild and scenic.                              {time}  1445  Madam Speaker, I urge support for S. 1296.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
