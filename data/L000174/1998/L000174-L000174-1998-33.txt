President, it is a time when Senators say goodbye to Senators who are leaving, and I was privileged, in 1974, to be elected with a very special class of Senators, a very large class of Senators--nearly a dozen--who came to this body. We developed personal friendships. Of that class, there are only four left: The distinguished senior Senator from Ohio, Mr. Glenn; the distinguished senior Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Ford; the distinguished senior Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Bumpers; and myself. Each of the other three have announced their plans to retire this year. In some ways I feel like the lonely person who is given the chore to turn out the lights after everybody else leaves, because I will be the last of the class of 1974.  I am going to speak of each of them, but I wish to speak now and to give tribute to a great statesman, a person who is recognized as a true American hero and a very good friend of mine, John Hershel Glenn, Jr.  As I said, we both arrived in the Senate at the same time in 1974. There was a big difference, however. I came here as a 34-year-old unknown county prosecutor from rural Vermont. John Glenn arrived here as a living American legend. We have served together now for 24 years and it is with the fondest memories that I recollect his time here. I remember the very first day I met him. The two of us had gone over to see the legendary Jim Eastland, President pro tempore of the Senate. That is probably the only time, then or since, I have ever seen John Glenn look at all nervous, was going in to see Senator Eastland. Senator Glenn was nervous. I was terrified. There is a big difference.  But John Glenn will be remembered here in the Senate as a man who advocated a role for Government in daily life, but he never stopped trying to make Government more efficient. He is one of our leading experts on science and technology. He has always been a tireless advocate for Government-sponsored scientific and health research. He brought tremendous intellect and dedication to the task of preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction. I remember when the United States and the Soviet Union were locked in a wasteful nuclear arms race, John Glenn was a voice of reason and moderation.  He has used his seat on the Armed Services Committee to advocate for our men and women in uniform, while at the same time looking out for wasteful spending. I remember, when I and others began to have doubts about the costly B-2 bomber--$2 billion a plane--that I read papers and memos about it. John Glenn went out and flew it, then came back and said its cost outweighed its benefits. I credit him for saving the taxpayers a lot of money.  He used his position in the Governmental Affairs Committee to expose waste in Government and to clean up the Nation's nuclear materials production plants.  In his conduct here in the Senate, John has always been nonpartisan, polite, accommodating, but always true to his beliefs. His personality reminds me of Longfellow's words, ``A tender heart; a will inflexible.''  It is hard for us to think of John Glenn before he was a national hero, but not so long ago he was a smalltown boy like many of us. He was born on July 18, 1921, in Cambridge, OH. He grew up in the tiny town of New Concord, OH. But, like millions of Americans, his life was forever changed by World War II.  Many of us know the details of what makes John Glenn a hero, but I want to repeat them for my colleagues. Shortly after Pearl Harbor, he was commissioned in the Marines Corps. He served as a fighter pilot in the South Pacific. He stayed in the Marines, and when the Korean War started, John Glenn requested combat duty. He ended up flying 149 combat missions in both wars. How good a pilot is our colleague from Ohio? In the last 9 days of fighting in Korea, he downed three Chinese MiG fighters in combat along the Yalu River.  In July 1957, he set a speed record from Los Angeles to New York, the first transcontinental flight to average supersonic speed.  An avid pilot to this day, John has over 9,000 hours of flight time in a variety of aircraft. To put that statistic in perspective, to equal that mark you would have to fly 8 hours a day, every day of the year, for 3 years.  Probably the flight that I remember the best, the one I enjoyed as much as any, was when John Glenn and I flew to the northeast kingdom of Vermont in a small float plane at the height of glorious fall foliage. John and Annie Glenn were staying with Marcelle and I at our farm in Middlesex, VT. John had borrowed the plane from a friend of mine in Vermont. We flew up and set down in one of those little Vermont ponds with the fall foliage around it. There happened to be a trapper's convention there. Some of the people therewere calling him Colonel Glenn, not Senator Glenn. They kind of put up with me being there, but he was the hero.  Of course I do remember also the look on John and Marcelle's and Annie's faces when we landed in Montpelier Airport in a heavy crosswind. John turned to me after he taxied up and said, ``You know, I have never been so frightened landing anything in my life,'' which almost stopped my heart to hear him tell it. But when we got out of the plane, John was wearing--this is accurate now--a skunk-skin cap which the trappers had given him.  He stepped out of the airplane with me shaking and quivering behind him. Annie turned to Marcelle and says, ``Marcelle, I told you we never should have let those boys go off by themselves.''  We all know what happened in a far more dramatic time when John strapped himself into a tiny capsule on top a gigantic tube of volatile fuel on February 20, 1962. When he landed 4 hours 55 minutes later, John Glenn not only became the first American to orbit the Earth, but he boosted the psyche of our Nation in a way not seen equaled before or since.  Cicero said a man of courage is also full of faith. It should be said that John Glenn is a man who puts all his faith in God.  All his accomplishments here in the Senate, in the cockpit, in the capsule, all pale before the one true constant in John Glenn's life, and that is the love he shares with his beautiful wife Annie. They are truly a couple for the ages and role models for all of us. Married for 55 years, they have two wonderful children, John David and Carolyn Ann, whom we all know as Lyn.  When the space shuttle Discovery surges into space later this month, the cabin will be cramped with the seven astronauts aboard. But sitting with John in spirit, as she has for so many years, will be Annie. They are truly inseparable. No matter how fast or far he travels, she is always with him.  Mr. President, later this month the eyes of the Nation and the world will focus on Cape Canaveral, FL. We will watch as a marvelous machine, built by Americans, flown by an international crew, roars into the heavens in the name of science, and on board will be our colleague from Ohio, a great Senator, an expert pilot and extraordinary American hero, my friend, John Glenn. I intend to be there to cheer him on.  Once again, as he has done in so many ways over the years, John Glenn will make us turn our eyes toward the heavens, and like all who will be there, I will say, ``Godspeed, John Glenn, and thank you.''  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from Roll Call about Senator Glenn be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From Roll Call, Oct. 5, 1998]    Glenn Counts Down to Launch With Complete Support From Wife and                Colleagues--Senator Set to Repeat History                             (By Ed Henry)       He's survived 149 combat missions as a Marine, orbited the      Earth three times at 17,544 miles per hour as an astronaut      and endured 24 years of partisan battles as a Senator.       But John Glenn says that one of the toughest missions of      his life came as a husband: convincing his wife, Annie, that      it was a good idea for him to be shot into space again at the      end of this month.       ``Let's say she was a little cool with this whole idea to      begin with--that's the understatement,'' Glenn said in an      interview about the Oct. 29 space mission. ``She didn't react      too kindly when I first started talking about this some time      ago.''       The 77-year-old Ohio Democrat said that while the couple's      two children were not excited about the Discovery launch      either, ``Annie was the main one to convince.''       Slipping into the lingo of an old Marine, Glenn noted that      based on all of the dangers he's already faced, he could have      gotten ``bagged'' long ago.       ``There were lots of times that things could have gone a      little bit different way, but they didn't,'' he said. ``But I      think all my life, I guess, you don't look back and think      what might have been or where you might have gotten bagged or      whatever. You look forward. There are risks in everything you      do.''       Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), one of the couple's closest      friends, said Annie was ``apprehensive'' about the fact that      her husband was heading into space so close to his retirement      from the Senate.       ``She had some reluctance because he was coming to a time      in his life when they were going to have more time      together,'' said Leahy. ``They are an extraordinarily close      couple--they're sort of the role model for all of us in our      own marriages.''       Nobody underestimates the strength of Annie Glenn, who      toughed her way through her husband's Feb. 20, 1962, Mercury      mission, when he flirted with death in the 36-cubic-foot      Friendship 7. She also had the guts to stand up to then-Vice      President Lyndon Johnson by refusing to let him come into her      home for a photo-op, out of fear for how her stutter would      look in front of Johnson and so many network TV      correspondents.       She was sitting up in the House gallery on that day in 1962      when Glenn jubilantly told a joint session of Congress, ``I      want you to meet my wife, Annie * * * Annie * * * the rock!''       And Glenn was there for Annie, Leahy recalled, when she      conquered her stuttering problem 20 years ago. ``We don't      think of them as John or Annie,'' he said. ``We think of them      as JohnandAnnie--it's just one word.''       In finally deciding to hop aboard for this mission, Annie      thought back to a vow her husband had made on the day they      wed 55 years ago.       ``One thing that she's reminded me of is that on our      wedding day, along with the vows, one of the things I told      her that day or that night sometime was that I would pledge      to her I would try to do everything I could to keep life from      ever being boring,'' said the Senator.       Then he added with a laugh, ``And she's reminded me of that      several times in the past, and this time, too, that she'd      just as soon have things be a little bit more boring.''       Since critics have said the upcoming nine-day mission is      merely a joy ride, Glenn has done his homework. With great      specificity, he can recount how the research about how a      senior citizen is affected in space will do a great deal for      the 34 million seniors in America.       ``She gradually over a period of time became an enthusiast      for this,'' he said. ``She's changed her view on this, as has      my whole family, so she's excited about it.''       Sen Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.) said he spoke to Annie last week      and she revealed that NASA will be providing a laptop so she      can communicate with her husband in space.       ``I said, `Annie, aren't you apprehensive at all about this      flight?' '' recalled Bumpers. `` `She said, `I'm never      apprehensive about anything John really wants to do.' ''       Annie Glenn will not be the only person close to the      Senator lending her support at Cape Canaveral. A bipartisan      delegation of Senators will be heading down to Florida on an      official CODEL authorized by Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-     Miss.) and Minority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.).       Daschle plans to be there for the launch, even though he      faces re-election back in South Dakota less than a week      later. Because Lott has a scheduling conflict, he will be      sending Senate Appropriations Chairman Ted Stevens (R-     Alaska)--who helped come up with the idea of a trip--to lead      the Republican side.       ``Senators have a way of coming together when another is      involved,'' Lott said in an interview.       The office of Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Greg Casey, who is      organizing the trip, does not have a complete list of      Senators attending yet. The trip will originate from Andrews      Air Force Base on the morning of the launch.       ``We have a lot of interest from Senators,'' said Secretary      of the Senate Gary Sisco, who will also attend.       Glenn said that while colleagues have not discussed the      launch with him, he's heard whispers about it and feels      gratified.       ``It's a good feeling to know that there are going to be      people there that you have worked with all these years--that      they think enough about it to be down there,'' he said.       Another person who was supposed to be at the Cape was Alan      Shepard, his onetime rival in the Mercury program, who      recently died. Glenn admits that Shepard's death reminded him      of his own mortality, but the Senator insists he's not      worried about his safety.       ``I've always been very aware of my own mortality anyway,''      said Glenn. ``I got over that teenage immortality bit a long      time ago.''       Glenn suggested he is at peace with his decision. ``I have      a deep religious faith and I have all my life,'' he said. ``I      don't believe in calling on your religion like a fire engine,      you know, `Oh God, get me out of this mess I've gotten myself      into and I'll be so good even you won't believe it.''       He added, ``But I think . . . we should all live so that if      something like that happens to us it won't be a big shock.      It's a shock. It would be a shock, of course. Nothing can be      100 percent safe. Everyone knows that. But I think the safety      record NASA has had through the manned space program has been      absolutely amazing.''       Besides his combat missions in Korea and World War II,      Glenn faced danger in 1962.       ``Some of the ophthalmologists predicted your eyes might      change shape,'' he said. ``It was serious enough that if you      look at the Friendship 7 over there in the Air and Space      Museum now, up on top of the instrument panel there's still a      little eye chart that I was to read every 20 minutes to see      if my eyes were changing.''       When asked why he took such risks, without so much as a      blink Glenn responds, ``I thought it was valuable for the      country.''       Colleagues say it is this modesty--as well as Glenn's      relationship with his wife--that they will remember most.       ``He's one of my favorite people in the whole world because      he wears his heroism with such extraordinary modesty,'' said      Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.).       Senators like 51-year-old Tim Johnson (D-S.D.) seem awed by      getting the chance to serve with Glenn.       ``It's like serving with a legend,'' said Johnson. ``The      fact that I served with John Glenn is something I'll tell my      grandkids.''       As a young Navy pilot, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) revered      Glenn and says the upcoming mission will remind everyone of      that.       ``I know it will just affirm in people's minds that we're      privileged to have known a great American hero,'' he said.      ``I am honored to be in his company. I am serious. I am      honored to be in his company.''       Sen. Richard Bryan (D-Nev.) said he will try to be in      Florida, partially because of a simple expression of love he      saw when Bonnie Bryan and Annie Glenn recently traveled      together to Saudi Arabia. From across the globe, Mrs. Glenn      placed a phone call to her husband in the Senate cloakroom.       Bryan recalled, ``He was very excited and came up to me and      said, `I've got Annie on the line, would you like to talk to      Bonnie?' John and Annie have this very special relationship--     you can sense that.''       Leahy recalled riding in the back seat one time as the      Glenns kept teasing and poking fun at one another in front      seat.       ``The two of them are like a pair of teenagers,'' he said.       But a much sadder occasion reminded Leahy of his affection      for the couple. When Leahy's mother died last year, he found      out that the Glenns had been trying to lift her spirits      during her illness.       ``One of the things I found on her bed stand was a      handwritten note from John and Annie,'' said Leahy. ``They      both had written a couple of paragraphs in the letter. These      are very special people.''       For Glenn, his frequent trips to Houston for training seem      to have been a sort of fountain of youth.       Every time Glenn returns from Houston, said Sen. Richard      Lugar (R-Ind.), he's been updated about the status of the      mission. ``It's wonderful to see someone so engaged and lit      up with enthusiasm,'' he said.       It has also reminded Glenn about the differences between      his two careers.       ``Here of course, the political lines are drawn and you      have confrontation and you have to put everything through a      political sieve to know what's real and what isn't in      people's minds,'' he said.       ``Back when I was in the Mercury program or in the program      down there now, it's such a pleasure to work in that program      because everything is so focused on one objective that      everybody's agreed on.''       The similarities between the two jobs, he concluded, are      limited.       ``Both fields take a lot of dedication to accomplish      anything. That would be a big similarity, dedication to      country and dedication to what you're doing. But that's about      where the similarities end.''
