  Chairman Barrasso has led an open, bipartisan process that has generated a strong proposal. It builds on President Trump's infrastructure approach, encouraging local control over local priorities and leveraging Federal resources to ensure that each dollar spent goes to major water infrastructure improvements. It cuts redtape and empowers the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to break through bureaucratic backlogs.  Thanks to Senator Boozman, it enhances the investments in our Nation's failing drinking water and waste water infrastructure.  My State of Kentucky contains more than 1,900 miles of navigable inland waterways. Our water resources support more than 13,000 jobs in the maritime industry. Paducah, KY, serves as the heart of America's inland waterways system, and Western Kentucky is also home to major water civil works projects like the Olmsted Locks and Dam and Kentucky Lock.  This bipartisan legislation is good news for communities throughout the Commonwealth. One provision, the Freedom to Fish Act, will help safeguard an important part of Kentucky's cultural heritage. Generations of Kentuckians have fished the Cumberland River and the tailwaters of the Barkley and Wolf Creek Dams.  I remember my dad and his friend taking us to fish there at a young age. They were experienced fishermen. The last thing they needed was advice from Federal bureaucrats on where to cast their lines, but, in 2012, in a typical display of Obama administration overreach, the Army Corps threatened to restrict access to these cherished waters. I didn't know anyone in Kentucky who thought it was a good idea. The farmers didn't, the anglers didn't, the area businesses relying on fishing tourism didn't. The Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife certainly didn't. So I worked with community leaders like my friend Lyon Countyjudge executive Wade White and my colleagues in the Kentucky and Tennessee congressional delegations to put a stop to this government interference. We introduced legislation to prevent the Army Corps from robbing our fishers and anglers of this beloved pastime and damaging this key component of the local economy. The measure passed with overwhelming support and was signed into law. It has been successful, but its provisions are set to expire soon.  That is why I worked with Chairman Barrasso, Ranking Member Carper, and the committee to secure a new 5-year extension of the Freedom to Fish Act in this year's water infrastructure bill. It is just another achievement among the many victories this bill will deliver for communities across the country.  I am grateful to the supporters of this legislation, such as the National League of Cities and the National Rural Water Association, and the bipartisan coalition of Senators who worked to craft it. I look forward to the committee's vote today and to supporting this bill once it reaches the Senate floor.                          ____________________
