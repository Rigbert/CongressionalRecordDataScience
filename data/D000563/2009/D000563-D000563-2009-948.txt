He has decided not to answer my question but to ask a question of me.  I say first that his assertion that this man, Ahmed Ghailani, if found not guilty would be released in the communities and neighborhoods of America cannot be sustained in law or in fact. He made that statement on the floor. That is the kind of statement that has been made about these Guantanamo detainees.  I don't know what will happen to Mr. Ghailani if he is found not guilty. It is conceivable that he could be charged with other things. It is conceivable he could face a military tribunal. It is conceivable he may be subject to detention.  I will say this with certainty. President Obama will not allow dangerous terrorists to be released in the United States in our communities and neighborhoods. I hope everyone on both sides of the aisle would agree with that.  I also wish to ask, if the Senator from Kentucky is critical of President Obama for announcing that he was going to close Guantanamo before he had a plan, why didn't we hear the same complaint when President George W. Bush announced he was going to close Guantanamo before he had a plan? Is the difference partisan?  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Illinois, he has made this point before, and I answered it before. I will answer it again.  I was against it when President Bush was in favor of it. I have been consistently against closing Guantanamo all along the way, no matter who the President was. At least you could say this about President Bush: He didn't put a date on it before he had an idea what he was going to do with them. And that is the core issue here.
