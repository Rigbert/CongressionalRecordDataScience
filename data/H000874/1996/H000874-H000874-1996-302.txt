Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me.  Mr. Chairman, I want to get up and say, as my chairman did, that it is unfortunate that this bill is on the floor.  I am a strong supporter of three strikes and you are out. Very frankly, this is about the third strike.  We say to those who break our laws, do it once, we are going to penalize you; do it twice, we are going to give you a long prison sentence; do it the third time, we are going to throw away the key because you are not learning.  You are on the brink of shutting down the Government for the thirdtime, putting people out on the street who want to work, who are doing good service for America, out on the street.  Why? Because this bill is not real, and you know it. Some of my reasonable friends on that side of the aisle unfortunately, in my opinion, are not in control, because what we ought to do is sit down with the President, say you are a coequal branch of Government, we are a co-equal branch of government, let us make it work. That is what the American people want.  Have you not heard their anger? Some of your Presidential candidates have heard their anger.
