President, to answer the Senator from Michigan, I am perfectly willing to voice vote both of them. I intend to vote for both of them. We are saying that you have a freedom of religion, and the courts cannot undermine the first amendment.  This is hornbook law. This is your first week of law school. No court is going to disagree with that. I am perfectly willing to accept both by a voice vote.                Amendment No. 1613 to Amendment No. 1511  So, Mr. President, I offer my amendment and send it to the desk.
