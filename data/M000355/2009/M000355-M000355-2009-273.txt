 President, I rise on behalf of the people of Louisville, my hometown, and across Kentucky who were saddened by the news that after 40 years on the air, WAVE-3 chief meteorologist Tom Wills is retiring. Tom first joined the station and began to be welcomed into people's homes over the airwaves back in 1969.  Many Louisvillians cannot imagine turning on the TV and not being able to find a forecast from Tom Wills. It is a rare and remarkable achievement to reach 40 years in broadcasting and even more so at the same station, serving the same community.  Tom earned the level of respect he has in Louisville by being one of the best meteorologists in the Nation. He is the only broadcast meteorologist in Louisville to hold the Certified Broadcast Meteorologist Seal from the American Meteorological Society, and he is among the earliest holders of the AMS Seal of Approval in the Nation to still be on the air.  We Louisvillians have appreciated waking up every morning the last 40 years knowing Tom is there to tell us whether we need our coat or our umbrella. Tom has also been a calming presence on the television screen at the time of severe weather, helping to save lives by providing crucial information.  Tom was on the air on April 3, 1974, the day when the most severe tornadoes in living memory cut a path of destruction through the city of Louisville. When it was over, lives had been lost, hundreds were injured, and over 900 homes were destroyed.  Throughout the night and into the early morning hours of the next day, Tom Wills was on the air telling people the information they needed to know. As tragic as those events were, we know things could have been worse if not for the lives saved and the tragedy averted thanks to Tom's work.  Tom Wills grew up in West Reading, PA, and knew by age 7 he wanted to do the weather when he grew up. While earning meteorology degrees at Penn State and Colorado State, he specialized in the science of tornado formation.  In addition to his WAVE-3 duties, he has passed along his knowledge and experience by teaching meteorology at the University of Louisville.  Now that he will no longer have to wake up at 2:30 a.m. every day, I hope Tom will have time to pursue his other interests, including gardening and following our Louisville Cardinals sports teams. Of course, his wife Pam, his kids, and his grandkids will be happy to see more of him. Tom is known throughout the community not just as a fine meteorologist but also a gentleman and friend to the many people he has met in his 40 years on the air. He is going to be greatly missed, and I wish to take this moment to thank him on behalf of Kentuckians everywhere for his service.  We are honored that for four decades he chose to share his talents with the people of Louisville and the Commonwealth of Kentucky.                          ____________________
