President, Senate Republicans' partisan obstructionism has reached a new low. There are 17 district court nominees pending before the Senate, and 12 of them would fill judicial emergency vacancies on our Federal trial courts. In an unprecedented breaking from our tradition, Senate Republicans have decided that they will recess for the election and deny almost all of these consensus nominees confirmation. Worse, they have decided to extend the delays that Americans face in our overburdened Federal courts by denying new judges to those courts. We all know that justice delayed is justice denied. By denying confirmation votes to 15 of these 17 nominations, Senate Republicans are denying justice to the American people. By refusing to vote on these 15 nominations, Senate Republicans have declared that they are unconcerned about the millions of Americans who will continue to lack adequate access to our Federal courts and speedy justice. =========================== NOTE ===========================     On page S6609, September 21, 2012, the Record reads: The nominations were confirmed.
