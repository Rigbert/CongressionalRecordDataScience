 President, this bill grants permanent residency status to Jasmin Salehi, a California constituent who is currently assisting the LA district attorney with the prosecution of her husband's murderer.  Mai Hoa Jasmin Salehi is a Korean immigrant who was denied permanent residency after her husband was violently murdered at a Denny's in Reseda, CA, where he worked as manager. Local INS officials in Los Angeles denied Jasmin's application because the law requires legal immigrants be married for 2 years before they become eligible for permanent resident status. Jasmin and Cyrus Salehi were newlyweds who had been married only 11 months before the murder.  I have previously sought administrative relief for Jasmin by asking the INS if any humanitarian exemptions could be made in Jasmin's case, but the local INS officials in Los Angeles has told my staff that there is nothing they can do.  Jasmin met and married Cyrus Salehi, an American citizen, in March 1995 and has completed all the paperwork necessary to obtain her green card. But now, Jasmin has been told that she can stay in the United States as long as the district attorney needs her to prosecute her husband's murderer. Despite here assistance in the prosecution, Jasmin would be deported once the investigation and subsequent trial are completed.  Jasmin has done everything right in order to become a permanent resident of this country--except for the tragedy of her husband's murder 13 months before she could become a permanent resident. I hope you support this bill so that we can help Jasmin begin to rebuild her life in the United States.  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the attached news article and the bill be entered into the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 508       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,       I. Permanent Residence:       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for purposes of      the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.),      Mai Hoa ``Jasmin'' Salehi, shall be held and considered to      have been lawfully admitted to the United States for      permanent residence as of the date of the enactment of this      Act upon payment of the required visa fees.                                                                         ____                   [From the Los Angeles Daily News]                       Widow's Troubles Multiply                        (By Jeannette DeSantis)       Things have gotten worse instead of better for Jasmin      Salehi.       Alone in a new apartment, half of her belongings still      packed in moving boxes, Salehi, 32, surveys her new residence      and wonders how it came to this.       When the Korean widow first came to the United States more      than a year ago, her life was filled with promise. A loving      husband with a steady income, friends and a comfortable home      in Sherman Oaks were more that she could ask for.       Then life handed her more.       Her husband of 11 months, Cyrus Salehi, was slain earlier      this year. Soon after, the Immigration and Naturalization      Service notified Salehi she would be deported because she had      not been married to a U.S. citizen long enough to get her      green card.       And recently, she was evicted from the only home she has      known since arriving in the United States.       ``All these things happened at one time,'' Salehi said.      ``It is really hard for me, and I get depresses . . .      especially during the holidays.''       In the midst of her first holiday season as a widow, Salehi      can only dream of her husband, Cyrus Salehi, killed in      February after two robbers shot him during a holdup at the      Reseda Denny's restaurant he owned.       ``There are lots of memories of my husband . . . and our      Christmases together,'' she said. ``Now, every Christmas will      be a Christmas without him.''       But it won't be a holiday season without friends.       Francine and Ralph Myers, who informally adopted Salehi      since Cyrus's death, met her through a victim support group.      The Myers, whose son was slain, know well how those first      holiday seasons can affect a victim of crime.       ``It can be a real tough time,'' Francine Myers said. ``It      is different for everyone. Jasmin doesn't want to decorate. I      remember (after my son died) I would try to change every      tradition we had and make new ones.''       Myers said Salehi is a survivor, who stood up to the INS      and was allowed to stay in the country until her husband's      accused killer stands trial. Meanwhile, she has not let her      own grief stop her from helping others.       ``Although she needs help, she unselfishly helps others,''      Myers said, adding that Salehi has accompanied her to the      trial of the person accused of murdering her own son. ``That      says something about her.''       Salehi contends that she is only returning the support the      Myers have given her. ``She is a victim too, and all that      time she is there for me,'' Salehi said.       Shellie Samuels, the deputy district attorney handling the      Cyrus Salehi murder case, said that although all victims of      crime are traumatized by a loved one's death, Salehi's ordeal      has been especially nightmarish.       ``Besides the emotional trauma she has gone through, the      U.S. has not done right by her,'' Samuels said. ``Her      American citizen husband gets killed and they treat her like      an illegal immigrant.''       Cyrus and Jasmin Salehi filed the paperwork for Salehi to      receive a green card in early 1995, soon after their March      nuptials.       But Salehi was deemed ineligible for residence status      because her husband was killed before they had been married      two years--an INS time requirement for a spouse sponsorship.       The INS has only offered Salehi a temporary reprieve,      allowing her to stay in the country for her husband's murder      trial.       As for Salehi, she fears if she is sent back to Korea, she      will be a stranger in her own country, a place where stigmas      are attached to orphans and widows, of which she is both.       Born Mai Hoa Joo in Seoul, Korea, in 1964, Salehi's parents      died within months of each other when she was 14. A college      graduate, Salehi visited the United States several times      before she immigrated.       During a 1993 visit, Salehi met her husband at a Denny's      restaurant in Los Angeles. They continued their relationship      even as Salehi returned to Korea.       Once married, Salehi received a work permit after she      applied for a green card and began working at a clothing      manufacturer in downtown Los Angeles, where she still puts in      10-hour days on a regular basis.       But her salary as a production manager was not enough to      cover the mortgage payment on the small house the couple      owned, even though she has inherited part ownership of the      Denny's restaurant where her husband was killed.       ``She has run into a lot of roadblocks, but she is a      survivor,'' said Francine Myers. ``She will do all right as      long as she feels like she has the support behind her.''                                 ______                                       By
