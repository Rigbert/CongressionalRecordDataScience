 Madam Speaker, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 made it unlawful for employers to knowingly hire or employ illegal aliens and required employers to check the identity and work eligibility documents of all new employees. Unfortunately, illegal aliens have used the easy and cheap availability of counterfeit documents to make a mockery of IRCA. Today's document-based verification system just does not work, and it frustrates employers who do not want to hire illegal aliens, but have no choice other than to accept documents that have a high likelihood of being counterfeit.  In 1996, Congress created a pilot program to help employers verify worker eligibility. Under this program, the employers who elect to participate in the pilot program may submit Social Security numbers and alien identification numbers of newly hired employees to be checked against Social Security Administration and INS records. This weeds out bogus numbers provided by illegal aliens and thus helps to ensure that new hires are genuinely eligible to work.  The pilot program has been a great success over its 6 years of operation. A recent study conducted by the Institute for Survey Research at Temple University, in conjunction with Westat, found that 96 percent of participating employers believe the pilot to be an effective and reliable tool for employment verification; 94 percent believed it to be more reliable than the IRCA- required document check; and 83 percent believed that participating in the pilot reduced uncertainty regarding work authorization. The study recommended the continuation of the pilot.  Several participating employers indicated in a recent letter to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Hostettler), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security, and Claims of the Committee on the Judiciary, that ``the pilot is the best tool employers have to make sure they are not hiring unauthorized aliens. Employers have embraced the tools granted by Congress and Congress should grant a continuation of the pilot employment verification program.''  H.R. 2359, introduced by the gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert), would extend the pilot program for an additional 5 years. It would also allow volunteer employers throughout the Nation to participate in the pilot. Currently, the Department of Homeland Security is required to operate the pilot in at least five of the seven States with the highest estimated number of illegal aliens. There is no reason why employers elsewhere in the Nation should not be allowed to participate and reap the same rewards as the current participants.  The study of the pilot found that now is not the time to require all businesses in the United States to participate. However, all this bill does is to open the pilot program to additional volunteer employers. The study explicitly found that ``the Social Security Administration and INS are currently capable of handling'' a nationwide voluntary program. That is all H.R. 2359 does. The study did indicate that the pilot could be improved.  However, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security, and Claims will elaborate, in the years since the time the study reviewed the pilot, the INS and the Department of Homeland Security have been successfully making these improvements. At the request of the Department of Homeland Security, H.R. 2359 would also provide that inquires by Federal, State, and local government agencies seeking to verify or ascertain the citizen or immigration status of any individual for any purpose authorized by law may be made using the mechanism of the pilot program.                              {time}  1800  Under current law, DHS must already respond to these agencies' request. The bill merely allows DHS to utilize the pilot program in responding. And, the pilot program contains no new databases. It merely relies on current Social Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security records system.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. This legislation will provide willing employers throughout the Nation the tools they need to hire a legal workforce and comply with the law.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
