 President, I am here because families across this country are going to be hurt because this Republican Congress has not done its job. We have all heard that this session of Congress is a do-nothing Congress. It has earned that title. But there is one thing everybody ought to understand. When Congress doesn't do its job, it makes it harder for all Americans to do their jobs, whether it is teaching our children or providing health care or improving transportation or making our communities safer.  This may seem like a debate over process, but it affects you. If you fly on an airplane and are concerned about your safety, it affects you. If you drive on a highway and are concerned about traffic congestion, this affects you. If you want our Government to stop the flow of money to terrorist organizations, this affects you.  Today I want to share with the Senate a few examples of how it is going to hurt because the Senate Republican leadership has not done its job. I want to point out how it is going to hurt the priorities in my State of Washington, from their fight against drugs and gangs to the cleanup of the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. This Republican Congress's failure is going to make it harder for all of us to do our jobs next year, and that is a terrible legacy for the Republican leadership to leave our country.  Every year Congress has to pass its annual spending bills.
