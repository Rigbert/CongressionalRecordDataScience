I am hopeful that as the economic recovery and reinvestment plan moves forward that we may work together to see if this important issue can be addressed in conference.              victims' compensation and assistance grants  Mr. President, I wish to join Senator Mikulski, the chairwoman of the Commerce, Justice, and Science, CJS, Appropriations Subcommittee, in a colloquy about the importance of including additional funding to States for victims' compensation and assistance in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. I would first like to thank my friend from Maryland, who has worked so hard for the success of this bill. I commend her for fighting to include and maintain vital funding to support some of the most vulnerable Americans today, who need our help.  During the past year, victim service professionals have seen a clear increase in victimization and victim need. The National Crime Victim Helpline has experienced a 25-percent increase in calls,as job losses and economic stress translate into increased violence in the home and in our communities. The shortage of affordable housing and rising unemployment are causing victims to require longer stays in emergency shelters. The increasing unemployment rate also means victims are less likely to have insurance to cover their crime-related expenses. In addition to significant State and county budget cuts, corporate and individual donations are decreasing. Across the board, victim service providers are strapped for funding.  As the Senate considers extraordinary legislation to address the current economic crisis, I believe it is imperative for the record to reflect the intent behind the provisions included in this legislation. To ensure that there is no doubt about what we intended, I ask my friend from Maryland whether it is her understanding that the funding included for State victims' compensation and assistance programs would be in addition to any funding states receive from their annual Victims of Crime Act, VOCA, Grants in the 2009 and 2010 appropriations bills?
