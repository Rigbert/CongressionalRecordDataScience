President, every day, Social Security provides vital benefits to millions of Americans who worked and paid into the system, and I cannot overstate the important anti-poverty role that the program plays. Supplemental Security Income or SSI is the safety net of last resort for individuals who have not worked enough to qualify for Social Security. Even with these critical income support programs, more and more seniors and people with disabilities find themselves struggling to keep up with the costs of the things they need just to get by.  Although Social Security and SSI automatically increase each year when there is an increase in the cost of living, over time those increases do not allow beneficiaries to maintain their standard of living. Because Social Security provides an increasingly larger share of the elderly's income as they age, even a slight decrease in value of these lifeline benefits can lead to poverty and hardship. Too many seniors are walking on an economic tightrope, balancing their food bill against their rent against their utility bill. It's time to update Social Security's guarantee of a secure retirement, and this bill is a landmark step towards accomplishing that goal. I'm particularly hopeful about the benefits this bill will have for older American women, who live longer and often have less retirement savings.  To help combat the risk of poverty among the most vulnerable receiving Social Security and SSI, I, along with Senators Brown and Casey, are introducing the Elder Poverty Relief Act. This bill creates a monthly Poverty Relief Benefit for almost everyone over age 82, individuals who have been relying on Social Security or SSI for a long time, or who have worked in low-paying jobs and receive a very small Social Security benefit. The Poverty Relief benefit will also go to seniors who receive only SSI. If enacted, in 2019, the Poverty Relief Benefit would provide an additional $85 a month to almost 14 million people. The Poverty Relief Benefit will grow by roughly 4 percent each year. SSA estimates that the enactment of the Poverty Relief Benefit would reduce poverty among seniors who received the benefit by almost 25 percent in 2030 which would lift 420,000 seniors out of poverty. Notably, the enactment of the Poverty Relief Benefit would not accelerate the depletion year of the Social Security trust funds. The bill has been endorsed by the Gray Panthers, Justice in Aging, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, Social Security Works, and the Strengthen Social Security Coalition.  For most seniors, Social Security is the only income they will receive that's guaranteed to last as long as they live. But despite these important benefits, poverty among seniors grows--with some studies showing the poverty rate among the very old is between 12 and 19 percent. We simply must do more to protect the financial stability of our elderly friends, neighbors, and relatives and enactment of the Poverty Relief Benefit would help reduce poverty among America's seniors. These are workers who sent a chunk of every paycheck to the Federal government with the understanding that they'd be getting it back in their later year when they needed it most. We must do right by them.  Mr. President: I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare be inserted into theRecord following my remarks about the Elderly Poverty Act.                                    National Committee to Preserve                                  Social Security & Medicare ,                                   Washington, DC, March 16, 2018.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Wyden: On behalf of the millions of members      and supporters of the National Committee to Preserve Social      Security and Medicare, I write to endorse your bill, the      ``Elder Poverty Relief Act.'' We applaud your leadership in      developing new and innovative approaches for alleviating      poverty among America's seniors.       The ``Elder Poverty Relief Act'' addresses the long-     standing problem of seniors falling into poverty after being      on the Social Security rolls for many years. This occurs when      inflation, only partially offset by annual cost-of-living      adjustments, gradually erodes the purchasing power of a      Social Security benefit for beneficiaries who have      participated in the program for several years.       The ``Elder Poverty Relief Act'' will help alleviate      poverty among the elderly and the disabled by granting each      beneficiary a monthly increase in their benefit equal to      about $85. This bump-up will increase for future      beneficiaries in tandem with growth in wages in the economy.       Benefits under the ``Elder Poverty Relief Act'' will be      paid to:       Social Security beneficiaries beginning at age 82 (or      older) and to Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients      when they reach their full retirement age (currently 66,      increasing gradually to age 67);       Social Security and SSI beneficiaries who have received      benefits for 20 years; and to       Social Security beneficiaries with low monthly benefits      (currently about $944) when they reach their full retirement      age.       The ``Elder Poverty Relief Act'' embodies legislation that      the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and      Medicare has supported for a number of years. In testimony      given before the Senate Finance Committee at a hearing on      December 9, 2014, Catherine Dodd, who is the chair of the      National Committee's board of directors, recommended      increasing benefits for seniors who have received Social      Security for many years.       For these reasons, the National Committee endorses your      bill, the ``Elder Poverty Relief Act.'' We thank you for your      leadership on this matter and look forward to working with      you to enact this important improvement to Social Security.           Sincerely,                                                     Max Richtman,                                                President and CEO.
