I appreciate the fact that the chairman included it in this legislation; and I think from a social and economic standpoint, it ought to remain in the legislation.  Section 502, paragraph A states that it is the sense of the Congress that to the greatest extent practical, all equipment and products purchased with funds made available in this act should be American-made.                              {time}  1315  Subsection C of that same section states that if it has been finally determined by a court or Federal agency that any person intentionally affects a label bearing ``Made in America'' in description or any in description with the same meaning to any product sold or shipped in the United States, that is not made in the United States, the person shall be ineligible to receive any contract or subcontract made with funds made available in this act.  I understand the gentleman's intent as far as his motion to strike relative to jurisdictional issues, but I do believe this is a very key and fundamental issue to protect American workers in a living wage in the United States of America. And given the problems we have in this country as far as outsourcing where you have people intentionally lying and violating the law so the United States of America, we ought to protect American workers.  I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Hobson) for having this measure in this legislation.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mrs. Biggert). Does anyone else wish to be heard on the point of order?  The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Hobson) is recognized.
