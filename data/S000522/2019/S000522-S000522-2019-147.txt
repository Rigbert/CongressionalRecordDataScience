Madam Speaker, as a result of legislation I introduced (H.R. 3655) which was signed into law (P.L. 115-151), more than 200 people gathered outside the U.S. Post Office located on Main Street in Belmar, NJ at a ceremony to rename the building in honor of Dr. Walter S. McAfee--an extraordinary scientist, educator, and innovator.  Attending the event were many family members, friends and coworkers of Dr. McAfee's, including his sister, Velma McAfee-Williams, who turned 90 last week, and his daughters Marsha McAfee Bera-Morris and Diane Mercedes McAfee.  Also present to pay tribute to Dr. McAfee was: Belmar Mayor Mark Walsifer; USPS South Jersey District Manager James Drummer; Belmar Postmaster John Mutchler, III; Mike Ruane, the CEO of InfoAge Science & History Center; and elected officials from Monmouth County, neighboring Lake Como and Wall Township.  Dr. McAfee was a brilliant scientist. His breakthrough research and mathematical theories led to bouncing radio signals off the moon's surface. His unique work served as the forerunner for satellite communications, entry into the space age, moonshots and moonwalks.  Dr. McAfee is also known for his many innovations and successful projects including sensors he pioneered to assist the military in keeping tabs on aggressive actors--tools that saved the lives of many Americans and our allies.  And we remembered and honored Dr. McAfee for his lifelong commitment to learning--including his tenure as a professor at Monmouth College and service as Chairman of the Board at Brookdale Community College.  As an African-American, Dr. McAfee overcame adversity and prejudice with courage, tenacity and faith. His amazing life inspires. He challenges us to strive for excellence. He is truly a role model.  In closing, I would like to include in the Record, the moving and heart-warming remarks given by Dr. McAfee's daughter, Marsha McAfee Bera-Morris, and nephew, Dr. Leo Cecil McAfee, Jr.                  Remarks by Marsha McAfee Bera-Morris       Good morning. Congressman Smith, Mayor Walsifer, District      Manager Drummer, Postmaster Mutchler, family and friends. I      am Marsha McAfee Bera-Morris, the younger (or second)      daughter of Walter Samuel and Viola Winston McAfee.       On behalf of the entire McAfee family, I would like to      thank Congressman Smith and his staff and ``the leaders of      the Information Age Learning Center (or InfoAge)'' for their      efforts and persistence in the honoring of our father/     brother/uncle/granduncle/etc. by renaming the Belmar Post      Office as the ``Dr. Walter S. McAfee Post Office Building.''      We all greatly appreciate this honor and the opportunity that      this renaming ceremony affords us to celebrate his memory and      share our thoughts about his lifelong effort to contribute to      science and its service to the nation.       My father was deeply interested in education throughout his      entire lifetime. He taught briefly at a Champion Junior High      School in Columbus, Ohio. He also taught part-time at a      couple of New Jersey colleges, including Monmouth College,      while employed by the Army.       I would like to share with you just a bit of my personal      perspective on his love of astrophysics. I can remember him      waking me up, along with my sister Diane--at our request [a      request that he probably encouraged]--to see meteor showers      or lunar eclipses. Space physics was one of his true loves.      The summer I turned 12, a significant age for air fares, the      4 of us traveled to Europe. Three (3) of us were on vacation;      he was doing research on what, I think, were large radar      installations.       At home, he would often help with homework. But he would      never seem to just answer a question. Rather, he would ask      questions, backtracking until he found something that I or my      sister Diane had mastered. He would then bring us forward to      the subject matter about which we had inquired. Sometimes      this was interesting; more often, it was quite exasperating.      But he instilled in his two daughters a desire to master      their selected fields of endeavor. And finally, it was almost      impossible to argue with my father; logic and reason had to      govern any discussion.       About 15 years ago, I got my hands on a copy of a speech my      father had given. His speech concerned his own education and      the almost unbelievable hardships he had endured and against      which he had struggled. My father was born in 1914 in Ore      City, Texas. One of nine children to survive beyond age five      (5), he grew up in Marshall, Texas. His parents were both      educated and ``had strong middle-class values.'' All but one      of his siblings earned college degrees. He pointed out in his      speech that his parents owned a parcel of land. If they had      been sharecroppers, then he might not have continued his      education, since, in those days, the landowner could      ``determine the fate'' of a sharecropper's children in the      educational sphere.       My father graduated from Wiley College in Marshall, Texas,      with a bachelors (B.S.) in mathematics, magna cum laude. I      think all or most of his siblings also attended Wiley. Second      oldest, he assisted with the expenses of some of his younger      siblings. He earned an M.S. in Physics from Ohio State      University and a Ph.D. in Physics from Cornell University      (under Hans Bethe). It is from his speech that I gather that      his most trying time was at Ohio State. Black people were not      allowed to be teaching assistants at Ohio State at that time,      nor could they stay in the dormitories on campus. At times,      my father was working three or four jobs simultaneously to      cover the cost of tuition and housing and educational      expenses. His department chairman actively discouraged      pursuit of a Ph.D. and, according to my father, hollered at      him for not taking an Industrial Arts course. He was, after      all, only going to be able to go back South to teach in a      black school.       Walter McAfee persevered. His family background, his stay      at Wiley, his continued communication with one or more of his      teachers from Wiley, plus his own awareness of what he had      mastered seem to me to be the chief support for this      perseverance. My father maintained a lifelong correspondence      with his first physics teacher, Professor McCane of Wiley      College, and, so far as I can tell, relied heavily on his      advice and support while at Ohio State.       In his own speech, my father stressed two things: (1)      mastery of your subject matter; and (2) perseverance. Before      he went on to Cornell University, but after he left Ohio      State, my father worked his way through several physics      books. He was determined to master the subject matter whether      or not his dream of a Ph.D. was achieved.       My father went to work as a civilian employee of the Army      in 1942 or so. He retired in 1985. He died in February of      1995. He is best known, I guess, for his mathematical      calculations for Project Diana, which involved bouncing radar      off the moon. This success has been said to mark the      beginning of the Space Age. As you can see, he had a l-o-n-g      career with the Army. I will not try to summarize that      career. For one thing, while he could and would talk about      physics in general, he couldn't and didn't talk about most of      the specifics of his job. I do know that, late in his career      with the Army, he did some traveling to NATO, and once he      mentioned ``night vision.''       In the 1950s, my father was recognized by President      Eisenhower for his work on Project Diana. In 1997, about two      and a half years after my father's death, the Army named a      building, actually a complex of buildings, ``McAfee Center.''      McAfee Center was located at Fort Monmouth, N.J., and, we are      told, the designation was a first at Fort Monmouth for a      civilian employee of the Army. After the Fort was scheduled      for closure, a cluster of buildings at Aberdeen Proving      Grounds in Maryland, was named in his honor.       Still, to have his name here in this Post Office, a central      public building, in the place he called home, raised his      family, honed his scientific skills and contributed to major      space exploration--this moment provides a singular pride and      satisfaction for so many of his family and friends and      colleagues.       I thank you for allowing me to share my thoughts.            Excerpts of Remarks by Dr. Leo Cecil McAfee, Jr.       Good Morning,       My name is Leo McAfee. I am a nephew of Dr. Walter McAfee.      My role today is to represent the non-immediate family of      Uncle Walter.       In this role, first I would like to acknowledge the birth      family of Uncle Walter, including his mother Susie McAfee and      father Luther McAfee.       Uncle Walter was born into a family of 9 children to become      youth and adults. There were 6 sons and 3 daughters, each      attended college. Seven or 8 of the siblings earned      bachelor's degrees in the Mathematics and Science fields. One      of the mathematically oriented siblings is with us today,      Aunt Velma, the youngest daughter, who was blessed to just      celebrate her 90th birthday in Houston, Texas on Saturday,      August 10th, 2019. Please recognize Aunt Velma, the only      surviving sibling of Uncle Walter.       Now for some impact of Uncle Walter in the lives of our      family.       First, Uncle Walter impacted me personally.       I knew Uncle Walter's Family because of their visits to      Grandmother Susie McAfee in Marshall, Texas. We would travel      to Marshall to visit with Aunt Vi, Mercedes, Marsha and Uncle      Walter. Since I was under age 10, Uncle Walter was only      slightly known to me.       Vividly I remember a day at my elementary school; I was a      fifth/sixth grade student at the time. My father, school      Principal of my elementary school, proudly showed us a      newspaper article reporting that Uncle Walter was a recipient      of a Secretary of the Army Presidential Fellowship. This      event is vivid in my memory because I decided I wanted to      earn a Ph.D. and be a scientist, though I did not know the      career of a scientist or of an engineer or for any other      professional career other than educator/teacher. That event      and day has remained etched and stored in the forefront in my      memory for perhaps 63 years now.       Well I did not become a scientist, but I did earn a Ph.D.      in electrical engineering in 1970 at the University of      Michigan and became the first American of African heritage to      become a faculty member in the College of Engineering at the      University of Michigan.       Now, I will tell you a bit of my journey as mentored by      Uncle Walter.       Jump ahead nine or ten years to summer 1965. As a student      in the middle of my junior level in college, I accepted a      summer job in Poughkeepsie, NY at IBM semiconductor      development/manufacturing facility.       Being in New York, I was encouraged to contact my nearby      relative, Uncle Walter.       To visit, Uncle Walter tried to get me to catch a train or      a bus to visit Aunt Vi and him in South Belmar. He quickly      realized that this ``country boy'' was hopeless to use public      transportation in the NY/NJ region. He arranged to drive to      Poughkeepsie to pick me up to stay a weekend at their home;      and then take me back to Poughkeepsie at the end of that      weekend.       During that weekend, we discussed my academic record and      educational ventures and education goals. Also, we discussed      areas of electrical engineering I Preferred (circuits,      electronics, semiconductors). Well, semiconductor physics was      one of the classes Uncle Walter taught, a class I looked      forward to taking. That connection engaged conversations.      Also, he knew much about electronics, he being in the      Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM) at Fort Monmouth.       Either that weekend or during another weekend visit, Uncle      Walter decided that I was a serious student. He encouraged me      to transfer to Monmouth College. He offered that Aunt Vi and      he would pay for my education expenses, so my education would      be more fundamentally sound based in physics and      semiconductor devices.       My viewpoint was that in another 14 months, I would be able      to start graduate study at a top university in the United      States, and would be able to strengthen my fundamentals.      After further discussion, Uncle Walter seemed to accept my      viewpoint.       During summers 1968, 1969, 1971, I had summer positions at      Bell Labs in Murray Hill, NJ and IBM in Yorktown Heights, NY      twice, the two superior industry research labs in the United      States. Again, for each summer, I was near Uncle Walter and      Aunt Vi. Uncle Walter and I had numerous mentoring contacts      during those three summers.       After I started my 40-year faculty career at the University      of Michigan, in the early 1970's, Uncle Walter visited      researchers at the University of Michigan, including managing      a project at the Willow Run Laboratories that was the site      for highly confidential research. During his visit, we had      some serious career decisions discussions. Though I liked      circuits and electronics, many top electrical engineers      thought those fields were past their hey-day. I clearly      remember Uncle Walter telling me to stick to the areas that I      liked, and that my work would find more than enough rich      areas to study and to make contributions. Again, he was      correct. I was part of the pioneering field of numerical      mathematical computer modeling of circuits and semiconductor      electronic devices.       Next, Uncle Walter impacted three generations in the McAfee      (and Lester) family.       He impacted the first generation--the nieces and nephews of      Uncle Walter--which included me, my siblings, McAfee first      cousins, and the Lester first cousins.       He impacted the second generation--the grand-nieces and      grand-nephews of Uncle Walter. Each of my three children did      a report on Uncle Walter several years in elementary, middle,      and high school. Children of my siblings did reports on Uncle      Walter. And children of first cousins did reports on Uncle      Walter, even children of first cousins on my mother's side      (Lester) did reports.       He impacted the third generation--the great-grand-nieces      and great-grand-nephews of Uncle Walter. Children of grand-     nieces & grand-nephews are still doing reports on Uncle      Walter.       Uncle Walter had major notoriety regarding the moon with      his contributions in Project Diana. Just last month, NASA,      the USA, and the world celebrated the 50th anniversary of      first landing on the moon by humans, partially made possible      by the work of Uncle Walter in Project Diana.       In closing, a bit of Big Ten conference razzing, hopefully      humor for sports fans.       As a family, my children and I are die-heart University of      Michigan alumni; we bleed U-M maize and blue. The one strike/     complaint against Uncle Walter is his attending Ohio State      University, U-M's arch Big Ten rival in all collegiate      sports, especially football.       In baseball terminology, attending Ohio State was initially      a called strike against Uncle Walter. However, Uncle Walter      ``hit a home-run out the park'' with his spectacular      technical and personal family successes.       Thank you.                          ____________________
