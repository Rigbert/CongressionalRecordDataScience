Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication to her country and community is exceptional. The Inland Empire has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated business and community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give time and talent to make their communities a better place to live and work. Mrs. Candace Hunter-Wiest is one of these individuals and her exemplary leadership is being recognized at a dinner on Thursday, November 7, 2002 as she is honored as the 2002 Inland Empire Boy Scouts of America Distinguished Citizen.  Candace's career path is as unique as it is exceptional. She was married at age 18 and was a proud mother of three by age 22. As the sole provider for her family, she began working in the restaurant business and later took a clerical support position with an independent insurance agency. She was quickly promoted to bookkeeper, then to office manager and soon became a licensed agent. Her career in banking began when she associated with an agency owned by a bank holding company that had been perpetually unprofitable. Under her excellent management, Candace turned a profit in ten months. She moved to Riverside in 1988 and her career with the Inland Empire National Bank (IENB) began. Under her superb leadership, IENB has become one of the best banks in the country and has been named a Super Premier Performing Bank.  Candace has been involved in numerous community organizations and she currently serves on the board of directors for the United Way of the Inland Valleys, the Community Foundation, the Mission Inn Foundation, and the Greater Riverside Chambers of Commerce--to name a few. She is also on the University of California, Riverside's Chancellor's Executive Roundtable and the A. Gary Anderson Graduate School of Management Executive Forum.  In 1998 Candace was recognized as one of ``Twelve Women Who Make A Difference in the Inland Empire'' by the Inland Empire Magazine and the Business Press name Wiest ``A Woman of Distinction.'' She has also been listed in the International Who's Who of Professionals in the Year 2000 edition of Who's Who and has been named an Athena recipient as a YWCA Woman of Achievement in 1995.  Candace's tireless work as a community leader has contributed immeasurably to the betterment of the Inland Empire. Her involvement in community organizations, especially the Inland Empire Council of Boy Scouts of America, make me proud to call her a fellow community member, American and friend. I am grateful for her efforts and service and salute her as she is deservedly honored as the 2002 Inland Empire Boy Scouts of America Distinguished Citizen. I look forward to continuing to work with her for the good of our community in the future.                          ____________________
