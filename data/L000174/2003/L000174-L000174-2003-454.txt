President, although our attention today is focused on the persistent attacks against U.S. Armed Forces in Iraq and the escalation of the bloodshed between Israelis and Palestinians, it is imperative that we not ignore the challenges we continue to face in Afghanistan.  In southeast Afghanistan, U.S. soldiers continue to battle with the remnants of al-Qaida and the Taliban, whose fighters have managed to regroup across the border inside Pakistan. Despite hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. aid, the national impact has been difficult for many Afghans to see. Afghanistan is such a large, inaccessible, impoverished country that it will take many billions of dollars over many years to recover from decades of war, and that will be possible only if adequate security exists to implement these programs. Security will remain elusive as long as political and economic power outside of Kabul continues to be wielded by regional warlords.  An article by Carlotta Gall in yesterday's New York Times provides a sobering description of the continuing challenges in Afghanistan. I hope officials at USAID, the State Department, the Defense Department, and OMB took the time to read it. As with so many aid programs, we often focus on the trees and lose sight of the forest. We can point to lots of small success stories--new well dug here, a bridge repaired there, more girls enrolled in school. But when you step back the picture looks very different, as Ms. Gall's article shows.  We and our Allies have major stakes in Afghanistan's future, and I am confident that we will remain engaged. But let's do the job that needs to be done, not half measures. Without a more effective strategy to enhance security, strengthen the central government and support civil society, we will fall far short of our goals.  I ask unanimous consent that Ms. Gall's June 11, 2003, article in the New York Times entitled ``In Warlord Land, Democracy Tries Baby Steps'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              In Warlord Land, Democracy Tries Baby Steps       KABUL, Afghanistan, June 10.--In the hushed, rose-filled      gardens of the royal palace in Kabul, life seems calm and      good. Under the chandeliers of the meeting hall upstairs,      President Hamid Karzai, just back from a trip to Britain and      a meeting with the queen, manages to combine an expression of      condolence for German peacekeepers killed in a suicide bomb      attack in the capital Saturday with an upbeat assessment of      the situation in his country.       The heavily armed American bodyguards who stand in the      gardens and by the windows of the palace have become like the      wallpaper, so much are they part of the scene now. The      Taliban threat in the south and southeast, the car bomber who      drove this week right into the city, the persistent factional      fighting in the north of the country, all seem far away.       But in the last few months there has been a crisis of      confidence in Afghanistan, a sense that the security      situation may be spiraling downward and that the rise of      regional warlords may be more than a temporary phenomenon.      Attacks on peacekeepers and aid workers are increasing. After      more than a year of waiting patiently for results, people      here are increasingly asking: are the Americans getting it      right?       Today, as American forces in Iraq struggle to establish      order, as one or two American soldiers seem to fall every      day, it seems likely to be a question the United States will      soon face in Iraq as well.       Even the most pessimistic Afghanistan watchers acknowledge      that this time is different from the sliding chaos of the      early 1990's. The Americans are not going to turn their back      on Afghanistan the way they did then, and the way they did in      Iraq after the Persian Gulf war in 1991. The Americans are      here and, by all accounts and appearances, here to stay.       But there is only a year left for Mr. Karzai and his      American backers to get things right before his term is up.      The Bonn process, which set up the interim administration led      by Mr. Karzai, lays out a rapid program for a new      constitution to be drawn up and approved by a grand assembly      this October, and for national elections to be held next      June.       For Afghanistan, one key to establishing order is the      disarmament of the factional armies around the country. The      United Nations and Afghanistan's new Human Rights Commission      have already stressed that if the much delayed disarmament      and demobilization program does not go ahead, the drafting of      the constitution and national elections could be thrown into      jeopardy.       ``There is a real, but still avoidable, risk that the Bonn      process will stall if security is not extended to the      regions, and that Afghans will lose confidence in the central      government if it cannot protect them,'' the United Nations      special representative to Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, told      the Security Council in New York last month.       Another difficulty is that the allies are tackling the      problems in piecemeal fashion, a strategy that will only      advance the country by tiny steps, critics say.       United States diplomats and aid officials like to draw      attention to a large wall map in their embassy that is      covered in a ``blizzard'' of yellow Post-it stickers marking      every single project under way in the country. They     trumpet the provincial reconstruction teams, United States      military-civil affairs teams that are trying to win hearts      and minds in the provinces by building schools, or      latrines for schools. And they talk of the program to      train the Afghan National Army, which should produce a      9,000-member force by next year.       But the national impact of all of this is virtually nil. As      one director of a donor agency, which completed 160      construction projects last year, said, ``The dimension of the      destruction is such that people don't see it.''       Compared with the enormous military-political Gordian knot      that needs to be cut, the attention to human needs can only      be described as paltry, even irrelevant.       Little has been done to disarm and dismantle the power      bases of the factions, and as time goes on the armed men who      rule the districts, regions and whole provinces are becoming      more and more entrenched and increasingly powerful      economically. They are likely to dominate politics during the      next year, which could fatally erode all public trust in the      process and the results. The country could end up being ruled      by a mixture of drug lords and fundamentalist mujahedeen--in      other words, people not much different from the Taliban.       Everyone has a different idea of what the United States      should be doing, but most Afghans and Westerners working here      agree that there are two basic requirements for nation-     building that the United States cannot afford to ignore--     providing security and establishing a functioning political      system. They are interconnected, most here agree; in fact, it      is impossible to have one without the other.       Only a legitimate, national political system will have the      authority to establish a police and justice system with the      necessary powers to establish real security. Without real      security, there can be no widespread development; American      soldiers cannot stand on every street corner, or monitor      every business transaction and tax collection.       The problem here, as in Iraq, is that the American military      is still running the show and views Afghanistan through the      prism of the campaign against terrorism and not according to      the country's political and economic demands. But if      Afghanistan is to seize the chance this year to start      becoming a stable and prosperous society, there is much, much      more to be done.       Many are saying that Washington needs to exert more      political pressure--on Mr. Karzai to act more decisively on      this government to work more proactively, on the police      nationwide to ensure law and order, on commanders to disarm,      on ministers to reform their ministries and even out the      balance of power, on warlords to give up their fiefs and join      the government, on Pakistan to stop supporting the Taliban      and other opponents of the Bonn process. The list goes on.       All those steps would be a help. But fundamentally, the      Americans need to create an atmosphere in which democratic      politics can take hold. That means doing more than attending      to human needs and offering military training. It means, in      the view of many Western officials here and prominent      Afghans, putting pressure on the warlords, disarming them and      cutting their power bases, leveling the political playing      field so that the coming elections are free and fair.                          ____________________
