 President, last year on Mother's Day, supporters of sensible gun laws came together by the hundreds of thousands to participate in the Million Mom March and say to Congress: ``Enough is Enough.''  Those women, men and children all shared a common purpose: The passage of sensible gun laws--laws that will hopefully help save lives.  The primary stated goal of the Million Mom March was to push for legislation to license gun owners and keep track of guns. We know it will be a long process of educating the Congress and the public on this issue. But we will not give in until we succeed. So today I rise, along with Senators Schumer and Boxer, to reintroduce the ``Firearm Licensing and Record of Sale Act,'' which I believe represents a common-sense approach to guns and gun violence in America.  Mr. President, in this country, when you want to hunt, you get a hunting license; when you want to fish, you get a fishing license. But when you want to buy a gun, no license is necessary. That makes no sense.  We register cars and license drivers. We register pesticides and license exterminators. We register animal carriers and researchers, we register gambling devices. And we register a whole host of other goods and activities--even ``international expositions'' must be registered with the Bureau of International Expositions!  But when it comes to guns and gun owners--no license and no registration, despite the loss of more than 32,000 lives a year from gun violence.  To this end, my staff and I worked for months with law enforcement officials and other experts in drafting the bill we introduced last year. And since that time, we have refined the bill, corrected some vague sections, and made it even more clear what the bill would do, and what it would not do.  Upon enactment of this legislation, anyone purchasing a handgun or semi-automatic weapon that takes detachable ammunition magazines will be required to have a license. Shotguns and a large number of common hunting guns are not covered by the requirements of this bill.  Current owners of these weapons will have up to 10 years to obtain a license, on a rolling basis, much like many states now handle drivers licenses.  The bill sets up a federal system, but allows states to opt out if they adopt a system at least as effective as the federal program.  Under this bill, anyone wishing to obtain a firearm license will need to go to a federally licensed firearms dealer. There are currently more than 100,000 such dealers across the country--to put that in some perspective, there are four times more gun dealers in America than there are McDonald's restaurants in the entire world. Operating the federal licensing system through these licensed dealers will minimize the burden on those wishing to obtain a license.  If a state opts-out of the federal program, an individual will go to a State-designated entity, like a local sheriff, local police department, or even Department of Motor Vehicles. It will all depend on where the state feels is best.  Either way, the purchaser will then need to:  Provide information as to date and place of birth and name and address;  Submit a thumb print;  Submit a current photograph;  Sign, under penalty of perjury, that all of the submitted information is true and that the applicant is qualified under Federal law to possess a firearm; Pass a written firearms safety test, requiring knowledge of the safe storage and handling of firearms, the legal responsibilities of firearm ownership, and other factors as determined by the state or federal authority;  Sign a pledge to keep any firearm safely stored and out of the hands of juveniles (this pledge will be backed up by criminal penalties of up to three years in jail for anyone failing to do so);  Undergo state and federal background checks.  Licenses will be renewable every five years, and can be revoked at any time if the licensee becomes disqualified under federal law from owning or possessing a gun.  And Mr. President, the fee for a license cannot exceed $25.  Once the bill takes effect, all future sales and transfers of firearms falling within the scope of the bill will have to be recorded through a federally licensed firearms dealer, with an accompanying NICS background check. That way, law enforcement agencies will have easier access to information leading to the arrest of persons who use guns in crime.  The bill covers both handguns and other guns that are semi-automatic and can accept detachable magazines.  The legislation covers handguns because statistically, these guns are used in more crimes than any other. In fact, approximately 85 percent of all firearm homicides involve a handgun.  And the legislation also covers semi-automatic firearms that can accept detachable magazines, because these are the kind of assault weapons that have the potential to destroy the largest number of lives in the shortest period of time.  A gun that can take a detachable magazine can also take a large capacity magazine. Combine that with semi-automatic, rapid fire, and you have a deadly combination--as we have seen time and again in recent years.  Put simply, this legislation will cover those firearms that represent the greatest threat to the safety of innocent men, women and children in this nation.  Common hunting rifles, shotguns and other firearms that cannot accept detachable magazines will remain exempt.  Penalties will vary depending on the severity of the violation. But in no case will gun owners face jail time simply because they forgot to get a license:  Those who fail to get a license will face fines of between $500 (for a first offense) and $5,000 for subsequent offenses.  Failing to report a change of address or the loss of a firearm will also result in penalties between $500 and $5,000, because this system works best for law enforcement when the perpetrators of gun crime can be quickly traced and arrested;  Dealers who fail to maintain adequate records will face up to 2 years in prison--dealers know their responsibilities, and this will give law enforcement the tools necessary to root out bad dealers and prevent the straw purchases and other violations of law that allow criminals easy access to a continuing flow of guns;  And adults who recklessly or knowingly allow a child access to a firearm face up to three years in prison if the child uses the gun to kill or seriously injure another person. In this way, the bill truly puts a new sense of responsibility onto gun owners in America.  Mr. President, law enforcement in California tells me that a licensing and record of sale system like the one I am introducing today will help law enforcement, upon recovery of a firearm used in crime, to track the gun down to the person who sold it, and then to the person who bought it.  And this legislation also sets in place a method through which we can better attempt to ensure that gun owners are responsible and trained in the use and care of their dangerous possessions.  We have tried to minimize the burden of this bill at every turn:  The licensing process will take place through federally licensed firearms dealers--as I mentioned earlier, there are currently more than 100,000 in this country;  The fee for a license will be only $25;  Current gun owners will have as many as ten years to get a license, on a rolling basis, and guns now in homes will not have to be registered;  Future gun transfers will simply be recorded by licensed dealers--as they are now--and a system will be put in place to allow the quick tracing of guns used in crime. Gun owners themselves will not have to register their old guns or send any paperwork to the government.  This nation is awash in guns--there are more than 200 million of them in the United States. The problem of gun violence is not going away, and accidental deaths from firearms rob us of countless innocents each year.  Too many lives are lost every year simply because gun owners do not know how to use or store their firearms--particularly around children. In fact, according to a study released in 1999, in 1996 alone there were more than 1,100 unintentional shooting deaths and more than 18,000 firearm suicides--many of which might have been prevented if the person intent on suicide did not have easy access to a gun owned by somebody else. It is my hope that the provisions of this bill, particularly with regard to child access prevention, will begin the process of making it harder for children and others to gain easy access to firearms.  As I said, I know that this bill will not pass overnight. We have a long process of education ahead of us. But the American people are with us. The facts are with us. And common sense is with us.  I thank the Senate for its consideration of this measure, and I look forward to working with each of my colleagues to move this bill forward in the coming months.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 25       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) the manufacture, distribution, and importation of      firearms is inherently commercial in nature;       (2) firearms regularly move in interstate commerce;       (3) firearms trafficking is so prevalent and widespread in      and among the States that it is usually impossible to      distinguish between intrastate trafficking and interstate      trafficking;       (4) to the extent that firearms trafficking is intrastate      in nature, it arises out of and is substantially connected      with a commercial transaction, which, when viewed in the      aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce;       (5) because the intrastate and interstate trafficking of      firearms are so commingled, full regulation of interstate      commerce requires the incidental regulation of intrastate      commerce; and       (6) it is in the national interest and within the role of      the Federal Government to ensure that the regulation of      firearms is uniform among the States, that law enforcement      can quickly and effectively trace firearms used in crime, and      that firearms owners know how to use and safely store their      firearms.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act and the amendments      made by this Act are--       (1) to protect the public against the unreasonable risk of      injury and death associated with the unrecorded sale or      transfer of qualifying firearms to criminals and youth;       (2) to ensure that owners of qualifying firearms are      knowledgeable in the safe use, handling, and storage of those      firearms;       (3) to restrict the availability of qualifying firearms to      criminals, youth, and other persons prohibited by Federal law      from receiving firearms; and       (4) to facilitate the tracing of qualifying firearms used      in crime by Federal and State law enforcement agencies.
