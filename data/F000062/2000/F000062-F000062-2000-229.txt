 President, today I introduce a bill to amend the legislation that authorized construction of the San Luis Unit of the Central Valley Project in California. Enactment of this bill would allow water districts in the San Luis Unit of the Central Valley Project to supplement their federal water supplies with purchases of water from the State Water Project. At present, federal law prohibits the delivery of non-federal water to districts in the San Luis Unit until certain conditions are met.  The San Luis Unit is the last component created by federal law in the Central Valley Project, which is the largest Bureau of Reclamation project in the United States. Water service to districts in the San Luis Unit is often curtailed because of limitations imposed in pumping in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.  It is customary for water districts in the San Luis Unit to supplement their supplies through purchases on the open market. However, current federal law prohibits them from purchasing supplies from the State Water Project and having these delivered over federal facilities. Making such deliveries is relatively easy because state and federal project conveyance facilities are interconnected. Prohibiting purchase of state water for delivery over federal facilities limits the opportunities available for San Luis Unit districts to obtain as large a supplemental supply as they would like.  Mr. President, this bill has already passed the House as H.R. 3077. It will impose no additional costs on the federal government. It contains provisions which assure that the additional water obtained by districts in the San Luis Unit cannot be used in a manner that would exacerbate current groundwater drainage problems. It is consistent with the provisions in the Central Valley Project Improvement Act that sought to encourage the exchange of water by willing sellers to provide additional supplies at reasonable cost to willing buyers. I urge the Senate to pass this bill.                                 ______                                       By
