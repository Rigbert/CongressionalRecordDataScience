President, I will go to this amendment in a moment, and it is one I hope all Members will listen to carefully because it is an effort to protect our military from the provisions of this bill, particularly in light of theactivation of Guard and Reserve units across America and the financial hardship it has created. I will speak to that amendment after I address this bill a few moments more.  I thank my colleague from Alabama. We see this issue differently, but there are some things on which we agree. I think my colleague from Alabama is doing the right thing on the homestead exemption because if you could walk into bankruptcy court having just bought a multimillion-dollar mansion in Florida and then say, I don't want to be held responsible for my debts, and then the court says, Of course, your home you can keep, your home is your castle, and that home is worth millions of dollars, you have just defrauded the system, as far as I am concerned. Here you are with a multimillion-dollar home and these debts and you do not pay your debts, and the States of Florida, Texas, Kansas, and a few others say whatever your home is worth, it is exempt.  It is a loophole in the law. If we are talking about just and right conduct in this situation, then clearly we would change the homestead law. I salute my colleague from Alabama because he has been a leader on this issue. It is unfortunate that we have been unable to reach a better agreement as we go forward on this bill.
