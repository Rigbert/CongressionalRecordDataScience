 They were busy pushing other policies to weaken and undermine internal financial controls.  So I want to get into that. In 1998, when Mr. Lynn was chief financial officer, something we call pay-and-chase was the Pentagon lingo used to describe the Department of Defense vendor paying process. With pay-and-chase, the Pentagon paid bills under $2,500 first, and then worried about chasing down receipts later. You get it--pay-and-chase: pay without worrying about what you are buying or the invoice and then, after you pay, go out and find some justification for the payment.  Ever wonder why there is waste in the Defense Department? Sometimes receipts were found under pay-and-chase, sometimes not. Nobody seems to care either way. This is how the Department of Defense ended up with not $2,500 here and there but with billions of dollars in what they refer to as unmatched disbursements--another big control problem with which chief financial officer Bill Lynn was thoroughly familiar.  Pay-and-chase accurately characterized the core DFAS problem I witnessed during my review of internal controls from 1997 through 1998. I saw pay-and-chase up close and personal. Pay-and-chase was not an official policy; it was an unofficial policy. It was actively practiced but not authorized by any Government regulation or laws.  As I understand it, pay-and-chase was supposed to end in October 1997when the Department of Defense general counsel determined it was illegal. But it did not stop. Secretary Cohen wanted to, instead, legalize pay-and-chase and make it the law of the land.  On February 2, 1998, when Mr. Lynn was chief financial officer, Secretary Cohen asked the Senate for legal authority to pay bills without receipt with no dollar limit. Now, that is pretty high up in the Department that you are deciding that we ought to have a policy to pay bills without receipts, and to do it not with a $2,500 limit but with no dollar limit. This proposal was embodied in section 401 of the Defense Reform Initiative. It was touted--can you believe it--as a measure to ``streamline'' the DOD payment process.  Fortunately, the Congress rejected this absurd and misguided legislative proposal. But you know what the thinking was at the highest levels of the Defense Department. So I discussed Secretary Cohen's pay-and-chase proposal in great detail in a speech on the floor of this body on May 5, 1998. You will find that on pages S4247 through S4250. I placed, at that time, Secretary Cohen's request in the Record.  So what was Mr. Lynn's position on section 401 of Secretary Cohen's Defense Reform Initiative? I asked him this question on February 5, 2009. This is what he said: He could not ``recall'' taking a position on it but agreed it was wrong ``to pay bills without a receipt.''  This seems like a real cop-out. I responded this way:       In February 1998, you had been [chief financial officer]      for several months. This issue fell directly under your      purview. How could you possibly avoid taking a position on an      issue the Secretary of Defense was urging the Senate to      adopt? As the Chief DOD Lobbyist for Raytheon, you say it was      wrong. As the DOD [chief financial officer] back in 1998, why      didn't you know it was wrong and speak up about it [at that      time]?  My records appear to indicate that pay-and-chase continued as the unofficial policy through 1998 and eventually evolved into another more troublesome policy known as ``straight pay.'' This policy was even more dangerous for the taxpayers. The straight pay policy had much higher dollar thresholds than the old pay-and-chase plan. Believe it or not, it was a whopping half million dollars.  Straight pay was Mr. Bill Lynn's baby. This policy was personally approved by Mr. Lynn in a memorandum on December 17, 1998, and reauthorized in another memo on March 9, 1999, and possibly again later. This is that document:     Memorandum for Director, Defense Finance and Accounting          Service     Subject: Prevalidation Threshold       In a memorandum dated December 17, 1998, I authorized a      temporary $500,000 threshold on new contracts paid by the      Mechanization of Contract Administration Services (MOCAS)      system. This temporary authorization is scheduled to expire      on March 22, 1999. However, while the Defense Finance and      Accounting Service Columbus Center has made significant      improvements in the backlog of payments, we are not at the      point where we can lower the threshold to $2,500. Therefore,      the temporary threshold of $500,000 is extended for another      90 days for Columbus MOCAS payments only.       I request you continue to provide me with a monthly report      showing progress in resolving the current prevalidation      process delays. The monthly report should include your plan      to lower the threshold at the appropriate pace to reach the      goal of total prevalidation by July 2000. As we improve our      systems capabilities, we will continue to aggressively reduce      the threshold until all payments are prevalidated.                                                  William J. Lynn.  On January 19, 1999, I addressed a letter to Mr. Lynn expressing grave concern about straight pay and requesting verification of certain facts surrounding this policy. The facts in question were provided to me anonymously by a DFAS employee. I wanted Mr. Lynn to check out all of this for me.  Prior to the implementation of straight pay, the DFAS center in Colombia, OH, had a prevalidation policy that required that all disbursements over $2,500 be matched with obligations or contracts prior to payment, which is the way it ought to be--well, no; it ought to be for every dollar, but at least over $2,500 it had to be matched. When an invoice was submitted to the center for payment, a DFAS technician searched the database for supporting obligations and receipts.  If supporting documentation could not be found, a red warning flag was supposedly run up the pole. Accounting due diligence was needed to confirm if this particular invoice was valid, a duplicate, or fraudulent payment. In theory, these red flags had to be resolved. As you would expect, in practice, that did not always happen.  Mr. Lynn's straight pay policy raised the prevalidation threshold by $497,500, up to finally a half million dollars. This allowed the DFAS technicians to make payments up to a half million dollars without a valid obligation. To cover these payments, technicians were ordered to create a bogus account known as negative unliquidated obligations. Now, that is a Harvard word, isn't it. But they called it NULO for short, the acronym. So we have these negative unobligated obligations. Bills were then paid from these bogus NULO accounts which carried negative balances.  Mr. Lynn's policy gave DFAS accountants up to 6 months to link the payments to valid supporting obligations in the accounting records. If valid supporting documentations could not be found in that timeframe, then the center was authorized to cover the payments with other available funds with no further investigation. This is how the unmatched disbursements of the Department of Defense were born and eventually built into the billions of dollars.  In my January 19, 1999, letter to Mr. Lynn, I drew some comparisons between straight pay and the case of Air Force SSgt Robert L. Miller. Now, Robert L. Miller may not be a very famous name to most people around here, and he would not be to me if I had not run into him through this investigation. So I wanted to draw a comparison between the straight pay policy and the case of this Air Force staff sergeant.  I think Mr. Lynn and others in the Pentagon at the time remember the Miller case, and remember it all too well, or at least they did at that time. I examined that case and several others just like it in great detail at a hearing before my Judiciary Subcommittee on Oversight on September 28, 1998.  As chief of vendor pay at a DFAS center, then-Staff Sergeant Miller had pursued his own unlawful versions of straight pay. Miller had full access to the Integrated Accounts Payable System. As such, Miller was able to manipulate Department of Defense systems to create obligations and invoices where none existed and generate nearly $1 million in allegedly fraudulent payments to his mother and his girlfriend. Miller was not apprehended because internal controls at DFAS were effective, the things that were under the control of Mr. Lynn; he was caught because a coworker blew the whistle on him. She was one of Miller's subordinates who had allegedly been sexually harassed by him.  At that time, I told Mr. Lynn--the same Mr. Lynn whose confirmation we are considering now--that his straight pay policy appeared to authorize DFAS accountants to do essentially what Staff Sergeant Miller did: create false bookkeeping entries to cover large payments in the absence of valid obligations. DFAS and Miller obviously had different goals, but there was a common denominator, and that common denominator was manipulation of the accounting system.  DFAS payment policies practiced on Mr. Lynn's watch left the barn door wide open to fraud and outright theft of the taxpayers' dollars.  The Government Accountability Office, which provided excellent support all the way through my investigation, fully agreed with this assessment.  There was another disturbing facet of the Miller case that I took up with Mr. Lynn. On October 19, 1995, the date that Staff Sergeant Miller became chief of vendor pay at the Dayton center--a position considered far above his rank--he was already under investigation in connection with, one, the alleged disappearance of Government checks at Castle Air Force Base and, two, allegedly directing at least eight fraudulent checks valued at $50,769 to his mother.  On October 26, 1995, just 1 week after Staff Sergeant Miller became chief of vendor pay at Dayton, an investigating officer at Castle Air Force Base made this recommendation about Miller:       Management should not place SSgt Miller in a position where      he is entrusted with funds again . . .  After this report was issued, Miller should have been removed from his position at the Dayton center immediately. But it took 2 years, until June 1997, when Miller was arrested for allegedly stealing the million dollars.  The whole Miller story, of course, is unbelievable.  In view of his problems at Castle Air Force Base, why did the DFAS center place him in charge of vendor pay? Why did DFAS keep him there after an official report indicated he could not be trusted with the money? That makes as much sense as hiring a bank robber to be the bank teller.  On September 18, 1998, I wrote another letter that I have. This is letter No. 9, which I ask unanimous consent be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                               Washington, DC, September 18, 1998.     Hon. William J. Lynn III,     Comptroller and Chief Financial Officer,     Pentagon, Washington, DC.       Dear Bill: I am writing to thank you for providing the      ``Investigation of Major Loss of Funds'' at Castle AFB      involving Staff Sergeant (SSGT) Robert L. Miller, Jr. and to      raise several additional questions.       I am very disturbed by what I found in the investigative      report on the disappearance of U.S. Treasury checks at Castle      AFB. The very obvious red warning flag raised by this report      was totally ignored by management at the Defense Finance and      Accounting Service (DFAS).       The report states that ``SSGT Miller was negligent in the      loss of the two treasury checks entrusted to him.'' It says:      ``He breached his duty,'' and it says ``he failed to      safeguard his funds.'' For a military pay agent, that would      normally be a death sentence. And if those words didn't ruin      SSGT Miller's career in money matters forever, the report's      recommendation number one should have done it. The      investigating officer recommended that: ``Management should      not place SSGT Miller in a position where he is entrusted      with funds again. . . .'' Those are strong words.       The recommendation that SSGT Miller not be trusted with      money again was made on October 26, 1995. That recommendation      came exactly one week after SSGT Miller was ``forced'' into a      position at the DFAS/Dayton finance center that was far above      his rank. A much more senior civilian--Mr. Chuck Tyler--who      occupied that position, was summarily removed to make room      for SSGT Miller. Although official organizational charts      indicate that SSGT Miller was just Chief of the Data Entry      Branch, officials familiar with SSGT Miller's operation      contend that he was, in fact, Chief of the entire Vendor Pay      Department. In that position, he had direct control over      billions of dollars in payments. In addition, for unknown      reasons, SSGT Miller was given unrestricted access to the      check generating system known as the Integrated Accounts      Payable System or IAPS. This was a clear violation of      internal control procedures. His predecessor--Mr. Tyler--had      much more limited access.       On October 19, 1995--the date on which SSGT Miller was      ``forced'' into Mr. Tyler's position, SSGT Miller was under      active investigation for the disappearance of a large sum of      money at Castle AFB. Unfortunately, his suspicious and      improper conduct at Castle was not limited to the two missing      Treasury checks. He had also generated at least 8 fraudulent      checks worth $50,769.00, which were addressed to his mother,      Ruby J. Miller. Only these facts were apparently not known at      the time. Furthermore, on October 19, 1995, he was just a few      days away from generating his first fraudulent check at      Dayton. This one was for $12,934.67 and was also addressed to      his mother.       All the new information that surfaced in connection with      SSGT Miller's court-martial clearly shows that the      investigating officer's concerns about SSGT Miller and money      were based on sound judgement. SSGT Miller could not be      trusted with money again. If the investigating officer's      advice had been followed, SSGT Miller's criminal activities      could have been brought to a screeching halt in October 1995      instead of June 1997. In November 1995, a trusted employee at      the Dayton center, Mr. Otas Horn, even warned Colonel Berger      about the dangers of placing SSGT Miller in Mr. Tyler's      position with unrestricted access to IAPS. This early warning      was followed by repeated reports of criminal conduct at      Dayton throughout 1996, including an internal DFAS memo      signed by Mr. Nabil, Director of the Denver Center, on      September 30, 1996. Most involved fraudulent documents      created in SSGT Miller's section. All involved criminal      conduct--violations of 18 U.S.C. 1001--as noted in Mr.      Nabil's memo. Why didn't DFAS management report this criminal      activity to the law as required by every rule in the book?       Bill, I would like to return to the investigating officer's      recommendations: ``Management should not place SSGT Miller in      a position where he is entrusted with funds again. . . .''      When this report was issued, SSGT Miller should have been      removed from his new position at Dayton--on the spot. Who in      SSGT Miller's chain of command at Dayton was responsible for      acting on the findings and recommendations in the      investigative report? Was it Mr. Nabil? Was it the Commander      at Dayton, Colonel Berger? Or was it Captain Brown, SSGT      Miller's immediate supervisor? Who at Dayton had knowledge of      this report? Who in DFAS management was responsible for      totally ignoring this very dangerous red warning flag?       Bill, the responsible person or persons in your      organization need to be held accountable for ignoring obvious      and repeated warning signals about SSGT Miller's      trustworthiness and giving him unrestricted access to your      department's money vault.       I respectfully request a response to my questions by      September 23, 1998.           Sincerely,                                Charles E. Grassley, Chairman,                                    Subcommittee on Administrative                                         Oversight and the Courts.
