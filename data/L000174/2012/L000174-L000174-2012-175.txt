President, it is time for reasonable and independent thinking Senators to end this needless and damaging filibuster on Judge Bacharach's nomination and confirm him. With judicial vacancies remaining at such high levels for so long, we need to continue confirming judicial nominees. At a time when judicial vacancies remained historically high for 3 years, with 40 more vacancies and 40 fewer confirmations than at this point in President Bush's first term, the Senate Republican leadership should reconsider its obstruction and work with us to fill these longstanding judicial vacancies in order to help the American people. We have well-qualified, consensus nominees with bipartisan support who can fill these vacancies. It is only partisan politics and continued tactics of obstruction that stand in the way.
