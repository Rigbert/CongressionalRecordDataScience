Speaker, on December 5, 2012, I was absent from the House and missed rollcall votes 617, 618, and 619.   Had I been present for rollcall vote 617, on the motion to suspend the Rules and agree to S. Con. Res. 50, expressing the sense of Congress regarding actions to preserve and advance the multistakeholder governance model under which the Internet has thrived, I would have voted ``yes.''   Had I been present for rollcall vote 618, on the motion to suspend the Rules and pass H.R. 6602, to make revisions in title 36, United States Code, as necessary to keep the title current and make technical corrections and improvements, I would have voted ``yes.''   Had I been present for rollcall vote 619, on the motion to suspend the Rules and pass S. 2367, to strike the word ``lunatic'' from Federal law, and for other purposes, I would have voted ``yes.''                          ____________________
