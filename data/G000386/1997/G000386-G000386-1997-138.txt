 President, today I would like to talk about two letters from the Department of Defense, DOD.  The first letter is dated June 11, 1997.  The second one is dated June 13, 1997--just 2 days later.  Both letters are addressed to the editor of The Hill newspaper, Mr. Albert Eisele.  Both are signed by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, Mr. Kenneth H. Bacon.  Both were written in response to an article I wrote about Mr. John Hamre in the June 4 issue of the Hill.  Mr. Hamre is the Chief Financial Officer at the Pentagon.  He has been selected by Secretary Cohen to become the next Deputy Secretary of Defense.  I oppose this nomination for the reason I gave in the Hill article.  Mr. Hamre is aggressively pursuing a progess payment policy that the inspector general has declared illegal.  Mr. Bacon charges that my article ignores the facts and twists the truth.  Ironically, Mr. Bacon's letters prove he is the one who ignores the facts and twists the truth.  He sent the second letter to correct misinformation in the first one.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have his letters and my article printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               Assistant Secretary of Defense,                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 1997.     Albert Eisele,     Editor, The Hill, Washington, DC.       Letter to the Editor: Last week Senator Charles Grassley      authored an article condemning John Hamre, currently the      Comptroller at DoD and the nominee to be Deputy Secretary of      Defense (``Sen. Grassley looks for missing $50 billion at      DoD,'' June 4, 1997). It is a serious distortion of Mr.      Hamre's record. The facts actually prove the opposite of      Senator Grassley's contentions. It is imperative that The      Hill publish a correction.       First, Senator Grassley stated ``the books at DoD are in      such shambles that as much as $50 billion cannot be traced.''      DoD's books were in very bad shape when Mr. Hamre signed on      back in 1993, and they are still troubled, but the facts show      that the situation is dramatically improved. Back in 1993,      DoD's so-called ``problem disbursements'' exceeded $34      billion. Last month the total was under $8 billion, a 74%      reduction in three years.       Second, Senator Grassley stated that Mr. Hamre has left      DoD's funds vulnerable to theft and abuse. The facts are      quite different. Mr. Hamre created a dedicated organization--     Operation Mongoose--to undertake fraud detection and      prevention. He and the DoD Inspector General have hosted      governmentwide conferences on fraud prevention. Mr. Hamre is      the first, and to my understanding the only, Comptroller that      ever initiated an anti-deficiency investigation on himself,      asking the DoD Inspector General to review accounts under his      jurisdiction.       Third, Senator Grassley claimed Hamre ``presided over a      scheme'' to make illegal process payments. Again, the facts      are quite different. Mr. Hamre, working with the DoD      Inspector General, has carried out the IG's recommendations      on progress payments. Senator Grassley claimed Hamre ``tried      to legalize the crime'' by proposing legislative changes      concerning progress payments. That legislation was first      proposed by the Inspector General.       Fourth, Sen. Grassley claims Hamre understated his problems      through ``a clever bureaucratic trick to make the problem      look a lot smaller than it really is.'' The facts are rather      different. Rather than report three categories of problem      disbursements together, he reported all three categories in      two separate tables. None of the data has been dropped and      all of it is made available every month to the General      Accounting Office.       Reading Sen. Grassley's article is like looking at a      distortion mirror in an amusement park. The image he paints      is wildly distorted and in most cases is totally reversed      from the truth. Facts do matter, even in Washington, and      Senator Grassley has not presented the facts.                                             Kenneth H. Bacon,                                    Assistant Secretary of Defense     for Public Affairs.                                                                    ____                               Assistant Secretary of Defense,                                    Washington, DC, June 13, 1997.     Albert Eisele,     Editor, The Hill, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Eisele, I am sorry we have not been able to      establish phone contact. In the interim, I thought it would      be useful to send you the attached clarification to the      letter Ken Bacon sent to The Hill on Wednesday, June 11.       In reviewing the letter we felt that some points were not      clear and we want to ensure that our response is as accurate      as possible. We hope you will publish this revised letter.       I can be reached at 703-697-0713. Thank you for your      assistance in this matter.           Sincerely,                                             Clifford H. Bernhath,       Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public      Affairs.                                                                    ____                               Assistant Secretary of Defense,                                    Washington, DC, June 13, 1997.

Grassley Looks for Missing $50 Billion at DoDAge-old practice of cooking the books at the Pentagon is alive and well                     (By Sen. Charles E. Grassley)       Between 1989 and 1993, a man named James Edward McGill was      paid $3,025,677.99 by the United States Navy for phony      claims. With nothing more than a mailbox, a couple of rubber      stamps and blank government forms, McGill set up a business      to cheat the taxpayers. He delivered no goods. He did no      work. But he had no trouble doing business with the Navy.      Pure chance, rather than internal controls at the Defense      Department (DoD), put an end to this scam. Unfortunately for      the taxpayers, the McGill case does not stand alone.       The sad truth is, the books at the DoD are in such shambles      that as much as $50 billion cannot be traced. The department      flunks every single audit by its chief financial officer      (CFO). And the inspector general (IG) expects the DoD to      continue falling short ``well into the next century.'' When      you can't audit the books, you don't know how money is being      spent. The result is a multi-million dollar money pipe left      vulnerable to theft and abuse.       The problem described here is exacerbated by an illegal      operation used by the Pentagon to make progress payments on      contracts. Under this policy, payments are deliberately      charged to the wrong accounts. Once payments are made, the      DoD attempts to ``adjust'' the accounting ledgers to make it      look as though the checks were charged to the right accounts      when the money was, in fact, charged to some other account.      The entire process leads to over-, under-and erroneous      payments.       Presiding over this scheme since October 1993 has been the      comptroller and CFO for the DoD, John J. Hamre. In his      official position, Hamre is responsible under the Chief      Financial Officer Act of 1990 ``to strengthen internal      controls and improve financial accounting.'' However, instead      of meeting a pledge to reform the process, Hamre tried to      legalize the crime. Earlier this year, he circulated for      comment draft legislation to sanction the payment procedures      declared illegal by the IG and authorized by Hamre at CFO.       A fundamental issue is at stake. In 1992, the IG stated      that the DoD's progress payment procedures ``result in the      rendering of false accounts and violations'' of Title      31,Section 1301 of the U.S. Code. This law embodies a sacred      constitutional principle. Only Congress decides how public      money may be spent. Section 1301 requires that public money      be spent as proscribed in the appropriations acts.      Congressional committees spend considerable effort each year      segregating public money in different accounts. For example,      the DoD appropriations bill might require procurement money      be used for production work and not for R purposes. Hamre's      payment policy shatters the integrity of the appropriations      accounts. It spends money according to an arbitrary scheme      dreamed up by DoD bureaucrats.       While this payment scheme was in place before Hamre's time,      he had a golden opportunity to fix this problem. But every      time the issue has popped up on his radar screen he's      protected the scheme. Under his leadership, the DoD's      progress payment operation has flourished and achieved a new      level of sophistication.       When Hamre became CFO he, in fact, did declare war on      financial mismanagement. Today, he cites ``steep drops in      contract overpayments.'' But his claims are not supported by      the facts. Three reports of the General Accounting Office      (GAO) issued during the last three years contradict Hamre's      success stories. The most recent analysis of the GAO      concludes that the DoD's progress payment scheme is the      biggest single driver behind overpayments. And each of these      reports shows that the DoD has no check in place to detect      overpayments. Virtually every overpayment ever examined by      the GAO was detected by recipients of checks, not by the      government. In most cases, contractors voluntarily refunded      the overpayments.       If Hamre was serious about eliminating overpayments,  why      didn't he shut down the progress payments operation? If he      has no capability whatsoever to detect overpayments, where      does he get the data that shows a steep drop in such      payments? How does he know they are going down if he      doesn't know how many there are? Perhaps this means the      contractors are no longer making voluntary refunds.       Hamre also has claimed his financial reforms have produced      sharp drops in unmatched disbursements. Again, the claims      don't stand up to scrutiny. In fact, Hamre has used a clever      bureaucratic trick to make the problem look a lot smaller      than it really is. In December 1996, he issued a decree that      arbitrarily redefined the entire universe of problem      disbursements. He simply made the universe smaller by      excluding huge numbers of unreconciled disbursements from the      totals appearing in official reports. This was not missed by      the GAO. In yet another report, the independent analysts      challenged Hamre's approach. The GAO concluded that the DoD      is understating the size of problem disbursements by at least      $25 billion. So, instead of the $18 billion claimed by Hamre,      at least $50 billion of tax dollars are unaccounted for.       Because of these facts, I stand opposed to the nomination      of Hamre for deputy secretary of defense. My personal      feelings have absolutely nothing to do with my position, as      charged by some. Rather, I have reached my conclusion based      on the facts. If government does not hold accountable the      official who is responsible by law, then who?       While Hamre inherited a major problem caused by years of      neglect, he took aggressive action to perpetuate the mess.      True, Hamre has made a lot of promises and statements about      reforming the process. But good intentions never get the job      done at the Pentagon. The bottom line is, these kinds of      problems cannot be corrected unless those in charge are held      accountable. Awarding promotions to leadership that drops the      ball is a green light for con artists like James Edward      McGill.
