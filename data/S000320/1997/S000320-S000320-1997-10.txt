 President, according to the latest statistics, Alabama is home to 47,011 military retirees. We have the eight largest population of retired service personnel in the Nation. Senator Bond highlighted the many changes in DOD's health care system that are limiting access to health care for military retirees aged 65 and above. I would like to briefly explain how these general trends are affecting the 47,011 military retirees in my State.  The 1995 BRAC slated Fort McClellan for closure by 1999. When that base closes, Noble Army Hospital will be forced to close as well. The emergency room at Lyster Army Hospital at FortRucker is being closed. At all of the military treatment facilities, space-available is becoming unavailable. In addition to these physical changes, TRICARE came on line in region 4, and Alabama now is experiencing excessive delays in receiving reimbursement payments and other well-known problems associated with TRICARE. Many private physicians who provided CAMPUS are leaving the DOD health care, which I believe is unacceptable and irresponsible.  Despite extended service and sacrifice, retired service members are the only Federal employees who will lose their government-sponsored health insurance when they become eligible for Medicare. This bill takes a modest step forward to insuring that military retirees receive at least as much as Members of Congress or retired Federal employees. Military retirees have dedicated their lives to protecting our Nation; we owe it to them to pave the way for health care equity.  I thank Senator Bond for his leadership in introducing this legislation. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bipartisan bill.                                 ______
