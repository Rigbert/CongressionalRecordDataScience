 President, today I wish to remember the life of John Andrew Rickett of Wayne County, KY, who passed away earlier this year at the age of 94. As a proud member of the ``greatest generation,'' J.A. served in the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II before returning to service again to fight in the Korean war. J.A. was a leader in his community, providing guidance to all those around him, and he will be remembered by many.  Born and raised in Wofford, J.A. interrupted his high school studies and was drafted into the Army Air Corps. Arriving in England 1 month prior to D-Day, J.A. flew as a B17 waist gunner on several missions over Europe. His service played an important role in helping the Allies win the war.  After his service in the Second World War, J.A. met the love of his life, Frieda. He dedicated the next 64 years to the service and love of his wife and their children. J.A. earned his bachelor's degree in agriculture from the University of Kentucky, where he was also active in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps, ROTC. Upon graduating, he received a commission into the Army as a lieutenant and was drafted once again and sent to Korea.  When he returned, J.A. began working for the UK Extension Service, initially as an agriculture agent but later as a 4H Agent in Monticello. His family remembers that it was with the 4H that he found great joy. Because of his many years of work with the 4H, J.A. is known for his care and respect for several generations of youth in Wayne County.  Elaine and I send our condolences to his children, Cassandra, Jerry, Rebecca, and John, and their friends. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in remembering the life of a great man, J.A. Rickett.                          ____________________
