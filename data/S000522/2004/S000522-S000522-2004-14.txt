These centers would provide comprehensive      rehabilitation programs, targeted education and outreach      programs, and research initiatives for veterans injured by      explosive blasts in combat theaters.     Compromise agreement       Section 203 of the Compromise Agreement authorizes, and      authorized the appropriations to support, the Secretary to      establish an appropriate number of centers for research,      education, and clinical activities to improve and coordinate      rehabilitative services for veterans suffering from complex      multi-trauma from combat injuries.

SEC. 402--AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS     Current law       Section 8104(a)(2) of title 38, United States Code,      prohibits funds from being appropriated for a VA major      medical facility lease, unless that appropriation has been      specifically authorized by law.     House bill       Section 101(b) of H.R. 4768 would authorize $24,420,000 to      carry out major medical facility leases specified location in      the bill.

In the event that the Secretary of Veterans      Affairs determines the terms or conditions of the lease not      to be in the best interest of the United States, the      Secretary should propose an alternative strategy to Congress.      The Committees not that the Administrator of General Services      has delegated to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs the      authority to enter into lease agreements for VA major medical      facility leases.

In cases      where a property carries value in excess of $50,000, any      disposal must be proposed in the President's budget. In the      event such property is so disposed of, proceeds are deposited      into the Nursing Home Revolving Fund for construction,      acquisition, or alteration of VA nursing homes.     House bill       Section 102 of H.R. 4768 would amend chapter 81 of title      38, United States Code, to add a new section 8118 to provide      the Secretary authority to transfer by sale, exchange or      lease unneeded real properties. It would establish a      Department of Veterans Affairs Capital Asset Fund to finance      these transfers, as well as to construct new and improved VA      health care facilities. The Fund could also be used for      demolition, environmental restoration, maintenance, repair,      historic preservation, and administrative expenses. Section      102 would establish fair market value as the basis for      property transfers.     It would require the Secretary to include in each budget      submission to Congress a report of the uses of the Capital      Asset Fund and descriptive information on each transfer      completed, pending, and planned. The section would also      repeal the Nursing Home Revolving Fund in section 8116 of      title 38, United States Code, and transfer remaining balances      from that fund to the new Fund. The authority of Section 102      would be contingent upon the Secretary's certifying to      Congress that VA facilities maintain long-term care capacity      as required by section 1710B(b) of title 38, United States      Code.     Senate bill       Section 101 of S. 2485 contains a similar proposal.     Compromise agreement       Section 411 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House      language with modification.

House bill       The House Bills contain no comparable provision.       Senate bill       The Senate Bills contain no comparable provision.     Compromise agreement       Section 413 of the Compromise Agreement authorizes the      Secretary to acquire property in the District of Columbia      that the Secretary determines is suitable for providing      services to homeless veterans, if the Secretary identifies a      provider of homeless services that is prepared to acquire the      property from the Secretary. The Compromise Agreement      requires the Secretary, having so identified a provider, to      promptly transfer the acquired property to that provider of      homeless services. The Compromise Agreement provides a      reverter power to the Secretary if the provider of homeless      services discontinues providing services to homeless      veterans.sec. 414--limitation on implementation of mission changes for specified                veterans health administration facilities     Current law       Section 401 of Public Law 108-170, the ``Veterans Health      Care, Capital Asset, and Business Improvement Act of 2003'',      requires VA to notify Congress of facility closings proposed      under the Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services      initiative, and prohibits such closings until the lapse of 60      days following the notification or 30 days of continuous      session of Congress, whichever is longer.

Compromise agreement       Section 414 of the Compromise Agreement prohibits the      Secretary from implementing a mission change until the lapse      of 60 days following the notification or 30 days of      continuous session of Congress, whichever is longer, at VA      Medical Centers in the following locations: Boston,      Massachusetts; New York City, New York; Big Springs, Texas;      Dublin, Georgia; Montgomery, Alabama; Louisville, Kentucky;      Muskogee (and the outpatient clinic in Tulsa), Oklahoma;      Poplar Bluff, Missouri; Ft.
