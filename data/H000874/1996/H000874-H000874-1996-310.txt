Speaker, I had not intended to give a 1-minute at this point in time, but the previous speaker is brandnew to the House, and very frankly, he is incorrect, totally, absolutely incorrect. I hope his advice as a physician was far better for his patients than his advice just now in his 1-minute.  The extension of the debt limit has to do with policies that were signed by Ronald Reagan and George Bush, as well as previously adopted policies of this Congress. Not prospective. Not prospective.  Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman does not want to pay Social Security on March 1, I understand that. He can get up and say that. If he does not want to pay veterans' benefits that are committed and expected, I understand that, and he can get up and say that. But to imply for 1 second that extending the debt limit so that America can pay its bills that is has already incurred is somehow like giving a person that has a gambling disorder additional money is totally, absolutely inaccurate and unfortunate.                          ____________________
