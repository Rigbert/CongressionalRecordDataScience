Speaker, I yield myself another 30 seconds.  The statement that the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren) mentioned, did not say why they need to have cloned embryonic stem cells. I think we are talking about two different things here.  What this bill does is, it prohibits research on cloned embryonic stem cells, not on uncloned embryonic stem cells.  If there is a shortage of uncloned embryonic stem cells, I would like the people on the other side to let the House know about it. We have had not one scintilla of evidence either in this debate or the hearings or markup on the Committee on the Judiciary.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Weldon).
