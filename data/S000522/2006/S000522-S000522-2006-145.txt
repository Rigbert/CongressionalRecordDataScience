Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 320) calling on the Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam to immediately and unconditionally release Dr. Pham Hong Son and other political prisoners and prisoners of conscience, and for other purposes, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 320       Whereas in March 2002, Dr. Pham Hong Son was arrested after      he had translated an article entitled ``What is Democracy?''      from the Web site of the United States Embassy in Vietnam and      sent it to both friends and senior party officials;       Whereas Dr. Son has written and published on the Internet      articles entitled ``The Promotion of Democracy: A Key Focus      in a New World Order'', ``Sovereignty and Human Rights: The      Search for Reconciliation'', and ``Hopeful Signs for      Democracy in Viet Nam'';       Whereas in none of his activities did Dr. Son advocate      violence in his opposition to the Vietnamese Government or      its policies;       Whereas Dr. Son has been arrested for the peaceful exercise      of his fundamental rights to freedom of expression and      association in violation of Article 69 of the Vietnamese      Constitution which states: ``The citizen shall enjoy freedom      of opinion and speech, freedom of the press, the right to be      informed and the right to assemble, form associations and      hold demonstrations in accordance with the provisions of the      law'';       Whereas Dr. Son has been arrested, tried, convicted, and      imprisoned in contravention of the rights enshrined in the      International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)      to which Vietnam is a state party, specifically Article 19      (freedom of expression) and Article 22 (freedom of      association);       Whereas Dr. Son did not have a trial that would be      considered fair and that met even the most basic standards of      internationally accepted justice, in contravention of Article      14 (right to a fair trial) of the ICCPR;       Whereas Dr. Son was sentenced in June 2003, after a half-     day closed trial in Hanoi, to 13 years of imprisonment and      three years of house arrest on spurious espionage charges;       Whereas such spurious charges are routinely used to      suppress peaceful democracy activists, as in the notorious      cases of Father Thadeus Nguyen Van Ly, his two nephews and      niece, and in the cases of Pham Que Duong, Tran Khue, and      Tran Dung Tien;       Whereas Dr. Son's appeal was held on August 26, 2003, in a      closed trial before Vietnam's Supreme Court, from which      international observers and Western journalists were barred,      although diplomats from more than eight countries gathered      outside the courthouse during the trial to register their      concern;       Whereas, although the Vietnamese Supreme Court upheld Dr.      Son's sentence, it reduced the sentence of imprisonment from      13 to five years;       Whereas Dr. Son remains imprisoned in harsh conditions,      including imprisonment for more than a year in solitary      confinement, which have endangered his health;       Whereas Vietnam has imprisoned, detained, placed under      house arrest, or otherwise restricted numerous other peaceful      democratic and religious activists for reasons related to      their political or religious views, such as Do Van My, Mai      Thi Dung, Nguyen Thanh Phong, Nguyen Thi Ha, Nguyen Van Dien,      Nguyen Vu Binh, Phan Van Ban, To Van Manh, Vo Van Buu, Vo Van      Thanh Liem (Nam Liem), Bui Thien Hue, Nguyen Lap Ma, Nguyen      Nhat Thong, Nguyen Van Ly, Phan Van Loi, Thich Dong Tho,      Thich Huyen Quang, Thich Nguyen Ly, Thich Nguyen Vuong, Thich      Phuoc An, Thich Quang Do, Thich Tam Lien, Thich Thai Hoa,      Thich Thanh Huyen, Thich Tien Hanh, Thich Tue Sy, Thich Vien      Dinh, Ngo Van Ninh, Le Van Chuong, Le Van Tinh, Phuong Van      Kiem, Nguyen Van Si, Tran Van Thien, Thich Thien Tam, Hoang      Chinh Minh, and Do Nam Hai (Phuong Nam);       Whereas Dr. Son and other political prisoners and prisoners      of conscience have been deprived of their basic human rights      by being denied their ability to exercise freedom of opinion      and expression;       Whereas the arbitrary imprisonment and the violation of the      human rights of citizens of Vietnam are sources of      continuing, grave concern to Congress;       Whereas Vietnam continues to restrict access to Western      diplomats, journalists, and humanitarian organizations to the      Central Highlands and the Northwest Highlands, where there      are credible reports that ethnic minorities suffer serious      violations of their human and civil rights, including      property rights, and ongoing restrictions on religious      activities, including forced conversions;       Whereas there are continuing and well-founded concerns      about forcibly repatriated Montagnard refugees, access to      whom is restricted;       Whereas on December 1, 2005, the European Parliament      adopted a resolution calling on the Vietnamese authorities,      among other measures, to undertake political and      institutional reforms leading to democracy and the rule of      law, starting by allowing a multi-party system and      guaranteeing the right of all currents of opinion to express      their views;       Whereas the resolution further calls on Vietnamese      authorities to end all forms of repression against members of      the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam and officially      recognize its existence and that of other non-recognized      Churches in the country;       Whereas the resolution further calls on Vietnamese      authorities to release all Vietnamese political prisoners and      prisoners of conscience detained for having legitimately and      peacefully exercised their rights to freedom of opinion,      expression, the press, and religion;       Whereas the resolution further calls on Vietnamese      authorities to guarantee full enjoyment of the fundamental      rights enshrined in the Vietnamese Constitution and the      International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, in      particular by allowing the creation of a genuinely free      press; and       Whereas the resolution further calls on Vietnamese      authorities to ensure the safe repatriation, under the      Cambodia-Vietnam-UNHCR Agreement, of the Montagnards who fled      Vietnam, and allow proper monitoring of the situation of the      returnees by the UNHCR and international nongovernmental      organizations: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That--       (1) Congress--       (A) condemns and deplores the arbitrary detention of Dr.      Pham Hong Son by the Government of the Socialist Republic of      Vietnam and calls for his immediate and unconditional      release, and for the immediate and unconditional release of      all other political prisoners;       (B) condemns and deplores the violations of freedom of      speech, religion, movement, association, and the lack of due      process afforded to individuals in Vietnam;       (C) strongly urges the Government of Vietnam to consider      the implications of its actions for the broader relationship      between the United States and Vietnam;       (D) urges the Government of Vietnam to allow unfettered      access to the Central Highlands and to the Northwest      Highlands by foreign diplomats, the international press, and      nongovernmental organizations; and       (E) applauds the European Parliament for its resolution of      December 1, 2005, regarding human rights in Vietnam, and      urges the Government of Vietnam to comply with the terms of      the resolution; and       (2) it is the sense of Congress that the United States      should--       (A) make the immediate release of Dr. Pham Hong Son a top      concern;       (B) continue to urge the Government of Vietnam to comply      with internationally recognized standards for basic freedoms      and human rights;       (C) make clear to the Government of Vietnam that it must      adhere to the rule of law and respect the freedom of the      press in order to broaden its relations with the United      States;       (D) make clear to the Government of Vietnam that the      detention of Dr. Son and other persons and the infliction of      human rights violations on these individuals are not in the      interest of Vietnam because they create obstacles to improved      bilateral relations and cooperation with the United States;      and       (E) reiterate the deep concern of the United States      regarding the continued imprisonment of Dr. Son and other      persons whose human rights are being violated and discuss the      legal status and immediate humanitarian needs of such      individuals with the Government of Vietnam.
