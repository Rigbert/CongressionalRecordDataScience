To help fund these activities over the long-term, the bill creates a nonprofit organization to be known as the National Film Preservation Foundation to combine public and private resources and leverage the Federal seed money with private fundraising. The bill we consider and pass today retains only 5 percent of the authorized funds that were initially requested. I urge the private section and those interested in preserving our heritage to rise to the challenge, contribute to the National Film Preservation Foundation and make it a success.  I thank all those who have served on the National Film Preservation Board for their contributions to this important effort. I want to commend Eric Schwartz of the Proskauer Rose law firm for his dedicated commitment as pro bono counsel to the National Film Preservation Board. Finally, I know that our Librarian of Congress strongly supports this legislation and want to thank Jim Billington and the Library staff for their help and for making our National Registry films available to the public.                               Exhibit 1                                      Northeast Historic Film,                                   Bucksport, ME, August 30, 1996.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Russell Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: On behalf of the board, staff and      members of Northeast Historic Film, we ask for your strong      support of THE NATIONAL FILM PRESERVATION ACT of 1996 (H.R.      1734). This bill has already passed the House of      Representatives without controversy or opposition. Now we      hope you will help the Senate to pass H.R. 1734 quickly so      that libraries, educators and archives can benefit from the      legislation as soon as possible.       The passage of this act will mean a great deal to our      survival as a cultural organization. Northeast Historic Film      is a nonprofit     organization preserving film and videotape from Vermont,      Maine and New Hampshire.       We spent most of May in Burlington with our history      exhibition, ``Going to the Movies: A Century of Motion      Picture Audiences in Northern New England.'' The culmination      of this educational and cultural series--in which scholars      and filmmakers from the University of Vermont, Middlebury      College, and other institutions, spoke to the public--was a      screening of Charlie Chaplin's classic film The Circus with      live orchestra at The Flynn to 1,100 people of all ages.       After the screening we received letters from people around      Vermont, such as a letter from Hinesburg saying, ``It would      be an awful shame to lose this and other such cultural      treasures to neglect.'' Film preservation needs your support.       The National Film Preservation Board, which is up for      reauthorization, has been a significant force in making      people aware of our film heritage nationally. The      establishment of a new National Film Preservation Foundation,      as recommended by the Librarian of Congress and the Film      Board, is essential to the continued preservation and      presentation of our film heritage.       While the amount of federal matching funds authorized by      H.R. 1734 has been reduced by 95% from the original request,      we are all too aware of the frugality of the present period.      We still enthusiastically support the bill, seeing it is an      important start for a preservation effort that will grow in      size and energy as we turn the century.       We are members of the Association of Moving Image      Archivists, the professional group representing our field. I      enclose testimony to the House by Edward Richmond, AMIA's      president at the time of the hearings, in support of this      legislation.       The National Film Preservation Act will give the field a      way to seek matching funds--an important source of leverage--     with a very investment by the federal government.       Archives like this one preserve images and sound that      record the changes to our social history, the changes in our      landscape, the way we relate to each other. The work we do is      very important to the education of young people. We saw      first-hand how compelling this experience is to Vermont      people.       Please help the many organizations working to save our      history by supporting the Senate passage of H.R. 1734.           Sincerely,     Karan Sheldon,     David Weiss.                                                                    ____                                           The National Center for                                                  Jewish Film,                                     Waltham, MA, August 30, 1996.     Re National Film Preservation Act (H.R. 1734).     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,     U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of the National Center for      Jewish Film, located at Brandais University, we are writing      to ask you to support the NATIONAL FILM PRESERVATION ACT      (H.R. 1734).       The passage of this act will accomplish two goals which are      critically important to the nationwide effort to preserve      America's film heritage and make it available to educators,      students, scholars and the public. First, it will reauthorize      the National Film Preservation Board, which has provided      valuable leadership in helping the film archive community      develop a coordinated national preservation plan, and which      has done much to raise the public's awareness of the need for      film preservation.       Second, it will establish the National Film Preservation      Foundation, which will allow the nation's film archives to      raise private sector funding on a national level, with the      need for only a minimum investment by the federal government      in matching funds. In Massachusetts and throughout America,      archives everyday are facing mountains of deteriorating film      which they cannot afford to preserve. These films, often      called ``orphans'' because they are no longer owned by      commercial entities--including documentaries, newsreels,      actuality footage, independent and avant-garde films, films      of local and regional interest, socially significant amateur      footage, and films which have fallen into public domain.       The National Center for Jewish Film was the recipient of      uninterrupted grants from the National Endowment for the      Arts/American Film Institute Film Preservation for 19 years      until that invaluable program was eradicated last year. The      preservation funds provided by that program were crucial in      assisting our Center save a number of classic Yiddish feature      films including: THE DYBBUK, TEVYE, GREEN FIELDS and UNCLE      MOSES. Our Center holds thousands of cans of film in dire      need of preservation. Each can preserved saves a small      glimpse of the rich cultural heritage of the Jewish people.       Important collections of films exist in each of the fifty      states--in local archives, museums, historical societies,      libraries, universities and other non-profit institutions.      Taken together they constitute an amazingly rich and very      endangered cultural legacy.       The National Film Preservation Foundation represents our      best hope for saving this legacy on behalf of the American      people. Please help us in this effort by supporting H.R.      1734.           Sincerely,                                               Sharon Pucker Rivo,     Executive Director.                                                                    ____                                             Association of Moving                                             Image Archivists,                               Los Angeles, CA, September 4, 1996.     Re National Film Preservation Act (H.R. 1734).     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: On behalf of the Association of Moving      Image Archivists (AMIA), I am writing to ask you to support      the NATIONAL FILM PRESERVATION ACT (H.R. 1734).       AMIA is a professional organization established in 1991 to      provide a means for cooperation among individuals concerned      with the preservation and use of moving image materials. It      currently represents over 300 professional archivists working      at more than 100 institutions in both the public and private      sectors, most of the working professionals in the film      archive field.       AMIA strongly endorses H.R. 1734. This Act has but one      purpose--to preserve American films, especially educational      and historical materials, which are deteriorating at an      alarming rate. The need to act immediately was documented by      Film Preservation 1993, a study completed by the Library of      Congress and the National Film Preservation Board. H.R. 1734      will reauthorize the Board and establish a separate      Foundation to coordinate fundraising efforts to save films.      The Act is almost entirely dependent on private funds.       We believe passage of H.R. 1734 is critically important to      preserving our nation's history, and insuring that educators,      students, scholars, and the public will have access to the      most vivid records of our past for teaching, research and      enjoyment. The focus of the Act is not Hollywood feature      films, but so-called ``orphan films'' which are not owned by      commercial entities. These films include newsreels,      documentaries, actuality footage, educational films, socially      significant amateur footage, films documenting local and      regional history, and films which have fallen into the public      domain with no copyright owner to insure their survival.       H.R. 1734 will help preserve such films by accomplishing      two related and vital goals. First, it will reauthorize the      National Film Preservation Board, originally established in      1988. The Board consists of representatives from all      important constituencies within the film and academic      communities, and operates under the direction of the      Librarian of Congress. During the past eight years, the Board      has proven invaluable in raising the public's awareness of      the need for film preservation and in working with archives      throughout the country to develop a coordinated national      plan. Reauthorizing the Board will enable it to carry on the      work of implementing this plan and providing leadership for      the nationwide effort to preserve America's film heritage.       Secondly, H.R. 1734 will establish the National Film      Preservation Foundation, as strongly recommended by the Film      Board and the Librarian of Congress. The Foundation will work      with the nation's film archives to raise private sector      funding on a national level, with no investment of federal      funds until the year 2000, and after then limited to a      maximum allocation of $250,000 in annual matching funds. All      funds raised by the Foundation will be used by non-profit      archives to preserve and make available historical,      educational and cultural films of local, regional and      national interest which will otherwise be lost forever.       Important collections of such films exist in each of the      fifty states. They are housed in local archives, museums,      historical societies, libraries, universities, and non-profit      associations. Everyday these institutions face vaults full of      deteriorating films which they cannot afford to preserve.      These are not Hollywood films, belonging to the film studios      and production companies, but orphan films comprising an      amazingly rich and valuable national resource.       H.R. 1734 is a non-controversial proposal. It has already      passed the House of Representatives by voice vote with      complete bi-partisan support and no opposition. It focuses      exclusively on films held in the public trust, that are not      owned or protected by commercial entities. In recognition of      these frugal times, the amount of federal matching funds it      authorizes has been reduced by a full 95%. It simply and for      the first time gives the nation's archives the tool they need      to save the nation's film heritage--a federally chartered      National Film Preservation Foundation.       We hope the Senate will act quickly to pass H.R. 1734, so      its benefits can be felt as soon as possible. Your help is      very much appreciated. Please give the nation's archives a      chance to do their job for the benefit of the American      people.           Sincerely,                                            Maxine Fleckner Ducey,                                                        President.
