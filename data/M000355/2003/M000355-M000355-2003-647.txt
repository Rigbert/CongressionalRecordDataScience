 President, if you are a litigant from Tennessee or Kentucky and are having to wait 50 percent longer than a litigant in some other State because of the actions by the Senators from Michigan, it seems to me that is simply unfair. Because of some grievance that occurred in the past, some score being settled by holding hostage these litigants from Tennessee and Kentucky who had nothing to do with this situation, I think is grossly unfair.  One thing the majority leader has asked Senator Hatch to do that will help is have hearings, as has been suggested by the senior Senator from Illinois, and move forward on these nominations.
