I want to thank the gentleman, my colleague and friend from the great State of Louisiana, for those words. The gentleman is so right that countless, nameless individuals whose names will never appear in a newspaper or a magazine, their faces will never appear on television, African-Americans who made outstanding, unbelievable contributions that we must never forget.  I thank my friend.
