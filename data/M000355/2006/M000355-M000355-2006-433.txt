 President, this evening we completed the Homeland Security appropriations bill. I congratulate Senator Gregg and Senator Byrd for their diligence in working through this important funding bill. Early next week we will consider the stem cell research bills. There are actually three of them. We will be debating all day and into the evening on Monday, with the closing remarks and votes on Tuesday.                          ____________________[Page S7543]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL.
