Leader, very seriously, we have been debating pretty hotly the question of whether or not the CR, in fact, will do what we want to do, I think most of us want to do, and that is keep the Government open.  In point of fact, it has to go to the Senate. The Senate has gone home; the Senate is not here, because we changed it over here. Presumably, they therefore cannot act on it until Monday morning. Presumably, from what the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Livingston] said, and I think the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon] also said, the Senate is going to take the amended CR, so they will send it to the President.  The President has said, without question, he is going to veto the CR as it stands now with the Medicaid premium increase.  My question, therefore, is assuming that that happens, and assuming that we do not want to shut down the Government, you have not indicated on there a timeframe in which we might continue to pass another CR which would provide for the Government's operation on Tuesday, November 13. Is there such a contingency plan?
