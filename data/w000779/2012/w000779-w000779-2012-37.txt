President, today a part of the Pacific Northwest is coming to Washington, DC. Thanks to the immensely creative and dedicated work of artist Rick Bartow and his team, two wooden pole sculptures will be placed in the garden of the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian. Atop one pole sits a bear and the other pole a raven, representing the healer and the rascal, respectively. The Bear pole is 27 feet tall, and the Raven pole, 23 feet tall. The poles--collectively titled ``We Were Always Here''--will face the Washington Monument and overlook the National Mall.  The artist behind this project, Rick Bartow, is a Native American of Wiyot and Yurok heritage who was born in Newport, OR. His previous work has been shown throughout the world, including his Cedar Mill Pole, which was displayed at the White House in 1997. When you hear Mr. Bartow discuss his art, his process, and the world around him, you realize that you are listening to one of the country's foremost artistic minds.  That talent is clearly showcased in ``We Were Always Here.'' The level of detail, history, and meaning in each pole is truly amazing. The poles are based on Native beliefs, but the message and meaning behind them are universal. For example, Mr. Bartow explains that the repeated horizontal patterns on each pole, ``symbolize successive waves, generations following generations, an accumulation of wisdom and knowledge.'' This idea that we can learn from our ancestors and from history is critical to the progress of our Nation and is one that is beautifully captured through these sculpture poles.  Thanks to the tireless efforts of Mr. Bartow and his team, folks visiting the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian or walking the National Mall will now be able to lookupon these sculptures and gain an understanding of the important role the Native American community has in Oregon and throughout our country.  It is important to note that it is not only Oregon that is represented in these poles, but rather the Pacific Northwest. The two trees from which they are carved--a 1200 and 500 year old cedar--are from our northern neighbors, Washington State, and artists from around the area contributed in the creation of these sculptures. This sense of community is a staple of the Pacific Northwest and one that is represented in ``We Were Always Here''.  I want to commend Mr. Bartow and his team for their great work, and I encourage everyone to get out and experience ``We Were Always Here'' by visiting the American Indian Museum or The National Mall.                          ____________________
