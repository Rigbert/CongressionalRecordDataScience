The President himself knows he lacks the authority to take such actions--he has said so publicly on 22 occasions.  I support comprehensive immigration reform. But the President's 2014 Executive order overreach usurps the role of Congress, and undermines our system of checks and balances. We must stand tall for the separation of powers doctrine in our Constitution.  We can do so while protecting the much more limited June 2012 Executive order that created the so-called DACA program that benefits DREAMers. Under my bill, the DACA program will continue just as it was designed by the President in 2012.  Madam President, I yield back all time on this side.
