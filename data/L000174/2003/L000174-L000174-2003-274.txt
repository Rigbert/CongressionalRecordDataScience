President, I respond to the distinguished Senator from Nevada, we have had a good colloquy with the distinguished senior Senator from Virginia, which is not unexpected because the distinguished Senator from Virginia is one of the most knowledgeable Members of the Senate, as well as being a dear and close friend. I think we have probably proved, for those who are watching, the edification of having both sides here.  The Senator from Virginia, though I control the floor--I have yielded to him whenever he wanted.
