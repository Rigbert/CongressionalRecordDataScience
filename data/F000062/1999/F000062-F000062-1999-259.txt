 President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Michigan. A while back, a former Vice President said he is one of the great minds of the Senate. I certainly agree with that. I think you know that.  Thank you very much.  I see the distinguished Senator from New Jersey on the floor. I yield 5 minutes of my time to Senator Torricelli.
