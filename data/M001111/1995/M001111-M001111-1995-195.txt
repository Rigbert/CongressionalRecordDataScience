62 a week. I have to tell my colleagues that I have had a number of families say to me: I know I have to pay my taxes, but I want something in return. And what I want in return is to know that my kids are going to get a good education, to know that my parents are going to be taken care of when they are sick and elderly and dependent on me. I want a quality of life. For $14.62 back, I will give that back to the Government.  But we are not giving it back to them. We are taking everything away--their education, their care for their parents, and their security.
