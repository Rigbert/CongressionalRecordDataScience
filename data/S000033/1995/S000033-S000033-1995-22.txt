 Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, this is not a good rule because it does not allow for a motion to recommit and debate over a serious and real alternative. The question is not whether we should move toward a balanced budget; the question is how we should move toward a balanced budget.  Mr. Speaker, the economic reality in this country today is that the richest people are becoming richer, the middle class is shrinking, and today, with great shame, we have by far the highest rate of childhood poverty in the industrialized world.  Given that reality, how in God's name can anyone talk about moving toward a balanced budget by giving huge tax breaks to the rich, by creating a situation in which the largest corporations will pay no taxes, by building more B-2 bombers that the Pentagon does not want at $1.5 billion a plane, by putting more money into star wars, by spending $100 billion a year defending Europe and Asia against a nonexistent enemy?  How do we talk about balancing a budget when we continue to spend $125 billion a year on corporate welfare, but we are going to slash Medicare, slash Medicaid, slash veterans' programs, eliminate LIHEAP, and do devastation to middle-income working people and the poor?  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues, if they want to balance the budget, what about going after foreign corporations with subsidiaries in America like Toyota and Nissan, which underpay their U.S. taxes by $25 billion?
