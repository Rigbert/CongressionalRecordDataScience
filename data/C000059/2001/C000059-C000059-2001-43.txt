Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a most wonderful person, friend and father--Tom Barnes--who passed away at the young age of 55 last Wednesday, July 18th.  Calvin Coolidge, America's 13th President, once said, ``No person was ever honored for what he received; honor has been the reward for what he gave.'' And Tom Barnes gave much to his community and the whole of the Inland Empire during his life.  A small piece of heaven just south of Corona, Tom's Farms, was Tom Barnes' gift to countless men, women and children. After years of selling fruit out of the back of his truck, Tom opened Tom's Farms in 1971. In the tradition of Walter Knott of Knott's Berry Farm and the culture of roadside stands, Tom offered tourists traveling through California's Inland Empire fresh fruits, antique furniture and dining all in the picturesque setting of country-style buildings painted yellow with green trim, a lake and the majestic shade of large trees. Today, Tom's Farms remains the perfect family outing and a traditional ``must-stop'' for anyone heading south on Interstate 15.  His roots take us back to Kansas City, Missouri where Tom got his start in business by selling his father's strawberries door to door. And today, Tom's Farms serves as a proud testimonial to that upbringing where fresh fruit and vegetables, finches and macaws, cheeses and wines, and country and antique furniture is offered for the delight of all who stop and take a moment to enjoy their surroundings. Through present expansion, including the addition of an animal farm, Tom's Farms promises to provide ``down-home'' enjoyment and family fun for years to come.  Tom Barnes was best known for his business finesse and a dedication to family and community involvement--particularly when it came to supporting local police and fire safety. In fact, for the past two years, Tom offered up Tom's Farms for the Great Taste of Corona, an annual event to raise funds for the police and fire departments. Additionally, Tom's versatility allowed him to expand Tom's Farms in the form of furniture stores in Corona and San Bernardino. He was also co-owner of TB Scott's restaurant in Corona with his best friend Scott Sherman.  Tom is survived by his wife, Leslie, two sons, two daughters and a grandchild. My prayers go out to them for their loss.  Mr. Speaker, looking back at Tom's life, we see a man dedicated to his family and community--an American whose gifts to the Inland Empire and southern California led to the betterment of those who had the privilege to come in contact or work with him. Honoring Tom's memory is the least that we can do today for all that he gave over his lifetime.                          ____________________
