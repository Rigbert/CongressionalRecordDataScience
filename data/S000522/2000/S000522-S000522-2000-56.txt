Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride and pleasure that I rise to urge the enactment of H.R. 2909, the Intercountry Adoption Act of 2000.  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Intercountry Adoption Act, which is necessary to implement the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.  The Convention was adopted in 1993 and signed by the United States in 1994. It will enter into force for the U.S. when the Senate gives its advise and consent and the President ratifies it.  Senator Helms, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has indicated his intention to schedule a committee vote as soon as both Houses of Congress have enacted this implementing legislation.  Mr. Speaker, the purpose of the Hague Convention and of this implementing legislation is twofold. The first purpose is to facilitate international adoptions whenever they are in the best interest of the child by eliminating unnecessary confusion, expense, and delay resulting from differences among certain laws and practices of nations.  The second and equally important purpose is to ensure transparent and fair regulation of international adoptions so that adoptions that are not in the best interest of the child, whether they involve gross abuses such as baby stealing and baby selling or other abuses that result in placing children in inappropriate settings, will not take place.  The legislation now before us establishes a framework for fulfilling both these essential goals. It charges the Secretary of State and the Attorney General with overseeing a process of accreditation and regulation of agencies and persons involved in international adoptions while avoiding unnecessary Federal encroachment on the regulatory authority long exercised by State governments. It sets minimum standards for this process of accreditation and regulation, all of which are designed to protect the best interests of children by promoting their adoption into appropriate family settings by agencies whose employees have the requisite skill, experience, and good judgment. And it ensures that courts and other competent authorities in the United States and in the adoptive children's countries of origin, as well as prospective adoptive parents, will have the information they need to make intelligent, life-affirming decisions.  Mr. Speaker, just let my say, throughout my 20 years in Congress, I have worked tirelessly on behalf of adoption and always in a bipartisan way.  In the late 80's, I introduced the OMNIBUS Adoption Act--which had as its centerpiece, a $5,000 tax credit for nonrecurring expenses. That's low today. Now I've introduced an updated measure designed to boost the credit to $10,000. That too is a bipartisan bill. The text in H.R. 2909 as it is presented on the floor today, is again a result of a tremendous amount of bipartisan work on the text.  Let me also point out, Mr. Speaker, in keeping with this commitment of protecting children, during the long and painstaking process of preparing this bill for enactment, I have at various times expressed concerns about provisions in preliminary versions of the legislation. Particularly, I have been concerned that the new regulatory scheme not facilitate ``end runs'' around legitimate laws and policies of States and foreign countries designed to protect the best interests of children.                              {time}  1245  Again I am happy to say that the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman) and I and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Delahunt), the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Camp), the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Mrs. Johnson) and many others have worked on legislation, with a text we could all agree to.  I join my colleague in thanking the professional work of our respective staffs especially Joseph Rees, who is general counsel and chief of staff of my Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights.
