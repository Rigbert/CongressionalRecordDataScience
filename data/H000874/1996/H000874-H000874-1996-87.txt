Chairman, if the Chairman will review the amendment that has been offered and on which unanimous consent was accorded, he will see that it has two sections, an A section and a B section. It refers to the payment of moneys to individuals who worked for the Travel Office.  Specifically it says in section 301(a), ``If an individual whose employment in the White House Travel Office was terminated on May 19, 1993, submits a claim under this subsection to the Secretary of the Treasury within 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall pay to the individual an amount equal to legal fees and expenses incurred by the individual with respect to that termination.''  It then goes on to say, ``For payments required under subsection (a), to be derived in equal amounts from funds made available in this title under the heading Compensation of the President and the White House Office--Salaries and Expenses and funds made available in this title under the heading Office of Administration, there are available to the Secretary of the Treasury up to $500,000.''  Mr. Chairman, I submit that this amendment has very little relationship to the amendment on which the unanimous consent was accorded. The reason for that is that it provides for payment to no one. It relates to the reduction of no specific office, Office of Administration or other White House account. This deals generally with the White House account across the board. As a result, I think it is clearly inconsistent with what Members gave unanimous consent about. One has to do with a cut in the White House budget. One has to do with reimbursement of White House travel officers.
