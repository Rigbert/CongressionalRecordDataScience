Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo) for his great work as chairman of the subcommittee. I run my committee a little different than most of the other chairmen. I like to have my subcommittee chairmen that handle the bill to do the work, and I deeply appreciate what an outstanding job he has done with the Coast Guard. And he has Coast Guard facilities in his district and represents the Coast Guard quite well and the ports, which is something that I think this bill will help take care of.  We have a serious problem, which I think we have met in this bill, and that is the importation of product without screening. We do that. We really think that this will make sure that something cannot, it could happen, but cannot readily happen because of the passage of this legislation, product damaging to the Nation through our ports, and we will be ability to make sure that does not occur. Of course, the Coast Guard plays an immense role in that.                              {time}  2200  Mr. Speaker, I know that the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo) has done this before; but I, too, would like to acknowledge Rebecca Dye, who has not only been a staffer for me for many, many years on the committee, her husband worked for the government; and even better, Rebecca is going to move on. This is her last presentation. She has been nominated by the President to serve as a commissioner on the Federal Maritime Commission, and I expect her nomination to be approved by the Senate very shortly. I am very proud of her actionsand ability to go forth and serve in an industry that I deeply respect, and that is the maritime industry. She has been a great professional, has done an outstanding job, and formerly served in the Coast Guard as a Reservist. She knows what she is doing.  I would also like to thank Patty Seeman for her hard work, and Ed Lee for his hard work, and of course Liz Megginson, chief of staff.  This bill has been a long time coming. We had to work with Senator Hollings, and I love him to death; but working with Senator Hollings can sometimes be difficult. Working with Senators always is difficult, and I know that I am not supposed to say that. The next rule change, we will be able to do that.  Mr. Speaker, I think this is a good piece of legislation. I know the hour is late and this is a so-called lame duck session; but this is one part of this lame-duck session we should be proud of. It protects our Nation, supports the Coast Guard, and helps our ports. I am extremely proud of this legislation. I urge my colleagues to vote for this legislation, if we have a recorded vote. I thank all Members who have worked together on a bipartisan basis, particularly the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar), the ranking member. We have done a good job on this legislation.                Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore
