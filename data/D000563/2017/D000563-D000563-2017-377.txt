President, I will yield the floor if the Democratic leader arrives, but until his arrival, I would like to do two things--first, join in the comments made by the majority leader, Senator McConnell, relative to the Holocaust remembrance.  This is the day on which we gather in the Rotunda each year to remember the atrocities of World War II, which includes remembering the Holocaust victims, so many who were Jewish people as well as Polish people--the list goes on and on--as well as those who were gay and gypsies. This was an ethnic cleansing--the worst ever seen in the history of this world. We remember it on this day, as we should.  Mr. President, on a separate issue, before us now is the nomination of Rod Rosenstein to be the Deputy Attorney General of the United States.
