 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 266, the Democratic proposal for funding the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, and related agencies for the remainder of fiscal year 2019.  This bill is almost entirely a Senate product. As such, it ignores the bipartisan priorities of the House and, perhaps even worse, it abdicates congressional responsibility under the Constitution to keep the executive branch in check.  Before I get into the details of the bill, however, I want to take a moment to congratulate my friend and colleague, Betty McCollum, for her appointment as the new chair of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies.  She has been a tireless advocate for programs under the jurisdiction of this subcommittee, a firm but fair overseer of agency operations, a tough negotiator and, above all, a good friend. She will be an outstanding chair. I wish her well, and I look forward to working with her in both of our new capacities.  Madam Speaker, over the past year, Ms. McCollum and I worked in collaboration to write a bill representing the needs and priorities of the House. We held nine budget oversight hearings, including four hearings with nearly 80 Tribal leaders regarding programs that honor treaty rights promised to our Native American brothers and sisters.  We wrote a bill that accommodated, in some shape or form, roughly 93 percent of all House Member requests, regardless of party. On top of that, when the bill came to the House floor, 70 amendments were debated and 50 were adopted.  And when told to begin negotiating the House-passed bill last year, we defended it against competing priorities in the Senate. We came together on numerous topics to write report language directives that maintain a check on the executive branch.  I am extremely proud of our work. We are so close to a final product. We shouldn't be throwing it all away with the bill before us today, a bill that the Senate has already said it will not consider and the President will not sign.  Let me highlight just a few of the House priorities missing in this product which concern me the most, and which are likely to concern our colleagues on both sides of the aisle.  First and foremost, the bill leaves behind all congressional report language directives. These directives are critical for keeping the executive branch in check. These directives are also the conduit through which the concerns of our constituents back home are heard directly by agency officials at the highest levels.  All of our colleagues in the House who have worked with their constituents and worked with the Appropriations Committee over the past year to craft these directives understand the effort that went into them and the impact they have on people's lives back home. The bill before us today throws that away, all that important work.  We included language to protect the California WaterFix from frivolous lawsuits in order to move forward a water supply project that is critically important to my constituents. By taking up this Senate bill, I am prevented from even fighting for my constituents.  But this isn't about my priorities; this is about all of the bipartisan priorities of the House of Representatives that are flushed away by rubber-stamping the Senate bill.  The bill provides $12 million less than last year's House-passed bill for the U.S. Geological Survey's natural hazards research and early warning system, the earthquake system, and $21 million less for the Forest Service and Department of the Interior to clear dead and dying trees from our forests in order to prevent more catastrophic wildfires like the kind we experienced in my own State of California.                              {time}  0930  These ounce-of-prevention programs save lives and save money. With so many fires, earthquakes, volcanoes, and other natural disasters in recent years, these programs should be a higher funding priority than they are in this bill.  Additionally, this bill provides $77 million less than the House Republican bill for EPA's WIFIA, brownfields, and Superfund remedial programs. These programs provide regulatory relief, leverage Federal dollars, improve water infrastructure, and spur economic development.  Instead, this bill increases funding for EPA regulatory programs. In many parts of the country, particularly agricultural States, EPA regulations and additional red tape are a bipartisan concern.  Even popular EPA grant programs, like the diesel emission reduction grants, DERA, and targeted airshed grants, were significantly reduced in this bill.  The DERA and targeted airshed grants are essential to my home State of California, where air quality remains one of our biggest concerns. My State and constituents rely on these grant programs to help improve air quality and public health by accelerating the replacement of older engines with new, cleaner engines.  For our National Park System, the bill before us today falls $27 million short of the House-passed level for park operations and reducing the maintenance backlog. With park visitation on the rise, this is no time to cut corners on the budget.  This bill also lacks important reforms for implementation of the Endangered Species Act, and it lacks the funding needed to prevent the sage grouse from being listed. Failure to prevent a listing will hurt local economies in 11 Western States and undermine our Nation's energy security.  This bill is almost $10 million below last year's House-passed bill in funding for historic preservation grants, including civil rights grants and grants to underserved communities.  The House felt so strongly about these programs that it added $5 million in multiple amendments on the House floor last year. Why would we give up all that funding by acceding to the Senate?  Last, but certainly not least, this bill falls $160 million short of last year's House-passed bill in funding treaty obligations to American Indians and Alaska Natives through the Department of the Interior and the Indian Health Service.  Earlier this week, USA Today was the latest news agency to run a front page article on the sad state of healthcare in Indian Country, which is funded mostly through the Indian Health Service in this bill. Funding for the Indian Health Service in this bill is $135 million below last year's House-passed level.  For an Indian health system that already is rationing the kind of healthcare that most of us take for granted, every dollar makes a difference in the quality of life of one of our fellow Americans whose ancestors paid in advance with their lives and their land to guarantee that the Federal Government would care for the health of their descendants. Properly funding this obligation is not optional.  The House heard from nearly 80 tribal leaders in hearings last year about the importance of funding these programs. Let's not turn our backs on them now, acceding to the Senate position.  Madam Speaker, for these reasons and others, I am strongly opposed to this bill, H.R. 266, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand up for their constituents' priorities and oppose the bill as well.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I couldn't agree more with my colleague and the former chair. When we were developing the bill, we had a much superior product as we came out of conference committee.  But it is time to move forward. Speaker Ryan did not bring that to the floor. We must move forward and begin our work, our important work, on 2020.  Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey), the chairwoman of the full Appropriations Committee.
