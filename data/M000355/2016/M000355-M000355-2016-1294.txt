 President, I too wish to say a few words about Ed Pesce, who today, after 25 years of Federal service, is retiring as the director of the Senate Periodical Press Gallery. Ed has been a fixture around here for years. You could usually find him right outside the Chamber, behind the saloon swinging doors of the Senate Periodical Press Gallery.  When George Mitchell was the majority leader, that is where you found him. When Bob Dole had the job, that is where you found him. It has been true ever since. But you can sometimes find Ed in other places too. Some mornings you can spot Ed at the gym on a spin cycle. Later in the evening, you might see Ed queuing for the premiere of a Star Wars sequel, maybe even a prequel.  At almost any other time, you likely would find Ed buried in a book. Fiction is one of his favorite genres; history is the other. He certainly witnessed plenty of it firsthand. He oversaw media planning and execution for six Presidential inaugurations, for half a dozen Republican Conventions, and for just as many Democratic ones, not to mention hundreds of congressional hearings and press conferences.  Ed is a Baltimore native who came to the Senate Periodical Press Gallery shortly after graduating from Loyola. He diligently worked his way through the ranks, and after a decade spent learning the tricks of the trade, he assumed his current role back in 2000. The job has brought Ed in contact with thousands of Senate staffers and congressional reporters. It necessitated many long hours and plenty of late nights. It presented ample amounts of tense situations as well.  But Ed never lost his good attitude or his boisterous laugh. Just ask his staff. ``Funloving,'' ``thoughtful,'' ``tough, but fair''--that is how people who work closest with Ed describe him.  At 6 feet 2 inches, Ed Pesce is hard to miss, but I know he will be missed here in the Senate when he leaves. He took on a tough job with a great attitude. He gained a lot of fans. It is a legacy that anyone could be proud of. I think I can speak for my colleagues when I say that we thank Ed for his many years of service. We send him our best, and we look forward to seeing what he will be able to accomplish in the next chapter of his life.                          ____________________
