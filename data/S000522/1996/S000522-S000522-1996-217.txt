Mr. Speaker, today the Helsinki Commission, which I Chair, is releasing its staff election observer report on one of the most important international events of the year--the September 14 elections in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Among their conclusions, the Commission staff state the following:  The elections cannot be considered free and fair, and were held prematurely because of limited international support for existing peacekeeping burdens.  The campaign period detracted the most from the election process, due to a lack of freedom of movement, association and expression, as well as the continued political activity of persons indicted for war crimes.  The provisional results, challenged by allegations of more ballots than voters, showed clear victories for the ethnically based parties originally brought to power in 1990. Whether the elections have set the stage for Bosnia's partition along ethnic lines, or for movement toward its effective reunification remains an open question.  The election administration was extremely complex and required significant outside help from the OSCE, which performed considerably well given the political and logistical circumstances in which it had to work.  Voter registration was also controversial, including on election day. Balloting nevertheless went relatively smoothly. There was some confusion in the transport and counting of ballots.  Mr. Speaker, holding the municipal elections in November as tentatively planned by OSCE would be a mistake. Not only would the administrative problems associated with the September 14 elections unlikely be corrected, the newly elected national institutions which must now begin to function should be free from the tensions and partisanship of another campaign period. And, a delay would allow time for Bosnian local leaders who support a unified, multiethnic Bosnia to compete fairly, and then help Bosnia build its democracy from the bottom up.  The Commission has, since 1992, taken the lead in the Congress in trying to shape a response to the war in Bosnia. Actively following and reporting on developments in the region, the Commission also has a particular interest in the effectiveness of the OSCE's organization of the Bosnian elections. The Commission held several briefings and hearings leading up to these elections, including hearing testimony from Bosnian elections officials, representatives of Bosnian political parties, OSCE mission chief Robert Frowick, special United States envory William Montgomery, and other experts. The Commission staff which compiled the election report benefited from being in various parts of Bosnia on election day, contributing to the large and important task of observing the voting and counting of ballots.  Bosnia-Herzegovina and most every country emerging from the former Yugoslavia will remain high on the United States foreign policy agenda through the end of this year and into 1997. I therefore encourage my colleagues to read the conclusions of the staff report, which I am submitting for the record, and contact the Commission should you wish a copy of the full report.Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe--Conclusions of Staff         Report on September 1996 Elections in Bosnia-Herzegovina       On September 14, 1996, Bosnia-Herzegovina held its second      multi-party elections since the collapse of the one-party      Communist political system in the former Yugoslavia in 1989.      These elections, however, were the first for that country      since the break-up of the old Yugoslav federation and the      warfare from 1992 to 1995 which accompanied Bosnia's      emergency as an independent state. This fighting, largely      directed against the civilian population, left an estimated      quarter of a million people dead or unaccounted for, and half      the original population of about 4.4 million displaced,      internally or abroad as refugees. The warfare ended in      December 1995 with the General Framework Agreement for Peace      in Bosnia-Herzegovina (hereinafter the ``Dayton Agreement''),      which divided the single Bosnian state into two entities with      significant powers of their own. Even for those who survived      the conflict in their own homes and villages, the economic,      social and political upheaval associated with the war--let      alone the almost universal personal loss of friend and/or      family in it--made the holding of free and fair elections in      Bosnia-Herzegovina virtually impossible, and filled any      attempt to do so with risk.       Elections were held at the national and lower levels but      did not include municipal elections, which were postponed.      The election administration was extremely complex and      required significant outside help from the OSCE, which      performed well given the political and logistical      circumstances. The campaign period detracted the most from      the election process, due to insufficient freedom of      movement, association and expression, as well as the      continued political activity of persons indicted for war      crimes. Voter registration was also controversial in      preparing for elections, and remained a problem on election      day itself. Balloting nevertheless went relatively smoothly,      although the subsequent transport of counting of ballots was      confusing and difficult.       Few have dared to characterize the September 14 elections      in Bosnia-Herzegovina as free and fair. Voters generally had      a free choice which could be secretly made when they stepped      into the voting booth, but disenfranchisement and an      intimidating atmosphere at certain locations detracted from      this positive characterization. Moreover, on the basis of the      campaign period alone, there was no doubt that the elections      were not fair. Opposition parties had little chance to make      their views known, let alone to counter aggressively the      effects of years of war and propaganda on Bosnian voters from      all ethnic groups. And, after the elections, questions      regarding the total number of eligible voters make      certification of the elections difficult.       The question, therefore, is not whether these elections      were free and fair; they obviously were not. The question is      whether the international community was wise to go forward      with the elections within the timeframe mandated by Dayton.      Based on the overwhelming nature of the victories for the      ruling parties in the September 14 elections, there is little      doubt that the results probably reflect the general will of      the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. With more time, during      which more substantial efforts could have been undertaken to      increase freedom of movement, of speech and of association,      as well as to sideline more effectively those indicted for      war crimes or otherwise responsible for the conflict in      Bosnia-Herzegovina, the result might have been different.       Some who argued for holding the elections on schedule      suggested that surprises may result, but they did not. They      claimed that the situation might actually worsen unless      elections were held soon rather than later, but little      evidence of that possibility has surfaced. They argued that      parties to the Dayton Agreement must adhere to the deadlines,      but, in doing so, Dayton's own prerequisites for effective      elections were not sufficiently met. They pointed out that      all parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina wanted the elections to      proceed, but this argument ignored the fact that the ruling      parties wanted the elections because they knew they would      win; that some other nationalist parties believed the      elections could facilitate partition; and that moderate      parties were hesitant but felt helpless in countering the      larger forces dominating their country's politics. Those who      prepared for the administration of the elections deserve      credit for their hard work, but additional time would have      enabled them to sort out the problems that caused so much      confusion around election day.       Therefore, the main argument for holding the elections by      the Dayton deadline seems driven mostly by the international      community's limited desire to continue to provide Bosnia's      peace and security through IFOR. The current IFOR mandate      expires at the end of 1996, and the elections were considered      a prerequisite to any withdrawal. Indeed, OSCE Mission Head      Robert Frowick succeeded in delaying the initial withdrawal      process until after the elections were held. If this      influenced the decision on when to hold the elections, then      U.S. Government pressure on the OSCE to hold elections      prematurely deserves criticism. However, the European critics      who wish to place full responsibility with the United States      should recognize that, for all its faults, only the U.S.-     brokered initiatives for peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina--both      the Federation and the Dayton Agreement--have actually      brought peace and produced some results. Also, not one      government spoke within OSCE in opposition to holding the      elections on September 14. Indeed, probably the greatest      opposition came from non-government organizations based in      the United States, which might have had greater success in      achieving a postponement had some influential countries      supported a delay.       Moreover, the peace process created by the Dayton Agreement      may have largely run its course by September 1996, and this      process needed something--the elections--to move to a new      level. Pressure now rests on those elected to work together      to resolve their problems, with less reliance on      international involvement. If the international community at      least maintains the resolve to prevent any party from      resorting again to the use of force to achieve political      ends, economic and other social forces may erode the      political power of those now taking office and result in a      more open, pluralistic society. This could even happen among      Serbs, despite their present intention to become independent.      Bosniacs, who have been the overwhelming victims, may      actually become less willing to reconcile differences as a      result. Bosnia's Croats can be expected generally to join      with whichever side seems to have the upper hand. For all      three, the pervasive fears and prejudices brought about by      war and propaganda must be replaced by trust and tolerance if      there is to be any hope of long-term success.       Unfortunately, the OSCE decided within days of the national      and entity elections--and before finalizing and certifying      the results of these elections--to proceed tentatively with      more complex municipal elections in late November 1996. OSCE      Coordinator for International Monitoring has personally      expressed reservations about this decision. Some of the      problems encountered with the national and entity-level      elections can be corrected by that date, but the root cause      of the original postponement--the registration of persons in      specific localities--will be especially difficult to remedy.      In the rush to organize the elections, other administrative      mistakes are to be expected. Moreover, fledging Bosnian and      entity institutions must now try to begin work in the context      of a new campaign that will only encourage intransigence.      Finally, postponing the local elections for six months or      longer provides the best chance for opposition parties to      score victories and build democracy in Bosnia-Herzegovina      from the bottom up. Comfortable with ethnically oriented      leaders offering protection from the top, or reacting to the      inability of these leaders to move the country forward,      voters could be prepared by that time to vote on the basis of      interests other than the need for ethnic cohesion. The ruling      parties will be able to ride the wave of victory into local      elections held in November 1996, reenforcing splits along      ethnic lines.       Bosnia's future remains uncertain. A genuinely unified      state could still emerge, or the state could be partitioned      by its neighbors. To some degree, at least, further action by      the international community could influence the direction in      which Bosnia will head.       The OSCE's performance in organizing and conducting the      elections has come under considerable criticism. While some      of the criticism might be warranted, the OSCE deserves credit      for having undertaken an extremely difficult task. Its      leadership resisted those governments which sought to      pressure it to act one way or another, and was relatively      candid in assessing the situation leading up to the      elections. In this respect, OSCE was a considerable      improvement on the United Nations in its political work in      Bosnia-Herzegovina. Finally, the OSCE can no longer remain on      the sidelines for the sake of its reputation. Perhaps the      OSCE should have been given a larger role to play earlier.      Considering the organization's direct involvement in      restoring peace and stability to Bosnia-Herzegovina today,      its effectiveness in bringing positive results to Bosnia-     Herzegovina will depend largely on its ability to avoid      repeating past mistakes and, like all international      organizations, on the political will of its participating      States.
