Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I rise to engage in a brief colloquy with the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Myers], the chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Water.  Mr. Chairman, as you and the members of the committee know, one of the Department of Energy facilities that is in the process of ceasing production is the Pinellas plant, which I have the privilege of representing. As noted in your report, we are engaged in a very innovative effort there to convert this defense facility to a commercial facility. As part of this effort, the Department of Energy has transferred ownership of the Pinellas facility to the Pinellas County Board of County Commissioners in an agreement that benefits both the Federal Government and the people of Pinellas County, FL, I represent. The Federal Government saves valuable resources by not having to bulldoze the facility and go through the time consuming process of surplusing the property. The county gains from retaining access to this facility which will save many of the jobs that would otherwise be lost from its closure.  Mr. Chairman, in decommissioning and closing out the defense mission of the Pinellas facility, the Department of Energy has certain obligations to leave the facility in compliance with various state and local codes and configured in such a way that it is safe and able to be utilized for its new commercial mission. The cost of these requirements is much less than the cost the Department would incur if it was to simply bulldoze the entire facility.                              {time}  1615  Mr. Chairman, I would like to clarify that nothing in the bill or accompanying report would in any way impede the ongoing effort to decommission and convert the Pinellas plant from a national defense to a commercial facility.
