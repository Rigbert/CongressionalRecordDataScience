 President, today I voted against the resolution offered by Senator Murkowski condemning the Government of Canada for its failure to resolve the blockade of a United States vessel in Canadian waters.  Canada's inaction clearly was wrong. The M/V Malaspina, a United Stats passenger vessel operated by the Alaska Marine Highway System, was blockaded in port by Canadian fishing boats for 3 days. The Canadian Government not only failed to condemn the blockage of the Ferry boat, it also took no action to enforce an injunction issued by a Canadian court requiring the M/V Malaspina to be allowed to continue its passage. The ferry was able to continue its passage only when the fishing boats voluntarily ended their blockade.  There is no doubt that the M/V Malaspina has the right of innocent passage through the territorial sea of Canada. Article 17 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea guarantees that right to the ships of all states.  There can also be no doubt that Canada failed to handle the illegal blockage of the United States vessel responsibly.  The amendment introduced by Senator Murkowski, however, is overkill. It would grant broad authority to the President and instruct him to compel Canada to prevent any further harassment of United States shipping. The amendment hints at the use of military force to escort shipping through Canadian waters, and offers only vague guidance on how outstanding maritime disputes with Canada might ultimately be resolved.  I believe that we should not jump to coercive methods to deal with maritime disputes--especially with one of our closest allies and largest trading partners--until all other diplomatic avenues have been tried and exhausted. Moreover, as a general rule, the Senate should avoid granting the President broad authority to accomplish vague objectives.  Rather than escalating this dispute, the Senate should call on Canada to fulfill its international commitments and provide assurances that the M/V Malaspina episode will not be repeated. We deserve at least that mush consideration from our ally to the north.                          ____________________
