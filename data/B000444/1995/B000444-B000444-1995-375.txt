 He was convicted of murdering two people in their homes. The main evidence was the testimony of another man who admitted having been in the house when the murder occurred, but who then claimed Macias was with him and committed the murder. Macias' lawyer did such a poor job. He did not investigate and discover a credible witness who provided an alibi.  The State court rejected Macias' claim that his lawyer had failed to give him an effective representation. Only when a Federal court looked at the fact an innocent man was facing the death sentence was the conviction thrown out. [[Page S7845]]   The prosecution still tried to reindict Macias, but on being presented with all the evidence, a grand jury in that same jurisdiction refused to indict Macias again.  Again, as I read the Hatch-Specter bill, the Federal court would have been forced to defer to the State court. So I would like to also point out another case, that of Hurricane Carter, which has been referred to. Carter was convicted of the murder of three people--despite the fact that he did not match the physical description of the killers, and was sentenced to life in prison.  The prosecution used the eyewitness testimony of a thief who at first denied seeing Carter at the scene. But the police then showed the witness a manufactured lie detector test that falsely showed he was lying.--In the face of this pressure, the witness changed his testimony. The fact that the witness had been pressured into his testimony using a false lie detector was not disclosed to the defendant, and was concealed from the jury.  The New Jersey Supreme Court upheld the conviction--but the Federal courts concluded that the prosecutor had unconstitutionally withheld evidence favorable to Carter. After habeas was granted, the State dismissed the indictment rather than seek a retrial in which it would have to give all the evidence to the defendant.  The deference rule in this bill would have prevented the Federal courts from correcting the State court's decision that the prosecutors had not violated the Constitution.  In fact, in that case, the State of New Jersey tried to win the case by arguing that the Federal court should defer to the State court. The Federal court instead exercised independent review, and ruled for Mr. Carter.  Let me also discuss the case of Walter McMillian. McMillian was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. The main evidence at trial was the testimony of a white man who claimed to have been an accomplice, and who was granted immunity. Two other witnesses testified that they had seen McMillian's truck in front of the dry cleaners. The jury ignored the testimony of a number of friends and family members who said he was at a fish fry.  After trial, a new investigation showed that the alleged accomplice who testified against McMillian at trial did not even know him at the time of the offense.  That, in fact, he had denied McMillian's involvement in three interviews before finally fingering McMillian.  That witnesses who claimed to have seen McMillian's low-rider truck could not have done so since the truck was not a low-rider at the time of the offense.  That the accomplice had complained to prison doctors that he was being pressured to frame McMillian, and that the doctors told the prosecutors about this before trial.  And that the State had interviewed other inmates who said the ``accomplice'' had told them he was going to frame a man.  The new investigation into the McMillian case showed that all of this evidence was withheld from the defendant at trial.  Despite this new evidence, the Alabama trial court refused to grant relief, turning down the constitutional claims about perjured testimony and Government misconduct. Eventually, the Alabama Appeals Court reversed. But, had the Alabama Appeals Court come out the other way, the deference language would have barred the Federal court from preventing the execution of an innocent man.  While my colleagues rightly point out the crush of repetitive petitions--many of which are frivolous, they leave the impression that habeas is no longer needed.  The cases I have just described demonstrate how important it is to preserve independent Federal review. While most State courts try to apply the law properly, sometimes they fail because of police or prosecution misconduct, or simply because they make mistakes.  Here are a few more examples of recent cases in which Federal courts granted habeas relief:       In Brown versus Lynaugh (5th Cir. 1988), Habeas relief was      granted because the presiding judge left the bench, took the      witness stand and provided evidence against the defendant.      Even though that type of conduct seems to make the trial      patently unfair, the State court didn't think so. The rule of      deference has prevented the Federal Courts from correcting      that error.       In McDowell versus Dixon (4th Cir. 1988), the conviction of      a dark-skinned African American was reversed because the      prosecutor had withheld eye-witness statements that the      assailant was white. The state courts found that this error      did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial. The Federal      court overruled and granted habeas relief. The deference rule      would have prevented the Federal courts from granting relief.  These cases demonstrate that habeas corpus is still needed--and that injustices continue to occur. Without habeas, those injustices would be left to stand uncorrected.                               conclusion  Everyone agrees that there is a need to end the delays and that the current system just doesn't work right. But I also think everyone would agree that we should have a fair process--one that does not execute innocent people.  We know that most prosecutors and most law enforcement officers are honorable. Most cases proceed fairly, and we can have confidence in the result.  But occasionally, prosecutors or cops act in bad faith--and there are cases which have demonstrated that. And, as we all know, our judicial system can make mistakes--and has done so.  The recent case of Kirk Bloodsworth is one example. Bloodsworth was convicted and sentenced to death for the rape and murder of a young girl. After a new trial, he was again convicted and sentenced to life in prison. Subsequent DNA testing confirmed his innocence. Bloodsworth lost 9 years out of his life because of an error in our legal system. He was lucky to escape with his life.  Mistakes do happen. Innocent people are convicted and sentenced to die.  Habeas corpus has existed to correct such errors--and to ensure that there will never be another Leo Frank--that there will never be another innocent person--man who is executed.  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  I hope that the Senator from Utah, when he gets an opportunity, will respond to my question relating to the case I raise. I thank the Chair for the time.  I yield the floor.
