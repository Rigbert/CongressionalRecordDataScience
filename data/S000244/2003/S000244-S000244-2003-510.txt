Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, this legislation authorizes Federal judges to receive the same cost of living pay adjustment that all Federal employees, including Members of Congress, have received for calendar year 2003.  By way of background, Congress enacted the Executive Salary Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act in 1975, which was intended to give judges, Members of Congress and other high-ranking Executive Branch officials automatic COLAs as accorded other Federal employees unless rejected by Congress. In1981, Congress enacted section 140 of Public Law 97-92, which requires specific congressional action authorizing judges the COLA.  Mr. Speaker, in the closing days of the 107th Congress, we failed to provide a COLA for Federal judges. This constitutes an inequity, since Members of Congress and all other Federal employees did receive a COLA in 2003.  The bill is straightforward. It simply provides for a cost-of-living adjustment for Federal judges consistent with the law. The President and the Chief Justice of the United States support granting judges a COLA now. The bill will assist in the administration of justice in our Federal courts and is otherwise noncontroversial. I urge its adoption.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
