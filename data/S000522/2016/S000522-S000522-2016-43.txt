Mr. Chairman, it is the gentleman who called it murder. I call it the taking of human life.  We need to hold the abortionists liable. We, in the pro-life movement, look at the women as co-victims. I have worked--I say to my friend from Florida--with well over 100 women, many of whom were part of the Silent No More Awareness Campaign, all of whom have had abortions, including the niece of Dr. Martin Luther King, Alvita King, who has had two abortions. She has said very, very strongly that in every abortion there was a co-victim, and that is the mother.
