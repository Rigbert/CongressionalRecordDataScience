Speaker, risk and danger are constant companions of progress. And last Saturday morning, we were reminded again that progress at times inflicts a painful price.  Fate has called the brave crew members of the Space Shuttle Columbia home, and, here on Earth, we maintain our faith that they have now begun a far better journey--one of our Creator's design.  Words are small comfort today to those closest to this tragedy, the families and friends of Rick Husband, William McCool, Michael Anderson, Kalpana Chawla, David Brown, Laurel Clark and Illan Ramon. A grateful Nation mourns their loss and honors their courage and sacrifice.  We also offer heartfelt condolences to those left behind, especially the twelve children who have lost a mother or father. We pray that time, and a recognition of this great mission, provide some comfort and help to heal this wound.  The history of America is marked not only by sacrifice in the service of others, but by a yearning to explore, to discover, to progress . . . from the first permanent settlers in the new world at Jamestown . . . to the expedition of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark . . . to the Wright Brothers' first flight at Kitty Hawk . . . to Neil Armstrong's first step on the moon a mere 66 years later.  The crew of the Columbia now joins that pantheon of American heroes who had the courage to dream, as well as the willingness to turn their vision into reality.  Although they traveled millions of miles in space, they sought answers to the questions that lie closest to the human heart.  The most fitting tribute that we can pay to their legacy is to fulfill this solemn pledge: We will continue the work that you have advanced.  And we will do so with the realization that it is our responsibility to determine the cause of this tragedy and to minimize the risk to those engaged in the exploration of space and the unknown.  Our Nation has always risen to a challenge and overcome adversity through perseverance.  That is a measure of our greatness. And, today, that is the calling that our national character commands us to undertake and continue.                          ____________________
