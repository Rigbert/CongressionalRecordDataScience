 President, I thank the chairman of the committee. There should be no doubt in anyone's mind that this administration is reopening the nuclear door. They are doing this to develop essentially a new generation of nuclear weapons. They call them low yield. It is contained in words such as ``advanced concepts.'' Essentially, they are battlefield tactical nuclear weapons.  This latest Defense authorization bill reversed the Spratt-Furse amendment which had existed for 10 years and had prohibited the development of low-yield nuclear weapons. So for 10 years there was a prohibition on this reopening of the nuclear door.  With this year's Defense authorization bill, that went down the tubes. Now we see in this Energy appropriations bill money to move along in the development and the research of these weapons.  What is interesting to me is when you ask these questions in committee, as I did of Secretary Rumsfeld--and I will get to that--what we hear is: Oh, it is just a study.  In fact, last year, $14 million was appropriated for the study. It is more than just the study. It is the study and development.  I rise today to send an amendment to the desk on behalf of myself, the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy; the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed; the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg; the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden; and the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold.
