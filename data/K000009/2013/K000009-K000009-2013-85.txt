 I am actually very familiar with the effect of rising water costs on a community. In my own hometown in Ohio, water costs will increase by 56.5 percent over the next 5 years, with the average ratepayers bill increasing from $125 to $300 per year. Such a large increase takes a significant toll on hard-pressed families, especially on seniors living on fixed incomes. This is being done in order to construct major water facilities that are seriously out of date and in need of replacement.  The amendment being offered here tonight must be viewed, I think, in terms of equity. Currently, the vast majority of local communities benefiting from water supply from Corps of Engineers projects are charged fees for storage.  The Corps is working to review the current policy case by case in favor of a more consistent policy across the country. My community receives nothing from the Corps in the way of water storage or capacity. The region in question has already benefited from cost-free water storage over several years. It seems to be unfair to provide special treatment to one specific region, or create an exception for one region, from a nationwide policy.  Given the sharp fiscal constraints to agencies funded by this bill, it is particularly difficult to justify such a localized subsidy because we have pressing needs across our country and, frankly, not sufficient funds to meet all the water needs facing our Nation. Frankly, I think these water needs are going to be very significant as time goes on because our population will double. It already has doubled since the last century, and tripled. By 2050, they expect 500 million people to be living in this country. The amount of water isn't going to change. It's a resourcethat just keeps replenishing. We have to treat it because we have more people and it's going to cost more to do this.  I respectfully rise in opposition to the gentlelady's amendment, urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from South Dakota (Mrs. Noem).  The amendment was agreed to.                    Amendment Offered by Ms. Speier
