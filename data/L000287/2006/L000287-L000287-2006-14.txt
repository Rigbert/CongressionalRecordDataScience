Mr. Speaker, the statement by Majority Leader Boehner was shameful and disgraceful. To suggest that my fellow Democrats care more about protecting the terrorists than the American people is not right, it is not fair, it is not just, and it is not the American way.  Mr. Speaker, Democrats will not stand by and let a single attack go unanswered. You may play the politics of fear, you may question the patriotism of those who use their constitutional rights to criticize this administration, but this dog will not hunt. This dog just will not hunt.  The American people know better. They want this Nation to take a new path. They want to move in a different direction. They want leaders who respect the dignity and the values of our democracy. We cannot defend democracy abroad if we don't practice it here at home.                          ____________________
