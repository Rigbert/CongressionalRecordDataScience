 President, I thank the majority leader for his work on the extension for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. Unfortunately, this program has had to be extended several times while the Senate finance Committee worked to complete a very ambitious agenda.  Happily, though, the Senate finance Committee was able to report a welfare reauthorization bill on September 10, 2003. I plan to file the committee bill shortly. It is critical that the Senate act swiftly to complete action on this legislation. This program has languished, unauthorized, for a year. States need to make plans to adjust to the new provisions. Recipients need some assurances that the program will continue.  It was my preference that Senate action on the welfare bill take place this fall, but I understand that the time frame for adjournment is fluid and this impacts what the Leader is able to bring to the floor. Additionally, I would have preferred a shorter extension, in order to keep the process moving forward. I do not want to send the signal that since we are passing a 6-month extension, this means that there will be no action on this legislation until March next year. If that should occur, we would find ourselves in the position of having to seek yet another extension. This is a situation which can only be avoided, in my view, by prompt action on this legislation.  I understand why the majority leader wants a 6-month extension because I recognize that it is nearly impossible to envision a scenario in which the Senate passes a bill, the House and Senate have a conference, a conference report is drafted and filed and the measure goes back to both houses for a final vote, prior to a possible adjournment date in late November. But if it becomes at all possible for the Senate to act on the legislation in what remains of this session, leaving conference committee consideration for early next year, we should certainly do that.  It is my intention, if a window of opportunity does open up before we adjourn for the year, to work with the Leadership to bring this legislation up for consideration. In the event that such a window of opportunity does not open up in what remains of this session, I am confident that this bill will be among the first pieces of legislation brought up for consideration as soon as we reconvene next year.                        montana's welfare waiver
