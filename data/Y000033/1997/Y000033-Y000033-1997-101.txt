Mr. Chairman, I just listened to the previous speaker speak, and since 1943, there was an Effigy Mounds National Monument by Mr. Truman of 1,481 acres; Russell Cave National Monument, 310 acres by President Kennedy; Buck Island Reef National Monument, 850 acres by Mr. Kennedy; Chesapeake & Ohio Canal National Monument, 19,236 acres historical; Marble Canyon National Monument, 26,000 scientific, by Mr. Johnson; 1978, and the reason I am speaking, the Alaska Monuments, 56 million acres; and then, of course, the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, 1,700,000 acres.                              {time}  1900  Both of those, the Alaska one and the Escalante, were for political purposes only and that is all.  We talk about robber barons. What about the coal deposits in that area that are now set aside so that people of every day can benefit from them? It is ironic that there are some other people at that time also interested in coal in foreign countries.  This was used for political purposes only. There was no consultation, even with Mr. Orton, who was one of their colleagues. He got shot in the foot, in the head, and the back by his President for the environmental community.  The bill we have before us today is a bill that will work. Fifty thousand acres is bigger than any other ones, than the political ones in Utah and Alaska. The true monuments, the true antiquities acts, have been applied with less acreage than is in this bill. This is a fairness bill. This is about if there is that much threat to an area, it can be saved by the President. If it is larger than that, and God help us, it never will be larger than that, they can come to the Congress.  I am surprised the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. Vento] wants to give away the authority of this Congress, because under this Constitution, only this Congress can designate and classify lands. The gentleman also said, we can come back and undo what they did in Escalante. With this President, who are they kidding? It will never get signed into law.  Do my colleagues know what they did to me in Alaska? After 56 million acres, they came back with Mo Udall, bless his heart, John Seiberling, a few others I can mention, and they set aside 147 million acres of land, took it away from the people of Alaska, took it away from the people of America, and put it in little classified areas so that only a few and the elite can get to see. This is not what the Antiquities Act is all about.  I am suggesting, respectfully, if we really want to save the Antiquities Act, if we really want to make it work, then we ought to take and adopt this bill. It is a fairness bill. It is a bill that does allow the President, by the stroke of a pen, to set aside 50,000 acres. If he wants more, he has to come back to us. And that is our role, and that is what we should be doing. This is a good bill, and I urge a ``yes'' on this legislation.
