 Won't the Department of Energy (DOE) accept full responsibility for the cleanup for this environmental liability, as provided under the 1996 USEC Privatization Act? Also, it is my understanding that the funds would be transferred to the General Fund, and no longer specifically dedicated to funding USEC's environmental cleanup? Is this accurate?
