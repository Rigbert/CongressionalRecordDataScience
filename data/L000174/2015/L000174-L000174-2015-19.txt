President, I hate to say this to my good friend from Kentucky, but this is a bumper sticker kind of amendment. It says it would keep us secure, but it would even stop tourists from visiting this country for at least 30 days.  Let's say you have a relative who is dying in this country, you will have to call them up and say: Don't die for at least 30 days so I can come over and say goodbye to you. It stops some of our closest allies in the Middle East. Jordan is probably our closest ally, and this legislation would stop us from issuing visas there.  It doesn't make us safer. It kills our tourist industry, it damages our economy, but most importantly it makes it look to the rest of the world like we are cowering in our shoes. I don't want to do that.  Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment violates section 313(b)(1)(C) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
