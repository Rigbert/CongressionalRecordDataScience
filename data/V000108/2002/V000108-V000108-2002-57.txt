Speaker, it is with a great sense of honor that I rise to celebrate Black History Month. As we honor the great culture and historic legacy that African-Americans have left to us and to future generations, I would like to recognize the oldest African-American church in Gary, Indiana--First Baptist. On Sunday, February 24, 2002, I will have the privilege and the honor to attend the worship service at First Baptist to show my respect for the spiritual foundation on which First Baptist was founded.  It was during the Industrial Revolution when smokestacks dotted the skies along the southern coast of Lake Michigan that thousands of immigrants looking for a better life and a steady income migrated to Northwest Indiana. Many who came to Northwest Indiana, particularly Gary, were from the South. Several of the migrants who came to Gary brought with them deeply embedded religious beliefs, including a yearning for their own place of worship. This unwavering spiritual foundation led in 1908 to the creation of Gary's first African-American church, First Baptist.  In its earliest days, the first services were held in the residence of Mr. and Mrs. Rankins, in Gary, yet baptisms were performed in Chicago. The need to establish a single spiritual home for its growing family of parishioners inspired the decision to purchase a vacant lot on Washington Street in downtown Gary.  In 1917, the church moved to 2101 Washington Street and began to expand its house of worship. The expansion project was completed in 1925. A year later First Baptist church achieved a milestone; they became the first African-American church in Gary to install a pipe organ. Through most of this period of unprecedented foundation and growth, Rev. Hawkins led and guided this congregation. In June of 1944, after 31 years of service, Rev. Hawkins delivered his last sermon, for his health was deteriorating. He died four years later. His successor, Reverend L.V. Booth, took over in July of the same year.  Under Rev. Booth's devout leadership, the number of parishioners continued to grow and the church began its second major expansion project: ten new lots were purchased along 21st Avenue near Harrison Street in 1949. In 1952, during the growth phase, Rev. Booth resigned after eight years of service. However, December of the same year brought forth a dedicated new pastor, Rev. Penn. During his 21-year tenure with First Baptist, he completed the second phase of the building expansion and held a groundbreaking ceremony on May 2, 1954 on 21st Avenue, with Rev. William Jernigan, president of the National Baptist Sunday School, in attendance.  In September of 1955, the parishioners marched from the building at 2101 Washington Street to their new house of worship and current location, 626 West 21st Avenue. In its new home, First Baptist entered an era of renewed community involvement. Under Rev. Penn's guidance, the number of worshippers grew from 1,200 members in 1955 to more than 1,900 in 1972.  In 1973, Rev. Penn resigned and gave his farewell sermon. Since that time, First Baptist has succeeded in its efforts to provide spiritual guidance for the Gary community under the direction of a number of religious leaders, including: Dr. Colvin Blanford; Rev. William Booth; the Rev. Allen Smith; and its current pastor, Rev. Bennie Henson, Sr.  A congregation founded in 1908 to meet the spiritual needs of the African-American community survives today as the city's oldest African-American church. In June of this year, First Baptist will celebrate its 94th anniversary. This is a testament to the positive will, dedication and fortitude of its past and present parishioners.  Mr. Speaker, as we remember the great cultural and historic legacy of African-American heritage during this month, I ask that you and my other colleagues join me in commending the parishioners at First Baptist and all other outstanding African-American leaders for theirefforts to build a better society for our country and the citizens of Northwest Indiana.                          ____________________
