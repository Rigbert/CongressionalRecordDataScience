In order to do the kind of work that is necessary on the south building, the GSA did extensive surveys and found that they had to take the employees out as the construction was taking place.  That is why this whole plan that we have developed involves moving out to Beltsville for temporary quarters and eventually moving back into a renovated south building, and then using what is constructed at Beltsville for permanent facilities so all the leased space can come together into something we own.  I am sure the gentleman's life experience, like my own, we rented for years, it was not worth much, finally bought a home, and now I take a lot more pride in it.
