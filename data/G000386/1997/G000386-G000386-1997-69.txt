 President, I rise today to introduce the Religious Liberty and Charitable Donations Protection Acts. This bill represents a giant step forward in protecting the religious freedom of many Americans who tithe. In the House of Representatives, Congressman Ron Packard will today introduce a companion measure. I ask consent that the bill be printed in the Record following my remarks.  As my colleagues may know, bankruptcy judges across the country have been ordering churches to refund large sums of money when a parishioner declares bankruptcy. This causes serious hardship to churches and is a frontal assault on religious freedom of worship. After the Supreme Court's recent decision striking the Religious Freedom Restoration Act [RFRA] down as unconstitutional, I believe that Congress has a responsibility to act now to protect religious freedom. Because I chair the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts--which has primary jurisdiction over bankruptcy--I have an obligation to respond to this renewed threat to religious liberty.  Of course, there are other areas where Congress needs to protect religious freedom, and I look forward to assisting Chairman Hatch--who is a strong leader in protecting religious liberty--in these efforts.  But in the context of tithing and bankruptcy, I feel the time to act is now. The Supreme Court just vacated and remanded a case from the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals which had ruled that RFRA protected churches from bankruptcy lawsuits seeking the return of money given as a tithe. This is a particular concern to me, since my home State of Iowa is in the eighth circuit and will be affected by this court case. The pastor of the church involved in this case, Pastor Steven Goold of the Crystal Free Evangelical Church, testified before my subcommittee as to the difficulties his church has faced in trying to protect itself from bankruptcy judges, including the huge legal costs associated with fighting the bankruptcy judge's ruling. Pastor Goold supports this legislation, as does Americans United for Separation of Church and State. So, the bill has broad support from many diverse sectors of our society.  In addition to preventing Federal judges from ordering churches to pay refunds of previous tithes, the legislation I'm introducing today will protect postbankruptcy tithing in chapter 13 cases. As currently interpreted, chapter 13, which permits debtors to repay their creditors at a discounted rate, also allows debtors to budget a moderate amount of money for entertainment expenses. But, several courts have said that debtors can't budget money to tithe to their church. In other words, if you're in chapter 13 bankruptcy, you can budget money for a hamburger and a movie, but you can't take that same money and give it to your church--even if you believe your faith requires that.  This is an obvious assault on the freedom of religion. Would our founding fathers have wanted a Federal judge to tell a citizen that he's not allowed to tithe to his church? Obviously not. Such a situation is antithetical to the American tradition of liberty and separation of church from State.  As a result of my hearing, I have made several minor changes to accommodate various concerns that have been raised about possible unintended consequences. I hope that the legislation as now drafted will receive the support of every Member of Congress who is concerned about protecting freedom generally and restoring freedom of religion--our first freedom--to its rightful place in American society.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1244       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
