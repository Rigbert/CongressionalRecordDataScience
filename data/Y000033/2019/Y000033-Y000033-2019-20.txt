Chair, I also insert in the Record a letter of opposition from the Laborers' International Union of North America.                                                       LiUNA!,                                                September 9, 2019.     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,     Speaker, House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Kevin McCarthy,     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader McCarthy: On behalf      of the 500,000 members of the Laborers' International Union      of North America (LiUNA), I want to express our opposition to      H.R. 205, which would permanently extend the moratorium on      oil and gas leasing in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico; H.R. 1146,      to once again prohibit oil and gas drilling in the Arctic      National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR); and, H.R. 1941, which would      bar offshore drilling along the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts.       Once again, jobs of LiUNA members who work in the energy      sector are being targeted for elimination by environmental      radicals for purely political purposes. There is absolutely      no chance for these ``message bills'' to be enacted into law      this Congress. So, instead of working to enact real job      creating infrastructure legislation, union members see their      jobs once again being denigrated and belittled.       Energy independence is central to the future of the      American economy and our standard of living. Unfortunately,      the enemies of job creation continue to try to wall off and      strand our domestic energy resources     from development; killing jobs, prolonging our energy      dependence on unfriendly foreign regimes, and saddling      middle-class and lower-income families with rising energy      costs.       LiUNA members, in Alaska and elsewhere, know first-hand      that when done responsibly, with union-trained workers,      energy development can coexist with environmental      stewardship. LiUNA and the other building trades unions      invest significant resources into the training of our members      that help develop the knowledge and skills they need to work      safely and productively while constructing energy and other      infrastructure to the highest standards.       For the hard-working members of LiUNA and other building      trades unions, these jobs put food on their families' tables      and roofs over their heads. These jobs enable them to put      their children through college, to save for retirement, and      to spend money in business establishments that employ others.       I urge you to vote against these ill-conceived bills.       With kind regards, I am           Sincerely yours,                                                 Terry O'Sullivan,                                                General President.
