President, I ask the Senate to join me in acknowledging the 15 Columbia River Basin tribes' involvement in the Columbia River Treaty negotiation and review process. As some of you may know, the Columbia River Treaty is an agreement between Canada and the United States on the development and operation of the major hydroelectric dams in the Columbia River Basin. It addresses power and flood control benefits in both countries. The treaty has been in effect since 1964. Under the provisions of the existing treaty, if either country wishes to modify or cancel the treaty, it must notify the other country by the year 2014.  With 2014 approaching, the United States and Canadian treaty ``entities'' have already begun talks regarding a possible extension and modification of the treaty. The Columbia River Treaty review team has designated representatives from 15 Columbia River tribes, also known as the Sovereign Review Team, SRT. The Columbia Basin tribes have vital cultural and natural resources at stake since their homelands are located in the area affected by the treaty and, as sovereign units of government and members of the Sovereign Review Team, SRT--they have a right to play an important role in those negotiations. It is important to recognize the unique fishing rights for salmon that will have to be taken into account during any negotiations of this treaty with our neighbors to the north. The outcome of these negotiations could have a profound impact on the Northwestern United States.  I really appreciate one of the designated tribal representatives from Oregon, the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, for their continuous involvement. I also appreciate the other members of the Sovereign Review Team. The tribes and folks from the Pacific Northwest all share a common desire for proactive approaches in salmon restoration and recovery, and it is important to come together with shared strengths, joint efforts and coordinated education strategies.  Unfortunately, the Columbia River Treaty was enacted during a time in our history when consideration was not given to the treaty's effects on the natural and cultural resources of tribes/first nations whose homelands are located within the Columbia River Basin. Lack of previous dialogue and inclusion of tribal perspectives has disrupted regional and tribal interests by leading to the degradation of rivers, the salmon population, traditional food sources, natural resources, and tribal customs and identities.  The Columbia River Treaty Review provides an opportunity for the United States to include Columbia Basin tribes in the treaty review process. I want to emphasize the importance of tribal consultation and incorporation of traditional knowledge in this process--to ensure protection and conservation of the numerous natural resources that tribal people's way of life are dependent on.  The treaty review provides an opportunity to discuss and learn ways to strengthen both the government-to-government relationship that exists between the United States and the individual Indian nations as well as the U.S.'s position relative to Canada. This can lead the U.S. to advance its relationship with 15 additional sovereigns. I have enjoyed working with tribes on a number of important issues; I value our continued friendship and look forward to working together in the future. I am proud to support the 15 Columbia River Basin tribes in their efforts to stand alongside the United States in negotiations of the Columbia River Treaty and stand ready to assist in any way I can.                          ____________________
