While I was not on the floor, there was a unanimous consent request propounded successfully, so that this is automatically going to become a reality without a vote. That is fine. That is going to happen. But I have to say, I was not here on the floor, as 75 percent of the Senators were not here.  I am not criticizing the majority leader or any Member of this Senate. But I have to say, I agree with Senator Byrd that--I think he probably recited it, even though I was not here--section 3 of Article I of the Constitution says:       The Vice President of the United States shall be President      of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally      divided.  I often say that one of the few qualifications I have for this office is that I am not an attorney. So when I read the Constitution, I know what it says. Soafter the 20th, we will be a majority party.  While I chair two subcommittees, the rule that we are adopting here, the resolution, says that even though I chair that subcommittee, if it is an equal vote--it is a tie vote--it goes on to the full committee. I do not think that is right. For that reason, I just want to make sure the Record does reflect I do oppose the resolution. I would like to have the Record reflect that.
