 President, the issue that the Senator from New York just brought up of threats being used is exactly what the Reed-Sessions amendment deals with. I suggest this was also very much a point that was raised by people at the White House that we have been discussing--the whole issue of bankruptcy over a long period of time.  This was also worked out because this was a major concern. They did not want this abuse. They did not want the issue of threats. We agree with them, as we had to work it out with Senators Sessions and Reed because the bill, as they saw it, was not adequate enough in this area.  As people vote on this amendment, I hope they will consider that we have been trying to respond in a very legitimate and strong way against the use of threats.
