Madam Speaker, today I congratulate James B. Blasingame on his retirement from the Alaska Railroad. Mr. Blasingame started at the Alaska Railroad at age 35 starting as a programmer. He has moved up through the company culminating his career as Vice President of Corporate Affairs. In 1985, Mr. Blasingame was appointed by the Alaska Railroad as the Federal coordinator where he oversaw the transfer of the Federally-owned Alaska Railroad to the State of Alaska.  The Alaska Railroad has been an outstanding organization in Alaska promoting expansion and economic development throughout the state. I commend Mr. Blasingame and his tireless effort within the company to improve the railroad's operations, facilities and safety performance. Not only do I want to commend him on his work, I would also like to applaud the amount of time he spent volunteering on a number of non-profit, civic boards and organizations, including Providence Hospital, Anchorage School Business Partnership, World Trade Center of Alaska and Credit Union National Association.  Today, I congratulate and recognize Jim on his retirement and years of service to Alaskan residents and the development of the Alaska Railroad and wish him good luck in the next chapter of life.  Madam Speaker, I would also like to submit a resolution approved by the Alaska Railroad Board of Directors commending Jim for his service.
