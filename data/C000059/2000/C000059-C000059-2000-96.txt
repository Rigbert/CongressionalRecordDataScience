Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 4205.  Mr. Chairman, I am in full support of this important legislation that honors our men and women serving our nation's armed services. I believe this bill properly addresses the needs of our servicemen and women by providing needed quality of life programs and revamping the procurement shortfalls our military has been suffering since the Kosovo campaign.  I am particularly thankful to Chairman Spence and the Armed Services Committee for their continued support of the C-17 Globemaster. This legislation contains language focusing on the aging C-141 aircraft fleet and replacing this aircraft with C-17's. This legislation directs the Secretary of the Air Force to consider placing C-17's at bases with reserve units, especially those that could accommodate a reverse-associated unit, like March Air Reserve Base in Riverside, CA.  Mr. Chairman, I believe this bill is good for U.S. servicemen and women, good for the national security needs of our country and a sound investment for the people of the United States.
