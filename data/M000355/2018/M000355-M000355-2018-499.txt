 President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to the consideration of the House message to accompany H.R. 6, the opioids bill. I further ask consent that the majority leader or his designee be recognized to make a motion to concur; that there be up to 4 hours of debate on the motion, equally divided in the usual form; and that following the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate vote on the motion to concur with no further intervening action or debate.
