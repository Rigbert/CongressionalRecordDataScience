President, I wish to express my thanks to Senator Thurmond and the staff of the Armed Services Committee for their diligence in working with Senator Nickles and me and our staffs on this amendment.  This amendment requires the General Accounting Office to review the DOD report on depot maintenance required in the National Defense Authorization Act of 1995 (S. 1026.), and report their findings to Congress within 45 days of the date of the report.  This is a common sense, noncontroversial amendment. It simply provides a second opinion for members of Congress when the time comes to review the Department of Defense's recommended changes. This additional review will help Members sort through this complicated subject.  Again, I thank the members and staff of the Armed Services Committee for their assistance in having this amendment included in the bill.
