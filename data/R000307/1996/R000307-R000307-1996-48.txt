Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  The House has before it today a historic conference report, H.R. 2854, the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996. I call it historic because the Committees on Agriculture have produced a farm bill that represent a major departure from the past and a bold plan in regard to the future.  Mr. Speaker, I have some 16 pages of very pertinent comments in regard to the Freedom to Farm concept that we have passed, but I am going to revise and extend my remarks and we are going to hope to try to conclude this.  The Senate has passed the similar conference report 74 to 26, and the reason that we are trying to expedite this bill is to get it to the President as fast as possible. We have assurance from the Secretary of Agriculture that the President will sign it, and farmers have been waiting and waiting and waiting. And so as soon as we conclude this debate, we will try to make it just as short as possible to accommodate not only every farmer and rancher of America, but my colleagues here who I know wish to go home.  Mr. Speaker, the House has before it today an historic conference report--H.R. 2854--the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996. I call it historic because the Agriculture Committees have produced a farm bill that represents a major departure from the past and a bold plan for the future.  Embodied in the Conference Report before us today is what is commonly referred to as the Freedom to Farm concept that I, along with Congressman Barrett of Nebraska, introducedlast August. Freedom to Farm was developed after the Committee conducted 19 field hearings and traveled over 60,000 miles last spring listening to over 10,000 farmers, ranchers, and the agribusiness community.  The original New Deal farm programs, over 60 years, ago were based on the principal of supply management. Control supply and raise prices. Over the last 20 years the principal justification for the programs has been that farmers receive federal assistance in return for setting aside a portion of their acreage. That assistance was largely in the form of deficiency payments to compensate farmers for prices below a government-set target price for their production.  Today that system has collapsed as an effective way to deliver assistance to farmers. Worldwide agricultural competition usurps markets when we reduce production. World demand (along with the Conservation Reserve Program) has tightened supplies so that there have been no set-asides in wheat for five years--and none are projected in the foreseeable future, eliminating that justification for the programs. In short, the supply management rationale not only fails under close scrutiny by the many critics of agriculture policy, it has enabled our competitors to simply increase their production by more than we ``set aside,'' thereby causing significant impact on American farmers through lost market shares.  The budget cuts of the last ten years have produced greater and greater bureaucratic controls on farmers. In fact, decoupling of the payments from production actually occurred ten years ago when Congress froze payment yields to save money. In 1990 the concept of ``unpaid flex acres'' was introduced to further weaken and devalue the programs in a budget-cutting move. For the last ten years, in effect, Congressional farm policy has been driven almost completely by budget reduction, and the 1995 debate reaffirmed the budget as the driving force for program policy.  Most in the agricultural community have come to the realization that annual set-asides are counter-productive and only encourage our competitors to plant more and steal market share. However, to eliminate the Secretary of Agriculture's reliance on set-asides would cost either the taxpayers or the farmers $6.6 billion under the present farm program according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).  The Freedom to Farm Act [FFA] was born of an effort to create a new farm policy from an entirely new perspective. Acknowledging that budget cuts were inevitable, FFA sets up a new set of goals and criteria for farm policy; Get the government out of the farmers' fields; return to farmers the ability to produce for the markets, not government programs; provide a predictable and guaranteed phasing down of federal financial assistance.  By removing government controls on land use, FFA effectively eliminates the No. 1 complaint of farmers about the programs: Bureaucratic redtape and government interference. Complaints about endless waits at the county office would end. Hassles over field sizes and whether the right crop was planted to the correct amount of acres would be a thing of the past. Environmentalists should be pleased that the government will no longer force planting of surplus crops and monoculture agriculture. Producers who want to introduce a rotation on their farm for agronomic reasons will be free of current restrictions. Allowing farmers to rotate their crops will allow them to reduce the use of pesticides, herbicides and fertilizer. This sample fact makes this bill the most ``green'' or environmentally friendly farm bill in my memory.  Under FFA, farmers can plant or idle all of their acres at their discretion. The restrictions on what they can plant are greatly reduced. Response to the market would assume a larger role in farmer planning. Divorcing payments from production (a process already begun when yields were frozen in 1985) will end any pressure from the government in choosing crops to pursue. All production incentives in the future should come from the marketplace.  The guarantee of a fixed (albeit declining) payment for seven years will provide the predictability that farmers have wanted and provide certainty to creditors as a basis for lending. The current situation in wheat, corn and cotton under which prices are very high, but large numbers of producers have lost their crops to weather or pests would be corrected by FFA. Those producers last year could not access the high prices without crops, and instead of getting help when they need it most, the old system cuts off their deficiency payments and even demands that they repay advance deficiency payments. FFA insures that whatever government financial assistance is available will be delivered, regardless of the circumstances, because the producer signs a binding contract with the Federal government for the next seven years.  Some of my colleagues have expressed reservations about making high payments during period of high prices. First, the payments will not be high. You can't cut the amount of money we have cut out of agriculture spending over the last 20 years and still have ``high'' payments. No farmer is likely to take his market transition payment and retire. Farmers will continue to farm.  Second, under FFA, the payments made to producers must be looked at from a new perspective. It is a transition to full farmer responsibility for his economic life. Just as farmers will need to look to the market for production and marketing signals, the FFA will require that farmers manage their finances to meet price swings. It is true that when prices are high, farmers will receive a full market transition payment. It is equally true that if prices decline, farmers will receive no more than the fixed market transition payment. That means the farmer must manage all his income, both market and government, to account for weather and price fluctuations.  In short, the FFP authorizes Transition Payments to farmers--as opposed to the current program's deficiency payments--to serve as a form of compensation as we move U.S. agriculture from an economy heavily influenced by the federal government to one in which the government's role is substantially reduced and the primary influence is the market place.  The old program provided market insulation for each bushel of production, but that system is collapsing under the weight of budget cuts. The FFA enhances the farmer's total economic situation--in fact, FFA results in the highest net farm income over the next 7 years of any of the proposals before Congress. This allows the farmer to become accustomed to saving when times are good and using those savings when times are tough. With government assistance declining, it is imperative that producers assume total responsibility for their economic futures. In the years that prices are strong and the farmer receives a payment, it will be his personal responsibility to save that money for the bad year or pay off debt so he can weather the bad years.  The severest critics of farm programs at the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Economist, and a host of regional newspapers have hailed FFA as the most significant reform in ag policy since the 30's. Many congressional critics have also decided that FFA represents the kind of reform they can support. If the ``welfare'' charge was to be leveled, it should have come from this corner. Instead, they believe FFA is the kind of reform that is needed. Nearly every agricultural economist who has commented on FFA has supported it structure and its probable effect on farmers and the agricultural sector.  The only people who are worried about it being classed as ``welfare'' are those populists who want to keep the status quo, some farm groups and others who are supportive of the old farm programs. Agriculture is now at a crossroads. It can either sink deeper into government controls and rapidly sagging government support, or it can strike out in a new direction that at least holds out the prospect of an assisted transition to the private marketplace. H.R. 2854 and the Freedom to Farm Act is that new direction and Congress needs to seize it.  Never before has a farm program proposal enjoyed such broad and diverse support as this one. From the Ivory Towers of academia and the think tanks to the editorial board rooms of our nation's newspapers to a broadspectrum of farm, commodity and agribusiness groups, support for this proposal is strong. Most importantly, Freedom to Farm enjoys widespread support among individual farmers across the country who are fed up with convoluted government programs, and exploding government debt.  The following groups or individuals have endorsed either the Freedom to Farm Act or that concept as contained in H.R. 2854. I ask unanimous consent to insert in the record at this point a list of groups, organizations, and newspapers who have endorsed the Freedom to Farm concept:                      farm and trade organizations       American Farm Bureau Federation, National Corn Growers      Association, National Grain Trade Council, National Grain &      Feed Association, American Cotton Shippers, Iowa Farm Bureau      Federation, Iowa Corn Growers Association, Iowa Cattleman's      Association, Kansas Farm Bureau, Kansas Association of Wheat      Growers, Kansas Bankers Association, Kansas Grain & Feed      Association, Kansas Fertilizer & Chemical Association, North      Dakota Grain Growers Association, the Minnesota Association      of Wheat Growers, the National Turkey Federation, the      National Sunflower Association, National Food Processors'      Association, Agricultural Retailers Association, American      Feed Industry Association, American Frozen Food Institute,      Biscuit & Cracker Manufacturers' Association, National      Oilseed Processors Association, Millers' National Federation,      and the Coalition for a Competitive Food and Agricultural      System (representing 126 members).           public interest organizations and representatives       U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Citizens Against Government      Waste; John Frydenlund--The Heritage Foundation; Paul      Beckner--Citizens for a Sound Economy; David Keating--     National Taxpayers Union; Grover Norquist--Americans for Tax      Reform; Fran Smith--Consumer Alert; Ed Hudgins--The Cato      Institute; Jonathan Tolman--Competitive Enterprise Institute.                  a sampling of newspaper endorsements       Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Washington Post, Des      Moines Register, USA Today, Dallas Morning News, Chicago      Tribune, Minneapolis Star Tribune, Denver Post, Kansas City      Star, Wisconsin State Journal, The Daily Oklahoman, The      Wichita Eagle, The Indianapolis News, The Hartford Courant,      The Louisville Courier Journal, Washington Times, The Garden      City Telegram, The Manhattan (KS) Mercury.

Clearly the support for the concept of Freedom to Farm is widespread. But this bill is more than just Freedom To Farm. There are other major reforms contained in this package. This bill reforms the dairy industry. It instructs the Secretary to reduce the number of milk marketing orders in the nation. It phases out the price support. This bill provides regulatory relief for farmers in terms of conservation compliance and wetlands by injecting a little common sense into the process.  This bill has a very strong trade title. It has strong embargo protection language that reminds the President we can't have a market-oriented farm policy and allow the State Department to destroy those markets through foreign policy embargoes. The American farmer remembers the Soviet Grain Embargo of 1980--that nearly wiped out a generation of farmers. We can't go down that road again and this bill makes it more difficult for a President to choose that path.  This bill also contains the Commission on 21st Century Agriculture. As I have alluded to, this is a transition bill. But many farmers have raised the question of a transition of what? This bill charges the Commission to look at where we have been and where we should head and report to Congress on the appropriate role of the Federal government in production agriculture after 2002.  This bill also authorizes existing research programs for two years while Congress can undertake an extensive review of the $1.7 billion we spend on agricultural research. The House Agriculture Committee has sent out 57 questions to the research community stakeholders asking them for their guidance and input. On Wednesday, we began the hearing process that will hopefully lead to reform legislation that moves agricultural research in the direction of helping our farmers compete in a global marketplace against very tough competitors.  This bill takes a small stab at reforming the way USDA goes about buying its computers. In the past, the USDA through the Commodity Credit Corporation has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on computers and information systems, often without very much Congressional oversight. The result has been the various agencies of the USDA all have different computer systems with little ability to communicate. Several years ago the USDA embarked upon Infoshare supposedly to better manage its computer and information systems. The Clinton administration abandoned that and is proposing to spend $175 million next year on yet another computer purchasing extravaganza. This bill attempts to get a Congressional grip on those purchases and make them subject to greater Congressional review and accountability.  This bill reforms and streamlines the current rural development system by establishing the Rural Community Advancement Program [RCAP], which authorizes the Secretary to provide grants, direct and guaranteed loans and other assistance to meet rural development needs across the country. The new program provides greater flexibility, state and local decision making and a simplified, uniform application process.  In summary, this bill is truly reform. It moves agricultural program policy into the 21st Century. I urge my colleagues to support it.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Gunderson].  (
