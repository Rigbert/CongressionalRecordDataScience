Speaker, it is my great pleasure to congratulate St. Ann of the Dunes Roman Catholic Church, in Beverly Shores, Indiana, as it celebrated its 50th anniversary as a parish this past Sunday, September 10, 2000. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Father John B. Barasinski, pastor, on this joyous occasion.  Adjacent to the scenic Indiana Dunes National Park, St. Ann of the Dunes celebrated its half-century of history during a special mass last Sunday with Bishop Dale Melczek and the Reverend Charles Doyle, who presided over the church as its pastor for 30 of its 50 years.  From humble beginnings, St. Ann of the Dunes began as a nomadic church, taking up weekly residence wherever it could find space. Parishioners held services in houses, restaurants, and even a fire station, until 1954, when Helen Wood donated five acres that were once home to the Beverly Shores Golf Course. On this donated land, parishioners built a simple, rectangular church which served them well until 1971, when this building underwent extensive renovations and additions. St. Ann of the Dunes parish continues to be home to a close-knit congregation.  With many of its members descended from Lithuanians and Poles, evidence of Central European ethnic pride can be seen throughout the interior of the church. Numerous parishioners have used their artistic talents to beautify the facility. The altar and stained glass windows were hand-crafted and donated by church members. Parishioner and local artisan, Richard Kiebdaj, carved the candlesticks and baptismal font. He also created the main crucifix in the church, which is made from amber donated by various members of the parish.  Sharing its geography with the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, St. Ann of the Dunes' peaceful setting is inviting not only to the people of Beverly Shores and surrounding communities, but also to the visitors from the nearby state and national park campgrounds. During the summer months, parishioners and travelers come to celebrate mass outdoors in the beautiful and natural setting of the neighboring park amphitheater.  The generosity of the parishioners is typical of the care and dedication they show for the church and each other. The parishioners are committed to a tithing program, dedicating 10 percent of the weekly parish collection for local, national and international causes to assist people in need.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating the parish family of St. Ann of the Dunes, under the current guidance of Father John B. Barasinski, as they celebrate their 50th anniversary. All past and present parishioners and pastors should be proud of the numerous contributions they have made out of the love for their church and devotion to their community throughout the past 50 years.                          ____________________
