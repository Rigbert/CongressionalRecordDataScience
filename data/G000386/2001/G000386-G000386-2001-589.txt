 President, I would like to discuss legislation I'm offering today on behalf of myself and Senators Baucus, Brownback, Burns, Lugar, Roberts, Craig, Enzi, and Nelson from Nebraska this afternoon. It will assist millions of farmers across the nation. I've named the bill the Tax Empowerment and Relief for Farmers and Fishermen Act, or what I will refer to as TERFF.  I'm a farmer, like my father was before me. I understand farming and how policy decisions from Washington impact hardworking farmers, like my son Robin. Before I ran for elected office and after I leave, God willing, I'll still be farming. There is little that I feel more strongly about than providing the agriculture community potential to survive and thrive. As far as I'm concerned, agriculture is my ``terf'' and as long as I'm in this town, I'll do all I can to serve my friends and neighbors in the agriculture community.  This legislation has already been adopted by the Senate multiple times. In the midst of a serious downturn in the agriculture economy, it seems to me we ought to be doing everything we can to help farmers, and this would provide significant assistance.  For example, my agriculture tax package will include:  The Farm, Fish, and Ranch Risk Management Accounts--these farmer saving accounts would allow farmers to contribute up to 20 percent of their income in an account, and deduct it in the same year. Farm accounts would be a very important risk management tool that will help farmers put away money when there's actual income, so that, in the bad times, there will be a safety net. This measure has strong bipartisan support and was actually sent to President Clinton, who vetoed it.  Farmers who participate in the Conservation Reserve Program CRP, are unnecessarily struggling during tax season because of a recent case pushed by the IRS. The latest 6th Circuit court's ruling treats CRP payments as farm income subject to the additional self employment tax rate of 15 percent.  Senator Brownback has taken the lead on fixing this problem. This unfair tax not only ignores the intent of Congress in creating the CRP, it discourages farmers from using environmentally pro-active measures. At a time when farmers are struggling to regain their footing economically and do the right thing environmentally--it's important that Congress support them by upholding it promise on CRP.  Senator Lugar has led the effort to expand the current program where companies can donate to food banks, so that farmers and restaurants can also donate surplus food directly to needy food banks. This will be a win for the farmers and a big win for people who depend on food bank assistance.  This was also part of the vetoed tax bill. When we passed income averaging for farmers a few years ago, we neglected to take into account the problem of running into the alternative minimum tax, which many farmers are facing now. My bill will fix this growing problem.  My bill expands opportunities for beginning farmers who are in need of low interest rate loans for capital purchases of farmland and equipment.  Current law permits state authorities to issue tax exempt bonds and to lend the proceeds from the sale of the bonds to beginning farmers and ranchers to finance the cost of acquiring land, buildings and equipment used in a farm or ranch operation.  Unfortunately, aggie bonds are subjected to a volume cap and must compete with big industrial projects for bond allocation. Aggie bonds share few similarities to industrial revenue bonds and should not be subjected to the volume cap established for industrial revenue bonds.  Insufficient allocation of funding due to the volume cap limits the effectiveness of this program. We can't stand by and allow the next generation of farmers to lose an opportunity to participate in farming because of competition with industry for reduced interest loan rates.  Recently the IRS determined that some cooperatives should be exposed to a regular corporate tax due to the fact that they are using organic value-added practices rather than manufactured value-added practices. This is unfair, and needs to be fixed.  And of course my package wouldn't be complete without a provision leveling the playing field for ethanol producers.  The Small Ethanol Producer Credit will allow small cooperative producers of ethanol to be able to receive the same tax benefits as large companies. This provision provides cooperatives the ability to elect to pass through small ethanol producer credits to its patrons.  The ``TERFF'' package will do more to reform taxes for the American farmer than any other measure in recent memory. I'll be urging my colleagues to strongly support this measure. It's a bill that should have the unanimous support it enjoyed last congress on the Senate floor. As sure as I'm chairman of the Finance Committee, I will push to have this package passed into law during the 107th Congress. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of these three bills be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 312       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
