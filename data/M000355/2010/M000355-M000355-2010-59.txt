 President, for the last 2 years, Democratic leaders in Washington have spent virtually all of their time ticking off items on the liberal wish list while they have had the chance: government-run health care, a national energy tax, financial regulations, bigger government, bigger deficits, union bailouts, government takeovers. So here we are, with just a few weeks left in the session, and they are still at it.  Last month, the American people issued their verdict on the Democratic priorities. Democrats have responded by doubling down. For 2 years, they legislated as if they were not in the middle of a national jobs crisis, and now they are legislating as if they do not realize the government is about to run out of money and every taxpayer in America is about to get slammed with a giant tax hike.  With just a few weeks to go before the end of the session, Democrats continue to place their priorities over the priorities of the American people.
