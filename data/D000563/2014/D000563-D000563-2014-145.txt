Senator Landrieu, more than any Member of the Congress, has made adoption her cause. We are reminded by Senator Landrieu what a difference it makes in the lives of children and their families and the world. I want to commend her. Senator Landrieu is the best.  As the grandfather of an adopted child, I know the difference, the joy, the importance of that moment in our family life. I thank her for continuing this battle to make certain that we understand the importance of adoption.                          ____________________
