 President, I listened carefully to Senator Alexander's observations about our good friend, Howard Liebengood. I first met Howard as he was leaving the Senate. I came here the year Senator Baker retired, and Howard was on the way out. I wasn't sure that I would get to know him because everybody even before I got here--it seemed like everybody I ran into--knew Howard Liebengood. He was part of this institution. He was on the way out as Senator Baker left.  In thinking about the last 20 years--that was 20 years ago--Howard Liebengood really never left the Senate. He was always in this town available as a resource to all of us. I called upon him frequently over the entire period when he was technically not working at the Senate but was in town and providing his good advice to anyone who would ask.  I say to my friend, the junior Senator from Tennessee, and to the majority leader, you were lucky that Howard Liebengood was from Tennessee. I wish he had been from Kentucky. He was a wonderful man and a great part of this institution that we will not soon forget.  I yield the floor.
