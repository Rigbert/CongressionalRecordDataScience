 President, I rise to introduce a bill on the Internal Revenue Code. From time to time we need to change the Internal Revenue Code, particularly when it deals with agriculture. However, there may be some people listening who do not understand agriculture. They may see these efforts as doing something special for farmers. I want to clarify today that I am a person who comes from the school of thought that every penny of legal tax that is owed the Federal Government should be paid. But I think, also, we have a responsibility, as Representatives of the people, to make sure that we balance taxpayers' compliance with taxpayers' rights.  The legislation I am introducing today is centered on a proposition that has been the law for approximately 40 years. It proscribes that most farm landlords, just like small business people and other commercial landlords, should not have to pay self-employment tax on cash rent income. For 40 years it has been that way for farm people and city people alike. But in 1995, there was an Arkansas Federal tax court case that said the IRS could take other expansive factors into consideration. As a result of that tax case, the IRS decided to issue a related technical advice memorandum. These are widely deemed to be IRS policy statements on the law. As a result, many farm landlords are now treated differently from commercial and other city landlords. Consequently, farmers and retired farmers now find themselves paying 15.3 percent self-employment tax on cash rent.  So, I say to the IRS, as I give an explanation for my legislation this morning: Don't try to game the system. The law remains what people have counted on for 40 years. Unless there is an act of Congress, you ought to respect history before you change the rules. Obviously, the test of time ought to prove the taxpayer was right and the IRS was wrong, particularly since there now is a difference between the farm sector and the city sector.  The correct rationale is simple, the self employment tax applies to income from labor or employment. Income from cash rents represents the value of ownership or equity in land, not labor or employment. Therefore, the self employment tax should not ordinarily apply to income from cash rents.  So, along with Senator Grams of Minnesota, I am introducing this bill so farmers and retired farmers are not going to be encroached upon by the IRS and the Tax Code as a result of this Arkansas Federal tax court case and the IRS technical advice memorandum. The IRS has thus, through this court case and broadened by its own pronouncement, introduced a new barrier to the family farmer. Our legislation would remove this new IRS barrier so that farm families and retired farmers can continue to operate.  Specifically, our legislation would clarify that when the IRS is applying the self-employment tax to the cash rent farm leases, it should limit its inquisition to the lease agreement. This is not an expansion of the law for the taxpayers. Rather, it is a narrowing of an antitaxpayer expansion initiated by the Internal Revenue Service. The tax law does not ordinarily require cash rent landlords in cities to pay the self-employment tax. Indeed, cash rent farm landlords are the only ones occasionally required to pay the tax. This is due to a 40-year-old exception that allowed the retired farmers of the late 1950's to become vested in the Social Security system.  However, the law originally imposed the tax on farm landlords only when their lease agreements with their renters required the landlord to participate in the operation of the farm and in the farming of the land.  Forty years later and we are here today, the IRS has expanded the application of the self-employment tax for farmland owners. Now the Tax Court has told the IRS that in one particular instance, the IRS could look beyond the lease agreement. On this very limited authority, the IRS has unilaterally expanded the one court case even further so it now approximates a national tax policy.  Our legislation clarifies that the IRS should examine only the lease agreement. Thus, it would preserve the pre-1996 status quo. We want to preserve the historical self-employment tax treatment of farm rental agreements, equating them with landlords in small businesses and commercial properties within the cities. The 1957 tax law was designed to benefit retired farmers of that generation so that they would qualify for Social Security.  So, obviously, those persons of the 1950's have all since passed from the scene. Their children and grandchildren are now the victims of this IRS expansion of their old rule. Congress does not intend that farm owners be treated differently from other real estate owners, other than as they have been historically. We need the clarity provided in our legislation in order to turn back an improper, unilateral, and targeted IRS expansion of old tax law. In other words, I see this legislation as removing this new IRS barrier to the family farm and the American dream.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of our bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 529       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
