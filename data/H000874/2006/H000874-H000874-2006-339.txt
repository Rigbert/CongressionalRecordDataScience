 Mr. Leader, I don't want to end the week on an unhappy note, but you and I had discussions in these colloquies the last 2 weeks in a row. After the tax reconciliation bill was reported out, I asked Mr. Rangel had he been included in the conferences in any meaningful way. It was his view that he had not. You had made assurances that would happen; I don't mean that you could guarantee that it would happen.  I will tell my friend that the ranking member of the committee does not believe there was meaningful participation by the minority in the consideration of that bill which obviously was a bill of some significant import.  I yield to my friend.
