 President, it is with sadness that I rise today to note the passing of one of southeastern Kentucky's most notable citizens, Mr. Harry Morgan Hoe. Mr. Hoe was a decorated World War II veteran who fought in the Battle of the Bulge under the command of GEN George Patton. He recalled once what General Patton said to his men then:  ``Half of you guys are not going home, you know that, don't you? You're over here to take that hill, and if you don't take it, I want to see the truckload of dog tags that show me that you proved yourself.''  Well, Harry Hoe did return home, after fighting in five major European campaigns, and he certainly did prove himself. He received the Silver Star for gallantry in action, the Bronze Star, the Oak Leaf Cluster for heroic action and the French Liberation Appreciation Medal.  But Mr. Hoe's heroic service in World War II is just the beginning of his incredible life story. He would go on to meet the love of his life, his wife Mary, in college and return to his hometown of Middlesboro to work in the family foundry business. He would be elected to the State legislature, invest countless hours in volunteer work and community service, and become a role model for me and many others for his leadership, his humility and his dedication to the people of the Bluegrass State.  With his wife Mary, who passed away some time ago, Harry had three children and several grandchildren. I wish to offer my greatest condolences to the Hoe family and all of Harry's many friends who are mourning his loss.  Mr. President, a wonderful article that appeared today in the Middlesboro Daily News tells the story of Mr. Harry Hoe's life and career. It is a fitting tribute to a fine man and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.       There being no objection, the article was ordered to be      printed in the Record, as follows:                   [From the Middlesboro Daily News,                              May 10, 2011]                    Middlesboro Loses `Crown Jewel'                    (By Lorie Settles/Staff Writer)       Middlesboro.--Many in Middlesboro are mourning the passing      of one of the city's most influential people--Harry Morgan      Hoe.       ``The city has lost one of its crowned jewels,'' lamented      longtime friend and businessman, Dewey Morgan. ``He and Mary      Bob (his     wife) were always generous and welcoming to everyone. They      were people people.''       Hoe spent his life serving his community and his nation. A      World War II veteran, Hoe fought in five major European      campaigns including the Battle of the Bulge, and served under      the infamous General George Patton.       Hoe spoke of his experience under Patton in a Daily News      interview in 2010.       ``He said: Half of you guys are not going home, you know      that don't you? You're over here to take that hill and if you      don't take it, I want to see the truckload of dog tags that      show me that you proved yourself.' So we fought. We were his      soldiers--that was all we knew to do,'' he remembered.       Dewey Morgan also remarked on Hoe's service to the nation.       ``The thing a lot of people might not know about Harry is      that he was a hero in the Battle of the Bulge. He was a      member of the American force that pushed Hitler back into      Germany. And for the rest of his life, he suffered with his      feet that had been frozen during the battle,'' Morgan      reported.       Hoe was decorated with the Silver Star for gallantry in      action, the Bronze Star, the Oak Leaf Cluster for heroic      action and the French Liberation Appreciation Medal--all      before reaching the age of 19.       Hoe's achievements only increased from there. In 1953,      Harry Morgan Hoe was honored as one of the three Outstanding      Young Men of Kentucky. Hoe worked as the Director of the      Kentucky Utilities company for 19 years, and was honored by      the company with a $100,000 donation that was awarded to      Clear Creek Baptist Bible College. He served as a board      member of the college for 20 years and as Chairman for two      terms.       In 1953, Hoe became the founder of the first racially      integrated Little League Baseball organization south of the      Ohio River. He served as the Middlesboro League's president      for seven years.       Hoe worked as General Chairman for the dedication of the      Cumberland Gap National Park in 1959. He was the Director of      Kentucky Mountain Laurel Festival Board for more than 50      years and served twice as President.       Harry also acted as Chairman of the Board of Directors of      Kentuckians for Better Transportation and Associated      Industries in Kentucky. He spent two three-year terms as      Director of the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce.       In 1964, Harry Hoe decided to try his hand at politics. He      was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives, where      he served for six years. The passage of the drunk driving      bill that he authored in 1968 was the highlight of his      political career.       Harry was the Minority Whip and the Assistant Minority      Floor Leader. He spent twelve years serving on the Kentucky      Republican State Central Committee and was inducted into the      Republican 5th Congressional District Hall of Fame by      Congressman Hal Rogers.       As an eyewitness to paramount moments in the history of the      U.S., the state of Kentucky, and the city of Middlesboro, Hoe      served as a reference guide to many who knew him.       ``He was a walking history book,'' said friend Lawrence      Tuck. ``He was a very special friend to my wife Barbara and      myself. He helped so many people and we will miss him so      much.''       Tuck said that Hoe had attended last Wednesday's Kiwanis      meeting, a club he was a member of since 1949. He also      attended Sunday services at First Baptist Church where he had      served as a Deacon, Sunday School teacher, and choir member.       Hoe was additionally a lifetime member of the Salvation      Army Advisory Board and was awarded the Salvation Army      William Booth Award, the highest honor given by the charity,      after serving as Chairman.       Many also know Hoe for his work with the family business,      the J.R. Hoe and Sons foundry.       Hoe was preceded in death by his beloved wife, Mary, whom      he met while the two were students at the University of      Tennessee. He referred to her as his ``secret weapon'' in the      Daily News interview. The couple had three children together      and several grandchildren.                          ____________________
