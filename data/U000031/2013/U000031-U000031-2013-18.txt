Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 1900, a commonsense, bipartisan bill that is going to help build the architecture of abundance that we need to fully realize the benefits of our American energy boom.  Until a few years ago, our Nation was facing a very critical shortage of natural gas, and I will remind us that policymakers in the seventies, eighties, and nineties never envisioned shale gas. Today, technological innovations like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have made the U.S. the number one gas-producing nation in the world.  Our overall energy landscape has changed dramatically in just a short period of time. It is not only rewriting the economic outlook that we have as a Nation but also beginning to change the geopolitical nature of global energy, as we have heard from nations around the world seeking access to United States supplies to help wean them off of regions like Russia and the Middle East.  Today, we face a new challenge: how to overcome government-imposed roadblocks to building the infrastructure and unleashing the innovation necessary to harness our new energy abundance. As energy production grows across the U.S., building the infrastructure to move these supplies to consumers is emerging as the real challenge of this century. With all of our abundance in natural gas, it is simply unacceptable that there are still regions in the country where lower prices are being constrained by a lack of pipelines because of regulatory delays. America's rich natural gas resources should continue fueling both job creation and economic growth, but we cannot fulfill that potential unless we ensure businesses and manufacturers have access to this affordable and reliable clean energy.  I commend Representative Pompeo for introducing H.R. 1900 as a remedy for this problem.  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.
