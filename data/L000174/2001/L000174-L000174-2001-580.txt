President, we owe the millions of small business owners across America, who are the backbone of our economy, adequate protection from unforeseen bankruptcy losses. I urge my colleagues to support the Leahy small business amendment to provide small business creditors with a simple priority in bankruptcy proceedings. They deserve it.  Remember what this does: It gives small business creditors priority over larger for-profit business creditors in the order of distribution under chapters 11, 12, and 13 of the bankruptcy code. It defines small business as any business with 25 or fewer full-time employees. That same definition of small business is already used in the bill for small business creditors. It does not affect the bill's provisions giving top priority in bankruptcy distributions to child support and alimony payments.  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.
