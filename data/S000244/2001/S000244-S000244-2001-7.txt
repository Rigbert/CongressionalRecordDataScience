 Madam Speaker, I think it is important that we get on the subject of what is before the House tonight; that is, legislation that does a number of important things: tightening up our visa issuing system; attempting to make sure that the visas and passports used by people entering this country are those that were issued to them; and to provide biometric information and various other types of antifraud devices.  I think it is important to point out that we provide more money for additional INS inspectors and investigators, and most importantly, provide a pay raise for them.  Since 9-11, I have made several visits to border areas. I have been to San Diego, I have been to Detroit, and I have been to the Miami airport. At each one of these stops, I have specifically requested to meet with representatives of the unions that represent the border patrol and INS inspectors, and I have heard again and again that good people are leaving because they can go to someplace else in law enforcement and get paid a lot more.  As a result, the turnover and the training time of those people who are actually on the borders enforcing the laws and protecting the people of this country becomes greater and greater. So this bill deals with those issues.  Again, I regret that the jurisdictional disputes prevent us from dealing with the aircraft and ship manifests and the chronic shortage of Customs inspectors, and once again, I urge the other committees of jurisdiction to promptly bring legislation before the House to deal with those issues.  With respect to what I have heard from the last several speakers, I will state categorically that this is not a war on immigrants, it is a war on terrorists. Immigrants have made this country what it is. With the exception of the descendents of Native Americans, all of our forefathers and foremothers were immigrants; granted that there were different waves of immigration from different parts of the world, but immigrants came to this country because of the economic opportunity and the freedom that we provide.  What we want to do is to make sure that the immigration is done pursuant to law, and to provide the proper documentation so that people who are here legally can go to work and help themselves and their families and our country.  Next year, we will be dealing with the restructuring and reorganization of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which is the most dysfunctional agency in the Federal Government.                              {time}  1815  Finally, with respect to 245(i), this House has voted in favor of extending 245(i). The chairman of the Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Gekas) and I introduced H.R. 1885 on May 17, 2001. We brought it before the House under suspension of the rules four days later on May 21, 2001. And on a roll call of 336 to 43, the House passed the extension of 245(i).  Now, that bill provided an extension four months after the date of enactment. And as is the case with a lot ofmeritorious legislation, the other body did not deal with it promptly.  Now, I hope the time has come when we will be able to bring another 245(i) bill to the floor. But I do not think it accurately represents what 336 of us did on May 21, to say that we have turned our backs on those families. There were only 43 no votes on May 21. And I think the vast majority, the 336 of us who voted yes, will have our day in court some time in the future and a 245(i) extension that is fair to all will be sent to the President of the United States. I urge an aye vote on H.R. 3525.
