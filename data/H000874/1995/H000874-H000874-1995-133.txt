Speaker, as one who represents 56,000 Federal employees and therefore has always been concerned about the failure of this Congress and the President to do their work in a timely fashion, causing the Government to temporarily shut down, I rise to express once again my deep regret that the Congress of the United States has not done its job.  The fact of the matter is, the only reason there needs to be a continuing resolution signed today or passed today is because we have not done our work, period. All the other rhetoric about balanced budgets, all the other rhetoric about the politics in the White House, are, frankly, not accurate.  There are nine appropriation bills that neither the House nor the Senate have finally acted upon. Therefore, this crisis could have been averted had we done our work.                          ____________________
