In particular, I recognize the enormous contributions of the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin; the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Edwards; and the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran. Without their help, we would not have been able to craft such an effective bill. I am very grateful for their assistance and support.  We have heard very eloquent statements from a number of Senators today about the need for this legislation. In closing this debate, let me quote from a 74-year-old woman who wrote to me about how deceptive sweepstakes put her deeply into debt. In her letter, she said:       My only source of income is a monthly Social Security check      totaling $893. I estimate that I have spent somewhere between      $10,000 and $20,000 in the last 19 years. What money I did      not have, I borrowed from my daughter who is now responsible      for my total financial support. I am deeply in financial      debt. Their mailings were worded in such a way that I was      certain I was going to win anywhere from $1 million to $10      million. I truly wish I could recoup the moneys that I      squandered in the hope that a real payoff would come my way.  Unfortunately, it is too late for this woman, but today the Senate can act to avoid financial hardship, wasted savings, and a great deal of heartache for countless other vulnerable citizens by passing this legislation.  It is my hope that we will have a very strong vote today and that it will prompt the House to act and we will see this important legislation signed into law before we adjourn this year.  I yield back the remainder of my time. I ask for the yeas and nays. I think they have already been ordered, but if they have not, I request the yeas and nays.
