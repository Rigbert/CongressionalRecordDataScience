 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn under the provisions of H. Con. Res. 21 until 1 p.m. on Monday, January 31. I further ask that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved, and there then be a period of morning business with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.
