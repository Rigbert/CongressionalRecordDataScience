Speaker, I rise today to congratulate McArdle Printing Co. on it's 50th anniversary of outstanding service. McArdle Printing represents what is right in America. It is a company rooted in family, solidified by a commitment to excellence and achievement. This company, which is in my district, prides itself on a fast turnaround and a high quality product, and for 50 years the McArdle Printing Co. has given it's customers exactly what they set out to provide.  In 1947, Mr. Walter McArdle bought the company formerly known as the Business Printing Co. In the years to follow, McArdle Printing began to expand externally as well as internally always keeping in sight the idea of a quick turnover rate. As the company grew due to their high quality of service they were forced to look for a larger facility. They relocated multiple times before they built their own 138,000 square-foot facility in Upper Marlboro, MD, where they now employ 215 people on three shifts.  Many companies lose sight of their mission as they begin to expand and evolve. This did not hold true for McArdle Printing. They continue to grow because of the trust their customers have in the service this company is able to give. The success in providing this kind of customer service cannot be achieved without an energetic, dedicated, and diligent group of employees. Without the hard work of the 215 employees the McArdle Printing Co. would not be able to live up to its mission.  Much of the company's success may also be contributed to the strong leadership of such presidents as the founder, Mr. Walter McArdle, his brother, Mr. Edward McArdle who took over in 1980 and his predecessor Mr. Joseph J. Fantozzi. Mr. Fantozzi was the first non-family member to take over the company in 1985 and still presides as president today. With these men at the helm, the company went from producing annual revenues of $1 million in 1947 to $26 million in 1996. This increase was a reflection of both ingenuity and customer satisfaction.  Mr. Speaker, McArdle Printing has a direct impact on the productivity of our Federal Government as well as the private sector. By representing such major organizations as the American Bar Association, the International Monetary Fund, U.S. Healthcare, the National Journal, as well as the United Nations, the company affects people in all walks of life. According to the March 1997 issue of Southern Graphics, G. William Teare Jr., vice president of marketing for McArdle claims, ``We are information printers. We print time-sensitive information like daily reports, weekly newsletters, financial printing, and health care information printing. The key to what we do, our niche, is the time sensitivity of what we have, which means fast turnaround.'' For 50 years McArdle Printing has filled this niche with high quality products and fast, professional service.  Mr. Speaker and colleagues, please join with me in congratulating the McArdle Printing Co. on 50 years of outstanding service and wishing them luck as they continue to serve our communities and country.                          ____________________
