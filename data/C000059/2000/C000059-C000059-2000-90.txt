Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and to express my full support for H.R. 4576, the Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2001. This important legislation honors the men and women serving in our Nation's armed services. I commend the gentleman from California (Mr. Lewis) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murtha) for their leadership and commitment in addressing the needs of our service men and women and their families.  This bill enhances recruiting, retention and quality-of-life programs. It also includes a 3.7 percent pay raise and an additional $64 million for basic housing allowances. It also addresses procurement shortfalls that our military has suffered since the Kosovo campaign.  In particular, I am thankful for the gentleman from California's support for metrology and calibration accounts and the C-17 Globemaster funding levels. I look forward to working with the gentleman to explore the active associate wing concept for any additional C-17s procured.  Mr. Speaker, I believe this bill is good for the U.S. service men and women, good for the national security needs of our country, and a sound investment for the people of the United States. Once again I would like to thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Lewis) and the staff of the Subcommittee on Defense of the Committee on Appropriations for their long hours and dedication. I know my district and the Nation's service men and women are better off because of their commitment. I support the rule and the bill.
