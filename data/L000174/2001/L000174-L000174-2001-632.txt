President, I thank my friend from South Dakota. He is one of the most thoughtful Members of this body. I know he has spent a great deal of time researching this. I know on an issue such as this, when it was time to make his decision, there were only two elements that totally influenced him--his conscience and his oath of office. I know my friend from South Dakota upheld them both.  Mr. President, I do not see anybody on the Republican side at the moment.
