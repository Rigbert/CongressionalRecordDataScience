 President, for the information of all of our colleagues, including our newest colleague from Alabama, who is going to have a very long first day here, if all time is used postcloture on the Price nomination, the Senate will have two votes at 2 a.m. Senators should be prepared to stay in session and take those votes tonight. If an agreement is reached to yield back time and to cast those votes earlier, we will notify Members the moment such an agreement might be reached.  I thank my friend from Maryland.  I yield the floor.
