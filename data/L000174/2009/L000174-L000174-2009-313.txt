President, I am happy to have this opportunity to honor the many accomplishments and contributions of my good friend, Marilyn Bergman. Marcelle and I have had the pleasure of knowing both Marilyn and her husband Alan for years. They are as accomplished songwriters as I have ever met. For the past 15 years, Marilyn has served as the distinguished president and chairman of the board of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, a position never before held by a woman.  Marilyn's list of achievements is vast and impressive. Her work as a champion of the arts has brought about many important changes. She was instrumental in developing ``A Bill of Rights for Songwriters and Composers''--an initiative designed to raise public awareness of the tremendous contribution and rights of those who make music. In addition, she has gone to great lengths to support and promote the work of female songwriters.  This month, Marilyn will step down from her position as chairman of the board of ASCAP and will move on to the next phase of her career. I know that she will bring the same commitment to excellence and vitality to all of her future endeavors and Marcelle and I wish her only the best.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of an April 8, 2009 ASCAP press release describing Marilyn's work be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From an American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers Press                         Release on Apr. 8, 2009] Marilyn Bergman to Step Down as President and Chairman of ASCAP After                                 15 Years       Los Angeles/New York: April 8, 2009: Three-time Academy      Award-winning songwriter Marilyn Bergman today announced her      decision to step down as President and Chairman of the Board      of ASCAP (the American Society of Composers, Authors and      Publishers). Her successor will be elected by the ASCAP Board      of Directors during their next meeting later this month.       Bergman was the first woman to be elected to the ASCAP      Board of Directors and was named President and Chairman of      the Board in 1994. She will continue to serve as an active      Board Member.       Commenting on her decision, Bergman said: ``I am grateful      to have had the honor of serving as the President and      Chairman of ASCAP for 15 years, and am exceedingly proud of      all that was accomplished during my tenure. I will continue      to be a passionate advocate for all music creators through my      work on the ASCAP Board of Directors. But in terms of the      Presidency itself, I see that now is the right time to step      down.''       Bergman noted that she and her writing partner and husband,      Academy Award-winning songwriter Alan Bergman, have a number      of new projects in the works which require her focus. ``Alan      has always been supportive of the time that my ASCAP      Presidency required. But with so much exciting work before      us, I feel it's time that I fully devote myself to my first      calling: writing. So I look forward to shifting my energy      back to our work, while having the privilege to continue to      serve ASCAP and my fellow music creators.''       The Bergmans have just completed work on Steven      Soderbergh's film, The Informant, with composer Marvin      Hamlisch, and are currently working on two musical theatre      projects, one with Marvin and one with Michel Legrand. They      are also at work on Visions of America: A Photo Symphony      Celebrating the Sites and Songs of Democracy with renowned      photographer Joseph Sohm and composer Roger Kellaway. This      was premiered at the Kimmel Center-Verizon Hall on January      25, 2009 in Philadelphia with Peter Nero and the Philly Pops.       A Strong Legacy of Advocacy, Education and Growth       Bergman's 15-year tenure as President and Chairman of the      Board of ASCAP was marked by a series of noteworthy      achievements, all of which have had a positive and lasting      impact on music creators.       As a passionate voice for the rights of music creators,      Bergman has a strong presence on Capitol Hill. She helped      lead ASCAP to several major legislative victories, including      most notably the Supreme Court's decision in 2003 to uphold      the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998, which      extended copyright protection an extra 20 years--to the life      of the author plus 70 years. Other legislative highlights      include:       Helming ASCAP through the modernization of the Federal      consent decree that governs ASCAP's operations.       Leading ASCAP's lobbying effort that helped secure the      passage and signing of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act      in 1998--bringing the U.S. into line with World Intellectual      Property Organization treaties and strengthening music      copyrights on the Internet.       Serving on the National Information Infrastructure Advisory      Council (NIIAC) from 1994     to 1995, at the request of Vice President Al Gore. Serving      two terms (from 1994 to 1998) as President of CISAC, the      International Confederation of Performing Right Societies.       Most recently, Bergman played a key role in the launch of A      Bill of Rights for Songwriters and Composers, an ASCAP      advocacy and awareness-building initiative designed to remind      the public, the music industry and Members of Congress of the      central role and rights of those who create music.       Bergman was also instrumental in the launch of the ASCAP I      Create Music EXPO, the premier conference for songwriters,      composers and producers. The 4th annual EXPO is set to take      place at the Renaissance Hollywood Hotel in Los Angeles,      April 23-25, 2009.       She has also been a strong supporter of educating young      people about the creative process and the rights inherent in      the creation of music. Programs established under her      leadership include:       The ASCAP Foundation Children Will Listen Program--created      in honor of ASCAP member and musical theatre great Stephen      Sondheim (West Side Story, Gypsy!, Pacific Overtures, A      Little Night Music) to provide the musical theatre experience      to a generation of students who might not otherwise have this      opportunity.       The ASCAP Foundation Creativity in the Classroom Program--     designed to help students recognize their own creative work,      to understand their rights as owners of intellectual property      and to respect the ethics of protecting the creative property      of others.       The Donny the Downloader Experience in partnership with i-     SAFE Inc., the worldwide leader in Internet safety      education--an interactive school assembly program aimed at      educating middle school students on what it means to be a      music creator and the real cost of music piracy.       The Junior ASCAP Members (J.A.M.) Program in partnership      with MENC: The National Association for Music Education--     created to support and nurture music students, and to educate      them on the value of music and the importance of intellectual      property rights.       She also supported the development of The ASCAP Foundation/     Lilith Fair Songwriting Contest--a national competition      designed to encourage unsigned women songwriters, co-     sponsored by The ASCAP Foundation and Lilith Fair.       ``From the moment she assumed the role of President and      Chairman of the Board, Marilyn worked tirelessly on behalf of      our membership to the benefit of all music creators,'' said      John LoFrumento, CEO of ASCAP. ``She has been tremendously      effective in helping ASCAP anticipate the changing needs of      our members--particularly given the immense shifts that have      occurred in music, technology and society as a whole over the      past decade. I will greatly miss the insights and      collaborative spirit that she brought to our working      relationship. But I am comforted to know that Marilyn will      remain a strong and active presence on our Board of      Directors.''       Bergman presided over the largest expansion of ASCAP      membership in the history of the organization--growing from      55,000 when she assumed the Presidency in 1994 to a current      membership of more than 350,000 music creators.                          ____________________
