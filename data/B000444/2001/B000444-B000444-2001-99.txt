 Res. 148  Whereas the average family in the United States spends more than $1,300 annually on utility bills.       Whereas that figure represents nearly 15 percent of a low-     income family's income and could approach 18 percent as fuel      costs steadily rise;       Whereas the Weatherization Assistance Program (referred to      in this resolution as the ``Program''), by using Federal,      State, local, and private dollars, benefits households and      communities across the Nation by providing cost-effective,      energy-efficient retrofits to homes occupied by low-income      families;       Whereas the average energy cost savings for each home that      is weatherized is more than $250 annually, allowing families      to spend the saved money on groceries, doctor bills,      prescriptions, and other needs, thereby making them more      self-sufficient;       Whereas carbon dioxide emissions are reduced by an average      of 1 ton per weatherized household, reducing pollution levels      in our air;       Whereas 52 jobs are created within the Nation's communities      for each $1,000,000 invested in weatherization;       Whereas for every $1 invested by the Department of Energy      in the Program, another $3.39 is leveraged from other      sources;       Whereas the Program works with public and private partners      to help reduce the energy burden of the Nation's low-income      families and promote the benefits of weatherization to all      people in the Nation;       Whereas people across the Nation should become more aware      of the importance of energy conservation, pollution      reduction, and safer homes; and       Whereas a concerted public information campaign will help      get the weatherization message to the people in our Nation:      Now, therefore, be it       Resolved,     SECTION 1. NATIONAL RESPONSE TO WEATHERIZATION.       (a) Designation.--The Senate--       (1) designates October 30, 2001, as ``National      Weatherization Day'';       (2) encourages families to learn about the benefits of      weatherizing their homes, including energy conservation,      money savings, and safer homes for their children; and       (3) encourages community action and service agencies,      Federal, State, and local government agencies, and private      sector partners to work together to promote the positive      aspects of weatherizing our Nation's housing stock.       (b) Proclamation.--The Senate requests that the President      issue a proclamation calling upon the Federal, State, local,      and private sector leaders of our Nation to observe and      promote National Weatherization Day with appropriate      partnerships, activities, and ceremonies.
