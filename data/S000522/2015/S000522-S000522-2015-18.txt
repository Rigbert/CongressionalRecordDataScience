Burma is a problem; Rohingya Muslims face problems. In Pakistan, as we all know, there are problems; in Iran, not just with the Baha'i who are persecuted again and have been facing that with unrelenting pressure, but also other Christians who live there and other Muslims.  Mr. Speaker, the need for USCIRF is clear, and I hope all Members will support this important human rights legislation.  I thank the Chair, and I thank my friend for yielding.
