Speaker, I rise today to recognize Salvatore and Myra Raspa of St. Mary's County, Maryland for their leadership as outstanding educators and service to their community.  In 1961, Sal was employed as a science and chemistry teacher at Great Mills High School. After teaching for seven years, he was appointed Assistant Principal and in 1978 became Principal of Great Mills High School. He later became Supervisor of Instruction for Science and Health with the Department of Curriculum and Instruction, St. Mary's County Public Schools. He was also Supervisor of Transportation and Assistant Superintendent before his retirement from the St. Mary's County Public Schools in 1999 after 38 years of service.  Dr. Raspa was dedicated to his profession and accordingly received numerous awards and commendations such as recognition from the VFW for Outstanding Achievement and Exceptional Leadership in the Community, the Governor's Citation for Outstanding Commitment to Public Education, recognition from the Naval Air Warfare Center and The Maryland Science Center, and the Joint Board of Science and Engineering Education Award as an Outstanding Educator. He also received the Governor's Award for Voluntary Service in Prevention of Drugs and Alcohol as well as the American Legion Award for Contribution to Youth in St. Mary's County and special recognition from Lions Clubs International for Promoting Drug Awareness Programs--Skills for Adolescence.  Myra Raspa began her teaching career as an English and Publications teacher at Leonardtown High School, where she was responsible for publishing two major publications: The History and Culture of the Chesapeake Bay and The Heritage/History of The St. Mary's County Fair. During her 20 years with the St. Mary's County Public Schools, she also received several awards and citations, such as the Citation from the Southern Maryland Legislative Delegation for ``Outstanding Educator and for Contribution to Youth'', the Governor's Citation for ``Excellence in Education'', Recognition from Comptroller Louis L. Goldstein for Exemplary Publication, The Heritage, Citation from St. Mary's County Commissioners for ``Outstanding Contribution to Students of St. Mary's County'', St. Mary's Board of Education Certification of Recognition for ``Outstanding Contribution to Student Achievement'', St. Mary's Award to Recognize Talent in Teachers, The St. Mary's Council on Children and Youth ``Outstanding Contribution to Youth'', recognition from Dr. David W. Hornbeck, State Superintendent of Schools for ``Outstanding Educator'', and National Council of Teachers of English for ``Outstanding Publication'', and a Commendation from Senator C. Bernard Fowler, Senator of Maryland, for ``Exemplary Contribution to Youth,'' and a Commendation from the Environmental Matters Committee for ``Excellence in Education.'' She is currently an Instructional Resource with the Department of Curriculum and Instruction with a focus on high schools.  Mr. Speaker, dedicated educators like Sal and Myra Raspa are today's hope for a better tomorrow. They are the role models to whom students and others within their workplace and their community look for guidance and support. By pointing students in the right direction, such educators contribute to the future accomplishments of their students.  They have applied this commitment to molding children's future to their own home, as well. Myra and Sal's children are Sal, Jr., Joseph--deceased, Scott, Angela, Victor, and Anthony. Myra Raspa had to undergo a major juggling act between continuing her education and taking her children to Boy Scouts, band practice, football practice, wrestling practice, swimming lessons, and so forth. All the children attended Great Mills High School and were given their diplomas by their father during his tenure as Principal there. All are college graduates and are successful and arecontributing to society. Sal and Myra consider their children their major accomplishments.  As busy as Sal and Myra were, they still took the time to find a way to involve the entire family in a tobacco farming business for a number of years when the children were teenagers, even venturing into an experimental curing process which was monitored by the University of Maryland. The Raspas also operated an air conditioning and refrigeration business at one time.  The Raspas have constantly demonstrated their commitment to service through their participation in other civic activities in St. Mary's County. Sal served four terms on the Democratic Central Committee and served as chair for two terms. He belongs to the Lexington Park Lions Club and received the Melvin Jones Award in 2002, which is the highest award given by Lions Club International. He was elected to the St. Mary's County Board of Education in 2002 and currently holds the position of Vice Chairman.  Myra has been active on many county and state committees including the State Department of Education Standards Setting Committee for English; the Maryland Assessment Consortium; the Gifted and Talented Task Force; Integrated Support Team; PreK-12 Intervention Task Force; Project SMART Grant Advisory Committee; MSPAP MEGA-TASK Developer; Content Coordinator for English/Language Arts/Writing MEGA-TASK, Maryland State Department of Education; and TASK-WRITER for High School Assessments, Maryland State Department.  Both Sal and Myra Raspa are still very active in St. Mary's County and continue to advocate for children. They believe in contributing for the betterment of the community. Mr. Speaker, on this day I wish Dr. and Mrs. Raspa well in their future pursuits.                          ____________________
