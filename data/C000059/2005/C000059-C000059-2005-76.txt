Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Linda Graham Ward, who retired on June 17,2005 after thirty three years as a teacher in the Ocean View School District of Huntington Beach, California.  Linda G. Ward is a fantastic teacher who truly cares for her students. She has dedicated her 33 years of teaching to improving the quality of life of her students by teaching them Fitness for Life.

She inspired her students to go on to become Olympians, professional athletes, and teachers.  Linda was born and raised in EI Centro, California. Her love of learning lead her to the University of Southern California where she earned her teaching credential in 1972. That fall she began her long career with the Ocean View School District teaching Physical Education and Science.
