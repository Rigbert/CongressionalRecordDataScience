Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr. Speaker, if the House would read the constitutional amendment, they would find that the gentleman from Virginia, with all due respect, is misinterpreting what is in the amendment. The amendment says that a loophole can be closed by a majority vote if the money that is raised as a result of closing the loophole is used to provide tax relief for the American people elsewhere. But where the two-thirds vote comes in is if the loophole is closed and the money is raised and is used to finance increased spending.  So what this Tax Limitation Constitutional Amendment encourages is using the money from closed loopholes to provide tax relief for the American people, rather than financing a spending spree by the Congress of the United States. I think that that is entirelylogical. What the amendment does is it says if you want to spend the money from the loophole, it is two-thirds; if you want to give it in tax relief, it is a majority.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Jones).
