 President, I wish to say a few words of thanks this morning to a member of the Senate family who is leaving us today. After 44 years of government service, including 32 here in the Senate, Carl Fritter has decided it is time to go.  Carl has been a real friend to my office over the years, through his work in the Office of Conservation and Preservation, and we are sorry to see him leave us. But before he does, I want to say how grateful we are for his outstanding work over the years.  Carl learned the art of bookbinding in an apprentice program at the Government Printing Office many years ago. He says he never saw himself as a bookbinder, but after working outside one January during the construction of the Kennedy Center, he started thinking about getting a job indoors, and his supervisors over at the GPO gave him the opportunity. Carl would learn his trade from bookbinders from all over the world, each of whom taught him different techniques, which he put to good use in the Senate Library for many years.  In 1990, the Office of Conservation and Preservation was created. Carl was named Director 4 years later.  In addition to binding and repairing books, Carl taught himself a lot of other crafts. I am told he makes some pretty amazing decorative boxes, bowls, gavels, and books. One of Carl's most memorable projects was a fall-down box that he built as a gift for Margaret Thatcher. It was a box that opened to reveal a plate in the middle, with two congressional resolutions on either side. I am sure Prime Minister Thatcher loved it.  Carl, thank you for lending us your talents for so long and for giving so much of your life to this institution. We wish you and Bunny all the best in your retirement. I am sure you will enjoy passing down your skills to your grandkids. They will have a great teacher. But the entire Senate community will miss your craftsmanship and your commitment to excellence, and we will miss your friendship.  Carl, thank you very much.                          ____________________
