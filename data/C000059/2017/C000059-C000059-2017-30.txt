Chair, the House has spoken several times on the Bureau of Land Management's methane regulation in the past 2 years. I understand the administration is reviewing the regulation and that litigation is ongoing.  In the meantime, I think action is needed, and so I support this amendment and urge my colleagues to do the same.
