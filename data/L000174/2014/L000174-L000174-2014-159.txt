President, yesterday in Maputo, Mozambique, representatives of many of the 161 countries that have joined the treaty banning the production, stockpiling, export, and use of antipersonnel landmines convened the third review conference in the 15 years since the treaty came into force.  The impact of that treaty, once ridiculed as a naive dream by many in the U.S. defense establishment, has been extraordinary. The vast majority of landmine use and production has stopped. New casualties have dropped significantly. Many countries have cleared the mined areas in their territories.  Of the 35 countries that have not yet joined the treaty, including the United States, almost all abide by its provisions. We can be proud that the United States has been the largest contributor to programs to clear mines and to help mine victims. Those programs have saved countless lives. In fact, the Leahy War Victims Fund was first used in Mozambique.  But I remember during the negotiations on the treaty how officials in the U.S. administration at the time urged, even warned, their counterparts in other countries, including our NATO allies, against signing the treaty. In the end, every member of NATO except the United States joined it.  Some in our government said it was a meaningless gesture that would accomplish nothing. I think they resented that other governments, especially Canada, and nongovernmental organizations from around the world could achieve something outside the U.N. negotiation process, which had utterly failed to address this problem.  Instead, the treaty has already accomplished more than most people expected, thanks to the extraordinary advocacy of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines and three-quarters of the world's governments, many of whose people have suffered from the scourge of landmines.  But the problem is far from solved. There are still thousands of deaths and injuries from mines each year, and most are innocent civilians.  Twenty years ago this week, in a speech at the United Nations that inspired people around the world, President Clinton called for a global ban on antipersonnel mines. I was proud of President Clinton for doing that, but his Presidency, his administration, was outmaneuvered by the Pentagon, and it failed to join the treaty. Then, during the 8 years of the last Bush administration, nothing happened. In fact, during those years, the White House reneged on some of the pledges of the Clinton administration.  When President Obama was elected, I thought we would finally see the United States get on the right side of this issue. After all, we fought two long wars without using antipersonnel mines. All our NATO allies and most of our coalition partners have banned them.  But that has not happened.  Now we rightly condemned, and I do condemn, the Taliban for using victim-activated IEDs, which are also banned by the treaty, but we still insist on retaining our right to use antipersonnel mines.  Eighteen years ago, President Clinton charged the Pentagon to develop alternatives to antipersonnel mines. Instead, the Pentagon has fought every attempt to get rid of these indiscriminate weapons, even if they do not use them.  As I have said many times, no one argues that antipersonnel mines have no military utility. Every weapon does. Poison gas has a military utility, but we outlawed it a century ago. Are we incapable of renouncing, as our closest allies have, tiny explosives that are the antithesis of precision-guided weapons, weapons we have rightly not used during two long wars, weapons that kill children and innocent civilians, and weapons that should bring condemnation to anybody using them?  We talk about the importance of avoiding civilian casualties. We all believe in that. We have seen how civilian casualties can turn a local population against us. We do not export antipersonnel landmines. We do not use them. We can drive a robot on Mars by remote control, but we say we cannot solve this problem. It begs credulity.  This is not an abstract issue. This girl is who I am talking about. I have met countless people like her. She is lucky. She survived, even though without hands and legs. Many others like her bleed to death.  I have been to clinics in poor countries where, instead of soccer balls, they make artificial limbs like these. We support them with the Leahy War Victims Fund. I am glad we can help, but I wish there was absolutely no need for that.  I visited a young girl in a hospital after the Bosnia war. Her parents had sent her away so she could be safe. The war ended. The soldiers returned home. She was running down the road calling out to her parents, and she stepped on a mine. Both her legs were blown off. The war was over, but not for her.  We recently sent people to that part of the world after flooding. Why? Because thousands of landmines still in the ground had washed up and moved around. Schoolchildren now face the danger again, because even though they had mapped where the landmines were that was before the floods.  As in the past, the White House hides behind their failure to act by pointing at North Korea. Who is not concerned about North Korea? But are we so dependent on antipersonnel landmines that we cannot develop war plans to defend South Korea without them? I reject that just as former commanders of our forces in South Korea rejected it long ago.  Last week, after a cursory 2-minute debate that inaccurately described the landmines in the Korean DMZ as U.S. mines, which they are not, and that inaccurately asserted, based on erroneous press reports, that the White House is about to join the mine ban treaty, which it is not, the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee adopted by voice vote a prohibition on the use of funds to implement the treaty.  The amendment's sponsor even claimed that the one thing--the only thing--stopping a North Korean invasion is U.S. antipersonnel mines. Balderdash. Did the Pentagon tell them that? Of course not. I wonder how many, if any, Members of that subcommittee have even read the treaty.  One would think, 61 years after the Korean war, that the Pentagon would not still be arguing that the defense of South Korea depends on tiny, indiscriminate explosives that would pose a threat to U.S. forces if we counterattacked. It makes you wonder.  This country, with the most powerful army, that spends far more money on its armed forces than any country in the world, has to rely on antipersonnel landmines? Oh, come on.  President Obama can still put the United States on a path to join the treaty, but time is running out. It will require some revision of our Korea war plans. That can be done in a manner that protects the security of South Korea and our troops. It needs to be done, because without the participation and support of the United States, the most powerful Nation on Earth, no international treaty can achieve its potential.  I commend the participants at the Maputo review conference. I regret the United States is there only as an observer, as it has been since the Ottawa process began 18 years ago. We sit on the sidelines as though we have no role in this. What a missed opportunity, what a stain on the country that should be the moral leader.  The next review conference is in 2019, the 25th anniversary of President Clinton's speech. What an anniversary it would be if that next review conference were held in Washington, with the United States attending as a party to the treaty.  I ask unanimous consent that a June 22 article in the Boston Globe and a June 23 article in the New York Times on this subject be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Boston Globe, June 22, 2014]          Formerly a Leader on Land Mine Ban, Obama Now Balks                           (By Bryan Bender)       Washington.--In 2005, then-Senator Barack Obama wrote to a      constituent that he would use his influence to help advance      an international treaty banning land mines, decrying what he      called the ``horrific injuries and loss of life'' among      civilians long after wars end.       But in his five-plus years as president, Obama has not      asked the US Senate to ratify the pact signed by 161 other      nations, showing an unwillingness to take on military      officials who assert that the devices, which the Pentagon      last used in battle in 1991, are still needed. Instead, his      administration has repeatedly delayed a review of the issue      initiated early in his first term.       Senator Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who has spent      more than two decades directing federal funding to clear      minefields and provide victims with wheelchairs, prosthetics,      and job training, is so frustrated at Obama's lack of action      that he is complaining bitterly and publicly about it.       ``I think of children who have gone to something shiny on      the side of the road thinking it was a toy and instead having      their legs blown off,'' Leahy said in a blunt floor speech in      late March, the first in a series he has delivered to focus      attention on the issue. ``President Obama, you know what you      should do.''       Indeed, what is most vexing to many treaty supporters is      that the United States has done more than other countries to      address the problem, but still hasn't taken up the treaty.       In addition to spending more than $2 billion over the last      two decades to reduce the threat and aid victims, the United      States has halted the production and export of so-called      ``persistent'' or ``dumb'' mines that have no disarming      mechanism and can remain a danger for unsuspecting villagers      for decades.       ``The United States has actually probably lived up to about      90 percent of the requirements of the treaty,'' said Lloyd      Axworthy, the former foreign minister of Canada who hosted      the treaty negotiations, expressing incredulity that the      United States has nonetheless long resisted giving up the      weapons.       Although it was among the first to call for a treaty      banning land mines, the United States is now the only member      of the NATO military alliance that has not joined the pact.      The only other nation in the Western Hemisphere to refuse is      Cuba. When treaty signatories meet on June 23 in Mozambique      to discuss ways to accelerate the destruction of mines as      well as strengthen the pact, the United States will attend      only as an observer.       ``It was US leadership that really got the ball rolling,''      said Bobby Muller, president of the Vietnam Veterans of      America Foundation, who was a key organizer of the original      movement to ban the weapons. ``But the United States is      shamefully behind the curve.''                         The killing continues       In late May, a six-year-old girl was killed and five other      villagers wounded in Myanmar when they came upon a land mine      near the border with Thailand.       The same week the US State Department dispatched a ``quick      reaction force'' to Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina where      flooding had dislodged land mines left over from the civil      war in the former Yugoslavia.       Advocates for the ban believe America's continued      reluctance to embrace the treaty is slowing momentum to      render politically unacceptable a weapon that kills or      injures an estimated 10 people every day in the 60-some      countries where they remain in the ground. For example, US      allies Ukraine and Finland have recently signaled they might      withdraw from the treaty out of military necessity.       Three dozen countries still remain outside the treaty,      according to a recent report by the Arms Control Association,      a nonprofit advocacy group, including the United States,      China, Russia, India, and Pakistan. Together they      collectively account for an estimated stockpile of 160      million landmines, while experts say there is no reliable way      to estimate how many landmines are still littering global      battlefields.                       At first, some high hopes       The ``Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,      Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Antipersonnel Mines      and on Their Destruction'' was proposed in 1997, requiring      member nations to no longer use land mines, destroy all      remaining supplies, and remove those planted on their      territory.       The so-called Ottawa Treaty was heralded as the first      global arms treaty to emerge from civil society, as opposed      to governments. The International Campaign to Ban Landmines,      a coalition of 1,400 nongovernmental organizations from      around the world--led by American Jody Williams--was awarded      the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize for spearheading the effort, which      also benefited from high-profile advocates like the late      Princess Diana.       The treaty's unique evolution is viewed as a possible      reason why the American military brass is still resisting;      the thinking goes that commanders fear that giving up land      mines could encourage similar efforts by human rights groups      to seek to ban other types of controversial weapons, such as      drones.       The United States initially was a leading advocate of the      pact; then-US President Bill Clinton called the land mine      problem ``a global tragedy.''       ``In all probability, land mines kill more children than      soldiers, and they keep killing after wars are over,''      Clinton said.       But he opted not to sign the treaty and seek its      ratification after US military leaders insisted that they      needed time to develop alternatives to mines.       The Bush administration also adhered to that position,      while the US Army began developing so-called ``smart'' mines      as a replacement, devices officials say are now ready to be      part of the arsenal.       One alternative, called the Spider, is designed to detonate      only by command and to self-defuse after a limited period. It      is designed and built in part by Textron Systems     in Wilmington, Mass. Textron officials did not respond to a      request for comment.       When Obama came into office in 2009 there were high hopes      that he would seek to join the treaty; he instead ordered up      a review that has gone on for five years.       Asked about the assessment, Edward Price, a spokesman for      the White House's National Security Council, said, ``We are      pressing forward to conclude our review of US land mine      policy'' but declined to provide details.       ``The United States shares the humanitarian concerns of the      parties to the Ottawa Convention,'' Price added, noting that      ``the United States is the single largest financial supporter      of global humanitarian demining efforts.''       A Pentagon spokeswoman, Lieutenant Commander Amy      Derrickfrost, defended the military's position. She said that      in addition to ending the use of so-called ``dumb'' mines in      2010, the US military also no longer uses plastic mines,      which cannot be identified with a metal detector or other      mine surveillance technologies.       But the military continues to say that it must have the      ability to use anti-personnel land mines.       ``I consider them to be an important tool in the arsenal of      the armed forces of the United States,'' General Martin      Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a      congressional hearing in March, especially on the Korean      penninsula, where they are intended to help blunt an invasion      by the North Korean army.       The Pentagon position has its share of supporters on      Capitol Hill, including Representative Randy Forbes, a      Virginia Republican, who calls land mines ``vitally important      to the defense of South Korea.'' Fearing that Obama will sign      the treaty, he has proposed an amendment to a new defense      bill that would prohibit the administration from implementing      the treaty.       Many observers, however, remain surprised at the extent of      opposition at the Pentagon to the treaty.       ``Some of the guys that wrote the [Korean] war plans were      advocates of the mine ban,'' said retired Army Lietenant      General G. Robert Gard, who traveled to South Korea in the      late 1990s at Leahy's request to make an assessment.       Gard, who is chairman of the Center for Arms Control and      Nonproliferation, a nonprofit think tank, said commanders      asserted ``we could accomplish the things that land mines      were purported to do for us by other means.''       A veteran of the Korean and Vietnam Wars, Gard believes      that the continued Pentagon resistance is driven by fear that      giving in could embolden human rights groups to try to ban      other weapons.       He described the argument: ``If you give in to those flaky      nongovernmental organizations they will try to to make us get      rid of other weapons we really need.''       Meanwhile, the ongoing land mine policy review--the third      such assessment since the Clinton years--has treaty advocates      such as Williams, the peace prize recipient, deeply      frustrated.       She said in an e-mail that she ``does not understand why      this review has taken place at all and even less do we      understand or accept why it has taken five years already and      President Obama still seems unable to bring it to a      conclusion that can be shared with the American public.''                         `Life forever ruined'       The gruesome photographs, blown up to nearly life size for      maximum effect, line a small, cluttered office of the Senate      Appropriations Committee. One depicts a pair of legless men      looking up from their wheel chairs, another a woman hobbling      along with the help of a stick.       The images were all captured by Leahy, an amateur      photographer who has personally chronicled dozens of innocent      war victims from Central America to Southeast Asia.       His crusade against land mines began more than two decades      ago in a jungle village in Nicaragua, at the height of its      civil war.       ``There was a little boy, probably 12 years old, one leg,      homemade crutch. He'd lost his leg from a landmine,'' Leahy      recalled in an interview in his Senate office, where some of      his war victim photos hang at eye level above his desk.       Leahy asked the boy if he was injured by the forces loyal      to the Sandinista government or the so-called Contra rebels.      ``Well, he had no idea. He just knew that his life was      forever ruined.''       Leahy later used his perch on the panel overseeing the      State Department budget to establish a US fund to help the      most vulnerable victims of war, which was later named the      Leahy Victims Fund. He also provided money for mine clearance      groups around the world.       Leahy later proposed legislation prohibiting the United      States from exporting land mines. To help convince a      skeptical Senate, he persuaded DC Comics to publish a Batman      comic edition in which the caped crusader, in his effort to      rescue a child, had to walk through a minefield.       The last panel depicted the child reaching for a shiny      object and being warned by Batman not to pick it up before      there was a ``Kaboom.''       Leahy provided a copy of the special issue to every      senator; his legislation passed by voice vote without      opposition. He now remains optimistic that if Obama would      sign the land mine treaty and send it to the Senate for      ratification it has a good chance of garnering the required      two-thirds, or 67 votes, to pass--despite the overall      partisan rancor.       ``I don't want to sound like I am on a crusade but nothing      has gripped me as much since I have been here,'' Leahy said,      tearing up when recalling how he lifted a Vietnamese landmine      victim into his wheelchair. (``He grabbed my shirt, he pulled      me down, and he kissed me''.)       ``This is today's poison gas,'' Leahy said. Failing to join      the treaty, he believes, ``is a moral failure of our      country.''                                  ____                [From the New York Times, June 23, 2014]         Treaty Is Making Land Mines Weapon of Past, Group Says                          (By Rick Gladstone)       Despite the conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, the      armed uprising in Ukraine and turmoil in other hot spots in      the Middle East and Africa, one of war's most insidious      weapons--antipersonnel land mines--have been largely outlawed      and drastically reduced, a monitoring group said in a report      released Monday.       In the 15 years since a global treaty prohibiting these      weapons took effect, the use and production of the mines has      nearly stopped, new casualties have plummeted, and more than      two dozen countries once contaminated by land mines buried      since old wars have removed them, said the report by the      group, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines.       ``The Mine Ban Treaty remains an ongoing success in      stigmatizing the use of land mines and mitigating the      suffering they cause,'' said Jeff Abramson, the project      manager of Landmine Monitor, the group's research unit.       The group, which won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1997 for its      work, released the report to coincide with the Third Review      Conference of the Mine Ban Treaty, which convened Monday in      Maputo, Mozambique, where representatives from its 161      signers and other participants will spend five days      discussing how to further strengthen enforcement of the      agreement.       Antipersonnel mines are hidden explosive devices that are      buried in the ground and designed to be detonated when a      person steps on or near them, causing indiscriminate death      and grievous injury. They can lie dormant for decades, long      after a conflict has ended. Many of their victims are      children.       The United States, which was among the original countries      to call for a treaty banning mines and has done much to help      other countries purge them, has not signed the treaty. It is      among the 36 countries that have not signed it and is the      only NATO member outside the treaty. (Russia and China also      have not signed.)       An American delegation is attending the Maputo conference      only as observers.       Human rights advocates criticize the United States for what      they call a conspicuous lapse that may be dissuading other      countries from joining the treaty.       The Obama administration, which says it has been evaluating      the treaty's provisions since 2009, has issued conflicting      signals about its intentions.       ``It's going to be embarrassing for the U.S. to have to      explain to the high-level officials at the summit meeting why      it has been reviewing its land mine policies for five years      without making a decision,'' said Stephen Goose, the      executive director of the arms division at Human Rights Watch      and the chairman of the United States Campaign to Ban      Landmines, a coalition of groups that has been pressing the      United States to join.       American defense officials have resisted a blanket      renunciation of land mines. Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, chairman      of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a congressional hearing in      March that he considered such weapons ``an important tool''      in the American arsenal, citing as an example their use in      South Korea to deter an invasion from North Korea.       Others, however, have expressed frustration over what they      regard as an inexcusable American refusal to join the treaty.      Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat and a prominent      supporter of the treaty, has pressed the administration in      speeches this year to endorse it.       ``If land mines were littering this country--in      schoolyards, along roads, in cornfields, in our national      parks--and hundreds of American children were being      crippled'' like children in Cambodia, Mr. Leahy said in an      April 9 statement, ``how long would it take before the White      House sent the Mine Ban Treaty to the Senate for      ratification.''       Despite its apparent reluctance to join the treaty, the      United States has spent more than $2 billion in the past two      decades to help clear mines and aid victims, more than any      other country.       The United States also has stopped production and export of      so-called dumb mines that cannot be disarmed, and it no      longer uses plastic materials that can foil metal detectors      used to decontaminate mine-infested areas.       The report by the International Campaign to Ban Landmines      said that only five countries--Israel, Libya, Myanmar, Russia      and Syria, all nonsigners of the treaty--had used      antipersonnel land mines since 2009.       But it also reported that Yemen, which has signed the      treaty, disclosed last November that it violated its pledge      against land mine use in 2011.       The report said global stockpiles of mines had dropped      sharply, with 87 signers of the     treaty having completed their promised destruction of a total      of about 47 million mines, since the treaty took effect.      Twenty-seven nations contaminated with mines have proclaimed      themselves mine-free during that period.       Casualties from leftover mines have also declined by more      than half since the treaty took effect, the report said. Yet      in the roughly 60 countries where contamination from land      mines and other explosive remnants of war remains a problem,      an estimated 4,000 people a year are killed or wounded.       The report said nearly half the victims were children. In      Afghanistan, it said, children constitute 61 percent of all      such casualties since 1999.
