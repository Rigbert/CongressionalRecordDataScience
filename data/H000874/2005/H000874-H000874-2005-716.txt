I presume the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spratt) will be invited to the conference at some point in time, along with others?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would yield, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spratt) is a very good friend of mine, and it would hurt my feelings if we did not invite the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spratt) to the conference.
