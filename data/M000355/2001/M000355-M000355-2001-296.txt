 But to make the Senator from Virginia feel better, not too far in the past the reform bills we were dealing with had draconian spending limits on candidates, taxpayer funding of elections.  As recently as 1992 and 1993 and 1994, majorities in the Senate were supporting taxpayer funding of elections. It was noteworthy that only 30 Senators in this body supported taxpayer funding of congressional races--the Kerry amendment earlier today. We have made some progress. We are now down to arguing over the impact of campaign finance reform on parties and outside groups. It used to be a lot worse.
