Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Ohio (Mr. LaTourette).  Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman very much, and if I could ask the attention of the distinguished ranking member, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) for just a moment if he has a minute.  One of the things I have learned over the last 8 years being here and getting the opportunity to preside from time to time is that there is not a more abler Member of this body than the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) or the gentleman from Florida (Chairman Young) when it comes to the appropriations process. And I am just a slug transporter who believes in building roads and bridges and dredging harbors and things of that nature.  When this continuing resolution came out the other day, we were very upset on our side of the aisle, as was the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) and the Democrats on the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, because we were told that the original language would put us at the $27 billion mark for the fiscal year, which was in violation of the $4.4 billion that we thought we restored.  We notified our leadership that we would en masse vote against the rule for this continuing resolution unless the language was changed. The language was in fact changed, and today we were told that this continuing resolution spends out the transportation trust fund at $31.8 billion until October 18. I guess I am asking the gentleman because he is a lot smarter than I am, were we hoodwinked or do we have to go back to our leadership and say that somehow they have fooled us or is that in fact the case?
