For nearly seventy years, North Coast Distributing has been a leader in the Northwest Indiana business sector, and while the company has seen much success, it is what they have done to give back to the community that makes them so vital to Northwest Indiana. For the third straight year, North Coast, in conjunction with Ivy Tech Community College of Northwest Indiana, will be providing the community with their ``Fall Innovators Cafe'' in an effort to share their expertise in operating a successful organization with regional and community leaders. This special event will take place on Thursday, September 25, 2008.  A local, family-owned beer wholesaler since 1939, North Coast Distributing, formerly Valpo Beverages, Incorporated, has become one of the premier distributors in the Midwest. The success they have seen, under the leadership of President and Chief Executive Officer Bruce Leetz, is in large part due to the core values of North Coast: Passion for business, Respect for each other and surroundings, Integrity to demonstrate the highest ethical and moral standards, Commitment to achieve goals, and in Excelling in everything they do. This commitment to excellence has led to many accolades at the local, state, and national levels for North Coast, who in 2007 became the first distributor to win both the Miller and Coors top distributor awards. While the many awards they have received are outstanding enough, North Coast's commitment to corporate responsibility and to their community are the most impressive.  Led by Bruce Leetz, North Coast Distributing has always been committed to promoting responsible consumption and in giving back to the community, as is evidenced by their participation in the upcoming innovative session. A graduate of Valparaiso High School and Ball State University, Bruce has been employed with North Coast for over 45 years.
