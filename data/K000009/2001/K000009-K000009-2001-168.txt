Chairman, I wanted to thank the gentlewoman from Missouri for her tremendous leadership on this issue and also the gentleman from Massachusetts, Mr. McGovern. The two of them have been vigilant all through our efforts in subcommittee and full committee. I want to thank the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Bonilla, for trying to do as much as he could do. I would hope that we might even consider doing a joint letter to the Secretary as we move toward conference, if that is possible, in order that this program be given the serious attention that it demands at the Department of Agriculture. I want to thank all my colleagues for their tremendous efforts.  Also, I understand Senator Dole has gone through a bit of a procedure at the Cleveland Clinic recently. If he is watching this, I hope our remarks make him feel better. I also want to thank Senator McGovern who has been such a stalwart supporter and innovator, a genius really on this program. We thank him for traveling up here recently to join us in a press conference in front of the Capitol. We hope in their stead here today that we do what is necessary to continue this program.
