  Mr. President, I pride myself on always doing my homework and sticking to the facts.  So when someone accuses me of straying from the facts, I like to address the criticism head on.  I would like to resolve the issue one way or the other.  To do that, I went back to the place where I got the information in the first place.  That's the General Accounting Office [GAO] in St. Louis, MO--near McDonnell Douglas headquarters.  The man with the knowledge there is Mr. Robert D. Spence.  I went back to Mr. Spence to check and recheck the facts to be certain my statements were consistent with the facts.  The disputed information pertains to the amount of money the Department of Defense [DOD] pays out to senior executives at the McDonnell Douglas Corp.  I presented those facts during the debate over executive compensation on July 10.  The facts that Defense Week questions appear on page S7172 of the Congressional Record.  This is what I said.  The DOD paid the top five executives at McDonnell Douglas a total of $9,273,382.00.  I said the top executive got $2,713,308.  To back up that statement, I will place a table in the Record.  This table was prepared by the GAO but the information came straight from the horse's mouth--the Defense Contract Audit Agency or DCAA.  The table shows how much each of the five top executives at McDonnell Douglas was paid by the Pentagon.  Now, Mr. Capaccio says that information is inaccurate.  He says the top five executives were not paid $9,273,382.00 by DOD.  He says that is the amount allocated to the overhead pools of the company's many components or subdivisions.  He said that money would then have to be divided between commercial, general government, and defense contracts.  Mr. President, I hate to say it, but Defense Week is flat wrong.  As I said, Mr. President, I went back to the GAO and Mr. Spence to check and recheck my information.  It checks out OK.  My information comes directly from the DCAA.  First, to get the DOD pay figures for the top five executives, DCAA had to query the field offices at each McDonnel Douglas subdivision.  This was done to establish the split between DOD, non-DOD government, and commerical contracts.  This was done to isolate the amounts charged to DOD contracts.  That's what the GAO table does.  It isolates the $9,273,382.00 as the amount allocated to components with DOD contracts.  DOD contracts--that's the key.  My numbers have absolutely nothing to do with general government or commercial contracts.  So that's a bogus argument.  Second, the dollar totals on the GAO table are not 100-percent accurate.  I will be the first to admit that.  They were not audited in every case.  But they are considered reasonably accurate. They're in the ballpark.  If the GAO and DCAA numbers aren't accurate enough, then Defense Week should produce a better set.  And it admits it can't do that.  Third, Mr. President, I need to clarify one point.  The Pentagon, for example, did not send McDonnell Douglas' top executive a paycheck for $2,713,308.00.  That's not how it really works.  There are no individual DOD paychecks that go to executives; $2,713,308.00 is the amount McDonnell Douglas is allowed to bill the taxpayers on DOD contracts for that individual's salary.  That is the amount set aside in DOD contracts for that individual's compensation package.  Once the amount is approved by DCAA, it is then apportioned across hundreds of contract payments.  It's doled out piecemeal in thousands of U.S Treasury checks.  But it's there in those checks.  McDonnell Douglas got the money.  The money came from DOD.  The money was for executive compensation.  Just because it was a small part of a big payment doesn't make the money any less real.  It doesn't make it play money.  In the end, Mr. President, no matter how you slice it, DOD paid McDonnell Douglas' top five executives $9.3 million.  I ask unanimous consent that the table I referred to earlier be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                         MDC ALLOCATION OF COMPENSATION TO COMPONENTS--TOP 5 EXECUTIVES----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                       Total                                                                   compensation                       Amounts                                                                        for            Total       allocated to                            Executive                             application of   compensation     components                                                                   compensation      $250,000        with DOD                                                                        cap                          contracts----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1...............................................................      $4,012,833      $3,762,833      $2,713,3082...............................................................       3,920,559       3,670,559       2,646,7733...............................................................       2,383,974       2,133,974       2,046,4814...............................................................       2,303,713       2,053,713       1,833,6045...............................................................       2,238,966       1,988,966          33,216    Total.......................................................      14,860,045      13,610,045       9,273,382----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                                            ____________________
