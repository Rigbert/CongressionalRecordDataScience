Speaker, this year marks the nine-year anniversary of the greatest financial crisis in a generation. This economic disaster nearly caused the destruction of our country's entire financial infrastructure and led to what we call now the Great Recession.  However, during the last nine years Wall Street Banks have succeeded and in the process have caused the financial failure of millions of Americans. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have all reported record profits during the recession. Wall Street in the last nine years has regained ALL of its pre-crisis wealth with interest, while Main Street has yet to see a real recovery.  During the 1990's, Wall Street's biggest banks and speculation houses concocted a fraudulent and greedy scheme to create false money. Then, in 2008, their crime exploded, nearly destroying capitalism. Their recklessness was so extreme it wiped out the net worth of 44 percent of Hispanic American households, 33 percent of African American households, and 11 percent of Caucasian households, respectively.  This was a taking of historic dimension never reimbursed to this day. It sucked out the wealth from millions of American families. It's time for Congress to ensure that these failures in our banking system are never repeated.  That is why I have reintroduced the Return to Prudent Banking Act. To build on the momentum and the movement to reinstate Glass-Steagall.  Since last summer, fifteen state legislatures introduced resolutions calling for Congress to reinstate Glass Steagall. Democrats and Republicans have memorialized support for Glass-Steagall in their respective political platforms. Even President Trump has declared his support for a new Glass-Steagall law and we are obligated to work with him to do just that.  I was proud to join with 57 members of the House who several years ago voted against the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the bill that overturned Glass Steagall. As the anti-regulation movement won the day, that law was a clear signal that Wall Street was in charge. Banks grew larger and riskier, and American taxpayers were given the bill when the deregulated financial sector fell apart.  This is a reality that has sunk its teeth deep into the flesh of our Republic, influencing more and more who is elevated to office.  Mr. Speaker, these banks have to be defanged. Restoring Glass Steagall is a first step among other items, like a campaign finance reform, better trade deals, and better deals for American workers.                          ____________________
