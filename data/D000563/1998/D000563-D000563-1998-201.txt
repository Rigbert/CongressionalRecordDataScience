As a matter of fact, is the Senator aware of the fact that when Mr. Freeh, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last year, I asked point blank, ``What has your experience been at the FBI with this policy that requires child safety locks or trigger locks to be used by every FBI agent?'' And Director Freeh said, ``I think it has worked very well. I think it hasn't impeded any readiness or ability to protect. I think it is a very simple but very wholesome requirement. Having five small boys myself, I think it is a very good idea, whether or not it is mandated.''  I just ask the Senator from California, is she aware of any of the critics of this legislation who can overcome this testimony from the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation that they already use these trigger locks for law enforcement agents who take the guns home in an evening?
