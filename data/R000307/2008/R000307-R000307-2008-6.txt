President, I wish today to recognize the Naval Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps, NJROTC, of Shawnee Mission North High School in Overland Park, KS, for their outstanding performance in the 2008 NJROTC Nationals competition. For 3 consecutive years, the Shawnee Mission North NJROTC, under the leadership and guidance of Chief Warrant Officer 4 Dennis C. Grayless, USMC (Ret) and Chief Petty Officer Christopher W. Neven, USN (Ret), has qualified to compete in the prestigious NJROTC National Academic, Athletic and Drill Championship hosted by the Navy League of the United States at the Pensacola Naval Air Station, Pensacola, FL. The NJROTC Nationals, or ``Navy Nationals'' as it is affectionately referred to by the participants, is the most comprehensive test of overall JROTC training and performance in existence today. The Nation's finest NJROTC units from each of the 11 Navy Areas participate in this two-day academic, athletic, and drill competition. There is no competition in JROTC that provides a more comprehensive test of program quality.  Earlier this year, the Shawnee Mission North team was recognized as the Area 9 Most Outstanding Unit after sweeping the NJROTC Area 9 Championship Drill Team Competition. The team placed first in armed exhibition, unarmed exhibition, armed regulation, unarmed regulation, push-ups, curl-ups/sit-ups and in the 16 x 100 shuttle relay. While they placed second in the competition for Color Guard, 8 x 200 oval relay, academics, and personnel inspection. As 2008 Area 9 Regional Champion, the team qualified to return to the Navy Nationals for the third consecutive year.  At the 2008 national competition, the Shawnee Mission North team placed first in the Nation in the Armed Regulation Drill and finished seventh in the overall competition. Cadet Dylan Warnick received individual honors by finishing third in the Nation in the male curl-up/sit-up competition by completing 320 cadenced curl-ups/sit-ups in 5 minutes. Cadet Bethany Krzesinski received individual honors by finishing sixth in the Nation in the female curl-up/sit up competition by completing 268 cadenced curl-ups/sit-ups in 5 minutes. While Cadet Michael Hoffman received individual honors by tying for fifth in the Nation in the male push-up competition by completing 114 cadenced push-ups in 5 minutes.  As reflected in the success achieved by the Shawnee Mission North NJROTC unit, it is apparent the breadth and depth of commitment, dedication, hard work, resolve and motivation each member of this team possesses. The Shawnee Mission North NJROTC unit has been recognized as a Naval Honor Unit (1992-1999), a Naval Distinguished Unit (2000, 2007, 2008), recipient of the Unit Achievement Award (2003), a Chief of Naval Education and Training Unit (1988, 1989), the 2007 National Academic, Athletic and Drill Champions, and the 2008 Area 9 Most Outstanding Unit. Five of its graduating cadets have enlisted into the U.S. Armed Forces; one has been awarded an NROTC scholarship to attend Purdue University; and two cadets from the junior class have been accepted into the 2008 summer semester at the U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, MD.
