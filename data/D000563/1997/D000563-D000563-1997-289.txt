I can read it in two sentences and describe it as well with these words.  ``A substantial majority of the tax cut benefits provided in the tax reconciliation bill''--which is a part of this agreement--``will go to middle-class working families earning less than approximately $100,000 per year, and the tax cuts in the tax reconciliation bill will not cause revenue losses to increase significantly in years after 2007.''  Senator Boxer and I are trying to establish as basic principles that the tax cut package that will emerge from this budget agreement will do one thing and avoid another. The thing that it will do is to gear more than a majority--a substantial majority--of the benefits to middle-income families. We think, if this ends up becoming a tax cut for wealthy people, that it is not in the best interests of sparking this economy and helping working families cope with the expenses of life that they face every day.  Second, we want to make certain in this resolution that we make it clear that any tax cut package will be measured not only to the year 2002, when we hope the budget will be in balance, and 5 years beyond to 2007. We have great fear and concern by reports that have come out recently from the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities that some of the tax cut provisions that are being debated will literally explode in cost in the outyears, causing great dislocation in terms of the Federal budget and a great burden to Federal taxpayers.  Let us make sure these tax cuts are affordable and they are targeted to families that need them. Then, I think we can say to the American people that we have not only balanced the budget, but we have given you a tax cut that is responsible for the future of our economy.  I yield the remainder of my time.
