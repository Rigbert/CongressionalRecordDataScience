President, today, Viktor Yushchenko, President of Ukraine, addressed a joint meeting of the United States Congress. I was honored to be part of the committee that escorted President Yushchenko into the House Chamber.  President Yushchenko's courage and commitment to democracy have inspired thousands of people in Illinois, and millions more in this country and throughout the world. In Illinois, we have a sizable Ukrainian-American population, particularly in Chicago. My son lives in a section of Chicago known as Ukrainian Village, and soon after President Yushchenko's election, the neighborhood was covered with orange ribbons in celebration.  Yesterday, President Yushchenko and his wife, Kathy Chumachenko-Yushchenko, a native of Chicago, visited the Windy City. I am glad they had the chance to experience our Illinois hospitality during their brief trip to the United States.  Just last month, I traveled to Ukraine as part of a bipartisan congressional delegation. There, I met with President Yushchenko and members of his government, and had the chance to see for myself a nation newly aglow in the light of democracy.  The story of President Yushchenko's election as the President of Ukraine is a story of great personal courage. It is a story of the power of democratic values and ideals. It is a story of what can be accomplished by individuals, united in peaceful protest against corruption, cronyism, and unfettered power.  President Yushchenko was elected as President of Ukraine despite a powerful array of opposing forces which, in pursuit of their ambitions, were willing to obstruct free assembly, free speech, and a free and fair democratic election. He ran for President at great risk to his own life. And he prevailed.  President Yushchenko spoke today with optimism and with hope for Ukraine's future as a democratic country. He said of his country, ``We want a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.'' This is a desire that we as Americans understand and share. I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress and with President Yushchenko to help nurture the flame of democracy that has started to burn so brightly in Ukraine.                          ____________________
