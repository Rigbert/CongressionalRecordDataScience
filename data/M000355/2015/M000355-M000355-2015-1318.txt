 President, I think we are all aware that Chairman Hatch and Senator Wyden have been working in good faith over the last several days to set up both debates and votes on amendments from both sides of the aisle. The bill managers have had some success in working together on the votes that we have had, and so far we have worked to get an additional seven amendments pending.  Sadly, there is an objection from the other side of the aisle on getting additional amendments pending regardless of which party offers the amendment.  Senator Hatch and his colleague have been down here for days trying to get amendments up, and obviously it is possible in the Senate to prevent others from getting amendments. Now we have the whole process stymied because we cannot seem to get agreements for any additional amendments.  I think we all know this is a body that requires at least some level of cooperation, and that just has not been happening here on this bipartisan bill.  I will point out that while I will file cloture on the bill this evening, that is not the end of the story. I will repeat that: That is not the end of the story. The bill managers will continue to work together to get more amendments available for votes before the cloture vote. And with a little cooperation from our friends on the other side of the aisle, I still think we can get that done.  It is my hope that we will be able to process a number of amendments, particularly those which are critical to Members on both sides, and then move forward, and we will have a couple of days to accomplish that.                             Cloture Motion  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send to the desk a cloture motion to the Hatch amendment No. 1221 to H.R. 1314.
