President, we need our environmental laws back. Old-growth trees that have stood for 400 years are falling today, and it will the year 2400 before we get them back. We need to restore the laws.  To achieve this goal, I have cosponsored two efforts. One is a straight, fundamental attempt to overturn the salvage law, and one that is a practical attempt to stop the lawless logging. No one has worked harder than Patty Murray to restore economic and ecological balance to the hoax of a ``jobs versus the environment'' campaign. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of her effort.  Senator Bradley, ranking Democrat on the Forests and Public Land Management Subcommittee, has taken the lead to simply overturn one of the worst environmental laws Congress has considered in years. As soon as the so-called salvage law passed, industry sued to cut the big old-growth trees. This will be a difficult bill to overturn, especially since we still have the same Congress through which it originally passed. Nonetheless, I am a proud original cosponsor of Senator Bradley's bill to repeal the salvage rider.  Proponents of logging without laws say that they must cut, build roads, risk mudslides, threaten fisheries, and scar the forest to create jobs. The facts don't support this twisted rationale. There were more than 14,200 new jobs in the Rocky Mountain-Pacific Northwest timber industry from 1992 until Congress forced through the rider, and the sector was still growing. Oregon had the lowest unemployment in a generation. We did not need to derail steady responsible growth with a return to the conflicts of the 1980's. Unfortunately, some groups have bought into the gluttony of the salvage rider, but have forgotten about putting food on the table for working families when the salvage free-for-all days are over.  Our No. 1 priority should be to restore stability to working families in rural communities. No one can tolerate another short-term logging binge. The current rider is bringing conflict. When it is repealed or expires, workers face another round of economic instability while we struggle with environmental triage on the forest resource.  But most importantly, we need to restore the environmental laws that this Congress suspended. The Forest Service is poised to release hundreds of millions of board feet of timber, and we must not leave the door open for such abuse. Both bills are steps in the right direction, and I hope we can unsaddle the salvage rider very soon.                          ____________________
