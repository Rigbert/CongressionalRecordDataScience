Speaker, I rise today to speak in favor of House Resolution 298, the Maintain United States Trade Law Resolution. There have been a number of pieces of legislation introduced this Congress aimed at strengthening our trade laws. While some of these bills have been very technical in nature, we have before us today a resolution that is so simple and straightforward that there can be no hidden agenda. It sends forth one basic, yet vital, message from the Congress to the Administration, and that message is this--do not allow the current antidumping and countervailing duty laws to be weakened.  Just over a month from now, the WTO will convene at the Seattle Ministerial to launch a new round of trade talks. An agenda has been set for these negotiations that does not include the antidumping and countervailing duty rules, yet there are a number of countries seeking to expand the agenda in order to debate them. The existing rules were concluded only with great difficulty during the Uruguay Round, and have hardly been tested. In no way have the existing rules been proven to be defective. Therefore, it would be clearly a rash decision to reopen them at this point in time.  Fortunately the Administration seems to have recognized the importance of maintaining these trade laws and has stated on a numberof occasions that they will not allow them to be reopened at this next round of talks. Apparently, some Members in this House feel this is enough assurance, but I speak today on behalf of the almost 200 cosponsors of this resolution who know the Congress must vocalize their support for the Administration's stated approach. We must show our trading partners that we wholeheartedly support and endorse our negotiators and their position at the Seattle Ministerial.  On a number of occasions, I have heard people state their concern that there is a growing protectionist tide in the U.S. and around the world. There are even those out there who believe this resolution will help fuel this tide, but nothing could be farther from the truth. Free trade must be synonymous with fair trade, and our antidumping and countervailing duty laws target only illegal imports, not those that are fairly traded. If you really want to see a growing protectionist tide in this country, go down the road of weakening our fair trade laws and just watch what happens. Weakening these laws will lead to a flood of illegal imports like we have never seen, and the result will be scores of American companies out of business and innumerable American workers without jobs. We will then see an unprecedented discontent with foreign manufacturers and, in no time, a movement toward closing our doors to foreign imports, fair and unfair alike. If you're looking for a recipe for protectionism, weakening our existing trade laws is the quick and easy way to get there.  Nothing good can come out of reopening the antidumping and countervailing duty rules, yet there is a very real possibility that it could happen. There is a Constitutional responsibility for Congress to join with the Administration in a unified approach and let it be known that we will not sit idly by and watch our fair trade laws be bargained away. Supporting this resolution is a way for us to say that we believe American farmers and manufacturers deserve to be on an equal footing with their counterparts around the world.  I mentioned earlier that these trade laws are the backbone of America's open-market policy. Well, it is now time for this Congress and the Administration to show that they have a backbone when it comes to negotiating the future for all Americans. I urge my colleagues to stand with me today in support of the Maintain United States Trade Law Resolution.                          ____________________
