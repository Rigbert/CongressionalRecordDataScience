President, I would like to inform the Chamber that I support the nomination of Wendy Sherman to be Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs. I had previously voted against her nomination earlier this week when it was brought before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but I have received information since that leads me to change my vote.  My good friend Senator Isakson of Georgia spoke to me about his 30-plus-year relationship with the Sherman family. Ms. Sherman's mother, Miriam ``Mimi'' Sherman, started working for Northside Realty, Senator Isakson's business based in Marietta, GA, in the late seventies and eighties. Mimi Sherman, who passed away in 2005, was a terrific person, and Senator Isakson was very happy to call her a close friend and fellow coworker. He also has known Wendy during this entire time and knows that she embodies the same qualities that her mother did. He is confident that she is qualified for the position and will do a great job at the State Department as Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs.  I have great respect for the wisdom and good judgment of my friend from Georgia. We both serve on the Africa Subcommittee, and as its ranking member, Senator Isakson always ensures that the views of his fellow Republican members are fully represented, even to the point of sharing his own speaking time at hearings with members like me who are passionate about bringing relief to the people on the African Continent. And when he expresses confidence in a particular person like Wendy Sherman, whom he has known personally for over three decades, that is good enough for me.  I support Ms. Sherman's nomination to be Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs.                          ____________________
