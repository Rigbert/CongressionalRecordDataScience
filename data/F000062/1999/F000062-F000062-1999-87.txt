 President, today I am offering an amendment to require the Environmental Protection Agency to develop a plan by May 1, 2000 for bringing all underground storage tanks into compliance with federal safety requirements.  Why do we need this amendment?  Leaking underground storage tanks are the leading source of groundwater contamination and petroleum is the most common substance leaking out. Most of the 825,000 regulated underground tanks in this country store petroleum products, from the local gas station on your neighborhood corner to the industrial complex using a large motor fleet.  I am offering this amendment to make underground storage tanks safe as a way to stop the contamination of drinking water by the gasoline additive MTBE.  What is MTBE? MTBE is methyl tertiary butyl ether, a gasoline additive. It is used by most refiners to make oxygenated or reformulated gasoline. It is the oxygenate of choice by refiners who sell gasoline in areas that need clean-burning gasoline to meet or maintain clean air standards. The major way MTBE gets into groundwater is from defective underground tanks storing petroleum products.  What's Wrong with MTBE?  Unlike other components of gasoline, MTBE does not biodegrade; it has a taste like terpentine and smells like paint thinner; it gravels quickly; it is expensive to cleanup ($1 million per well in California). MTBE is carcinogenic in animals and according to U.S. EPA, ``has a human carcinogenic hazard potential.'' Dr. John Froines, a distinguished UCLA scientist, testified at a California EPA hearing on February 23, 1999 as follows:       We in our (University of California) report have concluded      the cancer evidence in animals is relevant to humans. There      are `acute effects in occupationally exposed workers      including headaches, dizziness, nausea, eye and respiratory      irritation, vomiting, sensation of spaciness or      disorientation and burning of the nose and throat.  MTBE exposure was associated with excess cancers in rats and mice, therefore, multi-species,'' and he cited ``multiple endpoints, lymphoma, leukemia testicular cancer, liver and kidney. All four of the tumor sites observed in animals may be predictive of human cancer risk.''  Where is MTBE?  The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory studied underground tank sites in California and concluded that ``a minimum estimate of the number of MTBE-impacted sites in California is greater than 10,000.'' The Association of California Water Agencies has also found MTBE at over 10,000 sites and in many of the state's surface water reservoirs. Because of widespread contamination, California Governor GrayDavis ordered a phaseout of MTBE by December 31, 2002. A major University of California study has called for a phaseout. A top-level, EPA ``Blue Ribbon'' panel of experts in July recommended reducing the use of MTBE.  Nationally, while there is no comprehensive study, we do know that MTBE has been found in drinking water in many states, including Maine, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Texas, Kansas, New York, New Jersey, Georgia, Alabama, Colorado, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Delaware, and Arizona. A U.S. EPA-funded study by the University of Massachusetts found MTBE in 251 of 422 public wells in 19 states.  Are Tanks Safe?  On December 22, 1998, all underground storage tanks had to meet federal safety requirements. EPA has said that tanks that do not meet standards can be placed into temporary closure until December 22, 1999 at which point they must be upgraded or permanently closed. Under the law, noncomplying tanks can be fined $11,000 per day per violation. The safety requirements address tank integrity, design, installation; leak detection, spill and overfill control. Tank owners had ten years to meet the deadline.  Here are the facts:  1. Many tanks are still unsafe: Many underground tanks containing gasoline still out of compliance with federal safety regulations. In the country, around 165,000 tanks (20 percent of the total) are out of compliance, according to EPA. In my state, approximately 1,900 (3 percent) are not safe.  2. Many tanks are sitting empty, in temporary closure--74,250 in the country (9 percent) and 10,430 (10 percent) in California. These tanks are just sitting there in limbo. EPA considers the tanks that are in temporary closure to be ``in compliance'' for now and this is one way tank owners ``met the deadline'' for compliance. These tanks' ultimate use needs to be determined. Someone needs to decide whether to close them permanently or upgrade them.  3. EPA has funds to act. The Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund has $1.6 billion in it. This bill appropriates $71.6 million, the President's request. The fund is financed by a 0.1 cent per gallon motor fuels tax which began in 1987, that generates about $150 million a year. The American motorist is paying this tax and in doing so, expects it to be used for the purposes authorized.  4. Even new tanks are not safe. A July 1999 study by the Santa Clara Valley Water district of its groundwater supplies found that even with the new upgrades, required by federal law by December 22, 1998, the new systems are not preventing MTBE contamination. The study, entitled ``Investigation of MTBE Occurrence Associated with Operating UST Systems,'' concluded, of 28 sites in Santa Clara county that have new or upgraded tank systems, the majority of which have not had previous gasoline contamination, 13 have evidence of MTBE in groundwater because of improper installation, operation or maintenance. The study says, ``These data indicate that MTBE may be present in ground water at approximately 50 percent of the UST facilities that meet 1998 upgrade requirements within Santa Clara County.'' Officials were clear: ``Immediate improvements are warranted.'' To me this says, enforce the law.  Similarly, in testimony in the House of Representatives on May 6, 1999 officials of the Natural Resources Defense Council made this important point:  ``. . . if gasoline contains oxygenates, future gasoline tank leaks involving MTBE appear inevitable. Even new tanks will eventually fail through material aging, operator error and accident.''  5. Contamination growing, unknown?  As I mentioned, California has had 10,000 groundwater sites impacted, as documented by the Lawrence Livermore study. Many of the state's reservoirs and surface waters have been impacted. At South Lake Tahoe, 20 percent of the water supply has been eliminated; $2 million has been spent to address it. MTBE is less than 1,000 feet from the lake. Santa Monica lost 75 percent of its groundwater supply because of MTBE. Their water system has been decimated and they will spend up to $150 million to clean up.  In a disturbing August 16 story, the New York Times reported last year, the state of New York compiled a ``public list'' of 1,500 MTBE contaminated sites, but the actual number on an ``internal list'' is closer to 7,000 sites, more than three times that reported. So this suggests that we really do not know the extent of MTBE contamination.                           time to fix tanks  EPA and the states should take steps to make tanks safe. This amendment merely says, come up with a plan: identify the tanks, their owners, their status and bring the tank into compliance or close it. Enforce the law.  EPA reported last week they ``have no information from their regions'' on enforcement actions, that there is no formal schedule or official framework for finding out what enforcement actions are being taken in (1) EPA regional offices or (2) in the states. We could obtain no national list, for example, of enforcement cases, citations, administrative orders or fines.  Today I did receive some information for region 9, the EPA region in which California is located. In this region, since the December 22, 1998 deadline, of 71,686 underground storage tanks, 80 have been inspected. Twenty-three citations have been issued. These actions, according to EPA, are ``informal enforcement,'' not ``formal enforcement.'' The citations are like a traffic ticket and usually give owners 30 days to comply. It appears that the ``formal'' enforcement mechanism, levying the $11,000 per violation fine, is not being used.  I also received an EPA memo signed by Sammy Ng, of the Office of Underground Storage Tanks, dated April 13, 1999, which says:       At the end of the first half of FY 99, states and regions      have reported over 385,000 confirmed releases. States,      regions and responsible parties initiated cleanups at 84      percent of these sites and completed cleanups at about 54      percent of the sites. . . . the data do not necessarily      reflect the full extent of current compliance with the 1998      requirements.  . . .  While this is helpful--and disturbing information--it still does not tell us what is happening to make these tanks safe for storing petroleum products.  This amendment is quite modest, in my view. It merely says to EPA, do your job. We have a strong law. Tank owners had a deadline. Leaking tanks are contaminating drinking water. Take steps to make tanks safe.  The public needs assurance that EPA and the states are enforcing the law, stopping leaks, and protecting our drinking water.  I am pleased that this important amendment has been accepted.                           amendment no. 1793 (Purpose: To extend the comment period for proposed rules related to                           the Clean Water Act)       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert:       ``The comment period on the proposed rules related to      section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act published at 64 Federal      Register 46012 and 46058 (August 23, 1999) shall be extended      from October 22, 1999, for a period of no less than 90      additional calendar days.''                                  ____                           amendment no. 1794       Section 4(a) of the Act of August 9, 1950 (16 U.S.C.      777(c(a)), is amended in the second sentence by striking of      ``1999'' and inserting ``2000''.                                  ____                           amendment no. 1795 (Purpose: To restore funding for the Montreal Protocol Fund, with an                                 offset)       On page 78, line 20, strike ``$1,885,000,000'' and insert      ``$1,897,000,000''.
