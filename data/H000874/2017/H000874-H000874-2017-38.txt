Speaker, there is a saying that Texans like to use: ``That dog won't hunt.'' It doesn't do what it is purported to do. It doesn't take Einstein to predict what will happen this time around, when he defined insanity as ``doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.''  I have been here. I have seen this. I have heard this argument. It has always resulted in the same thing.  I have more to say, but my time is up.  Mr. Speaker, let me say to the gentleman from Texas, the chairman of the committee--he is going to tell me how much people in my district get a tax break--tell me about my children and my grandchildren whose debts he will pile on them to borrow money from China, or someplace else, to give this tax cut that they will then have to pay off in their time. Tell me how much my children will have their taxes raised.  He apparently doesn't know. That is sad.
