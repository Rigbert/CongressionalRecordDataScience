 President, on May 21, students and former students, their parents, teachers and administrators of Los Altos High School, will come together in Southern California to show their appreciation, and express their thanks and best wishes to Don Gunderson, who is retiring this year after 41 years as a music educator.  Don Gunderson began his teaching career at the halfway point of President Dwight Eisenhower's second term, working with his mentor in Washington state, teaching instrumental music in the junior high, as well as music to elementary schoolers. Three years later, in 1961, Mr. Gunderson came to Anaheim, California to be the band, orchestra and choir director at Crescent Junior High School, which was still in construction when he was hired. Five years later, he began a very distinguished eleven-year career as the band and orchestra director at Savannah High School in Anaheim. In 1978, Mr. Gunderson rose to the college ranks, serving as head of the jazz and student teacher programs at California State University at Fullerton.  Three years later, in 1981, Don Gunderson decided to return to high school instruction at Los Altos High School, in Hacienda Heights. At that time, Los Altos was one of the largest musical programs in Southern California, with a strong reputation in marching band competitions. For the next nineteen years, Los Altos High School would become more than just the home of one of Southern California's largest marching bands--it would be the site of one of our nation's internationally recognized music education programs. The Los Altos Entertainment Unit has performed at the Fiesta Bowl pageant twice and marched in the Tournament of Roses Parade four times. They've been here in Washington, where they performed at the White House, and traveled for performances in Florida and the Bahamas.  Don Gunderson began building the music program's international credentials in 1982, when he led the Los Altos Entertainment Unit on a two week tour of England and Scotland. Knowing that very few, if any Americans, knew of Hacienda Heights, Mr. Gunderson was prepared when inquiring Brits asked where in the world is Hacienda Heights: ``We're not far from Disneyland'' was his reply. It's safe to say that after that 1982 trip, along with a return visit ten years later as guests of the British Military as part of the prestigious Royal Tournament, the people of Britain know how to find Hacienda Heights on a map. The same can be said for music-lovers that had the good fortune to see and hear Los Altos perform in Germany, Italy, Austria, and Switzerland. The Los Altos Entertainment Unit has been the recipient of countless awards and achievements. Los Altos was designated the Official Youth Band of the 1984 Summer Olympics, and was crowned three times as marching band champions at the Southern California Tournament of Champions. And that's just the marching band, color guard and dance team. Don Gunderson brought to Los Altos a commitment to a total music program, and strived to establish the same standard of excellence to the orchestral and jazz programs.  Perhaps just as significant are the signs of recognition and respect given to this program in ways other than award ceremonies. Go to a Friday night football game at Los Altos and you're sure to find a few young people from other high schools in Southern California in the stands not to see the football team, but to watch and hear the Entertainment Unit. Those same football games certainly sparked the imaginations of young elementary and junior high school students, who would come home interested in learning music and being a part of the Entertainment Unit. Come to the football field on a night when the Entertainment Unit is rehearsing and you're sure to find parents, students, teachers, former students, and even students from other high schools in the stands. Trace the career paths of those who learned from Don Gunderson and yes, you'll find those who have gone on to rewarding careers in music and music education. However, there are many more alumni of the Los Altos Entertainment Unit that pursued other careers, but they carry with them lessons learned from Don Gunderson on football fields, concert halls, or the band room that go beyond musical notes on a page--lessons in teamwork, preparation, determination, and excellence.  Mr. President, those who have learned and applied these and countless other lessons from Don Gunderson will have an opportunity to say thanks in a few short weeks. Let me join them in expressing my admiration to a man who has brought the joy of music to thousands of students and parents, and to countless more around the world who have heard the stirring opening fanfare, ``Conquistadores.'' Perhaps more important, let me express my own thanks to Don Gunderson for the honor and inspiration he has brought to the teaching profession for more than forty years. To borrow from the Los Altos motto, Don Gunderson has engaged and conquered.  I wish Don Gunderson, his wife Judy and his family, all the very best.                          ____________________
