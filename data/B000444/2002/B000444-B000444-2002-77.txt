 President, each year on the last Sunday in August, a commemorative festival is held in Wilmington, DE. Known as the Big Quarterly, or the August Quarterly, the festival celebrates the heritage of the independent black church movement, and the continuing importance of the movement's cultural, political and social, as well as religious, influence.  For us in Delaware, as for our Nation as a whole, the history is both proud and painful. The first fully independent black church was founded in Wilmington in 1813; originally called the Union Church of Africans, it is now known as the African Union Methodist Protestant, AUMP, Church. It was founded by a former slave, Peter Spencer, and was built on land purchased with the help of Delaware's Quaker community, which notably included the station-master of the Underground Railroad, Thomas Garrett.  Affectionately known as ``Father,'' and formally as Bishop, Peter Spencer believed in the ``twin'' forces of education and religion to empower and to liberate African-Americans. The movement toward religious freedom was closely linked with the anti-slavery campaign, just as predominantly black churches in more recent times have provided leadership in the civil-rights movement and in the ongoing work toward equality of opportunity.  The Big Quarterly, also initiated in 1813, commemorates the founding of the Mother AUMP Church, and honors Peter Spencer's visionary leadership. The festival combines worship with a cultural celebration and a sprit of reunion, of renewing ties with family, friends and with a history of activism that continues to inspire us all.  The history and spirit represented by the Big Quarterly are important to our identity and character as a community and as a nation. It is an event that both reminds us of what has been overcome, and challenges us to complete the journey.                          ____________________
