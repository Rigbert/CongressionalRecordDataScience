 I will not give a long speech at this point on the vote that just occurred. I wish to take a second to respond to the partisanship aspect of this debate. I cannot speak for anybody but this Senator.  It would be one thing if the overtime amendment were the only one that we had to deal with, but we have seen lists, I think, of up to maybe 10 nongermane amendments that may have been potentially part of this debate. So you can understand, there may be 10 legitimate issues that are nongermane to this debate which ought to be discussed on the Senate floor, as per the right of every Senator, as expressed by the Senator from Nevada; but they don't all have to be discussed on this very important bill before the Senate.  This is a very important bipartisan bill before the Senate. It is one thing to deal with an overtime amendment; it is quite another thing to deal with an environment in which the minority may be expecting us to deal with vast numbers of nongermane amendments. That is very difficult and it is that sort of environment which brings about a cloture vote.  As my friend from Montana has stated, I hope we do get this behind us. The germane amendments will take very little time and we can then move past this bill. This bill will pass overwhelmingly when we get it up for a vote.  I yield the floor.
