Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today and pay tribute to an outstanding citizen of Indiana's First Congressional District, Billy Rosser. On Saturday, February 25, 1995, Mr. Rosser, along with his friends and family, will celebrate his retirement from public office. The celebration will take place at Rosser Hall in Hobart, IN.  Billy has dedicated a substantial portion of his life to the betterment of northwest Indiana, particularly Hobart Township.  After a 30-year career with Inland Steel's accounting department, Billy retired to pursue a life of public service. In 1970, Billy was elected Hobart Township Trustee, and throughout his 24-year role in this position, Billy has successfully led Hobart Township into one of the only debt-free townships in the county. With an emphasis on the improvement of education amongst Hobart Township's youth, as chief administrator of Hobart, and as a member of the Lake County Board of Education, Billy was instrumental in the restructuring of the Hobart Township school system from 1971 through 1974. During his tenure as Hobart Township Trustee, Billy procured funds to establish Rosser Hall, which is utilized for various celebrations, and Rosser Park. The moneys generated from these structures flow back into Hobart Township, and are applied directly to the township's assistance fund.  Billy has held past presidencies of the Lake County Township Trustee Association, the East Gary Police Association, and the Hobart Township Lake Ridge Community Services. He served as chairman of the Lake Station-Hobart Township Precinct Organization, and director of the East Gary Democratic Club. Billy holds memberships in the Hobart Elks, the Lions Club, the Shriner's organization, the Fraternal Order of Police Associations of Hobart and Lake Station, as well as membership on the advisory board for the Regional Lake Station Bank of Indiana Board of Directors. This year, Billy was recognized by the Indiana Township Trustees Association for his years of service and success as the Hobart Township Trustee and as the original president of the Lake County Township Trustee Association.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my colleagues to join me in honoring this amazing person for his commitment to the betterment of his community. However, as one great public servant leaves, I am sure that Ms. Barbara Rosser will continue to carry on her father's legacy as the new Hobart Township trustee. I truly hope that the Rosser's celebration this Saturday proves to be a most joyous occasion.                          ____________________
