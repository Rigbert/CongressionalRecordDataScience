Madam Speaker, today I am introducing legislation that will help people who have looked around their community and seen a great need. They have answered a call to national service. They are AmeriCorps volunteers.  Segal AmeriCorps Education Awards are offered to volunteers after they complete their service so they can pay for an education. The award is $4,725 for a year of full-time service. It is prorated for part-time. Unfortunately it is taxed as regular income. This legislation makes clear that the Segal AmeriCorps Education Awards are not income and should not be subject to income taxes. The AmeriCorps Education Award should be a source of inspiration to serve not a source of fear on tax day.  People trying to pay for college cannot afford to be hit by extra taxes on this education benefit, not while they are still in school, and not when they are struggling to make ends meet through working their first job. People cannot afford an unjust tax bill at the same time their student loans are coming due. People cannot afford to receive less financial aid because this award is counted as income and makes student loan applicants appear to have more ability to afford college than they actually do.  Now is the time to believe in people again. Now is the time to believe in the power of change. We must find every way to reinforce just how important it is that the American people engage in volunteer service to their country. We must make the future a better future. AmeriCorps volunteers are out there every day, leading the way, getting in the way and making good change. This bill invests in the power of change.                          ____________________
