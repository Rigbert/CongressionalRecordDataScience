 President, let me suggest another consent agreement that might make more sense. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator modify his previous request so that just prior to proceeding as requested, the three cloture votes would be vitiated and then the Senate immediately proceed to three consecutive votes on the confirmation of the nominations with no intervening action or debate.
