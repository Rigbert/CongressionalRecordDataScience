Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  If the gentleman would go to the microphone, I would like to ask the gentleman a question, and I will yield to him.  Your assertion is that Mexico asked the Government of the United States to include a waiver of our financial services reform provisions in section 105 in this agreement, and the Obama administration didn't agree to that but Mexico signed the agreement anyway, and now you're trying to help out the government of Mexico to get something that you claim they wanted but didn't get from this administration; is that correct?  I yield to the gentleman from Arizona.
