President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, for his kind words earlier this morning. He is the supporter of the Leahy-McCain-Daschle, et al, amendment pending before thebody. I will speak further at an appropriate time when I am not imposing on the time reserved by our colleagues. I wanted to thank Senator McCain for his support of the amendment and for his kind remarks.  I yield the floor.
