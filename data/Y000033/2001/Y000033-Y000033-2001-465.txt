Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce legislation which will facilitate and promote the successful commercial reuse of the former Naval Air Facility on Adak Island, Alaska. At the same time, this legislation will allow the Aleut people of Alaska to reclaim the island and to make use of its modern developments and important location.  The legislation I introduce today ratifies an agreement between The Aleut Corporation, an Alaska Native Regional Corporation, the Department of the Interior, and the Department of the Navy. ``The Agreement Concerning the Conveyance of Property at the Adak Naval Complex, Adak,'' Alaska was signed last September and is the result of more than four years of discussions and negotiations among the three parties.  The bill and the Agreement also further the conservation of important wildlife habitat. A portion of Adak is within the Aleutian Islands subunit of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. The Agreement facilitates the Department of the Interior's continued management and protection of the Refuge lands on Adak and even adds some of the Navy lands to the Refuge. Moreover, in exchange for the developed Navy lands, which are not suitable for the Refuge, but are commercially useful, The Aleut Corporation will convey environmentally sensitive lands it holds elsewhere in the Refuge to the Department of the Interior.  For many years the Navy was an important constituent in Alaska's Aleutian Chain. Its presence was first established during World War II with the selection and development of the island because of its combination of ability to support a major airfield and its natural and protected deep water port. The Navy's presence there contributed greatly to the defenseof our Pacific coast during World War II and throughout the Cold War. Through the Navy's presence, Adak became the largest development in the Aleutians as well as Alaska's sixth largest community. With the end of The Cold War our defense needs changed, however, and Adak was selected for closure during the last base closure round.  Those very same features that made Adak strategically important for defense purposes also make it important for commercial purposes. Adak is a natural stepping stone to Asia and is at the crossroads of air and sea trade between North America, Europe, and Asia. With the ability to use Adak commercially, the Aleut people, through The Aleut Corporation can establish it as an important intercontinental location with enterprise enough to provide year round jobs for the Aleut people. These goals are consistent with the promises and the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, the legislation that created the corporation.  This rebirth of Adak is already well underway. The Aleut people assumed responsibility for the operation of the Island from the Navy last October and there are a number of new commercial enterprises and endeavors. At the same time a new community has begun to take shape. Just last month the new City of Adak was established as a result of a public referendum and is in the process of taking over responsibility for the many public facilities.  The Agreement resolves a number of important issues related to the transfer of this former military base and the establishment of the new community on Adak, including responsibility for environmental remediation, institutional controls, indemnification, required public access, and reservation of lands for government use.  This legislation furthers this country's objectives of conversion of closed defense facilities into successful commercial reuse, it benefits the Aleut people and restores them to their ancestral lands and it benefits the National Wildlife Refuge System. I believe everyone will agree that such legislation is important and worthy of our support.                          ____________________
