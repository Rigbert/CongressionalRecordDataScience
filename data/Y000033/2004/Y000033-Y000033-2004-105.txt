Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Again, we are about to close this very long 2 days. We will have a seriesof three votes: the Bradley amendment vote, the Kennedy amendment vote, the Isakson amendment vote, and motion to recommit, and then final passage. Again, I can suggest to most of the Members of this House that this has been a long, trying time, but one which I take great pride in.  Regardless of what my colleagues read in the two rag sheets in this body, and they are constantly reporting and trying to divide this House, to try to pit one against the other in different fashions, we have overcome that and I think have come out with a very good piece of bipartisan legislation.  Yes, there are some that do not agree with it, and I understand that. But overall, if we believe in the national transportation system, and I want to stress, the national transportation system, H.R. 3550, the $275 billion does not completely do the job, but it is the nearest thing we can do at this time.  I will say right up front, a motion to recommit is very attractive, but it should not be done because it does break the budget against the budget resolution that passed the House; and it does, in fact, send a message to the Senate, but it does not accomplish the goals that I am trying to achieve, and that is to pass legislation so we can make a step forward, a step forward to the progress that is necessary to get our country moving, to keep this country moving, to make sure our people and our products move.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
