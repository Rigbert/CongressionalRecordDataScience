It is just great to be here this evening and to have so many women gathered on the floor--women Members. That in itself is historic.  As an Ohio Representative, I want to voice my support of your bill, H.R. 863, the National Women's History Commission Act, to study the potential creation of a National Women's History Museum in Washington, D.C., on our mall of democracy, our Nation's Mall.  I can't thank Carolyn Maloney of New York and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee more on behalf of the people whom I represent. The part of Ohio that I come from has really been the leading region of our State to elevate women to public life. I will enter some of that in the Record this evening, but in a personal way, let me say that, when I first got here in the 1980s, there were 24 women who were serving in the House.                              {time}  2000  A dear, dear Member from Louisiana, Congresswoman Lindy Boggs, took me and shepherded me through those rather unusual days. I can remember finally being elected to the Appropriations Committee. When I walked in, there were only the two of us. Virginia Smith from Nebraska was there. Virginia was a Republican. That was it. And me. It was just a different experience. It was like you ended up in heaven and you just saw who was there for the first time.  Over the years, I befriended many people. In 1995, I wrote a book about the women of Congress. I thought it would be easy. But what I found so difficult was, where were the primary materials? I ended up spending more time doing research on women who had served up to that point. I thought, Wow, this is really a huge vacuum.  I drove up to Maine to interview then retired-Senator Margaret Chase Smith. I recorded her. She had created next to her home a tiny little museum where she had some of her papers, and I thought, Oh, my gosh, there really isn't any place for this nationally, and yet this is such a significant person--the first woman to have served both in the House and the Senate.  So as I got into that book, I realized how these materials were all over the country and not really well gathered at all. Then, one of the women from our State, Mary Regula, who was married to former Congressman Ralph Regula of Ohio, worked for years to build the National First Ladies Museum in Canton, Ohio. I went there for the dedication. I am on the board. I saw how Mary and Ralph fought for that for years. It should have been so easy, but it was so hard.  As you go through that particular museum and you start reading the lives of the First Ladies, you are actually shocked to read what really happened and the materials that have been brought together. It was proof to me that the history of women really is yet to be recorded.  So I came down here tonight to compliment you on your efforts and to say that in the region that I come from, we have now seen women rise to positions of heading universities and major corporations. Obviously, women are the anchors for their families and communities in so many ways. They are physicians, engineers, attorneys, judges, athletes, Justices of our Supreme Court. Janet Yellen is now the first woman to head the Federal Reserve of our country. Finally, maybe she will straighten things out.  They are military personnel and legislators. They are career paths that had once been blocked or not even considered for women.  I wanted to come down here this evening and say I stand with you.  I am dedicating my remarks tonight in honor of a constituent of my own district, Mrs. Mattie McAlister, who has just celebrated her 90th birthday. Even as she begins her tenth decade of life, she maintains a full schedule. She is a grandma to all. She teaches children--and she has for years--full time at the Grace Community Center in the heart of our community of Toledo.  The lessons she has learned in her own life are passed on to new generations as the children learn through example. Mrs. McAlister maintains an active social life as well and is involved civic and church life. Throughout her life she has never hesitated to be involved serving her family, church, and community with dignity and grace.  She deserves to be honored in this Women's History Month because she is, fundamentally, a teacher. No child that walks by her doesn't learn. All these years that she has technically been retired, she still teaches in a community that is most in need of her shepherding ways and her incredible gifts as a teacher.  So I want to compliment both of you for allowing the American people to record the history of over half of our citizenry in a way that brings them into full view.  I can guarantee you that you have begun a project that is going to take the rest of your lives to complete. It is a mammoth undertaking, and one that certainly deserves our attention here in the Congress. How great to be living in this great moment in history where we can actually make it a reality.
