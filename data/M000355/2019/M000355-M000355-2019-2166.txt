 President, one final matter--last week, our Nation received yet another wave of good news about our strong economy and all the opportunities it is creating for working Americans.  Republicans' pro-growth, pro-family economic policies have helped our Nation's job creators and small businesses hit the accelerator, and middle-class families across the country continue to reap the rewards.  The Labor Department tracks the total amount that U.S. employers spend each year on wages and benefits for workers. Last quarter, the year-on-year increase was the highest it has been in more than 10 years. Last month, the total percentage of Americans who are employed hit its highest mark since December 2008.  Let me say that again. Following Republican policies, we are now seeing the largest annual jump in a decade in the amount spent on workers' compensation and a higher percentage of Americans working than we saw at any point--at any point--under President Obama.  An expert described these data to the New York Times: ``Employers are still actively looking for jobs, and with wages ticking up, it looks like workers are getting some more bargaining power.''  Another expert put it this way: ``The virtuous cycle continues . . . a virtuous cycle of a continuously growing U.S. labor market.''  So I am confident we will hear more about this from the President in his address Tuesday evening. The state of our Nation's economy is thriving and working Americans are feeling the boost. This is what happens when Republican policies get Washington out of the way.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
