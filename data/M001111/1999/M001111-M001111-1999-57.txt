 Every parent knows smaller class size is important. It is the question they ask their children when they come home on the first day of school: How many kids are in your classroom? They ask that question because every parent knows the smaller the class, the better chance at learning.  But the fact is, we want our Federal dollars spent in areas that will really work. We have, as a Senate, looked at studies--the STARS study the Senator from Massachusetts just mentioned--and the fact is, when we spend Federaldollars and we are partners with our local districts in reducing class size, it makes a difference for our students.  As the Senator from Massachusetts said, students in smaller classes have significantly higher grades, as found in a STARS study that followed these kids from the early grades all the way through senior year in high school. In fact, in English, smaller classes had a 76.1-percent average--higher than these. In math it was higher, and in science it was higher. This is real. These dollars make a difference. It means students will learn the skills every one of us wants them to learn, and studies back them up. This money makes a difference.
