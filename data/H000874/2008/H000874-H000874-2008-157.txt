 We all agree that this should have been done earlier. At least all of us in this body agree that it should have been done earlier. Frankly, I presume that everybody in the other body agrees that it should have been done earlier.  The problem has been, as you well know, the failure to get agreement and to get 60 votes in the Senate to allow almost any alternative to go forward. Obviously, we passed a bill that had pay-fors in it, which is what you're talking about, some of which were unacceptable to many on your side and to some on our side.  Whatever we offer is going to be paid for. Mr. Dingell and Mr. Rangel, in particular, and his committee are working on that as we speak to see what they can fashion, and we hope that the two-thirds majority necessary to pass a suspension bill will be there--we'll see--but we'll be working on this next week.
