Speaker, today I speak not only as a member of the House of Representatives, but as a proud member of a very important organization that is making a difference in my district. The Science and Technology Education Partnership (STEP) was recently established to inspire students to pursue careers in science, math, engineering and technology throughout the Riverside community, the state of California and the nation.  On November 3, 2000, STEP sponsored ``STEP One: The Congressional Conference on Science and Technology Education.'' This wonderful conference allowed local students, teachers, community and civic leaders, scientists and high-tech entrepreneurs an opportunity to meet and discover the importance of math and science education.  It was inspiring to see the faces of nearly 1,000 students light up with excitement during the conference's student program which included NASA Astronaut Vance Brand, chemical experiments and a `life in space' space science presentation.  I was honored to present National Teachers Hall of Fame inductee, Jaime Escalante, with the inaugural STEP Award. The panel discussion focusing on the gap between math and science education and the needs of the high-tech sector was an enlightening finale to the conference.  On behalf of everyone involved in the STEP Conference, I would like to give a special thanks to those who sponsored the event including: Complas, The Business-Press, Bourns, DynCorp, Naval Warfare Assessment Station, General Atomics, California Space and Technology Alliance, The Gas Company and Vertigo.  Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I would like to give praise to those who volunteered their time and energy to get the STEP foundation up and running. My fellow board members of the STEP foundation have all greatly contributed to this effort, they include: Steve Berry, Dave Bernal, Linda Burk, Dr. Damon Castillo, Troy Clarke, Dr. James Erickson, Dr. Susan Hackwood, Dr. Joseph Norbeck and Brian Wagner.                          ____________________
