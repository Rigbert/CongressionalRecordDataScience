We throw that word around here on the Senate floor, and it usually doesn't mean much, but it is true. We are friends. I respect him very much. I think he is a good father, good grandfather, and I think the time will come--and I hope soon--when we can sit down and take his proposal and my proposal and put them together and make a bill we will both be proud of. We have done that before, even to the point of getting the President to sign the bill into law.  For the time being and because his proposal cuts some Medicaid benefits that are a great concern to me, I am going to object in the hope that we can use this opportunity and this moment as a basis for sitting down and finding a bill we can agree on.  I object.
