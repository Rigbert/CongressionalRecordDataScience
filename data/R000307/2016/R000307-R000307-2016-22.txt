President, I wish to start off my remarks with regard to the bill that is before us. There is an article from The Hill newspaper, and it is quoting Julie Borlaug, who is the granddaughter of Norman Borlaug, a University of Minnesota graduate who helped to spark the green revolution in agriculture technology that is credited with saving more than 1 billion people from dying of hunger.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article from The Hill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From The Hill, Mar. 16, 2016]Safe, Proven Biotechnology Deserves Non-Stigmatizing National Labeling                                 Standard                           (By Julie Borlaug)       Global hunger is one of the most pressing challenges of the      21st century and the problem will only get worse if the U.S.      Senate fails to take action and prevent a costly state-by-     state patchwork of labeling mandates for food containing      genetically modified organisms (GMOs).       In a Senate Agriculture Committee mark-up last week, Sen.      Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) correctly noted that ``science is an      essential piece of the puzzle in addressing food      insecurity.'' The senator also praised the legacy of my      grandfather, Dr. Norman Borlaug, a University of Minnesota      graduate who helped spark the green revolution in      agricultural technology that is credited with saving more      than 1 billion people from dying of hunger.       I am glad to see my grandfather's work praised. And, as an      associate director for the Borlaug Institute for      International Agriculture, I want to see his work, and the      work of his fellow agricultural scientists, protected. That      means ensuring that innovations in agricultural biotechnology      aren't sent to the dustbin of history, leaving future      generations asking why good solutions were abandoned.       It really comes down to a simple label. In July, Vermont is      set to become the first state to begin enforcing a GMO      labeling mandate. The impacts will be felt on store shelves      and in science labs around this country. Make no mistake--     these state labeling efforts are not about a so-called `right      to know' but are about enabling activists to drive GMOs out      of the marketplace. Leaders in the labeling movement      acknowledge this, with one saying ``If we have it labeled,      then we can organize people not to buy it.''       These dangerous efforts undermine the critical importance      of biotechnology and the role it plays in feeding the world.      With the help of modern science and GMOs, farmers now have      the ability to produce crops that better withstand droughts      and require fewer pesticides. They can adapt genetic codes to      acclimate to new environments, and ensure that crops grow      well despite inhospitable climates.       You cannot be anti-hunger and be anti-GMO. GMOs not only      make farming more sustainable, they directly impact national      and global food security at a time when warming temperatures      and rising populations mean that those living in poverty will      face increasingly unstable supplies of food.       The safety of GMOs is as clear as their benefits. Every      major scientific organization that has examined this issue      has concluded that they are safe as any other food. Those      denying their safety are denying the science.       By allowing state-mandated on package labeling of GMO      foods, Congress would be turning its back on decades of      advancements in biotechnology and allowing a small group of      activists to deny millions of people the tools that will      prevent starvation and death. We cannot allow that to happen.       Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts (R-Kan.)      has put forward a bipartisan proposal that would establish      national standards for food made with genetically-engineered      ingredients. The Biotech Labeling Solutions Act would prevent      a costly state-by-state patchwork of labeling mandates. It      would also help ensure that providing greater information      could go hand-in-hand with providing greater education at a      national level about the safety and importance of GMO crops.      The Senate Agriculture Committee supported moving his bill to      the full Senate by a 14-6 bipartisan vote.       Now, we need senators of both parties to come together to      support this common-sense approach.       Sixteen years ago, my grandfather wrote that the world      would soon have the agricultural technologies available to      feed the 8.3 billion people anticipated in the next quarter      of a century. The more pertinent question is whether farmers      and ranchers will be permitted to use these technologies.       The members of the Senate will decide that very question in      their votes on the Biotech Labeling Solutions Act. For the      sake of science and the world, the answer needs to be yes.
