Speaker, It is with great pleasure and admiration that I congratulate Dr. William P. Sexton, of South Bend, Indiana, as he retires after more than thirty years of devoted service to the University of Notre Dame. I can truly say Dr. Sexton is one of the most dedicated, distinguished and committed citizens I have had the pleasure of knowing. Dr. Sexton will be retiring from the University on June 30, 2002. Notre Dame has certainly been rewarded by the true service and uncompromising loyalty he has displayed to its students, alumni, and community.  A native of Columbus, Ohio, Dr. Sexton earned his bachelor's degree in business administration, his master's degree in industrial management, and his doctorate in administrative management and behavioral sciences at Ohio State University. Dr. Sexton began his teaching career at Notre Dame in 1966, where he taught courses specializing in organizational development, corporate strategy, human behavior and group dynamics.  Dr. Sexton, professor and former chair of management and administrative sciences, currently serves as Vice President for University Relations at Notre Dame. In his role he oversees the University's efforts in community relations, publications, and special events, as well as the Notre Dame Alumni Association and Notre Dame Magazine. Under Dr. Sexton's direction, the University is engaged in the most successful capital campaign in the history of Catholic higher education, which already has surpassed its goal of $767 million.  During his years at Notre Dame, Bill Sexton has demonstrated a sincere love for the community in which he lives. While he has dedicated considerable time and energy to his work, he has always made an extra effort to give back to the community. He has volunteered his time to champion many causes aimed at bringing comfort to those in need of assistance. Throughout the years, Dr. Sexton has served in many different leadership positions and has been very involved in several organizations including: South Bend's Center for the Homeless, St. Joseph's Regional Medical Center, and the Logan Foundation. Additionally, he has conducted numerous management seminars for U.S. government agencies, hospitals, and religious communities and has served as an advisor to several not-for-profit health care systems.  Though Dr. Sexton is dedicated to his career and community, he has never limited his time and love for his family. He and his wife Ann, have six children and thirteen grandchildren, of whom they are immensely proud.  Mr. Speaker, Bill has truly dedicated his life to his God, Country and Notre Dame. He is one of the finest gentlemen I know. I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Dr. William P. Sexton for his service to the University of Notre Dame. The people at Notre Dame will surely miss his enthusiasm, but we wish him happiness and good health in his well-deserved retirement.                          ____________________
