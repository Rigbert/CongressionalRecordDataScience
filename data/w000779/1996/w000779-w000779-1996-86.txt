President, I rise today to introduce two new bills which I believe will help more fully inform patients and consumers about the health care choices they face, and safeguard the most critical relationship between care giver and patient.  The first bill, which I introduce with my colleagues Senator Snowe and Senator Boxer, is the Health Care Quality Improvements Act of 1996. It amends and improves the 1986 public law which created the national practitioner databank, an informational resource maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services which is a compendium of State disciplinary actions and civil malpractice case judgments against caregivers. As of this year, some 86,000 caregivers are listed in this taxpayer-supported databank. Currently, this informational resource is accessible only by hospitals, insurance plans, and State boards of medicine and health care licensing. The legislation introduced by Senator Snowe and me, today, would for the first time allow public access to critically important databank records. Caregivers who have had at least three reportable incidents in their files would have their entire databank records opened to the public. This legislation also would create an Internet site on the World Wide Web allowing easier access for publicly accessible information.  The second bill, the Patient Communications Protection Act of 1996, would make illegal provisions in some contracts between caregivers and health plans which restrict communications between caregivers and their patients. Too often, I believe, these contract provisions limit the free and necessary communications of information to patients regarding their medical condition and all possible modalities of treatment. This legislation, while upholding the right of plans to work with physicians to improve the overall quality of care within a health plan, clearly restricts plans from impeding the free flow of medical information between State-licensed caregivers and patient.  The Health Care Quality Improvements Act is endorsed by a number of groups including Families USA, Consumer Action, the National Association of Health Data Organizations, and the United Seniors Health Cooperative.  The Patient Communications Protection Act is supported by the Oregon Medical Association, the American Association of Retired Persons, the Center for Patient Advocacy, Citizen Action, the Consumers Union, and the American College of Emergency Physicians.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2004       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Health Care Quality      Improvement Act Amendments of 1996''.     SEC. 2. STANDARDS FOR PROFESSIONAL REVIEW ACTIONS.       Section 412(a) of the Health Care Quality Improvement Act      of 1986 (42 U.S.C. 11112(a)) is amended in the matter after      and below paragraph (4) by adding at the end the following      sentence: ``A motion for summary judgment that such standards      have been met shall be granted unless, considering the      evidence in the light most favorable to the opposing party, a      reasonable finder of fact could conclude that the presumption      has been so rebutted. The decision on such a motion may be      appealed as of right, without regard to whether the motion is      granted or denied, and the courts of appeals (other than the      United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit) have      jurisdiction of appeals from such decisions of the district      courts.''.     SEC. 3. REQUIRING REPORTS ON MEDICAL MALPRACTICE DATA.

(b) Substantive Effect.--Except as provided in subsection      (c)(1) and subsection (d), and except as otherwise provided      in this Act--       (1) the amendments made by this Act take effect upon the      expiration of the 1-year period beginning on the date of the      enactment of this Act; and       (2) prior to the expiration of such period, the Health Care      Quality Improvement Act of 1986, as in effect on the day      before such date of enactment, continues in effect.       (c) Regulations.--       (1) In general.--With respect to the amendments made by      this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services may      issue regulations pursuant to such amendments before the      expiration of the period specified in subsection (b)(1), and      may otherwise take appropriate action before the expiration      of such period to prepare for the responsibilities of the      Secretary to the amendments.       (2) Absence of final rule.--The final rule for purposes of      paragraph (1) may not take effect before the expiration of      the period specified in subsection (b)(1), and the absence of      such a rule upon such expiration does not affect the      provisions of subsection (b).       (d) Transitional Provisions Regarding Malpractice Payments      by Persons.--With respect to the reporting of information      under section 421 of the Health Care Quality Improvement Act      of 1986, the following applies:       (1) The requirement of reporting by persons under section      421(a)(1) of such Act (as amended by section 3(a) of this      Act) takes effect 180 days after the date of the enactment of      this Act.       (2) The requirement of reporting by persons applies to      payments under such section 421(a)(1) made before, on, or      after such date of enactment.       (3)(A) The information received by the Secretary of Health      and Human Services on or before August 27, 1993, pursuant to      regulations requiring reports from persons (in addition to      reports from entities) shall be maintained in the same manner      as the information was maintained prior to such date, and      shall be available in accordance with the regulations in      effect under such Act prior to such date (which regulations      remain in effect unless a provision of this Act takes effect      pursuant to this section and requires otherwise).

S. 2005       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Patient      Communications Protection Act of 1996''.       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:       (1) Patients need access to all relevant information to      make appropriate decisions, with their physicians, about      their health care.       (2) Restrictions on the ability of physicians to provide      full disclosure of all relevant information to patients      making health care decisions violate the principles of      informed consent and practitioner ethical standards.       (3) The offering and operation of health plans affect      commerce among the States. Health care providers located in      one State serve patients who reside in other States as well      as that State. In order to provide for uniform treatment of      health care providers and patients among the States, it is      necessary to cover health plans operating in one State as      well as those operating among the several States.     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION OF INTERFERENCE WITH CERTAIN MEDICAL                    COMMUNICATIONS.       (a) In General.--       (1) Prohibition of certain provisions.--Subject to      paragraph (2), an entity offering a health plan (as defined      in subsection (d)(2)) may not include any provision that      prohibits or restricts any medical communication (as defined      in subsection (b)) as part of--       (A) a written contract or agreement with a health care      provider,       (B) a written statement to such a provider, or       (C) an oral communication to such a provider.       ``(2) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be      construed as preventing an entity from exercising mutually      agreed upon terms and conditions not inconsistent with      paragraph (1), including terms or conditions requiring      caregivers to participate in, and cooperate with, all      programs, policies, and procedure developed or operated by      the person, corporation, partnership, association, or other      organization to ensure, review, or improve the quality of      health care.       (3) Nullification.--Any provision described in paragraph      (1) is null and void.       (b) Medical Communication Defined.--In this section, the      term ``medical communication'' means a communication made by      a health care provider with a patient of the provider (or the      guardian or legal representative of such patient) with      respect to the patient's physician or mental condition or      treatment options.       (c) Enforcement Through Imposition of Civil Money      Penalty.--       (1) In general.--Any entity that violates paragraph (1) of      subsection (a) shall be subject to a civil money penalty of      up to $15,000 for each violation. No such penalty shall be      imposed solely on the basis of an oral communication unless      the communication is part of a pattern or practice of such      communications and the violation is demonstrated by a      preponderance of the evidence.       (2) Procedures.--The provisions of subsections (c) through      (l) of section 1128A of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.      1320a-7a) shall apply to civil money penalties under      paragraph (1) in the same manner as they apply to a penalty      or proceeding under section 1128A(a) to a penalty or      proceeding under section 1128A(a) of such Act.       (d) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:       (1) Health care provider.--The term ``health care      provider'' means anyone licensed under State law to provide      health care services, including a practitioner such as a      nurse anesthetist or chiropractor who is so licensed.       (2) Health plan.--The term ``health plan'' means any public      or private health plan or arrangement (including an employee      welfare benefit plan) which provides, or pays the cost of,      health benefits, and includes an organization of health care      providers that furnishes health services under a contract or      agreement with such a plan.       (3) Coverage of third party administrators.--In the case of      a health plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan (as      defined in section 3(1) of the Employee Retirement Income      Security Act of 1974), any third party administrator or other      person with responsibility for contracts with health care      providers under the plan shall be considered, for purposes of      this section, to be an entity offering such health plan.       (e) Non-Preemption of State Law.--A State may establish or      enforce requirements with respect to the subject matter of      this section, but only if such requirements are consistent      with the Act and are more protective of medical      communications than the requirements established under this      section.       (g) Effective Date.--Subsection (a) shall take effect 180      days after the date of the enactment of this Act and shall      apply to medical communications made on or after such date.                                 ______                                       By
