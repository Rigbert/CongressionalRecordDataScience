R. 1314 be agreed to, and that Senator Hatch be recognized to offer substitute amendment No. 1221 and a first-degree amendment to strike title 2 of the amendment. I further ask that the following amendments be the only other amendments in order during today's session of the Senate: Brown No. 1242 and Lankford No. 1237.  I further ask that when the Senate resumes consideration of H.R. 1314 on Monday, May 18, the time until 5:30 p.m. be equally divided between the managers or their designees, and that at 5:30, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Brown and Lankford amendments in that order, with no second-degree amendments in order prior to the votes, and a 60-affirmative-vote threshold for adoption.
