Mr. Speaker, the Los Angeles Times succeeded in doing something this week that Speaker Gingrich has refused to do for years--release the names of the contributors to his political machine, GOPAC.  The partial listing published by the Times shows that one couple gave GOPAC more than $715,000 while other contributors made more than $300,000 available apiece. But who and how many more contributors are there? There are many questions that remain unanswered.  That is why the chorus of respected voices calling for an outside counsel is getting louder and louder.  The New York Times, Roll Call, the respected public advocacy group, Public Citizen, former Special Counsel Richard Phelan, and Al Hunt of the conservative Wall Street Journal all agree: Only an outside counsel can put this matter to rest.                          ____________________
