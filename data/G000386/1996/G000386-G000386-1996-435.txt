 First, they want us to believe that this is a legal issue. Commander Stumpf seems to have the mistaken notion that a promotion to captain in the Navy is an inalienable right.  He sees the committee erecting a barrier between himself and that right. So he has hired a fancy lawyer to reclaim that right under the law.  Well, sadly, I am afraid that Commander Stumpf may be in for a big disappointment. As Senator Nunn put it, ``It is well known that nomination proceedings are not criminal trials. They are not formal evidentiary proceedings.''  A promotion is not guaranteed under the law. In fact, as we all know, it must be earned, and not only earned, but confirmed by the Senate.  This, Mr. President, brings me to my second point. Each Senator must make a subjective judgment about a candidate's character. We have to examine the entire record, and then we have to pick and choose.  Sadly, Commander Stumpf and his lawyer somehow believe that the Senate should not sit in judgment of a nominee's character. Two Navy captain selection boards and Secretary of the Navy Dalton decided that Commander Stumpf should be promoted. End of the story for them. The Senate should somehow butt out.  Again, Senators Nunn and Coats have laid this misguided idea to rest. They put it this way: ``The Senate has a constitutional responsibility to give advice and consent on military promotions.''  That is our constitutional duty. We look at the evidence, and we make judgment calls. We know it is not an exact science. It is an imperfect system, but most of the time it seems to work.  This brings me to the third source of my concern. Those who are pushing the Stumpf promotion want us to think he is a victim of political correctness. Mr. President, that is pure, 100 percent, grade-A, Navy baloney. I happen to believe that Commander Stumpf's problems run much deeper than that. They go right to the core of his character. His behavior at the 1991 Tailhook convention raises questions about his ability to lead.  Mr. President, I am not holding Commander Stumpf to some arbitrary standard dreamed up by this Senator. I am holding him to the military's own standards.  The military standards are laid out in a document entitled ``Military Leadership, Field Manual 22-100.'' Those principles are described on pages 5 through 8 of the document. This is an exact quote from the document:       No aspect of leadership is more powerful than setting a      good example.  So, Mr. President, I feel obliged to ask this very simple question: Did Commander Stumpf set a good example at Tailhook? A former Naval officer, writing in the Washington Times recently, answered that question. I want to quote directly from the April 1, 1996, article:       Officers throughout the Navy--particularly Naval aviators      like Commander Stumpf--were well aware that the Tailhook      convention had become an increasingly grotesque event before      it finally suffered public scrutiny in 1991.       That Commander Stumpf finds himself having been caught in      the fallout is a result of the poor judgment he showed in      participating when many of his contemporaries had stopped      doing it years before.  That says it all, Mr. President.  Commander Stumpf's behavior also raises questions about his willingness to accept responsibility. The military leadership manual states that a leader must do two things: First, seek responsibility and, second, take responsibility for his or her actions. By seeking and accepting responsibility, a leader can build trust within his or her military unit.  Clearly, Commander Stumpf is eagerly and aggressively seeking greater responsibility. He has an aggressive lobbying campaign going to get himself promoted. He is doing a good job of that lobbying.  Unfortunately, he is not very good at accepting criticism for his past mistakes. It seems like he is trying to evade responsibility.  Commander Stumpf claims he did not witness the really obscene behavior at his squadron's Tailhook party. It happened after he left, and if he did not see it, he is not responsible, so he claims. Commander Stumpf's ship ran aground when he was not on the bridge. That is what he wants us to believe. He wants us to believe that his junior officers are to blame. In effect, he is saying that.  Commander Stumpf's reasoning is flawed, and it is inconsistent with naval tradition and leadership and the responsibility that is placed on leaders in the military manual. The ship's captain is always responsible if the ship runs aground.  When something like this happens, the manual says a leader should never try to evade responsibility by blaming others. When a commander tries to shift the blame to others, the manual says that undermines trust and respect within any military organization. Evading responsibility is not the sign of a topnotch military commander.  When Commander Stumpf first got in hot water, he should have acknowledged his mistake and taken corrective action.  Mr. President, Commander Stumpf needs to face the music and take responsibility for his actions.  I ask unanimous consent to have that part of the manual printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                      The Principles of Leadership       The 11 principles of Army leadership are excellent      guidelines and provide the cornerstone for action. They are      universal and represent fundamental truths that have stood      the test of time. Developed in a 1948 leadership study, the      principles were first included in leadership doctrine in      1951. Use these principles to assess yourself and develop an      action plan to improve your ability to lead. Examples      throughout this manual give you ideas of how to apply these      principles. Here is an explanation of each of the leadership      principles.                know yourself and seek self-improvement       To know yourself, you have to understand who you are and to      know what your preferences, strengths, and weaknesses are.      Knowing yourself allows you to take advantage of your      strengths and work to overcome your weaknesses. Seeking self-     improvement means continually developing your strengths and      working on overcoming your weaknesses. This will increase      your competence and the confidence your soldiers have in your      ability to train and lead.                be technically and tactically proficient       You are expected to be technically and tactically      proficient at your job. This means that you can accomplish      all tasks to standard that are required to accomplish the      wartime mission. In addition, you are responsible for      training your soldiers to do their jobs and for understudying      your leader in the event you must assume those duties. You      develop technical and tactical proficiency through a      combination of the tactics, techniques, and procedures you      learn while attending formal schools (institutional      training), in your day-to-day jobs (operational assignments),      and from professional reading and personal study (self-     development).      seek responsibility and take responsibility for your actions       Leading always involves responsibility. You want      subordinates who can handle responsibility and help you      perform your mission. Similarly, your leaders want you to      take the initiative within their stated intent. When you see      a problem or something that needs to be fixed, do not wait      for your leader to tell you to act. The example you set,      whether positive or negative, helps develop your      subordinates. Our warfighting doctrine requires bold leaders      at all levels who exercise initiative, are resourceful, and      take advantage of opportunities on the battlefield that will      lead to victory. When you make mistakes, accept just      criticism and take corrective action. You must avoid evading      responsibility by placing the blame on someone else. Your      objective should be to build trust between you and your      leaders as well as between you and those you lead by seeking      and accepting responsibility.                    make sound and timely decisions       You must be able to rapidly assess situations and make      sound decisions. If you delay or try to avoid making a      decision, you may cause unnecessary casualties and fail to      accomplish the mission. Indecisive leaders create hesitancy,      loss of confidence, and confusion. You must be able to      anticipate and reason under the most trying conditions and      quickly decide what actions to take. Here are some guidelines      to help you lead effectively:       Gather essential information before making your decisions.       Announce decisions in time for your soldiers to react. Good      decisions made at the right time are better than the best      decisions made too late.       Consider the short- and long-term effects of your      decisions.                            set the example       Your soldiers want and need you to be a role model. This is      a heavy responsibility, but you have no choice. No aspect of      leadership is more powerful. If you expect courage,      competence, candor, commitment, and integrity from your      soldiers, you must demonstrate them. Your soldiers will      imitate your behavior. You must set high, but attainable,      standards, be willing to do what you require of your      soldiers, and share dangers and hardships with your soldiers.      Your personal example affects your soldiers more than any      amount of instruction or form of discipline. You are their      role model.          know your soldiers and look out for their well-being       You must know and care for your soldiers. It is not enough      to know their names and hometowns. You need to understand      what makes them ``tick'' and learn what is important to them      in life. You need to commit time and effort to listen to and      learn about your soldiers. When you show genuine concern for      your troops, they trust and respect you as a leader. Telling      your subordinates you care about them has no meaning unless      they see you demonstrating care. They assume that if you fail      to care for them in training, you will put little value on      their lives in combat. Although slow to build, trust and      respect can be destroyed quickly.       If your soldiers trust you, they will willingly work to      help you accomplish missions. They will never want to let you      down. You must care for them by training them for the rigors      of combat, taking care of their physical and safety needs      when possible, and disciplining and rewarding fairly. The      bonding that comes from caring for your soldiers will sustain      them and the unit during the stress and chaos of combat.                    keep your subordinates informed       American soldiers do best when they know why they are doing      something. Individual soldiers have changed the outcome of      battle using initiative in the absence of orders. Keeping      your subordinates informed helps them make decisions and      execute plans within your intent, encourages initiative,      improves teamwork, and enhances morale. Your subordinates      look for logic in your orders and question things that do not      make sense. They expect you to keep them informed and, when      possible, explain reasons for your orders.         develop a sense of responsibility in your subordinates       Your subordinates will feel a sense of pride and      responsibility when they successfully accomplish a new task      you have given them. Delegation indicates you trust your      subordinates and will make them want even more      responsibility. As a leader, you are a teacher and      responsible for developing your subordinates. Give them      challenges and opportunities you feel they can handle. Give      them more responsibility when they show you they are ready.      Their initiative will amaze you.      ensure the task is understood, supervised, and accomplished       Your soldiers must understand what you expect from them.      They need to know what you want done, what the standard is,      and     when you want it done. They need to know if you want a task      accomplished in a specific way. Supervising lets you know if      your soldiers understand your orders; it shows your interest      in them and in mission accomplishment. Oversupervision causes      resentment and undersupervision causes frustration.       When soldiers are learning new tasks, tell them what you      want done and show how you want it done. Let them try. Watch      their performance. accept performance that meets your      standards; reward performance that exceeds your standards;      correct performance that does not meet your standards.      Determine the cause of the poor performance and take      appropriate action.\1\ When you hold subordinates accountable      to you for their performance, they realize they are      responsible for accomplishing missions as individuals and as      teams.---------------------------------------------------------------------------     \1\ Kenneth H. Blanchard and Keith L. Kettler, ``A Suitable      Approach to Leader Development.''---------------------------------------------------------------------------                             build the team       Warfighting is a team activity. You must develop a team      spirit among your soldiers that motivates them to go      willingly and confidently into combat in a quick transition      from peace to war. Your soldiers need confidence in your      abilities to lead them and in their abilities to perform as      members of the team. You must train and cross train your      soldiers until they are confident in the team's technical and      tactical abilities. Your unit becomes a team only when your      soldiers trust and respect you and each other as trained      professionals and see the importance of their contributions      to the unit.          employ your unit in accordance with its capabilities       Your unit has capabilities and limitations. You are      responsible to recognize both of these factors. Your soldiers      will gain satisfaction from performing tasks that are      reasonable and challenging but will be frustrated if tasks      are too easy, unrealistic, or unattainable. Although the      available resources may constrain the program you would like      to implement, you must continually ensure your soldiers'      training is demanding. Apply the battle focus process to      narrow the training program and reduce the number of vital      tasks essential to mission accomplishment. Talk to your      leader; decide which tasks are essential to accomplish your      warfighting mission and ensure your unit achieves Army      standards on those selected. Battle focus is a recognition      that a unit cannot attain proficiency to standard on every      task, whether due to time or other resource constraints.      Do your best in other areas to include using innovative      training techniques and relooking the conditions under      which the training is being conducted, but do not lower      standards simply because your unit appears unable to meet      them. Your challenge as a leader is to attain, sustain,      and enforce high standards of combat readiness through      tough, realistic multiechelon combined arms training      designed to develop and challenge each soldier and unit.                                summary       The factors and principles of leadership will help you      accomplish missions and care for soldiers. They are the      foundation for leadership action.       The factors of leadership are always present and affect      what you should do and when you should do it. Soldiers should      not all be led in the same way. You must correctly assess      soldiers' competence, commitment, and motivation so that you      can take the right leadership actions. As a leader, you must      know who you are, what you know, and what you can do so that      you can discipline yourself and lead soldiers effectively.      Every leadership situation is unique. What worked in one      situation may not work in another. You must be able to look      at every situation and determine what action to take. You      influence by what you say, write, and, most importantly, do.      What and how you communicate will either strengthen or weaken      the relationship between you and your subordinates.       The principles of leadership were developed by leaders many      years ago to train and develop their subordinates. The      principles have stood the test of time and the foremost      test--the battlefield. Use the principles to assess how you      measure up in each area and then develop a plan to improve      your ability to lead soldiers.
