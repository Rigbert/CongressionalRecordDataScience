 President, today is a sad day for children across America. Big tobacco companies with unlimited lobbying budgets and Republicans in the Senate killed tobacco reform legislation. Kids lost and Joe Camel won. I am outraged at the message this sends: tobacco money is more important than children's health.  Almost four weeks ago, the Senate began debating a comprehensive tobacco bill aimed at reducing underage smoking and strengthening the role of public health agencies to combat tobacco. Congress appeared unified in its intent to end the practice of tobacco companies preying on our children. But some of my colleagues in the Senate got lost along the way.  Since we started debate on tobacco legislation, more than 60,000 children have taken up this deadly addiction. But, this has not been the focus of the debate on this legislation. In fact, if the American people were watching the debate on the Senate floor they would be hard pressed to determine what legislation we were actually debating. That's because the tobacco industry has spent $40 million to hijack the process and prevent Congress from acting. This is a tragic example of our political system at its worst.  We had an historic opportunity to enact comprehensive tobacco legislation that would have mandated tobacco companies stop targeting our children. In one piece of legislation we could have saved five million children from suffering the ill effects of smoking or facing premature death. Those who acted to kill this legislation will have to answer these five million children, who are now facing a death sentence due to the actions of a few.  To those who think the state suits are a fall back position, they need to know that these suits do not change the corporate culture of tobacco. The states litigate, and Congress legislates.  This is a sad day for those of us who have worked hard to advance the tobacco settlement. Throughout debate of this legislation, I voted to strengthen the bill to protect our children and prevent the continued deadly assault of tobacco companies.  As a parent, I have always been troubled by how tobacco companies target our children. When my son turned 14, he received a birthday card from a tobacco company inviting him to celebrate this milestone by purchasing cigarettes. They sent a child coupons for cigarettes as a birthday gift. This is outrageous and unacceptable. These are kind of tactics that I have been fighting to end.  I will not let this set back today end my pursuit of big tobacco. I will continue to stand up to tobacco companies. I will continue to work for bipartisan, comprehensive tobacco legislation that is focused on public health.  This is not the first time I have witnessed the power of the tobacco industry or the hold that tobacco money has on many of the same members of the Senate. It is these very members who have used every tactic known to delay, filibuster and load this bill down with so many unrelated items, that it is hard to remember what was in the original legislation.  Every parent should be outraged. The U.S. Senate played politics with the health and safety of children in America. Today's action says that tobacco money is more important than the health and safety of our children. Where are our priorities?                          ____________________
