Mr. Speaker, ``I am concerned that the scope, authority and independence of the special counsel will be limited by the guidelines the Ethics Committee has established. The House of Representatives, as well as the American public, deserve an investigation which will uncover the truth. At this moment, I am afraid that the apparent restrictions placed on this special counsel will not allow the truth to be uncovered. The rules normally applied by the Ethics Committee to an investigation of a typical member are insufficient in an investigation of the Speaker of the House. Clearly, this investigation has to meet a higher standard of public accountability and integrity.''  Prophetic words, indeed, Mr. Speaker.  These are the words of the current Speaker of the House in 1988 referring to the investigation of a former Speaker of this House.                             point of order
