Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, first of all, let me say I rise in very strong support of the DeLay amendment. It is a very serious and necessary amendment that makes clear that the United States will not sit idly by as prosecutors and judges, whose country of origin will be rogue states, bring politically motivated charges against United States servicemen and women around the globe.  I truly believe, Mr. Chairman, that the depiction used by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) of this very serious amendment trivializes not only the amendment but the compelling risk to U.S. peacekeepers abroad, U.S. peacekeepers who are likely to be accused by rogue nations, prosecutors who work for countries like the Sudan, Libya, or other countries where human rights are trashed and cruelty is the order of the day. Our people could be held accountable for doing their duty for either peacekeeping or peacemaking. And that, frankly, is absolutely unacceptable.  Let me make it very clear, Mr. Chairman, that I was and I am a very strong supporter of the regional criminal actions that have been taken against those who commit crimes against humanity in Rwanda as well as in the former Yugoslavia. I believe we ought to do it on a regional basis, and not allow this ongoing freestanding court with judges and prosecutors, again, who are from rogue states who will sit in judgment of U.S. peacekeepers and peacemakers.  Let me just also say on those regional courts, when the first tribunal was getting under way, I offered the amendments to significantly increase the amount of the U.S. contribution because of the terrible crimes that were being committed against the Croatians and then the Bosnians. So I take a back seat to no one about my concern in holding accountable the Milosevics of this world. But having said that, this tribunal is rife with mischief and is likely to kill peacekeeping as we know it.  Why would we send our men and women out to be held accountable by a Libyan judge and by a Libyan prosecutor who would bring our people to trial? And I would just note parenthetically that the Clinton administration was against this until the last few weeks of the administration when they signed it, but argued against it in Rome as the Rome Statute, or the ICC, was being considered. At one of our hearings I asked the U.S. State Department to go back to all of our wars, World War II, World War I, the Korean conflict, Vietnam, and look at any battle that we were engaged in, and asked the question, Could a prosecutor take the Dresden bombing or the bombing of Japan or Hiroshima or Nagasaki and bring an action against President Truman, or General Marshall, or President Eisenhower, or any of our other generals, or those who flew the Enola Gay? Or take Vietnam or any other conflict, most recently the Persian Gulf, or any conflict we have engaged in.  This is rife, rife with mischief that rogue nations would bring about against us. And let us not forget as well, although it was rejected, there was an attempt to bring action against General Wesley Clark, who led our efforts in the Serbian conflict. And had we had somebody from one of those rogue nations sitting as a prosecutor, he might have been brought to the Hague or there may have been an attempt to bring him to the Hague to stand in account.  Finally, if you want a glimpse about what the ICC will look like when it comes into force, look just at the U.N. Human Rights Convention in Geneva. I have been there, year in and year out, as has the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf), and many of us saw countries like the Sudan sitting in judgement to do two things: one, they tried to run interference when actions are brought against them; and, secondly, they sit in judgment and then try to give their friends who commit human rights abuses a pass. They constantly do that.  That is why this is a dangerous game. And again I think the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) owes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay) an apology. That little game he played with the Netherlands was way off base. This is a serious amendment, and when our peacekeepers are held accountable, I hope President Bush and any successor President does all that is humanly possible to protect every American service personnel abroad as well as in this country.  Mr. Chairman, first of all, let me say I rise in very strong support of the DeLay amendment. It is a very serious and necessary amendment that makes clear that the United States will not sit idly by as prosecutors and judges, whose country of origin will at times be rogue states, bring politically motivated charges against United States servicemen and women around the globe.  I truly believe, Mr. Chairman, that the depiction used by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) of this very serious amendment trivializes not only the amendment but the compelling risk to U.S. peacekeepers abroad, U.S. peacekeepers who are likely to be accused by rogue nations, prosecutors who work for countries like the Sudan, Libya, or other countries where human rights are trashed and cruelty is the order of the day. Our people could be subjected to kangaroo trials for doing their peacekeeping or peacemaking duty. And that, frankly, is absolutely unacceptable.  Let me make it very clear, Mr. Chairman, that I was and I am a very strong supporter of the regional criminal tribunals that have been used to prosecute those who have committed crimes against humanity in Rwanda as well as in the former Yugoslavia. I believe we ought to establish war crimes tribunals on an ad hoc basis, and not allow this freestanding court with judges and prosecutors, who are accountable to none, to sit in judgment of U.S. military personnel.  Let me just say with regards to ad hoc tribunals, that the first tribunal was getting under way, I offered amendments in committee to significantly increase the amount of the U.S. contribution to establish the tribunal. The terrible crimes that were committed against the Croatians and then the Bosnians and even the Serbes, demanded no less. So I take a back seat to no one about my concern in holding accountable the Milosevics of this world. But having said that, the tribunal established by the Rome Statute is rife with mischief and is likely to kill peacekeeping as we know it.  Why would we send our men and women out to be harassed and prosecuted by a Libyan judge and by a Libyan prosecutor who would bring our soldiers to trial? And I would just note parenthetically that the Clinton administration was against the ICC until the last few weeks of the administration when they abruptly signed it, but previously had argued against it in Rome, as the ICC was being considered. At one of several hearings I chaired I asked the U.S. State Department representatives to go back to all of our wars: World War II. World War I, the Korean conflict, Vietnam, and look at any battle that we were engaged in, and I asked the question, Could a prosecutor construe the Dresden bombing or the fire bombing of Tokyo or Hiroshima or Nagasaki and bring an action against President Truman, or General MacArthur or Eisenhower or Marshall, or any of our other generals, or those who piloted or crewed the Enola Gay? Or take Vietnam or any other conflict, most recently the Persian Gulf or the bombing of Serbia or any conflict we have engaged in. Were these actions, in whole or in part, war crimes? I got a big ``maybe'' from State.  The ICC is rife with mischief that rogue nations would bring actions against us. And let us not forget, as well, although it was rejected by the prosecution arm at The Hague, there was an attempt to bring action against General Wesley Clark and others who led our efforts in the Serbian conflict. And had we had somebody from one of those rogue nationsserving as a prosecutor, he might have been brought to The Hague or there may have been an attempt to bring him to The Hague to stand trial.  Finally, if you want a glimpse about what the ICC will look like when it comes into force look just at the U.N. Human Rights Convention in Geneva. I have been there, year in and year out, as has the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf) and Ms. Ros Lehtinen, and many of us saw countries like the Sudan sitting on the commission do two things: one, they tried to run interference when actions were brought against them; and, secondly, they sat in judgment and then tried to give their friends who commit human rights abuses, a pass. If given new powers to prosecute Americans--believe me--they will!  That is why this is a dangerous game. I believe the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) owes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay) an apology. That little game he played earlier with the Netherlands invasion scenario was way off base. This is a serious amendment, and when our peacekeepers are wrongfully charged, I trust President Bush and any successor President will do all that is humanly possible to protect every American soldier, sailor, or marine abroad.                              {time}  2115  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. I would remind the gentleman that he voted against supporting the troops when they went to Kosovo.  Today this House is sort of engaged in watching a great allegory, only I think the Republican leadership has forgotten one of their famous phrases, ``Remember the Alamo.'' Why do I say that? You ask yourself, why would somebody stand in the Alamo and wait and get killed when they knew they were going to die? Or why did the Jews jump off the rock in Masada? Or why did the troopers get surrounded at Little Big Horn and why did they fight till they died?  The people on the other side, the leadership, are not paying attention to what is going on here, because there is a truth in what is going on in this process, and it is this: You have the power. We can talk and talk and talk and we know that we are going to lose. There is no question about that. We have no illusions that we are going to win. But why do people do what they did in the Alamo? Or why do people fly planes into buildings in New York? Or why do people wrap bombs around themselves? Or why do they go into the general post office in Dublin on Easter Sunday in 1916? You can pick a thousand places in history where people have done what makes no sense to people, where if you look at it you would say, ``They had no chance.''  We know we have no chance here tonight, but we are frustrated, we are powerless, because you have taken all the power. Wonderful allegory. You come out here, you smash us, you will beat us on every single amendment, and we will not be able to save Social Security, we will not be able to save Medicare. We cannot stop you from spending like you had no tomorrow. We have no ability to do that. We can tell the American people we stand against that kind of stuff and we will be beaten tonight.  But the problem with that is, we are coming to the last act in the allegory. I got this little thing that came from the GOP to their members:  ``Please note that it is mandatory that all Members stay in town and be available for votes tonight and the early morning hours as we plan to finish the supplemental in the early morning hours. It's possible for your boss to catch a late-morning flight home on Friday.''  We know martial law is coming. They knew it in the Warsaw ghetto. They knew it everywhere. Did people give up? No. But this really is not the Alamo. It is not really the end. This is more like Dunkirk. The Nazis pushed the Brits all the way up against the beach and they thought, boy, we are going to be in England in about a month. And at Dunkirk they took off 338,000 people who came back to fight another day.  When they surrounded the American troops at Bastogne in the Battle of the Bulge, they sent in an offer of unconditional surrender to General McAuliffe. He sent back one word written on a piece of paper: Nuts.  What you do not understand is there is an election coming and the American people are going to watch what you have done to Social Security and what you have done with the surplus that started out at $5.6 trillion and you have taken it down below the line and we are down in the depths again, a trillion dollars below. The single biggest reversal in economics in the history of the world. And you guys are still spending. You are still spending. ``Let's raise the debt limit. Let's keep spending.'' It is like if you take your credit card and you give one to your son or daughter and they go to college. They say, ``Dad, I've reached the limit. What should I do?'' You say, stop spending or get a part-time job or something. But no, not with you guys. You call up the company and say, ``Raise our debt limit. We got to have more credit to spend.''  We cannot stop you. You are free to do it. But you are also free to pay the price. And do not think this is the last night. I mean, you will win. In about two hours and 40 minutes, you will close this joint down and create a new day and you will come out here and slam bam, thank you, ma'am, and it will be over. We understand that. But do not think it is all over.
