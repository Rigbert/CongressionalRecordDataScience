Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski) for his hard work on this bill. This bill will fund thousands of critical highway bridge and transportation projects across the United States, putting millions to work, maintaining and improving our critical transportation infrastructure. Unfortunately, it is not enough to both catch up with the maintenance backlog and make the needed capacity improvements.  It is not for lack of trying by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski) or the ranking member, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar), or the chairman or the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Petri), but at the insistence of the White House they insisted that the bill be reduced by $100 billion.  That means thousands more weight-limited bridges across this country and detours; it means more congestion because the White House says we cannot afford to invest in America. That means 800,000 jobs a year that will not be created, 4.8 million over the life of the bill.  The White House also objects to the fact that this bill does not gut the environmental laws, so they have threatened to veto. If I were sitting in the White House and I presided over the lives of 2.8 million jobs, as has President Bush in a so-called jobless recovery, I would be a little bit more anxious to get out and cut ribbons for critical projects to put real Americans to work on real needs and create real jobs. But not this White House. They say they will veto the bill. Is it an April fool or are they just fools at the White House?
