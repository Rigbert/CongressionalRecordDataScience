I ask that this poem penned by Albert Caswell, of the guide service, be printed in the Record in remembrance of their selfless sacrifice and service to our Nation, on the upcoming 66th anniversary of D-day on June 6, 1944.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                            On These Beaches     On These Beaches. . . .     Goodness! Evil! Darkness! Light!     Those Brave Hearts . . .     Who, evil must fight!     Who, bring the light!     On These Beaches!     Which, now so beseech us. . . .     All at the very height . . .     Of what a heart can reach this!     ``D'' Day!     As a time as when, all those            hearts so prayed . . .     Heading, into those shores . . .     As sure death, so lie before. . . .     All On Those Beaches!     While, against all odds . . .     All in their fine cause. . . .     All in their most selfless sacrifice, these most brilliant of            all lights!     That which now, so teach us!     Of what happened, All On            These Beaches. . . .     ``D'' Day, as a time as when . . .     Mere men, became like Gods. . . . so then!     All in their actions!     Dropping from the air, heroes everywhere. . . .     All in their deeds, all for freedom's seeds. . . .     As into, those bloody shores they waded. . . .     As but, all of their fine lives., they so gave it!     As the ocean turned red. . . .     As they so died, and bled. . . .     All in what . . .     Their most magnificent of all hearts, so said!     Chapter and verse. . . .     So many acts of valor and courage, against the worst. . . .     All about a human being's, True Worth!     Of what, out to all of our souls so teaches!     ``D'' Day. . . .     All On These Beaches . . .     Their Most Heroic Bodies,            strewn into pieces . . .     As everywhere the dark stench of death beseeches!     So greets us!     As lies beneath us, Upon These Beaches. . . .     War is Hell, and Hell is War. . . .     Is that not what Heaven is for?     On These Beaches. . . .     Sights and sounds, men dare not repeat! This!     So, buried now . . . all in their hearts and souls of honor,            so carried deep! This!     As awaken in cold sweats, from their most restless sleeps!            This!     As for them, we now so weep! This!     As forever, in your hearts . . . we pray you keep . . . This!     Of what, all of these magnificent men so did for us. . . .     To Save The World!     All On These Beaches!     As on this day. . . .     I bid you, I but ask you to            kneel and pray . . .     And never forget, what happened on that day!     On These Beaches!                          ____________________
