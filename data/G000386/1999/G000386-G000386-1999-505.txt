 President, I rise today to introduce, along with Senators Kohl and Thurmond, the Class Action Fairness Act of 1999, a bill that will help curb class action lawsuit abuse. Last year, Senator Kohl and I introduced the Class Action Fairness Act of 1998, S. 2083. That bill was marked up in the Administrative Oversight and the Courts Subcommittee on September 10, 1998, and we favorably voted out of subcommittee a substitute amendment to the bill. Unfortunately, this legislation was not considered further by the Senate because of the press of other legislative business scheduled before the full Judiciary Committee.  We are now reintroducing the substitute amendment to last year's class action bill, with minor modifications, as the Class Action Fairness Act of 1999. This modest bill will go a long way toward ending class action lawsuit abuses where the plaintiffs receive very little and their lawyers receive a whole lot. This bill will preserve class action lawsuits as an important tool that brings representation to the unrepresented and result in important discrimination and consumer decisions.  In October 1997, my Judiciary Subcommittee held a hearing on the problem of certain class action lawsuit settlements. I found one example of class action lawsuit abuse to be particularly disturbing. In an antitrust case settled in the Northern District of Illinois in 1993, the plaintiff class alleged that multiple domestic airlines participated in price-fixing, which resulted in plaintiffs paying more for airline tickets than they otherwise would have had to pay.  In the settlement, all of the class plaintiffs were awarded a book of coupons which could be used toward the purchase of future airline tickets. These coupons varied in amount and number, based on how many plane tickets a particular plaintiff had purchased. The catch was that the plaintiff still had to pay for most of any new airline ticket out of his or her own pocket. This meant that only $10 worth of coupons could be used toward the purchase of a $100 ticket; up to $25 worth of coupons for a $250 ticket; up to $50 worth of coupons for a $500 ticket, and so on. In addition, these coupons could not be used on certain blackout dates, which appeared to include all holidays and peak travel times.  Interestingly enough, the attorneys did not get paid with these coupon books. Rather, the attorneys were paid cash--$16 million in cash. Now, if the coupons were good enough for their clients--the people that actually got ripped off--I wonder why those same coupons were not good enough for their lawyers.  Another example of an egregious class action lawsuit settlement was highlighted at the subcommittee hearing. Mrs. Martha Preston was a member of the plaintiff class in the case Hoffman versus Banc Boston, where some plaintiffs received under $10 each in compensation for their injuries, yet were docked from $75 to $90 for attorneys' fees. This means that attorneys who were supposed to be representing these people's best interests, agreed to a settlement that cost some of the plaintiffs more money than they received in compensation for being wronged.  These class action lawsuit abuses happen for a number of reasons. One reasons is that plaintiffs' lawyers negotiate their own fees as part of the settlement. This can result in distracting lawyers from focusing on their client's needs, and settling or refusing to settle based on the amount of their own compensation.  During our hearing, evidence was presented that at least one group of plaintiffs' lawyers meets on a regular basis to discuss initiating class action lawsuits. They scan the Federal Register and other publications to get ideas for lawsuits, and only after they have identified a wrong, do they find clients for their lawsuits. Instead of having clients who complain of harms going to hire attorneys, these attorneys find the harms first and then recruit potential clients with the promise of compensation.  On the other hand, the defendants do not always have clean hands. Plaintiffs' lawyers say that they are approached by lawyers from large corporations who urge them to find a class and sue the corporation. The corporations may use the class action lawsuit as a tool to limit their liability. Once a lawsuit is initiated and settled, no member of the class may sue based on that claim. In other words, if a corporation settle a class action lawsuit by paying all class members $10 as compensation for a faulty product, the plaintiffs can no longer sue for any harm caused by the faulty product. This is one way of buying immunity for liability.  A Rand study on class action litigation stated that,       It is generally agreed that fees drive plaintiffs'      attorney's filing behavior, that defendants' risk aversion in      the face of large aggregate exposures drives their settlement      behavior. . . . In other words, the problems with class      actions flow from incentives that are embedded in the process      itself.  The Rand study also found that the number of class actions is rising significantly, with most of the increase concentrated in State courts. State courts often are used in nationwide class actions to the detriment of class members and sometimes defendants. In fact, State courts are more likely to certify class actions without adequately considering whether a class action would be fair to all class members. In addition, class lawyers sometimes manipulate pleadings to avoid removal of the lawsuit to the Federal courts, even to the extent that they minimize their client's potential claims. Class lawyers also sometimes defeat the complete diversity requirement by ensuring that at least one named class member is from the same State as a defendant, even if every other class member is from a different State.  The Class Action Fairness Act of 1999 does a number of things. First, it requires that notice of proposed settlements in all class actions, as well as all class notices, must be in clear, easily understood English and must include all material settlement terms, including the amount and source of attorneys' fees. The notices most plaintiffs receive are written in small print and confusing legal jargon. In fact, a lawyer testified before my subcommittee that even he could not understand the notice he received as a plaintiff in a class action lawsuit. Since plaintiffs are giving up their right to sue, it is imperative that they understand what they are doing and the ramifications of their actions.  Second, our bill requires that State attorneys general be notified of anyproposed class settlement that would affect residents of their States. The notice would give a State attorney general the opportunity to object if the settlement terms are unfair.  Third, our bill requires that attorneys' fees in class actions are to be based on a reasonable percentage of damages actually paid to class members, the actual costs of complying with the terms of a settlement agreement, as well as any future financial benefits. In the alternative, the bill provides that, to the extent the law permits, fees may be based on a reasonable hourly (lodestar) rate. This provision would discourage settlements that give attorneys exorbitant fees based on hypothetical overvaluation of coupon settlements, yet allows for reasonable fees in all kinds of cases, including cases that primarily involve injunctive relief.  Fourth, our bill allows more class action lawsuits to be removed from State court to Federal court, either by a defendant or an unnamed class member. A class action would qualify for Federal jurisdiction if the total damages exceed $75,000 and parties include citizens from multiple States. Currently, class lawyers can avoid removal if individual claims are for just less than $75,000--even if hundreds of millions of dollars in total are at stake--or if just one class member is from the same State as a defendant. However, the bill provides that cases remain in State court where the substantial majority of class and primary defendants are from the same State and that State's law would govern, or the primary defendants are States and a Federal court would be unable to order the relief requested.  Fifth, our bill will reduce frivolous lawsuits by requiring that a violation of rule 11 of the Federal rules of civil procedure, which penalizes frivolous lawsuits, will require the imposition of sanctions. However, the nature and extent of sanctions will remain discretionary.  We need class action reform badly. Both plaintiffs and defendants are calling for change in this area. The Class Action Fairness Act of 1999 is not just procedural reform, it is substantive reform of our court system. This bill will remove the conflict of interest that lawyers face in class action lawsuits, and will ensure the fair settlement of these cases. This bill will preserve the process, but put a stop to the more egregious abuses. I urge all my colleagues to join Senators Kohl, Thurmond, and me and support this important piece of legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 353       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
