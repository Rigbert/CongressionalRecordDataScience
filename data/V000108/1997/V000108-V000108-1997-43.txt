Speaker, I--along with our distinguished colleague from New Jersey, Mr. LoBiondo, and over 80 of our other House colleagues--am pleased to introduce the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1997.  I was inspired to introduce this legislation when I learned that gang members in Northwest Indiana had the protection of bulletproof vests, but that many police departments simply could not afford to buy them for their officers. In fact, figures from the U.S. Department of Justice indicate that approximately 150,000 law enforcement officers--or 25 percent of the Nation's 600,000 State and local officers--do not have access to bulletproof vests.  The legislation I am introducing today would form a partnership with State and local law enforcement agencies in order to make sure that every police officer who needs a bulletproof vest gets one. It would do so by authorizing up to $25 million per year for a new grant program within the U.S. Department of Justice. The program would provide 50-50 matching grants to State and local law enforcement agencies to assist in purchasing bulletproof vests and body armor for their officers.  These grants would be targeted to jurisdictions where most officers do not currently have access to vests, and they are designed to be free of the red tape that often characterizes other grant programs. In order to make sure that no community is left out of the program, the matching requirement could be waived for jurisdictions that demonstrate financial hardship in meeting their half of the match.  This bipartisan bill has been endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriff's Association, the International Union of Police Associations, the Police Executive Research Forum, the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, and the National Association of Police Organizations.  Far too many police officers are needlessly killed each year while serving to protect our citizens. Since 1980, 1,182 police officers have been feloniously killed by a firearm. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 42 percent of those officers could have been saved if they had been wearing bulletproof vests.  Bulletproof vests are so effective in protecting law enforcement officers from death and injury that the lives of more than 2,000 police officers have been saved because they werewearing them. The FBI says that the risk of fatality to officers from a firearm while not wearing body armor is 14 times higher than for officers wearing body armor. One study indicates that between 1985 and 1994, no police officer who was wearing a bulletproof vest was killed by a gunshot that penetrated the officer's vest.  Mr. Speaker, if we are going to ask our law enforcement officials to risk their lives every day in the line of duty, it is incumbent upon us to give them every bit of protection possible. While no piece of equipment can save the life of every officer, having a bulletproof vest often means the difference between life and death. I would like to thank Mr. LoBiondo, and my other colleagues who have already co-sponsored this important legislation, and I urge you and the rest of our colleagues to support it as well.                          ____________________
