President, I rise today in honor of Alan Charles Sadoski, a loving husband, father, and friend whose lasting memory is continually celebrated by everyone who knew and loved him.  Alan's life was filled with family, friends, excitement, and laughter. He was one of what quickly became seven brothers and sisters growing up in Salem, MA. Everyone who knew him will tell you that his siblings were not only his best friends but also his biggest fans. He graduated from high school in 1967 and went on to become a standout soccer player at Salem State College, while at the same time serving in the Massachusetts National Guard.  After odd jobs throughout the summers in and around Salem, Alan took a job working as a teller for the Essex Bank. Little did he know at the time, but that job changed Alan's life. Not only did Alan find a career, but he also fell in love with a fellow teller, Claire McGuire. The two married and began their life together, ultimately moving to Washington, DC where Claire pursued her legal career and Alan took a job with the National Bank of Washington. Everyone who knew Alan can remember him on his way to work, the banker in his three piece suit.  On December 29, 1981 Claire and Alan had a son named Nicholas Alan. Shortly thereafter the family moved into their first home where Alan's love of fatherhood blossomed. Alan converted the boxes from their new appliances into little homes for Nick and the two of them spent countless hours playing together. When Nick had trouble sleeping at night, Alan would drive him around the neighborhood until he fell asleep. He even brought Nick back to Salem for his first haircut at the barbershop just down the street from his own childhood home. Everyone could see how much Alan enjoyed being a father.  Although Alan fought hard, his spirit and courage in the face of adversity never showing the effects of his illness, he sadly succumbed to his battle with cancer on August 12, 1985. He was troubled by the idea of leaving his wife and son behind, but he knew they would be taken care of and supported by both his family and the legion of friends he made over the years. Each of them made a special promise to Alan that in their own way they would always make sure Claire and Nick were okay. It is now 20 years later and Alan's friends and family have never let the two of them down.  Over the years the people closest to Alan have kept his spirit alive by thinking about him often and sharing their memories of him with others. His friends remember his tolerant and understanding nature. They remember his love of camping and how much he had hoped to take his son and nephews out on a true wilderness adventure. They talk about his fabled flapjacks, and how everyone would watch the pancake impresario perform his tricks. They remember how much fun it was to be around Alan; how he was always at the center of the crowd, telling some of his famous stories, somehow making the gathering better just by being there. Even the pharmacists at the local drugstore, who saw Alan during some of the worst days of his illness, thought the world of him and even made a donation to the American Cancer Society in his honor. He truly touched everyone he met.  Since then the family has remained close and they talk about Alan often. He has nieces and nephews now that he never had a chance to meet, but they have heard all about ``Uncle Al, the Kiddies' Pal.'' Alan would be happy to know that the people who meant the most to him in his life still gather and share their memories of him after his death. He would love to know that Claire and Nick are the best of friends. He would love to know that Nick enjoys hearing stories about his dad, and perhaps more than anything else, loves to hear people say, ``Your dad would be proud of you.''                          ____________________
