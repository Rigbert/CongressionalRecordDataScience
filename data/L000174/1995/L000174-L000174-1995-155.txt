President, I, like the distinguished chairman, cannot support the amendment and will join in his motion to table, not because I disagree with the Senator from Arizona in wanting to stop the flow of heroin from Burma. I totally agree with him in wanting to do that. I acknowledge his expertise in that part of the world. Anybody who has watched the evidence from the various law enforcement and international agencies knows of the tremendous flow of heroin from Burma. But I do not think this would stop it. In fact, I believe it will be money basically lost.  The SLORC itself is involved in the drug trade. They are an army that violates the human rights of their own people. They oppress their own people. They stop dissent in their own people. But, also, they take drug money themselves.  A U.N. program is not going to make any measurable difference. We are dealing with an outlaw government. We should not be doing something that might suggest that we accept this government in any way. These are drug dealers and thugs. They themselves are profiting from something we would be asking them to stop. So, while I will be happy to look at other areas when this bill next comes up, or any other bill, I will not support this.  I might also say I hope, having cleared 192 out of 193 amendments in disagreement, that we might be able to send back to the other body just one amendment in disagreement, something that will be debated and voted on following the debate and vote on the amendment of the Senator from Arizona.
