 President, today we continued debate on the motion to proceed to the marriage protection amendment. Tomorrow we will continue debate in an orderly fashion, with the time divided between the majority and minority. Moments ago on behalf of the leader, I filed a cloture motion on the motion to proceed to this issue. The vote will occur on Wednesday, and we will lock in a time certain for that vote sometime during tomorrow's session. The first vote of the week then will occur tomorrow at 10:20 a.m. on a district court nomination. As I mentioned this morning, there will be a joint meeting Wednesday morning at 11 a.m. in the House. We will hear from the President of Latvia who will address a joint meeting of Congress. Senators will leave this Chamber at 10:40 a.m. to walk to the Hall of the House of Representatives in order to hear that address.                          ____________________[Page S5433]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL.
