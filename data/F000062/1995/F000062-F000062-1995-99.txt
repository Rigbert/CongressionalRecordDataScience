 Nevertheless, despite our differing interpretations, we must face facts, and the fact is that the State Department has determined that the President should veto the bill in its current form.  As I said before, the damage that would result to Jerusalem, first and foremost, and to our common cause of moving the Embassy there from passing a bill that could get vetoed cold be irreparable. So I am hopeful that this bill will not be vetoed.   Mr. President, with a sufficient waiver, we can pass a bill that mandates the moving of the United States Embassy to Jerusalem, but allows the President to waive the timing of the establishment of the Embassy in Jerusalem if national security interests are involved.  This would be first-time legislation, the first time a bill on this issue has been passed, and I think that is extraordinarily important.  I must say, I have never conceived of this issue as a litmus test of one's support for Israel. I find deeply committed friends of Israel holding a wide variety of views on the question of when and how to move the United States Embassy to Jerusalem, and on these bills.  As for the debate in Congress, let us establish a basic understanding that all participants in this debate agree on one fundamental truth: that united Jerusalem is and will remain as the capital of Israel.  So Jerusalem's status as Israel's capital has never been in question here. The debate is, instead, focused on a side debate to the central issue, the placement of the Embassy, and I, like my colleagues, believe there is basic agreement in this body, and I share the view of my colleagues, that the United States Embassy in Israel does, indeed, belong in Jerusalem. It is elementary that a sovereign nation, as I have pointed out, has that right to place an Embassy at the site of a nation's capital with whom it enjoys diplomatic relations.  So this should not in all logic, in all reason, in all sovereign power be privy to negotiations having to do with peace and security between the Palestine Liberation Organization and the State of Israel, or between the State of Jordan and the State of Israel, or between any of the Arab neighbors and the State of Israel. However, there is one important point, and I think this is where we need to be very careful that we are not provocative.  There was a letter sent to Secretary of State Christopher sponsored by the two distinguished Senators from New York, Senator Moynihan and Senator D'Amato, last March. I joined with 92 of my colleagues in signing this letter in which we said, and I quote:       We believe that the United States embassy belongs in      Jerusalem. It would be most appropriate for planning to begin      now to ensure such a move no later than the agreements on      permanent status take effect and the transition period is      ended which, according to the Declaration of Principles, is      scheduled for May 1999.  This letter, I believe, reflected a true consensus on this issue in the Senate and, to a great extent, in the community affected. In a letter to the Jewish Press on April 7, 1995, Senator Moynihan explained why the letter was written, and I quote:       Senator D'Amato and I chose to write a letter rather than      to introduce legislation because we wanted to secure maximum      public support for the proposition that united Jerusalem is      the capital of Israel and the appropriate home of our      embassy.  So when legislation was introduced on this issue in May, however, the consensus cracked and then, as we know, with the earlier bill, 62 Senators signed on.  There was one point in that earlier bill that very deeply concerned me, and that was the provision that the commencement of construction on the Embassy site in West Jerusalem would begin in 1996, and I felt that that could truly be provocative, be disturbing to the peace process at this very difficult time, particularly in view of the fact that Palestinian elections for the first time have not yet taken place and are about to take place. And we now know that the date agreed to is prior to Ramadan or in January of next year. Therefore, to mandate the beginning of construction in 1996 could be, I think, unintentionally, but very realistically, provocative and something that we would not want to do.  The leader, in his wisdom, and I am grateful and thankful for this, and Senator Kyl agreed, did remove that section and, hence, that laid the basis for the new legislation which is before us today, entitled Senate bill 1322. So my major concern has really been addressed, and I am very pleased and grateful for that. The concern expressed then that the original bill might precipitate a difficult situation I think has been remedied.  There was also a lack of consensus at that time in statements that were issued by a number of major American Jewish organizations who felt that the objectives of the legislation were good but hoped that everybody would come together and agree on a piece of legislation that would not be provocative to the peace process but could establish the intent with the clarity of law, in this body and the House, for the first time in the history of debate over this issue.  I believe that if we can agree on waiver language that does not limit the constitutional authority of the President, that we will have given the bill the necessary features to meet a variety of needs. For the first time, we will have mandated in law the move of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, an important achievement, and a variety of preparations for that move spelled out in the timing of report language.  We will have also provided the President with the flexibility to postpone the actual move if events in the Middle East peace process or other U.S. National security interests warrant it, and I believe this is a responsible way for the Congress to legislate in this area.  I think that, as we vote on this bill, we should be aware that some of the leading Middle East experts in the administration do worry, still, about its impact on the peace process--not in 1999, but today. I think this Government is so privileged to have one of the most skillful and determined young negotiators I have met, in the person of Dennis Ross. His perspicacity, his energy, his undying commitment to this process has really been helpful in America playing the role of the honest broker, in sitting down with the two sides, and in being responsible for bringing the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the State of Israel, the President of Egypt, the King of Jordan, and a host of other dignitaries from the European Union, together recently at the White House to witness what was an unbelievable signing. I, for one, during many times in the past decades thought we would never see that day. But, Mr. President, we did see that day, and a lot of it is due to the skill and dedication of Dennis Ross. I think that has to be said.  Mr. Ross has warned that passing this legislation could now complicate the already-difficult implementation of the recent agreement on redeployment in the West Bank. He is also concerned that Jerusalem could become a central issue in the upcoming Palestinian election now scheduled for January, which would likely play to the radical faction and put Chairman Arafat in a very difficult position. Martin Indyk, our Ambassador to Israel, at his confirmation hearing in the Foreign Relations Committee, at which I was present, has echoed many of these concerns.  Mr. President, I raise these issues simply because I believe we should be aware of what people in the administration--in an administration that has been extremely supportive of Israel--are thinking about this legislation. This administration has achieved something that has never in the history of the area been achieved, and that is an agreement which may guarantee safe and secure borders and peace between the small, tiny State of Israel and the Arab nations that surround it. And its importance cannot be overlooked in that regard.  So I am looking for a way that we can indicate the rights of the sovereign nation by saying that we should place our Embassy in Jerusalem, that it should be the policy of the Congress that Jerusalem is the capital and that Jerusalem should remain undivided, without presenting a provocation in what I think is the most important process for peace ongoing, certainly, in the history of the Middle East.  I am hopeful that the negotiations now ongoing will be able to provide that form of waiver. I think it is vital--a waiver that does not in any way compromise the President's constitutional authority. So at this time I would like to yield the floor, and I will have more to say when those negotiations are completed.  At this time, I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1                                       U.S. Department of Justice,                                      Office of Legal Counsel,                                     Washington, DC, May 16, 1995.     Memorandum for Abner J. Mikva, Counsel to the President.     From: Walter Dellinger, Assistant Attorney General.     Re Bill to relocate United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to          Jerusalem.       This is to provide you with our views on S. 770, a bill      introduced by Senator Dole and others, ``[t]o provide for the      relocation of the United States Embassy in Israel to      Jerusalem, and for other purposes.'' The provisions of this      bill that render the Executive Branch's ability to obligate      appropriated funds conditional upon the construction and      opening of the United States Embassy to Israel in Jerusalem      invade exclusive Presidential authorities in the field of      foreign affairs and are unconstitutional.       The bill states that       [i]t is the policy of the United States that--       (1) Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital of the      State of Israel;       (2) groundbreaking for construction of the United States      Embassy in Jerusalem should begin no later than December 31,      1996; and       (3) the United States Embassy should be officially open in      Jerusalem no later than May 31, 1999.       Section 3(a).       The bill requires that not more than 50% of the funds      appropriated to the State Department for FY 1997 for      ``Acquisition and Maintenance of Building Abroad'' may be      obligated until the Secretary of State determines and reports      to Congress that construction has begun on the site of the      United States Embassy in Jerusalem. Section 3(b). Further,      not more than 50% of the funds appropriated to the State      Department for FY 1999 for ``Acquisition and Maintenance of      Buildings Abroad'' may be obligated until the Secretary      determines and reports to Congress that the United States      Embassy in Jerusalem has officially opened. Section 3(c).       Of the funds appropriated for FY 1995 for the State      Department and related agencies, not less than $5,000,000      ``shall be made available until expended'' for costs      associated with relocating the United States Embassy in      Israel to Jerusalem. Section 4. Of the funds authorized to be      appropriated in FY 1996 and FY 1997 for the State Department      for ``Acquisition and Maintenance of Buildings Abroad, ``not      less than $25,000,000 (in FY 1996) and $75,000,000 (in FY      1997) ``shall be made available until expended'' for costs      associated with, respectively, the relocation of the United      States Embassy to Jerusalem, and the construction and      relocation of the Embassy. Section 5.       The Secretary is required to report to Congress not later      than 30 days after enactment ``detailing the Department of      State's plan to implement this Act.'' Section 6. Beginning on      January 1, 1996, and every six months thereafter, the      Secretary is to report to Congress ``on the progress made      toward opening the United States Embassy in Jerusalem.''      Section 7.       It is well settled that the Constitution vests the      President with the exclusive authority to conduct the      Nation's diplomatic relations with other States. This      authority flows, in large part, from the President's position      as Chief Executive, U.S. Const. art, II, Sec. 1, cl. 1, and      as Commander in Chief, id. art. II, Sec. 2, cl. 1. It also      derives from the President's more specific powers to ``make      Treaties,'' id. art. II, Sec. 2, cl. 2; to ``appoint      Ambassadors . . . and Consuls,'' id.; and to ``receive      Ambassadors and other public Ministers,'' id., art. II,      Sec. 3. The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized the      President's authority with respect to the conduct of      diplomatic relations. See, e.g., Department of Navy v. Egan      484 U.S. 518, 529 (1988) (the Supreme Court has ``recognized      `the generally accepted view that foreign policy was the      province and responsibility of the Executive' '') (quoting      Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280, 293-94 (1981)), Alfred Dunhill of      London, Inc. v. Republic of Cuba, 425 U.S. 682, 705-06 n. 18      (1976) (``the conduct of [foreign policy] is committed      primarily to the Executive Branch''); United States v.      Louisiana, 363 U.S. 1, 35 (1960) (President is ``the      constitutional representative of the United States in its      dealings with foreign nations''). See also Ward v. Shannon,      943 F.2d 157, 160 (1st Cir. 1991) (Breyer, J.) (``the      Constitution makes the Executive Branch . . . primarily      responsible'' for the exercise of ``the foreign affairs      power''), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 1558 (1992); Sanchez-     Espinoza v. Reagan, 770 F.2d 202, 210 (D.C. Cir. 1985)      (Scalia, J.) (``broad leeway'' is ``traditionally accorded      the Executive in matters of foreign affairs''). Accordingly,      we have affirmed that the Constitution ``authorize[s] the      President to determine the form and manner in which the      United States will maintain relations with foreign nations.''      Issues Raised by Section 129 of Pub. L. No. 102-138 and      Section 503 of Pub. L. No. 102-140, 16 Op. O.L.C. 18, 21      (1992) (preliminary print).       Furthermore, the President's recognition power is      exclusive. See Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, 376 U.S.      398, 410 (1964) (``[p]olitical recognition is exclusively a      function of the Executive''); see also Restatement (Third) of      the Foreign Relations Law of the United States Sec. 204      (1987) (``the President has exclusive authority to recognize      or not to recognize a foreign state or government, and to      maintain or not to maintain diplomatic relations with a      foreign government''). It is well established, furthermore,      that this power is not limited to the bare act of according      diplomatic recognition to a particular government, but      encompasses as well the authority to take such actions as are      necessary to make the power of recognition an effective tool      of United States foreign policy. United States v. Pink, 315      U.S. 203, 229 (1942) (The authority to recognize governments      ``is not limited to a determination of the government to be      recognized. It includes the power to determine the policy      which is to govern the question of recognition.'').       The proposed bill would severely impair the President's      constitutional authority to determine the form and manner of      the Nation's diplomatic relations. The bill seeks to      effectuate the policy objectives that ``Jerusalem should be      recognized as the capital of the State of Israel'' and that      ``the United States Embassy should be officially open in      Jerusalem no later than May 31, 1999.'' ``To those ends, it      would prohibit the Executive Branch from obligating more than      a fixed percentage of the funds appropriated to the State      Department for ``Acquisition and Maintenance of Buildings      Abroad'' in FY 1997 until the Secretary determines and      reports to Congress that construction has begun on the site      of the United States Embassy in Jerusalem. It would also      prohibit the Executive Branch from obligating more than a      fixed percentage of the funds appropriated for the same      purpose for FY 1999 until the Secretary determines and      reports to Congress that the United States Embassy in      Jerusalem has ``officially opened.''       By thus conditioning the Executive Branch's ability to      obligate appropriated funds, the bill seeks to compel the      President to build and to open a United States Embassy to      Israel at a site of extraordinary international concern and      sensitivity. We believe that Congress cannot constitutionally      constrain the President in such a manner.       In general, because the venue at which diplomatic relations      occur is itself often diplomatically significant, Congress      may not impose on the President its own foreign policy      judgments as to the particular sites at which the United      States' diplomatic relations are to take place. More      specifically, Congress cannot trammel the President's      constitutional authority to conduct the Nation's foreign      affairs and to recognize foreign governments by directing the      relocation of an embassy. This is particularly true where, as      here, the location of the embassy is not only of great      significance in establishing the United States' relationship      with a single country, but may well also determine our      relations with an entire region of the world. Finally, to the      extent that S. 770 is intended to affect recognition policy      with respect to Jerusalem, it is inconsistent with the      exclusivity of the President's recognition power.        Our conclusions are not novel. With respect to the Foreign      Relations Authorization Act, FY 1994 & 1995, which included      provisions purporting to require the establishment of an      office in Lhasa, Tibet, the President stated that he would      ``implement them to the extent consistent with [his]      constitutional responsibilities.'' Statement by the President      at 2 (Apr. 30, 1994). The Reagan Administration objected in      1984 to a bill to compel the relocation of the United States      Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, on the grounds that      the decision was ``so closely connected with the      President's exclusive constitutional power in      responsibility to recognize, and to conduct ongoing      relations with, foreign governments as to, in our view, be      beyond the proper scope of legislative action.'' Letter to      Dante B. Fascell, Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      United States House of Representatives, from George P.      Shultz, Secretary of State, at 2 (Feb. 13, 1984). Again,      in 1987, President Reagan stated that he would construe      certain provisions of the Foreign Relations Authorization      Act, FY 1988 & 1989, including those that forbade ``the      closing of any consulates,'' in a manner that would avoid      unconstitutional interference with the President's      authority with respect to diplomacy. Pub. Papers of the      Presidents: Ronald Reagan 1542 (1987). Indeed, as long ago      as 1876, President Grant declared in a signing statement      that he would construe legislation in such a way as to      avoid ``implying a right in the legislative branch to      direct the closing or discontinuing of any of the      diplomatic or consular offices of the Government,''      because if Congress sought to do so, it would ``invade the      constitutional rights of the Executive.'' 7 James D.      Richardson (ed.) Messages and Papers of the Presidents      377-78 (1898).       Finally, it does not matter in this instance that Congress      has sought to achieve its objectives through the exercise of      its spending power, because the condition it would impose on      obligating appropriations is unconstitutional. See United      States v. Butler, 297 U.S. 1, 74 (1936); Issues Raised by      Section 129 of Pub. L. No. 102-138 and Section 503 of Pub. L.      No. 102-140, 16 Op. O.L.C. AT 30-31 (``As we have said on      several prior occasions, Congress may not use its power over      appropriation of public funds `to attach conditions to      Executive Branch appropriations requiring the President to      relinquish his constitutional discretion in foreign affairs.'      '') (citation omitted).       For the above reasons, we believe that the bill's      provisions conditioning appropriated funds on the building      and opening of a United States Embassy in Jerusalem are      unconstitutional.                                                                    ____                                       The Secretary of State,                                    Washington, DC, June 20, 1995.     Hon. Robert Dole,     Majority Leader,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Leader: I am writing to express my opposition to      S. 770, which would compel the Administration to move its      Embassy to Jerusalem. Given the sensitivity of the subject,      it is important that there be no misunderstanding on where we      stand.       There is no issue related to the Arab-Israeli negotiations      that is more sensitive than Jerusalem. It is precisely for      this reason that any effort by Congress to bring it to the      forefront is ill-advised and potentially very damaging to the      success of the peace process.       I do not say this lightly. Nor do I say it without      recognizing the depth of feeling that exists in the Congress      about moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. Both the      President and I am very much aware of this sentiment and the      reasons for it. The President expressed himself on this issue      during the 1992 campaign and he stands by that position. But      he also said at that time, and on a number of occasions since      then, that he would not take any step that would disrupt the      negotiating process and the promotion of Middle East peace.      And S. 770 would unmistakably have that consequence.       The President's commitment to promoting peace in the Middle      East has been one of his key priorities in foreign policy. It      is a commitment all of his predecessors have had since the      time of Israel's founding. The President and I know how      important the achievement of peace with security is to Israel      and to our national interests. We have worked very closely      with Israel's leaders to pursue our common interests. The      U.S.-Israeli bilateral relationship has never been stronger      and the President and I are particularly proud of that fact.       Our support for Israel will remain strong and steadfast,      and we will work actively to help Israel achieve peace with      her neighbors. Given the extraordinary progress of the last      two years, that objective appears, for perhaps the first time      in history, to be within reach. Having just returned from the      Middle East, I am even more persuaded of the opportunities      for progress which can ultimately produce a real peace. We      must not take steps that make it more difficult to achieve      that historic end.       Yet, there are few other issues that are more likely to      undermine negotiations and complicate the chances for peace      than premature focus on Jerusalem. The issues on the table      are complex enough without pushing to the fore perhaps the      most sensitive and emotional issue for Arabs and Israelis,      Muslims and Christians alike. The enemies of peace would use      the Jerusalem issue to inflame passions further and attack      those who want to see the negotiations succeed. Jerusalem is      a powerful symbol of the hopes and aspirations of all sides.      As such it has the potential to divide, to polarize, and to      divert attention from the critical issues now being      negotiated.       Palestinians and Israelis both understood this reality when      they agreed in the Declaration of Principles that Jerusalem      would be covered in the permanent status negotiations. They      recognized that deferring this highly sensitive issue as      essential if progress were to be made. The negotiations on      permanent status are slated to begin as early as May 1996.       Safeguarding the negotiations is more vital than ever. This      process is now entering an especially delicate period.      Israelis and Palestinians have set a July 1 date for an      agreement on the second phase of the Oslo accords, including      an agreement on elections for a Palestinian Council. Israeli      and Syrian Chiefs of Staff are scheduled to begin discussion      on security issues on June 27. Few actions would be more      explosive and harmful to these efforts than for the United      States--as the key sponsor of this process--to be pushing the      Jerusalem issue forward. In fact, we recently vetoed a      Resolution in the United Nations Security Council which      pushed Jerusalem to the fore precisely for this reason.      Israeli Prime Minister Rabin recently suspended land      expropriations in Jerusalem, effectively reducing the focus      on the Jerusalem issue. The last thing we should want is for      the U.S. at this very moment to put the focus back on      Jerusalem.       My opposition to this legislation is also strongly rooted      on constitutional grounds. The Justice Department's Office of      Legal Counsel has issued an opinion to the White House      Counsel concluding that the bill would unconstitutionally      invade exclusive Presidential authorities in the field of      foreign affairs. Because the bill would seek to compel the      President to build and open an embassy at a particular site      for foreign policy reasons, it is incompatible with the      separation of powers under the Constitution. This is the same      position taken by this and previous Administrations on      comparable legislative efforts to dictate the location of      diplomatic and consular facilities. Accordingly, I would be      remiss if I did not counsel the President to protect against      the unconstitutional infringement on the prerogatives of his      office.       In light of this, unless the policy and constitutional      concerns noted above are satisfactorily addressed, I will      recommend that the President veto S. 770 if it is presented      to him. I wish it were otherwise, but for the sake of Middle      East peace and the President's constitutional responsibility      in foreign policy, I will have no choice but to do so.           Sincerely,                                               Warren Christopher.
