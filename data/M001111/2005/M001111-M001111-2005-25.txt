 President, today I would like to recognize the extraordinary achievements of a gifted Washingtonian named Dr. Bonnie J. Dunbar. Dr. Dunbar is widely acknowledged as one of the world's most experienced female astronauts as well as a pioneer in biomedicl engineering. In tribute to her accomplishments, Dr. Dunbar has been selected to receive the distinguished Women in Engineering Achievement Award for 2005.  Born and raised on a ranch in Sunnyside, WA, Dr. Dunbar took an early interest in space. As a child, she studied the exploits of astronauts like Alan Shepherd and spent her nights studying the sky for signs of passing satellites. By the third grade, she had already declared that she would one day be an astronaut. Encouraged by her parents to follow her dreams, Bonnie Dunbar attended the University of Washington where she received her bachelor and master degrees in engineering, an important precursor to her career at NASA. However, her journey to space was not without its hurdles.  Like a true pioneer, Dr. Dunbar worked to break down barriers. At a time when women were generally discouraged from pursuing science based careers, Dr. Dunbar both succeeded and prospered in her field, paving the way for countless women who shared her interest in science. After receiving her doctorate in Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering from the University of Houston, Dr. Dunbar went on tohold a number of esteemed research and engineering positions in the private sector. During this time, Dr. Dunbar assisted in the development and manufacture of Space Shuttle Thermal Protection Systems integral to NASA flight operations.  In 1978, when NASA opened its astronaut program to women for the first time, Dr. Dunbar was one of the first candidates to enroll. Although she was not chosen in the final selection, NASA recognized her talents and hired her as a payload officer and flight controller. This would mark the beginning of a distinguished 27-year career at NASA. In 1981, Dr. Dunbar earned her astronaut wings and was assigned to the 1985 Challenger Spacelab mission. Following this successful mission, she was selected to participate in four more missions in space. All told, Dr. Dunbar logged more than 1,208 hours or 50 days in space.  Dr. Dunbar's exceptional performance during these missions garnered more than six NASA Space Flight Medals, including the Superior Accomplishment Award in 1997, and the NASA Exceptional Achievement Award in 1996.  Doctor Bonnie Dunbar's meteoric rise from a small ranching community in the State of Washington to a veteran of five successful missions to space is both extraordinary and inspiring. Her courageous trailblazing took the world's fascination for space to new plateaus and encouraged women to follow their dreams. She truly is a remarkable pioneer and a worthy recipient of the distinguished Women in Engineering Achievement Award for 2005.                          ____________________[Pages S12350-S12351]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                     HONORING DR.
