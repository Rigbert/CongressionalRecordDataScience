Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the National Association of Federal Credit Unions for deciding to take a leadership role in helping to raise funds for the National World War II Memorial.  At its annual Defense Credit Union Summit, NAFCU President Fred Becker announced that association members will be encouraged to make a personal donation, or by encouraging their credit union members to support the memorial through a NAFCU/World War II Memorial pledge card. Members will also be able to use the pledge card to submit names for the Registry of Remembrances for the Memorial.  I believe that all veterans and all families of veterans will appreciate this special campaign by the National Association of Federal Credit Unions. I encourage all of our colleagues to read the press release from NAFCU that I am submitting and to promote the program within their own Congressional Districts for the benefit of all World War II veterans.      NAFCU JOINS FUNDRAISING CAMPAIGN FOR NATIONAL WWII MEMORIAL       Honolulu, HI.--The National Association of Federal Credit      Unions (NAFCU) announced today at its annual Defense Credit      Union Summit that it will take a leadership role in helping      to raise funds for the National World War II Memorial.       NAFCU President Fred Becker made the announcement at a      gathering of defense credit union officials, just miles from      Pearl Harbor where the war began for America in December      1941. The Defense Summit is a one-day, defense credit union      meeting that precedes NAFCU's Annual Conference and      Exhibition, held this year at the Hawaii Convention Center,      July 19-22.       President Clinton signed legislation authorizing the      establishment of a National World War II Memorial in 1993,      and a fundraising campaign spearheaded by Senator Bob Dole      and FedEx Corporation CEO Fred Smith has now raised more than      $92 million of the estimated $100 million required to design,      construct and maintain a memorial. The NAFCU Board voted last      month to lend NAFCU's support to the campaign and to      encourage its members to promote the effort as well.       ``I think it is appropriate that we announce our      participation in the campaign here, in Honolulu, where the      battleship Missouri and the Pearl Harbor Memorial serve as      solemn reminders of America's involvement in the last world      war,'' Becker said. He noted that 16 million Americans served      in uniform during the war, and more than 400,000 died.      ``World War II was the most significant event in the last      century,'' he said. ``Without the sacrifice of that      generation, we would not enjoy the freedoms and opportunities      we have today.''       ``The World War II Memorial Campaign sincerely appreciates      the efforts of the National Association of Federal Credit      Unions and the support of the nation's federal credit unions      and their members in helping to make this memorial      possible,'' said Senator Dole.       NAFCU members will be able to participate in the campaign      in two ways: either by making a personal donation, or by      encouraging their credit union members to support the      memorial through a NAFCU/World War II Memorial pledge card      that can be obtained from the NAFCU website (or by diskette)      and distributed as a statement stuffer.       The NAFCU/WWII Memorial pledge card also will allow credit      union members to submit names for the World War II Registry      of Remembrances, which will include the names of veterans and      individuals on the home front who contributed to the war      effort. The registry will be kept on permanent display at the      National World War II Memorial.       ``The memorial and its registry will be a fitting tribute      to those who served,'' said NAFCU Chair Ron Keeler. ``I know      that many NAFCU credit union leaders and their members either      supported or served in World War II. This is a unique      opportunity to create a lasting legacy commemorating their      efforts.'' Keeler said that America is losing its WWII      veterans at the rate of 1,000 a day, adding a sense of      urgency to the campaign. ``Of the 16 million Americans who      served, fewer than six million are alive today,'' he said.       The artwork for the NAFCU/World War II Memorial pledge card      will be available on NAFCU's website at www.nafcunet.org.      Copies of the artwork can also be obtained by calling Joelle      Hahn in NAFCU's Marketing Division at 1-800-336-4644, ext.      227.       NAFCU is the only national organization of credit unions      that focuses exclusively on federal issues affecting credit      unions, representing its members before the federal      government and the public.                               ____________________
