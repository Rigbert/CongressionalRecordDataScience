Speaker, Ohioans, particularly those of Ukrainian ancestry, were saddened to hear of the passing yesterday of Cardinal Myroslav Lubachivsky, the head of Ukraine's Greek Catholic Church. Cardinal Lubachivsky was born in 1914 in the town of Dolyna in the Western Ukrainian province of Galicia and died not far from there in the city of Lviv, where he served as Archbishop and Metropolitan for millions of Ukrainian Catholics worldwide, including many in Ohio. Although the Cardinal was born in Western Ukraine and served his people as their spiritual leader until his last days, he spent more than half his life outside his native land, including 33 years in the United States.  Cardinal Lubachivsky left Ukraine in 1938 as a young priest to study in Austria. After the Second World War, he came to America where he spent more than twenty years serving as assistant pastor at Sts. Peter & Paul Ukrainian Catholic Church in Cleveland's Tremont neighborhood. There he celebrated mass, presided over the marriages of happy couples, baptized their newly-born infants and spoke the final words over the graves of thousands of his parishioners. He even drove the school bus for children attending the parish grade school. This scholarly, yet humble man seemed content to serve God and his fellow Ukrainian-Americans in this quiet, unassuming way when unexpectedly he was elevated to be the Metropolitan-Archbishop of Philadelphia. In 1980, he moved to the Vatican and in 1984, became worldwide head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church following the death of the saintly Cardinal Joseph Slipy.  Joseph Slipy had become the head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in 1944 when Western Ukraine was incorporated into the Soviet Union. Prior to that, Western Ukraine had been part of the Austrian Empire and Poland. Almost immediately, the Soviet Secret Police started carrying out Stalin's order to liquidate the Ukrainian Catholic Church. The entire clergy was either arrested or forced to renounce their faith. Most declined to do so and ended up in Siberia or were shot. Archbishop-Metropolitan Slipy spent 17 years in labor camps until Pope John XXIII finally negotiated his release in 1963. As a cardinal of the Catholic Church, Joseph Slipy went to work rebuilding his church in the underground in Ukraine and in places like Cleveland, Ohio where Myroslav Lubachivsky served as assistant pastor.  In 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union, His Eminence Myroslav Lubachivsky, a Cardinal and a U.S. citizen, returned in triumph to the city of Lviv to preside over the Ukrainian Catholic Church and its historic St. George's Cathedral. ``This native church of mine was resurrected and rose from the grave,'' he said at the time. Tens of thousands of Ukrainian Catholics, many weeping and singing hymns, lined the streets to greet their Cardinal and Archbishop-Metropolitan.  Cardinal Myroslav Lubachivsky had one of the most extraordinary and fulfilling lives that spanned nearly the entire 20th Century. He served through some of the most difficult periods of that turbulent ear and he lived to see his faith and the faith of millions of his parishioners rewarded with the restoration of his church, which not only survived enormous evil, but ultimately prevailed over it. I join in paying tribute to this great man and offer my condolences to all those in Ohio and throughout the world who benefited from his spiritual guidance and leadership and now mourn his passing.                          ____________________
