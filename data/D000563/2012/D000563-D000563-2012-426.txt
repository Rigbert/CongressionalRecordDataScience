President, this is a very simple amendment. If you go into the drugstore and look at the prescription drugs, every one of them has been registered with the FDA. The over-the-counter drugs have all been registered. When you go to the dietary supplement section, there is no requirement under the law for the company selling those products to register the name of the product, the ingredients of it, or a copy of the label.  The GAO did a study in 2009, and the FDA said we need this information to protect American consumers. From what? One of them is an example on this chart. This is a Chinese product that was imported into the United States, put up for sale, and then we discovered that one of the ingredients was life-threatening. It was never registered with the FDA, and there was no disclosure of its ingredients.  If you want to sell from the counters in America, shouldn't you be required, whether you are from China, India, Mexico, or anywhere in the United States, to register your product, the ingredients in it, and a copy of the label? The FDA says they need this information to keep America safe.
