President, I am concerned at the continuing lack of any real, strong effort to confirm Federal judges this year compared to the situation in the last year of President Bush's term in office with a Democratic controlled Senate. We confirmed 66 judges--actually confirmed judges and had hearings right through September. Now we have very, very few hearings.  While I am glad to see the Judiciary Committee moving forward with a few of the many qualified judicial nominees to fill the scores of vacancies that continue to plague our Federal courts, I am disappointed that there were no nominees to the Court of Appeals included at this hearing. I have said since the beginning of this year that the American people should measure our progress by our treatment of the many qualified nominees, including outstanding women and minorities, to the Court of Appeals around the country. The committee and the Senate are falling well short of the mark.  With 21 vacancies on the Federal appellate courts across the country, and nearly half of the total judicial emergency vacancies in the Federal courts system in our appellate courts, our courts of appeals are being denied the resources that they need. Their ability to administer justice for the American people is being hurt. There continue to be multiple vacancies on the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, Tenth and District of Columbia Circuits. The vacancy rate for our courts of appeals is more than 11 percent nationwide--and that does not begin to take into account the additional judgeships requested by theJudicial Conference to handle their increased workloads. If we added the 11 additional appellate judges being requested, the vacancy rate would be 16 percent. Still, not a single qualified candidate for one of these vacancies on our Federal appellate courts is being heard today.  At our first executive business meeting of the year, I noted the opportunity we had to make bipartisan strides toward easing the vacancy crisis in our nation's Federal courts. I believed that a confirmation total of 65 by the end of the year was achievable if we made the effort, exhibited the commitment, and did the work that was needed to be done. I urged that we proceed promptly with confirmations of a number of outstanding nominations to the court of appeals, including qualified minority and women candidates. Unfortunately, that is not what has happened.  Just as there was no appellate court nominee included in the April confirmation hearing, there is no appellate court nominee included today. Indeed, this committee has not reported a nomination to a court of appeals vacancy since April 12, and it has reported only two all year. The committee has yet to report the nomination of Allen Snyder to the District of Columbia Circuit, although his hearing was 8 weeks ago; the nomination of Bonnie Campbell to the Eighth Circuit, although her hearing was 6 weeks ago; or the nomination of Judge Johnnie Rawlinson, although her hearing was 4 weeks ago. Left waiting for a hearing are a number of outstanding nominees, including Judge Helene White for a judicial emergency vacancy in the Sixth Circuit; Judge James Wynn, Jr., for a judicial emergency vacancy in the Fourth Circuit; Kathleen McCree Lewis, another outstanding nominee to the multiple vacancies on the Sixth Circuit; Enrique Moreno, for a judicial emergency vacancy in the Fifth Circuit; Elena Kagan, to one of the multiple vacancies on the District of Columbia Circuit; and Roger L. Gregory, an outstanding nominee to another judicial emergency vacancy in the Fourth Circuit.  I deeply regret that the Senate adjourned last November and left the Fifth Circuit to deal with the crisis in the Federal administration of justice in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi without the resources that it desperately needs. It is a situation that I wished we had confronted by expediting consideration of nominations to that court last year. I still hope that the Senate will consider them this year to help that circuit.  I continue to urge the Senate to meet its responsibilities to all nominees, including women and minorities. That all of these highly qualified nominees are being needlessly delayed is most regrettable. The Senate should join with the President to confirm these well-qualified, diverse and fair-minded nominees to fulfill the needs of the Federal courts around the country.  During the committee's business meeting on June 27, Chairman Hatch noted that the Senate has confirmed seven nominees to the courts of appeals this year--as if we had done our job and need do no more. What he failed to note is that all seven were holdovers who had been nominated in prior years. Five of the seven were reported to the Senate for action before this year, and two had to be reported twice before the Senate would vote on them. The Senate took more than 49 months to confirm Judge Richard Paez, who was nominated back in January 1996, and more than 26 months to confirm Marsha Berzon, who was nominated in January 1998. Tim Dyk, who was nominated in April 1998, was confirmed after more than two years. This is hardly a record of prompt action of which anyone can be proud.  Chairman Hatch then compared this year's total against totals from other presidential election years. The only year to which this can be favorably compared was 1996 when the Republican majority in the Senate refused to confirm even a single appellate court judge to the Federal bench. Again, that is hardly a comparison in which to take pride. Let us compare to the year 1992, in which a Democratic majority in the Senate confirmed 11 Court of Appeals nominees during a Republican President's last year in office among the 66 judicial confirmations for the year. That year, the committee held three hearings in July, two in August, and a final hearing for judicial nominees in September. The seven judicial nominees included in the September 24 hearing were all confirmed before adjournment that year--including a court of appeals nominee. We have a long way to go before we can think about resting on any laurels.  Having begun so slowly in the first half of this year, we have much more to do before the Senate takes its final action on judicial nominees this year. We should be considering 20 to 30 more judges this year, including at least another half dozen for the court of appeals. We cannot afford to follow the ``Thurmond Rule'' and stop acting on these nominees now in anticipation of the presidential election in November. We must use all the time until adjournment to remedy the vacancies that have been perpetuated on the courts to the detriment of the American people and the administration of justice. That should be a top priority for the Senate for the rest of this year. In the last three months in session in 1992, between July 12 and October 8, 1992, the Senate confirmed 32 judicial nominations. I will work with Chairman Hatch to match that record.  One of our most important constitutional responsibilities as United States Senators is to advise and consent on the scores of judicial nominations sent to us to fill the vacancies on the federal courts around the country. I look forward to our next confirmation hearing and to the inclusion of qualified candidates for some of the many vacancies on our Federal Court of Appeals.                          ____________________
