President, today I would like to recognize Mr. Joseph ``Joe'' Burke for his 33 years of service with the U.S. Capitol Police.  Joe was raised and educated in Pennsylvania and Virginia. He attended Moravia College in Pennsylvania and graduated with a degree in criminal justice. Joe's studies didn't occupy all his time while at Moravia; he was an extremely talented baseball player and tried out for the Pittsburgh Pirates.  After choosing a career in law enforcement, Joe joined the U.S. Capitol Police on December 8, 1975. He served in several positions within the department before finding his true calling--the Containment and Emergency Response Team, CERT, in 1981.  Joe was among the original members of CERT upon its inception in 1981. The tryouts for CERT were strenuous; held at the FBI Academy, they consisted of shooting drills, running an obstacle course and jumping into a pool with a rubber gun before swimming the length of the pool. The Unit started with three five-man teams that train twice a month. This modest beginning has grown into the CERT we see today--a highly trained, full-time tactical team.  Over the years, Joe has remained committed to serving the congressional community. He has served during several challenging periods for the Capitol Police including the tragic shooting at the Capitol, the attacks on September 11, 2001, and the anthrax mailings. Joe's experience was invaluable during big events, too--the state funerals of Presidents Reagan and Ford, demonstrations, eight Presidential Inaugurations and numerous State of the Union Addresses.  Joe Burke's experience and service have helped CERT become a SWAT team that ranks among the top teams in the country. He is responsible for many of the programs currently used by the Capitol Police to train CERT personnel.  Joe has been recognized for his leadership and efforts to develop an enhanced and professional tactical team and for his work with area teams to develop response and coverage capabilities across the region.  Mr. President, Joe Burke retired from the U.S. Capitol Police on January 3, 2009. I would like to thank him for his years of service to the congressional community and ask that my colleagues join me in wishing Joe well in his retirement.                          ____________________
