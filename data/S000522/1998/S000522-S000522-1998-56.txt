Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Nebraska (Chairman Bereuter), my good friend, for his excellent remarks and for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, the newspapers each day report on the brutality and the military attacks on the civilians in Kosovo, and the prospects of a rising death toll are more and more likely unless we press for a cease-fire and make certain that Milosevic understands that we will not allow the situation to drag on and on.  The news from the Kosovo front seems like deja vu, reminiscent of the wars in Croatia and Bosnia. The common thread in all of this destruction and war is Slobodan Milosevic. Today, Congress can go on record. SlobodanMilosevic must be held accountable for war crimes against humanity and genocide. The United States leadership must not ignore the compelling case of complicity which has been compiled against Milosevic.  In the prima facie case for Milosevic's indictment prepared by Paul Williams and Norman Cigar, they conclude that this, and I quote, ``is a compelling and legal factual case that Slobodan Milosevic, through forces and agencies under his control, is responsible for directing and aiding and abetting war crimes on an extensive scale.''  The prima facie case focuses on evidence from years of both the Croatian war and the Bosnian war. Mr. Williams directs the Public International Law and Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and Dr. Cigar, a research fellow at the Balkan Institute, was professor of national security studies at the U.S. Marine Corps School of Advanced Warfighting in Quantico, Virginia, and a senior political-military analyst for the Army Staff at the Pentagon. For the benefit of my colleagues, I submit a summary of their statement for the Record: War Crimes and Individual Responsibility: A Prima Facie Case for the                     Indictment of Slobodan Milosevic   (Prepared by Paul Williams and Norman Cigar, The Balkan Institute)                           executive summary       When queried as to whether Slobodan Milosevic is ultimately      responsible for the widespread and systematic atrocities that      have been committed in the former Yugoslavia, most policy-     makers will readily indicate that of course everyone      ``knows'' that Slobodan Milosevic is responsible for the      worst atrocities to plague Europe since WWII. They often add,      however, that there is simply no ``proof'' that he ordered      the commission of these atrocities.       Recognizing that it is not possible to orchestrate ethnic      cleansing and genocide on the scale that has occurred in the      former Yugoslavia without leaving some proof of one's      responsibility, this study seeks to examine whether there is      sufficient information available in the public domain to      establish a prima facie case that Slobodan Milosevic is      individually responsible for the commission of war crimes in      the former Yugoslavia.       In order to ascertain Slobodan Milosevic's individual      responsibility for war crimes, this study does not seek to      develop any creative legal devices for attaching liability,      but rather limits itself strictly to legal avenues as set      forth in the statute, rules of procedure and evidence, and      the previous indictments of the International Criminal      Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. Similarly, the study      relies upon information that is widely available in the      public domain, including accounts from senior Serb      paramilitary leaders--such as ``Arkan'' and Vojislav Seselj--     and officials in Slobodan Milosevic's own government, as well      as information collected by international organizations and      foreign governments.       Based upon an examination of the legal precedent of the      International Criminal Tribunal and the publicly available      evidence, this study concludes that there is a compelling      legal and factual case that Slobodan Milosevic, through      forces and agencies under his control, is responsible for      directing and aiding and abetting war crimes on an extensive      scale. Specifically;       Yugoslav Federal and Republic of Serbia forces and agencies      and their paramilitary agents committed widespread atrocities      in Croatia and Bosnia against both civilians and prisoners of      war. These atrocities included the criminal acts of killing,      expulsion, rape, detention in concentration camps, forced      labor, torture, mutilation, and the looting and destruction      of property. All of these acts were perpetrated on a large      scale, and often with severe brutality.       Slobodan Milosevic, by virtue of his formal positions and      informal power base, exercised power, influence, and control      over the Yugoslav Federal and Republic of Serbia forces and      agencies and their paramilitary agents responsible for the      commission of war crimes.       By virtue of Slobodan Milosevic's official and/or effective      control over forces responsible for the commission of war      crimes, he may be held individually responsible for ordering,      planning, or instigating those crimes.       By virtue of Slobodan Milosevic's official and/or effective      control over Serbian Republic forces and agencies, such as      Serbia's Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Internal      Affairs, that were active in the initial organization of      Serbian paramilitary agents, including the provision of      financial resources and weapons, and that provided their      paramilitary agents with access to Croatia and Bosnia,      Slobodan Milosevic may properly be held individually      responsible for the war crime of aiding and abetting the      commission of war crimes.       Slobodan Milosevic, as the superior authority over Yugoslav      Federal and Republic of Serbia forces and agencies, is      individually responsible for failing to prevent or punish      their commission of war crimes.       This study therefore finds that it is possible and      reasonable to construct a prima facie case for the indictment      of Slobodan Milosevic for the commission of war crimes in the      former Yugoslavia.  Mr. Speaker, the evidence of war crimes, brutal killings, and other atrocities in Kosovo is, as I said, mounting with each and every passing day.  Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, John Shattuck, just returned in recent days from Kosovo. He makes a compelling case that, and I quote, ``there is substantial evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and violations of international humanitarian law * * * [which are] * * * subject to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.''  Mr. Shattuck was accompanied by former Senator Bob Dole, head of the International Commission on Missing Persons in the former Yugoslavia. In Mr. Dole's opinion editorial printed in today's Washington Post, he reminds us that ``American officials have pledged not to allow the crimes against humanity that we witnessed in Bosnia to be repeated in Kosovo. From what [Mr. Dole] has seen, such crimes are already occurring,'' as he writes in the op-ed today. In fact, I would like to submit his very moving piece for the Record as well.  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Dole recounts a scene that is reminiscent of my own experience with Mr. Milosevic when the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf) and I met with him in Belgrade in September of 1991. At that time, Milosevic claimed that Yugoslav forces were not sending military jets to threaten and bomb Croatia, and yet both the gentleman from Virginia and I had personally witnessed overflights by two Yugoslav MIG fighters a couple of days before in the besieged town of Vukovar. In fact, in order to get to that town, we had to go through a corn field because it was surrounded by tanks and artillery and snipers. We saw devastated schools and churches and homes that had been leveled in a ``scorched earth'' policy. A couple of days later when we met with Mr. Milosevic, he denied it all and we had been eyewitnesses to it all.  Mr. Dole, in a like fashion, reports that Milosevic denied any Serbian offensives were being planned or undertaken for Kosovo. Not 24 hours after Mr. Dole and Mr. Shattuck departed, Serbian troops began a destructive offensive in the region of Pec. Milosevic thinks he can get away with lying. Certainly to date, the Serbian forces have escaped the scrutiny of the International Criminal Tribunal, and we need to make sure that does not continue to happen.  Mr. Speaker, the chief prosecutor, Louise Arbour, has already stated that the ``nature and scale of the fighting [in Kosovo] indicate that an armed conflict, within the meaning of international law, clearly exists in Kosovo.'' As a consequence, she has said she intends to bring charges for crimes against humanity or war crimes if such evidence is established.  Mr. Speaker, I believe the case for the commission of war crimes will be made easily when the political will is established to proceed down that path, and so far that has been lacking. While the resolution we are considering today focuses on Milosevic and his culpability, there are a multitude of others who are on the run, some in Serbia. Even in recent weeks the Department of State has publicly admitted the United States has reason to believe that Mladic is in Serbia and the United States continues to pressure Milosevic to surrender the three Yugoslav military members who were indicted by the Tribunal for their involvement in the destruction and crimes in Vukovar.  Mr. Speaker, Milosevic needs to get the message loudly and clearly. The resolution calls for the U.S. to collect and provide evidence of Milosevic's culpability to the International War Crimes Tribunal, and to date, to the best of our knowledge, we have not done so. The measure affirms Congress' support for the Tribunal and calls on the U.S. to engage our NATO allies in the provision of evidence helpful in the work of the Tribunal.  Mr. Speaker, I would alert Members that we are working to have a hearing on what is going on in Kosovo in the Helsinki Commission on Thursday. We hope to have Mr. Dole and Mr.Shattuck testify. We are working on the details of that right now.  This resolution, which I hope will pass unanimously, will put us clearly on record as saying let us collect that evidence and get it to the Tribunal. Let us stop putting the evidence aside, which is what we have been doing for all of these months and years with regard to Milosevic.  Mr. Speaker, innocent civilians--women, children, and men--are losing their lives, their livestock, their homes and their hope. We are getting reports that Serbian forces are attacking and killing civilians and then food supplies are being destroyed and crops in the field are being torched. A couple of weeks ago, three members of the Mother Theresa Society who were driving tractors and trailers filled with relief supplies were killed when attacked by a Serbian armored vehicle. Serbian officials had shortly before cleared the relief vehicles at a checkpoint. The relief had been provided by Doctors of the World which has since announced suspension of its assistance in Kosovo.  The Christian Science Monitor quoted a Kosovar school teacher, ``First the police destroyed and looted our houses * * * Then they surrounded us with tanks and separated the men from the women and children. They beat the men and took them away.'' With the blockade of humanitarian assistance and the scorched earth policies of the armed forces, food and provisions are being used as weapons of the war.  Mr. Speaker, I agree with Mr. Dole that Kosovo ``is a political and military crisis, whose most visible symptoms are humanitarian. There should be no doubt that this is a war against civilians for political purposes.'' Just last week, Julia Taft, Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees and Migration estimated that we will see 100,000 to 200,000 casualties in the next few months if the fighting and attacks are not brought to an abrupt end. With winter approaching, the hundreds of thousands of homeless and the estimated 50,000 or so who are living in the fields and forests will be particularly vulnerable. The numbers will only escalate.  I encourage the House to unanimously approve the resolution before us.
