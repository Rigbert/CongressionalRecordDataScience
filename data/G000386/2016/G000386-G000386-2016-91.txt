 President, for much of this Congress, I have been working on a bipartisan basis to correct a little understood provision in the Affordable Care Act, ACA, that punishes small businesses for attempting to help their employees purchase individual insurance.  That is right, this provision actually punishes businesses that want to do the right thing and help their employees obtain health insurance coverage.  This is a result of so-called market reforms in the ACA, which based on IRS guidance generally prohibit employers from reimbursing their employees for the cost of health insurance the employee purchases on the individual market. An employer who does do this faces a $100 a day per employee penalty.  This fails to meet the common sense test, particularly when it comes to farmers, ranchers, and small business owners who frequently do not have the resources to offer a traditional group health plan to their employees.  These businesses have no obligation under the ACA to offer any form of insurance. However, they would like to do what they can to help their employees obtain coverage. This is a practice that should be commended, not penalized.  This is why last June 1 introduced the Small Business Health Care Relief Act with Senator Heitkamp. Under our bill, small businesses would once again be able to do something many have done for years. Namely, reimburse their employees on a pre-tax basis for the purchase of health insurance on the individual market.  Since introduction, Senator Heitkamp and I have been working, along with Congressman Boustany and Thompson in the House, with the Joint Committee on Taxation and Treasury to get feedback on our bill to ensure it works as intended.  I am pleased today to see that this hard work is starting to bear fruit. The Ways and Means Committee marked up and favorably reported to the full House a slightly revised version of our bill with bipartisan support.  In hopes of continuing this momentum, Senator Heitkamp and I are reintroducing this revised version of the Small Business Health Care Relief Act in the Senate today.  This new version mainly makes improvements to the bill to ensure the bill will work as intended. Further, in order to address cost concerns, the bill imposes a generous limit on the amount an employer may provide to their employee to purchase individual insurance. This limit is set at $5,130 for individuals and $10,260 for a family. These amounts are indexed for inflation going forward.  I am pleased that our bill continues to have strong support from the small business community, including the National Association of Home Builders, the National Association for the Self-Employed, the National Federation of Independent Business, the Council for Affordable Health Coverage, the American Farm Bureau, and many more.  This legislation should be a no brainer for anyone who supports small business. I hope with today's action in the Ways and Means Committee, it is only a matter of time before this legislation becomes law. I urge all my colleagues to work with Senator Heitkamp and me to see to it that this becomes a reality.                          ____________________
