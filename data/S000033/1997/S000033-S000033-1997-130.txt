 Speaker, according to the New York Times, a GAO report to be released later this week ``harshly criticized the Pentagon and a special White House panel over their investigation of the illnesses reported by veterans of the 1991 Persian Gulf war, and has found that there is substantial evidence linking nerve gas and other chemical weapons to the sorts of health problems seen among the veterans.''  Frankly, as a member of the Subcommittee on Human Resources of the gentleman from Connecticut, Mr. Chris Shays, which has been studying this issue for several years, the GAO conclusion is no surprise to me. Our committee has heard time and time again from scientists and scholars who believe very strongly that a major cause of Persian Gulf war ills is the synergistic effects of chemicals that our soldiers were exposed to, as well as drugs they were given as preventative measures, such as pyridostigmine bromide.  Mr. Speaker, the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Illnesses was wrong when it concluded in December 1996 that chemical exposure was not a cause of Persian Gulf illness, and that stress was the major factor. That error has delayed and deflected necessary research and treatment for tens of thousands of veterans who are suffering today.  Mr. Speaker, I am circulating a letter that I hope my colleagues will sign, asking the Presidential Advisory Committee to reassess its findings.                          ____________________
