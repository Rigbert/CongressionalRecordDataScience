 I talked to the Parliamentarians. Interestingly, the presiding officer did not ask: Does any Member want to change his vote? Because once that, as I understand it, is intoned, then the ability to change one's vote, except to come forward and be seen in changing your vote, was not stated, which I suggest to the chairman of the Rules Committee, who knows the rules very well, is unusual--perhaps not against the rules--but unusual.  And the vote was an extended vote. The Speaker, Speaker Ryan, has talked to us from the rostrum, saying that we want to keep votes to a limited period of time. Particularly, I would suggest, we all want to keep votes to a limited period of time when it is a so-called getaway day.  But in this instance, that did not occur. In this instance, to change from 217 to a lesser number that was a losing number--215-214, I believe, was the final vote--excuse me, 212-213, 212 ``ayes.'' So five votes were switched, net. However, one person voted late. Again, seven people changed their vote.  You are correct. They had a right to do that, but the consequences of that vote are subject to debate. And I raise for you, for this House, and for the American people, that the changing of those seven votes resulted in this House saying to the President of the United States: You cannot tell contractors that they cannot discriminate.  That, I think, was unfortunate.  I yield to my friend.
