President, I take this opportunity to congratulate the Association of Metropolitan Sewerage Agencies, AMSA, on the occasion of its 35th anniversary and on its name change to the National Association of Clean Water Agencies or NACWA. NACWA is the only association that exclusively represents the Nation's municipal wastewater treatment agencies. Its 35-year record of advocacy and leadership in fully meeting the goals of the Clean Water Act has helped guarantee the chemical, biological and physical health of our Nation's rivers, lakes, streams, bays, and coasts.  NACWA's members serve the majority of the sewered population in the country and treat and reclaim over 18 billion gallons of wastewater a day. Simply stated, NACWA and its members deserve to be celebrated for their ongoing role in the remarkable revitalization of America's waterways.  Despite the improvements made so far to the Nation's waters, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and NACWA understand that significant work remains to be done to achieve the lofty goals of the Clean Water Act. From the committee's close working relationship with the association, we know NACWA is well-positioned to continue to build on this Nation's water quality gains.  The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee has looked to AMSA and will continue to look to NACWA as a valued informational resource. The association has always been willing to share its expertise and to provide leadership in challenging times. For example, in the wake of the attacks on September 11, 2001, the association responded immediately with creative ideas and vital leadership in developing tools and resources to help further secure the Nation's critical water infrastructure. In fact, the association has been a vital resource on a host of clean water issues from wet weather control and the critical need for a Federal-State-local partnership to meet the Nation's clean water challenges.  As chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I have worked closely with the association and know that NACWA will build on its tradition as a trusted resource for Congress and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. I am also confident that NACWA will meet its strategic objectives and the goals of AMSA's original founders. Most importantly, NACWA's success is a direct result of its unparalleled membership. NACWA, then AMSA, was established in 1970 by representatives of 22 municipal wastewater treatment agencies. Since then, AMSA has grown into an organization of nearly 300 municipal agency members, including Oklahoma City, Stillwater and Tulsa, and a total membership of nearly 400 organizations poised to ensure that the 21st century will enjoy continued water quality progress.  The association's public agency members not only represent what is best about public service, they exemplify what it means to be environmental practitioners. Their daily work enables us to enjoy our Nation's rivers, lakes, streams and bays--somethng we as a National must never take for granted.  Once again, I congratulate NACWA on this important milestone as an organization and applaud its members for their outstanding service.                          ____________________[Page S4182]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]              RECOGNITION OF AMSA ON ITS 35TH ANNIVERSARY
