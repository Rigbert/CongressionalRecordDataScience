Mr. Speaker, this morning Speaker Gingrich will present a check to students who participate in the Earning by Learning Program which pays schoolchildren $2 for every book they read.  Speaker Gingrich has touted this program for years, stressing the low overhead as a major selling point. In a speech this January the Speaker declared:       The money only goes to the kids * * * So if you have $1,000      you can pay for 500 books, whereas in the welfare state      model, if you have $1,000, you pay $850 of it for the      bureaucracy.  But, lo and behold, according to the Wall Street Journal this week, Mr. Gingrich's official biographer, Mel Steely, also happens to run this program. And according to this report Mr. Steely and two friends were paid 90 percent, yes 90 percent, of the money raised in the past year for the program.  Ninety percent for the Speaker's friends and 10 percent for the children; this is the way, this is the way things work in the Gingrich corporate welfare model.                          ____________________
