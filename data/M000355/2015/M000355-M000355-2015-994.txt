 President, the senior Senator from Tennessee, as he often does, has laid it out very well. I believe it is the case the U.S. Senate is the only legislative body in the world where a simple majority is not enough on almost everything.  This body was crafted in a way that would ensure, unless one side has a really big majority, that we work together, but it doesn't automatically work unless you have leaders like Senator Alexander and Senator Murray who want to get a result.  So I want to commend both these outstanding Senators for an extraordinary accomplishment. This is a significant bill for the country, and to fold all of these disparate interest groups, with all their separate agendas, into a position of support was an extraordinary leadership contribution. So I say to both of you, both the Senator from Washington and the Senator from Tennessee, the Senate is proud of you for what you did here.  This is a good example for all the rest of us. On a little more contentious issue, Senator Murray and I had a chance to work together on trade promotion authority. We hope to do that on highways. We hope to do it on cyber security. The Senate is back to work. I think Members on both sides appreciate that, and we are going to continue to do this, but I thank both Senators for providing a wonderful example for all the rest of us.  I yield the floor.
