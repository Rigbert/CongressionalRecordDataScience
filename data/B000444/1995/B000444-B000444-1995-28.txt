 The conference report cuts $5 million from the $54 million boost requested for the DEA by the President. Again, we hear a lot of talk about how we need more to fight illegal drugs, and there is much finger-pointing about that the administration should do more, and they should. But in the end, it is the Congress that fails to fund the drug enforcement request of the President.  In yet another important area, let us review what has happened in interagency drug enforcement. The organized crime and drug enforcement task forces combine the efforts of the FBI, the DEA, U.S. attorneys, Immigration and Naturalization and the Marshal Service, Customs Service, U.S. Coast Guard, and the Internal Revenue, all working together in 13 regional task forces to target and destroy major narcotic trafficking organizations. And you need them all. The President requested $378 million for this program, but the Republican conference cut this amount by $19 million. This means that we will cut the important drug-fighting capacity below the 1995 level. In other words, you have all decided that the drug problem, I guess, is less worse this year than last year, notwithstanding all your speeches, with which I agree, that the problem is worse this year than it was last. But you decided to cut it. You did not decide to say we should restructure it or that the money is not being used wisely and we should redo it; you decided to keep the existing system and cut it.  Let me also point out that the Republican conference report cuts the President's request for U.S. attorneys, U.S. prosecutors. Our Federal prosecutors are the ones who prosecute all Federal crimes. You cut this by $13 million. The President requested an increase of $86 million to boost Federal prosecutors, but the conference report backed away from this commitment. In short, the conference report cuts the President's request for Federal law enforcement. So our Federal effort against crime and drugs will be fought by fewer FBI agents, fewer DEA agents, and fewer Federal prosecutors than requested. I assume that is because you all think that there is less crime, that there is less of a drug problem, and there is less of a need to prosecute.  If you believe that, this is fine, no problem. But somebody stand up and tell me that. Stand up and tell me that is the reason why you cut it back. If you tell me you cut it back for budgetary reasons, then I say, fine, you have made your priority choice. You have chosen other things to spend money on, or to cut taxes for, rather than on these. That is a legitimate position to take. But do not get up and tell me how you want to fight crime, how it has gotten so bad, how it is so terrible, how we want to move so rapidly on it, but, by the way, we can all do it with less money and effort. That does not work. That does not work, I respectfully suggest. It may work politically, but not practically.  I would like to return to the merits of the 1994 crime law. The 1994 crime law, in my view, and in the view of law enforcement officers across the country, is working. The passage of the major $30 billion anticrime package last year capped a 6-year effort to launch a bold and comprehensive and tough attack on violent crime in the roots of American communities. As we pass the 1 year mark, it is already clear that the major programs of the bill are working even beyond my expectations. Consider the 100,000 cops program. If this had been a typical grant program, the Federal Government would just now, at the end of the first fiscal year of funding, be preparing to issue its first awards. That is how it has worked in the six Presidential administrations I have been here for. They would be just now doing it.  The better part of the year would have been consumed drafting regulations and preparing application forms before money could finally be disbursed at the end of the year. The implementation of the 1994 crime law stands in stark contrast to this typical scenario. Instead of requiring burdensome applications that often fail to work and fill entire binders, a one-page application was developed by the Attorney General. Instead of waiting until the end of the year to distribute the funds, the money was awarded in batches beginning only weeks after the passage of the law. As a result, we find ourselves, at the end of the first year, with nearly all the fiscal year money out the door, with all of the funds having already been sent on their way to the States, and with more than 25,000 out of 100,000 new cops already funded in every State in the Nation. In a word, the law is working.  In addition to the new police, the law's provisions combating violence against women are also working. The first criminal has been tried and convicted under the new Federal violence against women statute, resulting in a life sentence for Christopher J. Bailey, who kidnapped and beat his wife nearly to death. Otherwise, he would have only gotten a couple years in jail. In addition, charges have already been filed in another case. Every State has received a grant to increase the police, prosecutors, and the victim services to combat family violence. Rape shield laws have been extended to protect more victims. Women no longer have to pay for medical examinations to prove they are raped, which had been the practice up until now. The victims of rape are finally being treated like the victims of any other crime. These long-overdue measures mean that women are now being protected, instead of further victimized, by the criminal justice system.  Another major accomplishment of the 1994 crime law is the military-style boot camp prisons. Crime law dollars are already at work helping 27 States plan and build and run military-style boot camps for nonviolent offenders. Boot camps allow States suffering from overcrowding problems to move nonviolent prisoners into cheaper space. Boot camps cost about one-third the price, per bed, as a conventional prison, and thereby free up space for the most violent offenders in conventional prisons.  Yet, another effort that is already underway is the drug court program. But before I move to that, let me tell you what this prison program in the crime law would look like after it goes through this reincarnation, were the President not to veto this.  The prison program in the crime law we passed last year was designed to meet two goals: First, to help States increase and then use to a maximum advantage the supply of prison space they have available to them. The second purpose was to encourage States to adopt the kind of truth-in-sentencing system that has been instituted by the Federal Government, to which I referred about 15 minutes ago. Today, prison systems in 34 States are under court order for overcrowding, and because there are not enough prison cells, many States are keeping violent criminals behind bars for roughly only 46 percent of the time for which they have been sentenced.  Worse yet, 30,000 offenders, who each year are convicted of a violent crime, do not even see a single, solitary day in prison. That is, 30,000 convicted in State court systems of a violent crime do not see a single day in prison because the States either do not have the money or do not have the leadership or do not have the gumption to tell the taxpayers that if they want these tough laws, they have to build more prisons.  The 1994 crime law is helping States respond to that problem with a $9.7 billion grant program. Under the 1994 crime law, States can use the money to build and operate additional secure prison cells for violent criminals or for boot camp prisons for nonviolent offenders, thereby freeing up secured prison space for violent offenders.  Let me tell you about these boot camps. Today, there are 160,000 young, nonviolent minor offenders who are behind bars in costly prison cells. That just does not make any sense. They are nonviolent, they are first offenders primarily, and they are behind bars at more than what it costs per year to send your kid to Harvard or Yale.  What this does, the crime law encourages States to take them out of those systems if they choose, put them in boot camps where you string barbed wire, you have the equivalent of Quonset huts. Make them engage in military-style activities to occupy them. It does not hurt marines or trainees. Surely, it will not hurt them at about one-third the cost.  I am encouraged that the Republicans' prison proposal permits States to use the funds for boot camps. That is an important change, I might add, and I compliment them for that on the House bill. But the fact of the matter is, it is a big change.  One of the key problems in the Republican prison plan is it permits States only to build or expand prisons, leaving out the ability to spend the funds to operate the present system. The State of Florida, when we had this debate on the bill, had built new prisons. They are sitting there with not a prisoner in them because they do not have the money to operate the prisons. They needed them badly but did not have the budget to operate them. This just does not make sense.  When the 1994 prison provisions were written we heard from several States about these operating problems. A close look at the fine print in this bill reveals what I believe is one of the most troublesome aspects. While $617 million is appropriated for prison grants in the conference report, the Republican conferees raided $200 million of that fund to fund prisons in just seven or eight States.  Let me explain that. The bill directly funds $300 million to reimburse States for the cost of housing criminal aliens in State prisons. That was a provision included in the 1994 crime law. I support that goal.  On top of that $300 million in direct appropriations to reimburse States for incarcerating criminal aliens, language was slipped into the bill so that an additional $200 million was shifted from general prison grants for all States through the Criminal Alien Reimbursement Program. I assume that was a legacy of the Senator from Texas before he went to the Finance Committee. So that means a few States are going to get the money.  I point out to my colleagues if you are not from Arizona, Florida, Texas, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, California, or Michigan, funds that should have gone to building prisons in your States have been stolen in this conference report. I think this is outrageous.  I support the need to reimburse States for these costs, but in the 1994 crime law, we recognize that crime is plaguing all States, not just a few of the largest States in America.  I have a list here that I ask unanimous consent to have printed at this point, entitled ``Conference Report Prison Funding--How Does Your State Do?''  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                            CONFERENCE REPORT PRISON FUNDING--HOW DOES YOUR STATE DO?
