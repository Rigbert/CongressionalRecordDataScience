 President, today I am proud to recognize Fort Knox, an important asset of our national defense infrastructure in my home State, as it celebrates its centennial anniversary. Located in Bullitt, Hardin, and Meade Counties, the installation was established by Congress in 1918 and has taken an active role in the defense of our Nation ever since. Today Fort Knox is a source of pride for the community and our Commonwealth, and I would like to take a look back at its century of accomplishment.  Named in honor of the Revolutionary War major general and the first U.S. Secretary of War, Henry Knox, the site began as a field artillery training range for Camp Zachary Taylor in Louisville. Congress purchased 40,000 acres of land in Kentucky to accommodate approximately 60,000 soldiers. Construction began in July 1918 under the supervision of quartermaster W. H. Radcliffe, and Camp Knox served as a facility to support troops returning home at the conclusion of the Great War.  In subsequent years, Camp Knox became a training facility for thousands of troops from the National Guard, Reserve Officers Training Corps, and Citizens Military Training Camps. One of the citizens who trained there was author Robert Penn Warren of Guthrie, KY. Before he gained enduring fame for writing ``All the King's Men,'' Warren's first published poem ``Prophecy'' appeared in the ``Camp Knox Mess Kit'' in 1922.  In 1931, the Army revolutionized our Nation's Armed Forces and formed a mechanized cavalry regiment at the facility. The next year, Congress gave the installation the name we call it today. Fort Knox was at the center of the mechanization of the cavalry, and it can proudly take credit for developing many of the tactics that helped win World War II.  As a vital contributor to our national security, Fort Knox has served wide-ranging roles throughout its 100 years. For instance, in 1937, it became the home of the U.S. bullion depository and the guardian of our Nation's most valuable assets and, at times, some of the world's most precious possessions. During the darkest days of the Second World War, the depository guarded the U.S. Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.  Fort Knox is also the proud home of the General George Patton Museum and Center of Leadership, a tourist destination honoring one of the giants of American military history.  While we celebrate the installation's remarkable history, we also recognize that Fort Knox continues to play a dynamic and integral role in our conventional force structure and our State's economy. In 2009, the Army Human Resources Command relocated to Fort Knox and led to the construction of the Army Human Resources Center, the largest project in the base's history. It's also the home to the Army's Recruiting Command and Cadet Command, which hosts thousands of Army cadets each year for Cadet Summer Training. Most recently, the First Theater Sustainment Command moved to Fort Knox in 2017. These units add an indispensable benefit to our national security, and I am proud to have each one of them in Kentucky. Further, the installation has been recognized on numerous occasions in the Army's Communities of Excellence program and has developed a highly recognized energy savings program. At the same time, the surrounding community has established a number of supportive initiatives to help military families and transitioning Army personnel pursue regional employment opportunities.  From its origin as a camp with 40,000 acres, this multifunctional military installation has grown to cover approximately 109,000 acres and is the sixth largest urban area in Kentucky. The centennial celebration is bigger than the Army, involving a passionate community that supports the installation and the men and women serving there. It is my utmost privilege to join each of them in sending my congratulations to Fort Knox and to all of the Army personnel there for reaching this milestone. During the many events planned to mark the occasion, I wish them all the very best and would like to once again thank them for all they do to keep our nation safe. I urge all of my Senate colleagues to join me.                          ____________________
