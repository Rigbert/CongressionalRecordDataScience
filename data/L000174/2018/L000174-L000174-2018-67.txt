President, on behalf of all Vermonters, I would like to honor Bob Foster of Middlebury, VT, who this month will be inducted into the Vermont Agricultural Hall of Fame in recognition of more than 30 years of outstanding service to Vermont agriculture. For as long as I have served in this body and especially in my work on the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, I have often looked to Bob for input and advice. In addition being a partner in an iconic fifth-generation Vermont dairy, Bob's leadership in Vermont has been extraordinary. During his 37 years of service on the Agri-Mark Dairy Cooperative Board, the co-op has become a critical resource for many Vermont dairy farms and a mainstay of the Vermont economy. Bob is an innovator, taking risks and leading the way in Vermont for bio-digesters and sustainable value-added products and working nationally on renewable energy as an adviser to the 25X25 effort. The extent of his service on local, State, and national leadership teams is exceptional and is further described in his well-deserved nomination to the Vermont Agricultural Hall of Fame, I ask unanimous consent that the nomination be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Vermont Agricultural Hall of Fame Lifetime Achievement: 30+ Years of  Outstanding Service to Vermont Agriculture. Robert Foster, Middlebury       Robert is a partner in Foster Brothers Farm, a fifth-     generation dairy, who served on the Agrimark Board of      Directors for 37 consecutive years, before retiring in 2015.      He also chairs the University of Vermont, College of      Agriculture and Life Sciences' Board of Advisors.      Sustainability has always been one of Robert's passions.      Foster Brothers Farm was the first in the state to install      and operate a methane digester. Robert is also co-owner and      operator of Vermont Natural Ag Products, a sustainable      business which supplies wholesale products, formulated from      cow, horse and poultry compost, to the horticultural,      agricultural, and turf industries. He currently serves on the      Board of Directors for The Soil Health Institute. Within the      Agrimark Co-op, Robert has been a champion for renewable      energy and sustainability, helping to pioneer the Vital      Capital Index, which helps member farms measure and manage      their impact on their community, the environment and their      bottom line. He has been a tireless advocate for Vermont      agriculture, and a mentor and leader to young farmers, over      the course of his prestigious career. Together with his wife,      Nancy, he has three grown daughters; Robin Cole, Jennifer      Foster, and Heather Foster-Provencher, and six grandchildren.                          ____________________
