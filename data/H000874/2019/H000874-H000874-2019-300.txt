 On Tuesday, Madam Speaker, the House will meet at 12 p.m. for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes postponed until 6:30 p.m.  On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate and 12 p.m. for legislative business.  On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.  We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. The complete list of suspension bills will be announced by the close of business tomorrow.  The House will also consider H.R. 986, the Protecting Americans with Preexisting Conditions Act of 2019.  On October 22, 2018, the Trump administration continued the Republican assault on affordable, quality health coverage by issuing new guidance to carry out section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act.  That new guidance, Madam Speaker, undermines patient protections and threatens coverage for Americans with preexisting conditions. H.R. 986 blocks implementation of that guidance so as to preserve preexisting condition protections and ensure that healthcare remains affordable and comprehensive.  In addition, Madam Speaker, the House will consider H.R. 2157, the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2019.  The legislation would provide relief and recovery assistance for Americans affected by recent natural disasters. It includes an additional $3 billion above that which we passed and sent to the Senate some weeks ago to address urgent needs following flooding in the Midwest and tornadoes in the South that have occurred since the House passed its first disaster relief bill in January, which, unfortunately, has languished in the Senate.  Lastly, the bill includes an extension of the National Flood Insurance Program until September 30, 2019.
