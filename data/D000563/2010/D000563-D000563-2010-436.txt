The fact is that this money will generate money to the Federal Treasury so it is not adding to our debt, it is creating jobs, helping businesses, reducing our deficit, and I might add--I am glad you made a reference to TARP. According to the Treasury Department, the 22 largest recipients of TARP dollars, banks, decreased their small business lending by $12.5 billion between April and November of 2009.  Here we are in TARP sending money to bail out the biggest banks and they are reducing their loans to small businesses as a result of it. What the Senator is saying, as I understand it, what this amendment is, is take this money, give it to healthy banks with the understanding it will be loaned to small businesses, they will prosper, create jobs, more taxpayers, fewer people on unemployment, and a net gain to the Treasury?
