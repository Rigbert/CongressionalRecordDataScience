Speaker, today I rise to honor Tim Friedman, a great friend a great public servant. Next month, Tim will officially retire from the House of Representatives following 30 years of outstanding public service.  Tim grew up in Lackawanna, New York, and came to Washington, DC in 1976. That year, he began his distinguished career with the U.S. House of Representatives under the former Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Dan Rostenkowski. Tim served as a Doorkeeper in the Democratic Cloakroom for the Honorable James T. Molloy from 1976 until 1982, when he began working for the Honorable Jack Russ. In 1985, Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill appointed Tim as the Assistant Manager of the House Democratic Cloakroom.  In 2003, Tim married his wife, Colleen Early. Tim and Colleen are dedicated golfers and are building a home in Wallace, North Carolina.  Mr. Speaker, it is a little-known fact outside of Washington that the Democratic and Republican Cloakrooms are vital to Congress' functioning. Dealing with Members of Congress on a daily basis is not an easy task, but Tim has kept our members running on schedule, kept us fed, and kept us smiling for years now, and he will be sorely missed.  I am grateful to Tim for his tremendous service to the House of Representatives, and I wish Tim and Colleen the best of luck in his well-deserved retirement.                          ____________________
