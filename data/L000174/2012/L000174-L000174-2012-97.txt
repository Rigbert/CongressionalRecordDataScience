 As we in New England knew and, of course, as the people of New Hampshire, and we neighbors in Vermont, especially knew--he was a skilled and accomplished legislator. He was a credit to this body. He was a catalyst for reform. He always kept his word. What was most important to me personally is that he was a good and close friend. We traveled together, we worked together, and we never let our different political parties get in the way of doing things that helped our part of the country or our country at large.  I think he was shaped by his experience as well as by his Yankee origins. An Army combat infantry commander, he saw much action during the Korean conflict before coming to the Senate. He had been a widely respected attorney general from New Hampshire.  Senator Rudman embodied the characteristics that many of us call the old school of Senate values. We served together on the Appropriations Committee. We often worked together on national issues, as well as on behalf of our two adjoining States. As I said earlier, I quickly learned that when Warren Rudman gave his word, you could count on it.  He served during a time when Senators would readily put aside party affiliations to work together. When progress required compromise, as it usually does, he was able to help chart the way forward to accommodate different viewpoints and interests. Regrettably, that kind of bipartisanship at this point in the Senate's history is too rare, and I think we have to work to recapture it.  In the can-do Yankee spirit, he took on difficult challenges and stuck with them. From national security and foreign affairs to budget policy, he dug into pressing and often prickly issues, and he made a difference.  Well after his retirement from this body--a voluntary retirement--he continued to serve the country he loved so deeply. Well before the attacks on our Nation of September 11, 2001, he and former Senator Gary Hart headed a national advisory panel investigating the threat of international terrorism. The sobering conclusions they reached about our susceptibility to terrorist attacks were prescient, but largely forgotten, until 9/11.  When I was asked to serve on the advisory board of the Warren B. Rudman Center for Justice, Leadership and Public Policy at the University of New Hampshire, of course I was pleased to accept. His legacy will be reflected well at the Rudman Center, just as his legacy of service and accomplishment will continue to be reflected and appreciated in this body.  Madam President, as I say this, it seems perfectly fitting that the distinguished senior Senator from New Hampshire is presiding: The Senate, and the Nation, are better for Warren Rudman's service.                          ____________________
