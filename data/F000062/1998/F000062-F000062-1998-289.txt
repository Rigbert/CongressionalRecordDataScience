 President, I rise today to express my deep sympathy to the families of those killed in Italy by a low flying plane. Like all Americans, I was shocked, saddened, and angered that an American plane caused this tragedy.  We do not have all the details at this time and are having to rely on media reports, but I want to be very clear. This tragedy never should have happened. This was a disgraceful act, military training should not be done in civilian areas.  I wish that I could say that this was an isolated incident. Unfortunately, I cannot. Accidents during training missions occur with disturbing frequency.  Last September, the Secretary of Defense was forced to suspend all training flights after a rash of six crashes within one week.  Also in September, a F-117 crashed in Maryland, injuring 4 civilians and burning a portion of a home.  In 1996, a U-2 spy plane crashed in the parking lot of the Mercury-Register newspaper, killing one and injury two others.  In October, a military jet crashed in Pennsylvania. The pilot managed to eject safely, but the plane exploded near a busy interstate highway.  It may be impossible to make training missions 100% safe for the pilots, but we have an obligation to make sure they are safe for civilians.  In the tragedy in Aviano, Italy, the pilot was flying an approved flight path though not at an approved altitude. This flight path led the plane, at a very low altitude, directly over a functioning ski lift. While I have trouble believing news reports that pilots entertain themselves by flying under the ski lift cables, that plane never should have been in the proximity of the ski lift. The potential for tragedy was simply too great. Unfortunately, it took the deaths of 20 people to prove it.  Clearly, responsibility for this tragedy lies not only with the pilot, but also with the commanders who authorized these dangerous flights. There is a certain degree of risk involved in all training missions. That risk should not fall upon innocent civilians. How many more incidents such as the one in Aviano have to occur before it becomes clear that the potential for tragedy in these missions is too great?  I would like to see the following actions taken:  1. A change in the guidelines over where planes can fly training missions.  2. An immediate report to the American people of the facts of the accident at Aviano. It has been almost a week and we still have no information from the military.  3. If the investigation shows that the pilot was at fault, the pilot should be subject to Italian law.                          ____________________
