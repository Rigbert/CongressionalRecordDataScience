Miguel Estrada's nomination to the Court of the Appeals for D.C. Circuit. On March 6, 2003, I placed in the Congressional Record excerpts of the editorials and op-eds that had been published by that date, because Republicans had been asserting that there were only a handful of editorials or op-eds in support of our concerns. Here are some excerpts from 24 additional editorials and op-eds expressing concerns about Mr. Estrada's nomination, bringing the total to at least 77. This controversial nomination continues to divide, rather than to unite, the American people.  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record excerpts of 24 recent editorials or op-eds, in addition to those printed last month.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Mar. 13, 2003]                          Hold Firm on Estrada       [Supporters] argued that handing over Mr. Estrada's      memorandums would be a violation of privacy, although other      nominees, including Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Judge      Robert Bork, did so in their own confirmation hearings.      Supporters have also contended, shamefully, that opposition      to Mr. Estrada is anti-Latino, even though his nomination is      opposed by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, the Mexican      American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and other leading      Latino groups. Now Republicans are attacking Democratic      senators for using a filibuster. The criticism rings hollow,      given that some Republicans making it, including the majority      leader, Bill Frist, voted to filibuster when President      Clinton nominated Richard Paez, a Mexican-American, to an      appeals court. Rather than demonizing Democratic senators,      the White House should look for common ground. In the case of      Mr. Estrada, it should respect the Senate's role in the      process by making his full record available. And going      forward, it should choose judicial nominees from the      ideological mainstream, who do not prompt the sort of bitter      partisan divisions that Mr. Estrada has.                                  ____           [From the Connecticut Law Tribune, Mar. 24, 2003]                           Nomination Battles       Because federal judgeships are for life, what is at stake      is what the law of the land will be for the next two or three      decades. That's why the continuing Senate filibuster      transcends Estrada. Its aim is to use what little Democratic      power is left to force the White House and Senate Republicans      to the table to hammer out a more bipartisan, more balanced      approach to judge-picking.                                  ____                  [From the Daily News, Mar. 31, 2003]                          The Quotable Lincoln       By President Lincoln's reasoning, Mr. Estrada is not      qualified for the court appointment if his opinions are      unknown publicly. The full quotation comes to light as the      Senate Republicans vow to keep bringing up the Estrada      nomination against the opposition of all but a handful of the      Democrats. The Republicans, including both Maine senators,      have been unable to muster more than 55 of the necessary 60      votes to break the filibuster.                                  ____                 [From the Times Union, Mar. 20, 2003]               Estrada Should Answer Questions in Public       Since Mr. Estrada doesn't have experience to bolster his      candidacy, he must provide convincing evidence of his ability      to perform. If he is qualified to serve, he should step up to      the plate and tell us, in a public hearing. If not, he should      step aside and let the Senate get on with its business.                                  ____           [From the Orlando Sentinel Tribune, Mar. 23, 2003]              Will Estrada Protect the Rights of Latinos?       At his hearing before the Senate, Estrada failed to answer      senator's questions, and he hid his views from the Senate and      the public. Because of his limited record, it was important      for Estrada to be forthcoming and give senators the      opportunity to find out more about the kind of judge he would      be; yet he chose to remain silent. . . . The little we do      know about his record is very troubling. . . . Defeating his      nomination would not send the message to Latinos that ``only      a certain kind of Latino need apply.'' On the contrary, it      would send the message that everyone in America is judged by      the same standard. If you cannot be fair and protect the      basic constitutional rights of the common person, you do not      deserve to serve in a judicial appointment, no matter what      your race or ethnicity is.                                  ____           [From the Connecticut Law Tribune, Mar. 24, 2003]                          Nominations Battles       Miguel Estrada is being treated the same way Republicans      treated Democratic nominees for years, Hispanic or otherwise.      The battle is intense because the stakes are high. At issue      is the American principle of checks and balances, and more.      Republicans already control the White House and Congress and      are now aiming for the third branch of government. Not only      will Bush likely get the chance to push the divided Supreme      Court rightward with an appointment or two. He already is      reshaping the appeals courts one level below the Supreme      Court. Because federal judgeships are for life, what is at      stake is what the law of the land will be for the next two or      three decades. That's why the continuing Senate filibuster      transcends Estrada. Its aim is to use what little Democratic      power is left to force the White House and Senate Republicans      to the table to hammer out a more bipartisan, more balanced      approach to judge-picking.                                  ____            [From the Troy Record Editorial, Mar. 10, 2003]               Senate Judgment Wise in Estrada Nomination       In reality, a Court of Appeals judgeship is a lifetime      appointment. This means that the 39-year-old Estrada could be      making decisions from the bench for 30 or 40 years. . . .      Democrats on the Committee want to get a feel for how Estrada      will rule when the rubber meets the road, and that is      certainly fair. Is it out of the question for Estrada to let      the committee know the name of a judge he admires? Why      wouldn't he name a Supreme Court decision he disagrees with,      or approves of? These are not unreasonable questions. . . .      The Senate is right not to simply rubber stamp his      nomination.                                  ____              [From the American Prospect, Mar. 17, 2003]Rule Breaker: When It Comes to Helen Thomas, Miguel Estrada and Acts of               War, George W. Bush Isn't big on Convention       Then there's the tussle over judicial nominee Miguel      Estrada. Bush doesn't like the fact that Democratic senators      are filibustering Estrada's nomination. So he suggested      changing the rules to ``ensure timely up-or-down votes on      judicial nominations both now and in the future, no matter      who is the president or what party controls the Senate.''      According to the Senate's Web site, filibusters have been      around since the early days of Congress and have been popular      since the 1850s. It's hard to remember the last time a      president suggested that the Senate change one of its oldest      traditions. There have been plenty of presidents who haven't      liked congressional rules, but that doesn't mean they've      suggested changing them just to accomplish one goal.                                  ____              [From the Times Herald-Record, Mar. 9, 2003]                       How To End the Filibuster       That's not nearly as bad as the charge by some Republicans      that Democrats are opposing Estrada because he's Hispanic      and, as a result, Democrats are preventing a group of people      from achieving a milestone. Do these people ever listen to      themselves? For a host of reasons, including support of      immigration and education reform, pro-union and pro-labor      policies and a philosphy that embraces affirmative action,      the Democratic Party has enjoyed the support of a majority of      the nation's growing Hispanic community for some time. In      fact, many Hispanic groups oppose Estrada's nomination      because they do not think he understands or is sensitive to      issues and aspirations that are important to Hispanics in      America. . . . It would have been nice, then, had Clinton      been able to secure a floor vote for other highly qualified      Harvard Law School graduates whose nominations languished and      eventually died in the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was      controlled by Republicans. . . .

A      president genuinely interested in a judiciary that works      won't map a strategy that allows presidents to push through      any nominee at will. Doing so allows for, even invites, an      ideological judiciary prone to extremes.

Senators who try to      keep that from happening deserve the thanks of the American      people, not the calumny heaped on them by a president who      last week showed his lack of understanding of the roles of      the separate branches of government by pressuring the Senate      to change its rules for debate and allow a one-vote      majority to ramrod presidential appointments through the      Senate.'')                                  ____             [From the Copley News Service, Mar. 20, 2003]                       Wise Words for the Senate       Republicans like to blame Democratic stalling for judicial      vacancies.

There is a very      serious issue at the core of this dispute--nothing less than      the fundamental nature of the federal judiciary--and the      attempt to defame opposition to Estrada as anti-Hispanic      prejudice is absurd on its face.                                  ____           [From the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, Mar. 16, 2003]                     Power, Not Ethnicity, at Issue       The Republican strategy is to win his approval by charging      that opponents are motivated by prejudice.

Estrada would be such a      judge. At least that is a fair assumption based on the record      of the Senate committee hearing on his confirmation. He      wasn't willing to offer his views on many of the most      pertinent and controversial constitutional questions of      concern to courts, Congress and the public. He declined to      make available memoranda he wrote for the office of solicitor      general when he worked there.

Their favorite      example is the Justice Department's release of memos during      Robert Bork's 1987 confirmation battle, written by a lawyer      in the solicitor general's office who held precisely the same      job as Estrada.                                  ____              [From the Chicago Sun Times, Mar. 14, 2003]  If Estrada Thinks That Being Latino is Enough To Get Him Confirmed,                       He's in for a Rude Awakening       Bush obviously wants to score political points with Latino      voters . . .

Bush's political stock      is sinking, and Latino political stock is rising. The way I      see it, Bush needs us more than we need him.

Judging by Estrada's lock-jawed      performance last September, it would be a gigantic waste of      time (which, of course, the White House knows). There is a      common theme in Estrada's and Owen's attempts to get on the      circuit court bench.

Judges are supposed to be able to look at attorney's      arguments with impartiality and determine which side has a      stronger case within the letter and spirit of the law. To be      effective and just, the judiciary must be neither liberal nor      conservative. The judiciary must be independent, concerned      only with the integrity of law. That's a high ideal and, of      course, nearly impossible to reach, but it's what we should      be reaching for. The fact is we have no idea if Mr. Estrada      is capable of impartiality, and he's not willing to discuss      it.                                  ____               [From the Houston Chronicle, Mar. 7, 2003]                   Yakety, Yak--Keep Talking Senators       So undemocratic, wail the Republicans desperate to get on      with a vote on the nomination of Miguel Estrada to the U.S.      Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia before      anyone can find out how right-wing the former Justice      Department official     might actually be. Some of these Republicans are the same      people--and are certainly of the same party--who over the      years have attempted to talk to death many bills and      nominations.  Additionally, here is an excerpt of an additional news article that is noteworthy for its assessment of the refusal of the White House to release the documents requested, despite the precedent and despite the interest of some Republican Senators in doing so:               [From the Weekly Standard, Mar. 17, 2003]                       Filibuster Si, Estrada No!       The White House refused . . . access to Estrada's working      papers. Period. This adamantine posture, in the eyes of some      in Senate GOP leadership circles, handcuffed Frist. ``There's      some frustration,'' said a top GOP leadership aide. ``From      the very beginning we told them that was the only way out and      a face-saver for everyone. But it came down to the fact      that no one on the White House or Justice team wanted to      walk into the Oval Office and say to the president, ``You      might have to give up these memos.'' The administration's      position on the memos reflects its deeply held ethic of      aggressively defending executive branch prerogatives.      Though the White House has never characterized the Estrada      matter as one of executive privilege ... it falls into the      broad category of executive branch muscularity. And while      most Republicans generally support this posture, some Bush      allies on and off Capitol Hill have come to question the      administration's fastidiousness in the Estrada fight.  In addition, there have been dozens and dozens and dozens of letters to the editor published in opposition to editorials supporting the Republican position on this nomination. Here is just one sample of those many letters from citizens across the country:               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 20, 2003]                     Behind the Estrada Filibuster       The depth of Mr. Estrada's sentiments on issues facing the      federal courts seems to be known only to the far-right      members of the legal community who support him and to the      Bush administration. The question is whether the Senate,      which has an equal say in whether Mr. Estrada will sit on the      U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, has an equal      right to the information, including Justice Department      memorandums, that is available to the administration. It is      far from extortionate that senators not be forced to vote      without the information the administration holds.
