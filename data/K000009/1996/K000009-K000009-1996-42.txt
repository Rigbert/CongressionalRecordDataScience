Will prices go down in our stores? No. We will all wait for that day. But will leading importers from China make billions off trading our jobs for outsourced production to China? Absolutely.  People like David Glass will benefit. Who is he? He is the chief executive officer of Wal-Mart, the leading United States importer from China. Last year he earned over $1 million trading off the handiwork of Chinese women who earn 10 cents an hour working 14-hour days. So did his top five executives, who hauled off over $3 million just last year.  Evidently Wal-Mart believes China's repressive regime is somebody they want to do business with. Last year, Wal-Mart imported 1,000 shipments from China by relying on 700 Chinese contract sweatshops. Can Members imagine how many jobs that would create in our country, including in those communities in which Wal-Mart does business here? I say it is time to revoke China's privileged trade status until we get a fair shake for American and Chinese workers and consumers.                          ____________________
