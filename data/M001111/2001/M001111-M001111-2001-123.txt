 Senator Shelby and I have been here. In fact, I got up at 4 o'clock Monday morning to come back from my home State of Washington to be on the floor Monday afternoon and ask Senators to bring their amendments forward. We waited. We have had a few amendments. I believe we have had four or five with which Members came to the floor and finally offered. We were here Monday evening:  I came back on Tuesday morning, ready and begging and telling Senators: We are ready to move this bill along. Offer your amendments. We will vote them up or down. In a week, we have only passed a handful of amendments that Senators have brought to the floor. I would have been happy if there were 20 amendments. Send them forward. We will vote them up or down.
