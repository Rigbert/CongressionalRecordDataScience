Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Let me begin by thanking my good friend and colleague, Mr. Wynn, for authoring this very important resolution. I rise today in strong support of it, recognizing May as the Bebe Moore Campbell National Minority Health Awareness Month. Bebe Moore Campbell will be remembered as a celebrated writer and journalist whose New York Times best selling novel, ``72 Hour Hold,'' challenged minority communities to be open with their mental health and lower the stigma associated with receiving therapy. Her ability to assessthe mental health delivery system from a minority vantage point has helped raise awareness and remove barriers.  Mental illness, Mr. Speaker, can be crippling, not only to the individuals suffering from this disease, but obviously also the family and friends of that person. In some cases, therapy is declined or refused because mental health care is seen as the treatment of last resort. But we must improve public awareness and erase the stigma that is so often associated with mental illness.  Again, I would like to thank my friend and colleague, the author of the resolution, Mr. Wynn of Maryland, for raising public awareness of mental illness in minority communities and the importance of getting proper mental health treatment to those and for those who have been diagnosed. I encourage all of my colleagues to vote in favor of the resolution.  I reserve the balance of my time.
