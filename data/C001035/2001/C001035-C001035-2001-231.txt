President, I rise today to introduce the Loring Pipeline Reunification Act, a bill to authorize the conveyance of a segment of the Loring Petroleum Pipeline from the U.S. Air Force to the Loring Development Authority, LDA, in Limestone, ME. The LDA will soon control more than two-thirds of this pipeline as the result of a process that was initiated nearly 3 years ago. By conveying the remaining segment to the LDA with this bill and placing the pipeline under the control of one entity, its value willbe maximized as will its ability to foster the economic development of northern Maine.  The pipeline at issue originally was built to supply the Loring Air Base with fuel products critical to its mission. Prior to the base's closure in 1994, Defense Fuels, now known as the Defense Energy Support Center, DESC, would deliver fuel products by tanker to Searsport, where the line originates, and then pump them through the line to the base. For a period following the base closure, the Maine Air National Guard continued to use the Searsport to Bangor segment to supply their activities in Bangor. After a study by Defense Fuels, however, the Air National Guard changed their means of transporting fuel from pipeline to truck. Consequently, in 1999, the U.S. Air Force made the largest segment of the pipeline, which runs from Bangor to Limestone, available to LDA for reuse. The Air National Guard supports the reunification of this pipeline under LDA's control as does the Maine State Department of Transportation.  In consideration of the large geographical expanse of my State, the often treacherous winter driving conditions, and the fuel shortages that have vexed the Northeast over the past two winters, I believe that the reunification and return to use of this pipeline would serve the public good in northern Maine. It would provide a safer and more efficient means of transporting fuel and, thereby improve the climate for manufacturing and processing plants currently considering new operations in the economically challenged area surrounding Limestone.  It is also worth noting, that from a cost-avoidance perspective, my bill will save the U.S. taxpayer more than $100,000 which would otherwise be required to support the administrative disposal of this currently unused pipeline. By passing this bill, the Senate and, ultimately, the Congress can help expand the options and opportunities for Aroostook County.                                 ______                                       By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Dodd):  S. 298. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow non-itemizers a deduction for a portion of their charitable contributions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.
