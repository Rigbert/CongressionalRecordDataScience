. Courts demonstrates the extent of these delays in Federal court. Across the country, there are over 15,000 civil cases that have been pending for more than three years without resolution. The Administrative Office's data show that many of the circuits with the highest number of vacant district judgeships also have the highest backlog of pending cases. The Ninth Circuit has over 1,700 civil cases that have been pending for more than three years. There are currently 14 district judgeships vacant in that circuit, including five vacancies that the Administrative Office has classified as judicial emergency vacancies. The Fifth Circuit has over 1,300 civil cases that have been pending for more than three years. There are eight district judgeships vacant in that circuit, six of which are emergency vacancies.  Our courts need qualified Federal judges, not vacancies, if they are to reduce the excessive wait times that burden litigants seeking their day in court. While 3 years may be necessary for some of the most complex business disputes, it is unacceptable for hardworking Americans who are seeking their day in court. When an injured plaintiff sues to help cover the cost of his or her medical expenses, that plaintiff should not have to wait for 3 years before a judge rules on his or her case. When two small business owners disagree over a contract, they should not have to wait years for a court to resolve their dispute.  With almost one in 10 Federal judgeships currently vacant, the Senate must come together to address the serious judicial vacancies crisis on Federal courts around the country. Bill Robinson, the president of the American Bar Association, warned recently in a letter to Senate leaders that excessive vacancies and high caseloads, ``deprive . . . our federal courts of the capacity to deliver timely justice in civil matters and has real consequences for the financial well-being of businesses and for individual litigants whose lives are put on hold pending resolution of their disputes.'' Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy and Chief Justice Roberts have also warned of the serious problems created by persistent judicial vacancies. This is not a partisan issue, but an issue affecting hardworking Americans who are denied justice when their cases are delayed by overburdened courts.  During President Bush's first 4 years, the Senate confirmed a total of 205 Federal circuit and district court judges. As of today, we would need another 89 confirmations over the next 12 months to match that total. That means a faster confirmation rate for the next 12 months than in any 12 months of the Obama administration to date. That would require Senate Republicans to abandon their delaying tactics. I hope they will. This is an area where the Senate must come together to address the serious judicial vacancies crisis on Federal courts around the country that has persisted for well over 2 years. We can and must do better for the millions of Americans being made to suffer by these unnecessary Senate delays.  More than half of all Americans--almost 164 million--live in districts or circuits that have a judicial vacancy that could be filled today if Senate Republicans just agreed to vote on the nominations now pending on the Senate calendar. As many as 25 states are served by Federal courts with vacancies that would be filled by these nominations. Millions of Americans across the country are harmed by delays in overburdened courts. The Republican leadership should explain why they will not consent to vote on the qualified, consensus candidates nominated to fill these extended judicial vacancies.  I have heard some Senators excuse the delays and the extraordinary numbers of nominations left pending on the Senate calendar by claiming that our progress on nominations this year has been among the best in history. This is not true on its face, and ignores the Senate's failure to confirm judges in the first 2 years of the Obama administration, a practice which has led to historically high vacancies. The 56 circuit and district court nominations we have confirmed thus far this year is well behind the 68 we confirmed in the third year of President George W. Bush's first term. What makes the claim of progress even more misleading is that of the 56 nominations we confirmed this year, 17 could have and should have been confirmed when they were reported by the Judiciary Committee last year and instead took us until June of this year to consider. Even including these nominees on this year's total, the Senate's progress this year barely cracks the top 10 years for confirmed nominees in the last 35 years.  The truth is that the actions of the Senate Republican leadership in stalling judicial nominations during President Obama's first 2 years led to confirmation of few judges, leading to high vacancies. Republican leadership allowed the Senate to confirm only 47 circuit and district court nominations last year and set the modern record for fewest nominations confirmed with only 13 the year before--a total of 60 nominees confirmed in President Obama's first 2 years in office--leading to judicial vacancies that stood at 97 at the start of this year. In stark contrast, at the start of President Bush's third year, 2003, judicial vacancies stood at only 60 because the Senate had confirmed 72 of his circuit and district court nominations the year before and 28 in his first year in office, a total of 100 in the 17 months prior to 2003 with a Democratic majority.  The 100 circuit and district court nominations we confirmed in President Bush's first 2 years leading to a vacancy total of 60 at the beginning of his third year is almost a complete reverse of the 60 we confirmed in President Obama's first 2 years, leading to nearly 100 vacancies at the start of 2011. Yet, even following those years of realprogress, in 2003 we proceeded to confirm more judicial nominations--68--than there were vacancies at the start of that year and reduced vacancies even further. We worked to reduce vacancies on the circuit courts to single digits and throughout the Federal judiciary to fewer than 30.  The two nominees we consider today should have been confirmed 2 months ago. Sharon Gleason is nominated to fill a vacancy in the District Court for the District of Alaska. She is currently the Presiding Judge on the Superior Court for Alaska's Third Judicial District, where she has served for nearly a decade. Judge Gleason spent 17 years in private practice and clerked for Chief Justice Edmond Burke of the Alaska Supreme Court. The ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated her ``well qualified'' to serve, its highest rating. Her home State Senators, Senator Murkowski, a Republican, and Senator Begich, a Democrat, gave Judge Gleason their strong support when they introduced her to the Committee at a hearing in July. If confirmed, Judge Gleason will be the first woman to serve as a Federal district court judge in Alaska.  Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers is nominated to serve as a United States District Judge for the Northern District of California. Since 2008, she has served as a judge for the Superior Court of California in Alameda County. Judge Gonzalez Rogers previously worked for 12 years as a litigator in private practice in the San Francisco office of Cooley LLP, and served for 2 years as a civil grand juror for Alameda County. Originally appointed to the Superior Court by Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in October 2008, Judge Gonzalez Rogers has the strong support of both of her home State Democratic Senators, Senators Feinstein and Boxer.  I hope that the Senate can build on our progress today by considering the other 23 judicial nominations pending on the Senate calendar. With less than 5 weeks left before Senate adjournment for the year, the Senate needs to consider at least 5 judges every week in order to begin to catch up and erase the backlog that has developed from the delays in the consideration of consensus nominees caused by the Senate Republican leadership. We should not end another year with the Senate Republican leadership refusing to give final consideration to qualified judicial nominees and insisting on their nominations being returned to the President to begin the process all over again. Such delaying tactics are a disservice to the American people. The Senate should fulfill its constitutional duty and ensure the ability of our Federal courts to provide justice to Americans around the country.                               Exhibit 1             [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 10, 2011]                 Criminal Case Glut Impedes Civil Suits                (By Gary Fields and John R. Emshwiller)       An explosion of criminal prosecutions in the nation's      overextended federal courts has left civil litigants from      bereaved spouses to corporate giants waiting years for their      day in court.       The logjam, prompted particularly by criminal cases related      to drugs and immigration, as well as by the proliferation of      more-obscure federal criminal laws, threatens the functioning      of the nation's judicial system, say some judges and      attorneys.       ``We need the resources to do both'' civil and criminal      law, says W. Royal Furgeson, a senior federal judge in      Dallas. If decisions on contracts, mergers and intellectual-     property rights ``can't be reached through quick and prompt      justice, things unravel for business.''       In the Northern District of California, a widely watched      intellectual-property fight between Google Inc. and Oracle      Corp. has stalled to an indefinite halt. The two-year-old      case, in which Oracle alleges that Google's Android      smartphone software infringes its copyrights and patents, was      scheduled to go to trial last month. Judge William Alsup      postponed it ``due to a lengthy criminal trial.'' In a      written order, he said the trial would occur ``in due      course.''       Oracle and Google declined to comment. Judge Alsup's clerk      said he was too busy to comment.       Over the past three decades, the U.S. has steadily added to      the federal rule book through new criminal statutes and      regulations that carry criminal penalties. Combined with      beefed-up enforcement, that has led to a 70% jump in the      number of pending federal criminal cases in the past decade--     to over 76,000, according to the Administrative Office of      U.S. Courts.       Civil litigation, which accounts for over three quarters of      federal court cases, is getting squeezed the most. In 2007,      fewer than 7% of civil cases were more than three years old.      By last year, that percentage more than doubled, with nearly      45,000 cases in a holding pattern.       While some of the case overload stems from mass litigation,      such as damage claims from Hurricane Katrina in 2005, much of      it traces back to the crowded criminal docket, say judges and      other legal experts. The Constitution and the Speedy Trial      Act of 1974 mandate criminal cases take precedence over civil      cases.       Exacerbating the problem are vacancies on the federal      bench. Despite the surge in case loads, the number of      authorized federal judgeships has risen just 4% since 1990.      Of the 677 district court judgeships currently authorized,      about 9.5% are vacant.       Instead of waiting, many civil litigants are settling their      disputes. That can be appropriate in many cases, but there is      ``no shortage of plaintiffs who wind up taking inadequate      settlements'' or businesses that make unnecessary payments to      end the expense and uncertainty of litigation, says Ian      Millhiser, a policy analyst at the Center for American      Progress, a liberal think tank.       Elizabeth and Nicholas Powers were awaiting jury selection      in their employment-discrimination suit against the      University of Illinois when the federal judge assigned to the      case earlier this year called a sudden halt to instead tackle      a mounting series of criminal cases.       Their 2008 lawsuit, which named the Board of Trustees of      the University of Illinois as defendant, alleged Ms. Powers      received lower pay for her work than male employees. It also      alleged Mr. Powers, who also worked for the university, was      treated differently than the wives of male professors who      worked at the school.       After the delay, the couple decided to settle for $85,000      rather than wait for a new trial. An attorney for the      University of Illinois declined comment on the settlement.       The judge in the case, Mike McCuskey, who is also the chief      federal jurist for the central district of Illinois, said in      an interview he has no choice but to push back civil cases      because of his criminal caseload. In 1997, federal court      statistics show, Judge McCuskey's district had 55 civil cases      that were pending more than three years. Last year, it had      1,200.       ``Civil litigation has ground to a halt,'' Judge McCuskey      said, adding that ``you've got a right to sue but you do not      get a right to a speedy jury trial.''       The Illinois jurist blames the glut of criminal cases on a      shift in jurisdiction. Many cases that once would have been      handled by state courts, including those dealing with drugs,      weapons and child pornography, are now being filed federally.      Congress has passed statutes that duplicate existing state      laws but often carry heavier sentences, an added attraction      to law-enforcement officials.       One of the nation's heaviest loads can be found in the      federal courts of the eastern district of California, which      covers an inland swath from north of Los Angeles to the      Oregon border. Its per-judge caseload is 1,129 and getting      worse with the September retirement of Judge Oliver Wanger.      Because he won't be replaced, his cases will be divided among      those who remain.       One of Judge Wanger's cases was a lawsuit involving      hundreds of people from a neighborhood in Merced, Calif.,      stemming from a 2006 flood and subsequent concern about toxic      chemical contamination from a nearby industrial site.       In 2007, current and former residents filed suit in federal      court against municipal entities and the former owners of the      industrial site seeking damages.       Judge Wanger divided the case into smaller trials, which      would allow him to intersperse those hearings with other      ongoing cases. But only one of those civil trials has been      held so far.       Mick Marderosian, the plaintiffs' attorney, said many of      his 2,000 clients are waiting for a resolution of the case,      now heading towards its fifth year. ``We get calls every day      from clients asking what is happening, what is causing the      delay,'' he said.       Kathy Ramos said she and her husband, a truck driver, spent      $35,000 repairing their home after the flood. Her husband      dropped plans to buy his own rig and the couple is still      paying credit-card debts from the home-repair work. As for      the lawsuit, ``we would just like to have it over with,'' she      said.       To get around the eastern district's problems, the suit has      been transferred to a federal judge in Santa Ana, Calif.       For two and a half years, Amy Bullock has been waiting for      her day in court seeking damages for the death of her husband      in a 2006 truck accident. Her suit was filed in Denver      federal court two years later against Daimler Trucks North      America LLC, formerly Freightliner LLC.       It has been postponed twice, once in November 2010, about      two weeks before the trial was supposed to start, and again      this October to make way for a firearms case.       ``It was devastating to hear it was postponed,'' says Ms.      Bullock.       Daimler disputes the merits of Ms. Bullock's claim, which      revolves around the truck's safety design and whether it had      adequate safety restraints in its sleeper compartment. Its      attorney, Peter Jones, a Denver lawyer, nonetheless agrees      that the delays represent ``a huge inconvenience to the      clients and the witnesses who are involved on both sides.''       The trial is now scheduled for March 2012. Said the 41-     year-old Ms. Bullock: ``I'm looking forward to having my day      in court but, honestly, I feel like it may never happen.''                          Vermont's Rebuilding
