Madam Speaker, I rise to congratulate a fine Alaskan soldier--SSgt. Shawn Michael Roberts. SSgt. Roberts has recently been inducted into the Sgt. Audie Murphy Award program in the Army. Sgt. Audie Murphy, for whom this award was named, was a famous Hollywood actor, as well as the most decorated American combat soldier of World War II. Sgt. Murphy was a courageous warrior and received every decoration of valor our country has to offer, including two Silver Stars, three Purple Hearts, the Distinguished Service Cross and the Medal of Honor. In short, this induction is one of the highest honors in the Army and reflects the comparable level of commitment and dedication that has been exemplified in SSgt. Roberts' performance.  It is little wonder, in light of his many accomplishments, that Shawn has received this award. Since entering active duty in December 2001 SSgt. Roberts has served two tours in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, as well as one tour in Bosnia. During his tenure with the U.S. Army, Roberts has received numerous medals of commendation, including the Iraq Campaign Medal with three campaign stars.  Alaskans are proud of our military heritage and I am proud that our country has such noble defenders. I thank SSgt. Roberts for his service to our country and I congratulate him on his induction into this award program.                          ____________________
