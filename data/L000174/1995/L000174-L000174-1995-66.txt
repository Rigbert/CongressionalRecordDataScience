President, the action of the House Members on the telecommunications bill conference this morning should send tremors through the Internet community and defenders of the first amendment. They agreed to a provision that would effectively ban constitutionally protected speech on the Internet.  If this amendment becomes law, no longer will Internet users be able to engage in freewheeling discussions in news groups and other areas on the Internet accessible to minors. They will have to limit all language used and topics discussed to that appropriate for kindergarteners, just in case a minor clicks onto the discussion. No literary quotes from racy parts of ``Catcher in the Rye'' or ``Ulysses'' will be allowed. Certainly, online discussions of safe sex practices, of birth control methods, and of AIDS prevention methods will be suspect. Any user who crosses the vague and undefined line of ``indecency'' will be subject to 2 years in jail and fines.  We have already seen the chilling effect that even the prospect of this legislation has had on online service providers. Last week, American On Line deleted the profile of a Vermonter who communicated with fellow breast cancer survivors online. Why? Because, according to AOL, she used the vulgar word ``breast''. AOL later apologized and indicated it would permit the use of that word where appropriate.  This is a serious misstep by the House Members of the telecommunications bill conference. I urge the full conference to consider the threat this amendment poses to the future growth of the Internet, and reject it.                          ____________________
