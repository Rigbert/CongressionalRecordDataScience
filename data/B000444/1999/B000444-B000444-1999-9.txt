 President, I rise to congratulate my colleagues for having supported S. Con. Res. 68, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, which I cosponsored with Senator Helms, commemorating the tenth anniversary of the so-called Velvet Revolution, whereby the people of Czechoslovakia overthrew the communist dictatorship that had oppressed them for four decades.  Since then, Czechoslovakia decided to effect a ``Velvet Divorce.'' Today both successor states, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, are in the process of integrating into the West. The Czech Republic is already a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and Slovakia is emerging as a strong candidate for the next round of enlargement. Both countries are busily preparing to qualify for membership in the European Union.  Both countries have growing pains associated with the difficult transitions from dictatorship to democracy, and from a command economy to the free market. Both have ongoing challenges to guarantee equal rights for minorities. But the overall picture for the Czech Republic and for the Slovak Republic is bright.  I am delighted that the Senate has recognized the accomplishments of the Czechs and the Slovaks and has wished them continued success in the future as partners of the United States.  I thank the Chair.
