 President, before we vote, I wish to take this opportunity to thank Senator McCain for his intervention and making sure that we had serious negotiations.  I thank the staff of the Veterans' Affairs Committee: Steve Robertson, Dahlia Melendrez, Travis Murphy, Jason Dean, Carlos Fuentes, Becky Thowman, Ann Vallandingham, Janet Gehring, Elizabeth Austin-Mackenzie, Kathryn Monet, Katie Van Haste, Shanna Lawrie, Raphael Anderson, and Shannon Jackson. These guys worked really hard for months, and I very much appreciate what they did.
