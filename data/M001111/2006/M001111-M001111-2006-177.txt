 President, today I wish to honor Lyn McClelland, a highly respected leader in the maritime community, who is retiring this month after 21 years of service as the Maritime Administration's Seattle representative. Lyn has helped support the success, safety, and security of the U.S. maritime community in the Pacific Northwest.  Over the years, we have turned to Lyn time and again for her expertise, her judgment, and her ability to comeup with practical solutions. If there is a challenge in the maritime community, you can bet that Lyn's worked to solve it.  I am especially proud of Lyn's work on critical security programs, which as my colleagues know is an area of special interest for me. I was so pleased that Lyn worked on Operation Safe Commerce, which I helped create here in the Senate. She has worked on the STEP program Seattle/Tacoma/Everett Port Security Program, and the Washington State Transportation Research Center electronic seal test. She's been a key player on three Area Maritime Security Committees Alaska, Washington, and Oregon, and Lyn partnered with the Coast Guard on a number of maritime security programs including reviewing applications for port security grants. Lyn's work also helped ensure the development, availability and security of military out-load ports in support of our men and women engaged in hostilities overseas.  Lyn's contributions were not limited to port security. She has also been a major supporter of the development of the Marine Transportation System, the U.S. Merchant Marine, and she has always been involved in encouraging young people to pursue careers in the maritime industry. Her support of the Puget Sound Harbor Safety Committee spurred the adoption of new safety measures for vessel and waterfront facility operation. Lyn's eager participation in a wide array of maritime events and celebrations helped make them successful.  Lyn has been a stalwart leader and mainstay of the Pacific Northwest maritime industry, and she has strengthened the relationship between industry and government. As other leaders came and went, we could always rely on the energy, knowledge, dedication, and professionalism of Lyn McClelland for any challenge. I want to wish her ``fair winds and following seas'' in her well-deserved retirement. She will be greatly missed. Lyn may be leaving her job, but she is leaving all of us with a tremendous legacy of service and success. Congratulations, Lyn.                          ____________________
