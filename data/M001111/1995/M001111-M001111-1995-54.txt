 President, I would like to clarify a single sentence in the conference report accompanying H.R. 1905 relating to economic development activities. Within the Department of Energy environmental management account, in the nuclear material and facilities stabilization section, there is a sentence that provides: ``Additionally, none of these funds should be used for economic development activities.''  It is my understanding that this language was included because there was concern by some members of Congress that money was being diverted from cleanup and restoration efforts and used for economic development. It is clear from this language that money should not be used for economic development activities when those activities are unrelated to the project for which the money was appropriated. However, where this money can be used both to achieve its intended purposes and assist in community transition and diversification, it should be so used.  The Department of Energy should allow the use of these funds to achieve as many positive results as possible and leverage this money to assist the communities they serve in achieving economic diversification.
