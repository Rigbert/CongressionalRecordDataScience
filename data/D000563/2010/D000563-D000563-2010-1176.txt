President, I wish to make a unanimous consent request: that on the Democratic side, the sequence be Senator Kaufman of Delaware, Senator Harkin from Iowa, and then that I be third in line; and then if there are any Republicans who come to the floor seeking recognition, that they be taken in sequence so that there will be a Democrat speaker followed by a Republican speaker.
