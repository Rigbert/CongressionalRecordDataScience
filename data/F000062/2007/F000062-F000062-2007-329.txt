 President, I rise to speak in support of an amendment to the budget resolution that Senator Chambliss and I have offered to increase FY2008 funding for the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program to $900 million.  The need for this amendment is clear. This country is currently experiencing a violent crime surge unlike anything we have seen in more than a decade. Just a few weeks ago, the Police Executive Research Forum reported that their survey of 56 cities and sheriffs' departments showed that, from 2004 to 2006, homicides increased overall by 10 percent, aggravated assaults with guns rose 10 percent, and robberies rose 12 percent. In just 2 years.  Of course, these updated survey results mirror the FBI's own statistics, which showed that in 2005 violent crime rose in every region of the country, and by 2.5 percent overall--the largest reported increase in 15 years. For the first 6 months of 2006, the surge in violent crime was even worse--3.7 percent overall, according to the FBI.  Let me put these numbers in human terms. The International Association of Chiefs of Police equates this 2.5 percent rise to 31,479 more victims of violent crime in 2005. And a 3.7 percent increase for all of 2006, it says, equates to about 47,000 more Americans murdered, robbed, assaulted, raped, or subjected to violent crimes last year.  Unfortunately, despite these disturbing numbers, the President's budget proposal for FY2008 continued to propose drastic cuts in the Federal assistance traditionally available to State and local law enforcement.  Listen to the warning cry that the International Association of Chiefs of Police recently issued:       [T]he cuts contained in the proposed FY 2008 budget have      the potential to cripple the capabilities of law enforcement      agencies nationwide and force many departments to take      officers off the streets, leading to more crime and violence      in our hometowns and, ultimately, less security for our      homeland.  These are strong words, but they make sense in the wake of the drastic Federal cuts we have seen to State and local law enforcement, especially in the last few years.  In FY2007, the total funding level for State, tribal and local law enforcement assistance was $2.316 billion. That was already more than $1.5 billion below the level given only 5 years earlier, when DOJ funded programs for state and local law enforcement totaled $3.831 billion.  Last year's $2.316 billion amount included not only Byrne/JAG, but also the COPS program and 17 other State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance grant programs, including the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, SCAAP; Tribal Courts Initiative, and other programs to promote Drug Courts, Prescription Drug Monitoring, Cannabis Eradication, and State and Local Intelligence Capabilities.  For FY2008, however, the President remarkably proposed to eliminate all 17 of these programs. In their place, it proposed only two consolidated programs, one of which would be called the Byrne Public Safety Program, or BPSP. Unfortunately, even when BPSP was combined with the President's other proposed programs, its total budgeted amount for FY2008 was only $582 million--a $1.7 billion cut from the already-depleted FY2007 number.  In other words, the President's budgeted $582 million represented an 85 percent cut in these funds in just 6 years. And to make matters worse, the President's FY2008 budget also proposed more than $500 million in cuts to the DHS grant programs traditionally available to State and local law enforcement.  During the 1990s and earlier years in this decade, our Federal Government vigorously funded grants programs for State and local law enforcement. And we saw results--violent crime went down year after year. But with the recent cuts, violent crime rates have now turned back up. Literally tens of thousands of additional Americans each year have become victims of violent crime.  It is time for the Senate to add substantial Byrne/JAG funding to this year's budget resolution--just as we have done in the past 2 years. In FY2006 and again in FY2007, this Senate voted to increase Byrne/JAG to $900 million--even after President Bush and previous Budget Committees tried to ``zero out'' this program.  I recognize and appreciate that Senator Conrad and his Budget Committee in the new Congress have taken a very different view of Byrne/JAG. I applaud their decision to reject the much smaller budget figure for Byrne/JAG that was contained in the President's Budget, as well as the decision to reject the President's proposal to consolidate Byrne/JAG with other grant programs and eliminate its formula funding. This is a major step forward.  Unfortunately, however, it just is not enough. At a time when this country is seeing the biggest surge in violent crime it has experienced in more than a decade, using FY2007 levels that are $1.5 billion below FY2002 levels will not do the trick. The Senate must do more--just as we rose to the occasion and voted to do more in the past.  After a Byrne/JAG amendment was offered on the budget resolution last year, we were confronted in June with the sharply higher 2005 violent crime numbers reported by the FBI. And in December, the FBI gave us even worse violent crime numbers for the first half of 2006. Given these disturbing trends, the Senate needs to restore these needed funds to the Byrne/JAG program.  I understand that this budget is tight, and I appreciate the difficult tradeoffs involved. But at a time whenwe are about to consider a Supplemental Appropriations bill that may add more than $100 billion so that we can try to secure the streets of Baghdad against violence, I do not think that it's asking too much for us to spend the funds we need to secure our own streets from the violence that the FBI says we are increasingly seeing.  Homeland security is undoubtedly important, but so is home town security.  The Byrne/JAG program, named after slain New York Police Officer Edward Byrne, is a time-tested program run by DOJ that has proven its effectiveness over the course of more than 20 years. It is a key source of funding for multi-jurisdictional task forces. And because 40 percent of a State's Byrne/JAG funds must be set aside for local governments, smaller and rural law enforcement agencies are often especially dependent on Byrne/JAG to meet their needs.  Increased funding for Byrne/JAG has been endorsed by a wide array of law enforcement groups, and I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.                           Amendment No. 616
