Speaker, I want to thank our leader here this evening for his superlative commitment to the cause of decency and values that we stand for as a free people.  In joining the gentleman this evening, along with our very respected colleagues, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Brown) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman), the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee) and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Kucinich), I am really proud to join these men and women, and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bonior) tonight in expressing in more than a minute why this is really a vote about values, and that if permanent trade status is granted in this vote to China, we essentially are placing a stamp of approval on current conditions and saying that this is the system that we want to enlarge in the future.  How can we want to enlarge a system that is based on utter exploitation of people? One cannot operate a company in China unless they have an agreement with the government, with one of the state-owned companies. There was an article in USA Today this week that said that the first 19,000 cars that were sold in China in a General Motors facility that was built there were sold to the owners of the State companies, they were not sold to the workers.  So if that is the kind of system that we want to build for those that have the most, then, by golly, that is what the current system is producing. If we look at the workers in those plants, they are not earning enough to buy what they make.  That is the reason that, under this system that people want to approve permanently, we are amassing greater and greater trade deficits with China every year, more of our dollars going in their coffers than their currency coming here.
