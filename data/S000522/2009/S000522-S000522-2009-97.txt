I say to my good friend, Mr. King, I have been offering the Mexico City Policy since 1984. I have been here for 29 years, and I offered it the first time. And I remember members on the other side of the aisle saying that none of the family planning NGOs will take the money with that kind of conditionality. They were so focused and filled with their wanting to provide abortions.  That didn't happen. NGOs lined up. The money went out the door. And we had that line of demarcation between abortion and family planning for years. Bill Clinton reversed it, and during the course of his presidency, we fought hard to restore it. And in the end, for the last 2 years of the Clinton administration, we had first a modified and then the full Mexico City Policy back. President Bush, by executive order, re-established it, and family planning moneys flowed, but without abortion promotion or performance.  And then, President Obama, like I said, just a couple of days after being sworn in, re-established, or reversed I should say, the Mexico City Policy with more money now flowing to those organizations. Why the joy and the happiness on the side of those who promote abortion? It is bewildering in the extreme. Father Pavone's Web site, and I encourage people to check it out, he talks about a meeting when this Dr. Haskell, the man who devised this child-abuse method called partial-birth abortion, as you pointed out where the baby's brains are literally sucked out, he presented that method, as Father Pavone points out in one of his speeches, it actually has much about what happened in this conference, and the conference was filled with abortionists. And when the baby actually died, it was being killed, because he had it all on film, they broke into applause at the demise, at the death of that child.  That is pathetic. It is beyond tragic. I said during the debate, and remember Bill Clinton vetoed partial-birth abortion not once but twice, that when my young girls, and we have two girls, four children totally, but when they were young, if they were to play ``doctor,'' the girls, and take their dolls as they had when they were 5 and 6, turn them around and pierce the back of their skulls and then suck their brains out, we would seek, as would any parent, immediate counseling. Something would be wrong. When someone embraces the death of a child, something is very, very dangerously wrong.  I have seen on this floor time and again--and I would say we won the debate, I would say to my friend, but lost the vote on Mexico City Policy. And when we have lost fights on partial-birth abortion, for example, not in vote count, but in vetoes by the previous administration, it never ceases to amaze me that one could be joyous over allowing, facilitating and enabling more death to children and more wounding of their mothers.  That is what this is all about. I believe passionately, and I have been in Congress 29 years, and I spend much of my time working on human rights issues, humanitarian issues around the world, whether it be in Africa working on human trafficking or on trying to mitigate and stop terrible things like torture. I wrote four torture victims relief acts--laws--they are not bills, they are laws, and many, many other laws, microcredit financing for the developing world, three human trafficking laws beginning with the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, I believe passionately in human rights. But birth is not the beginning of a person's life. We need to see it as an event that happens to each and every one of us, and that those children in utero are no less human and alive than you and me. They are definitely dependent.They are immature, as is a newborn, as is a 1 year old. And a compassionate and sane society would seek to enfranchise, not disenfranchise.  So when they expressed on the other side, and a few on our side of the aisle, happiness over the loss of the Mexico City policy, it was very clear to me. I had nothing but sorrow because there is one predictable consequence, more dead babies and more wounded mothers.  I yield back.                              {time}  2130
