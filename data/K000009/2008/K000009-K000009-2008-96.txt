. 3712, which seeks to name the Federal Courthouse Building located in Toledo Ohio, the James M. Ashley and Thomas W. Ludlow Ashley Customs Building and United States Courthouse.                              {time}  1115  This deserved recognition of two well-known lawmakers from the Ashley family, whose roots run deep in America and our community, pays tribute to the lives of late Congressman and Governor James M. Ashley who served here in the 19th century, as well as his great-grandson, former Congressman Thomas W. Ludlow Ashley, who served here during the 20th century.  These visionary Americans who lived in three different centuries advanced America's promise and the cause of social justice as they made immeasurable public service contributions to both define and direct the course of our Nation, one in the abolitionist fight to eliminate slavery in our Nation, and the other to bind up America's wounds in the civil rights era to help our Nation gain its idealistic foothold again.  Congressman James Ashley, who served in our U.S. House of Representatives from December 1859 to March 1869, was an active abolitionist credited with introducing the first bill for the 13th Amendment to our constitution to abolish the practice of slavery. He also drafted a bill to abolish slavery in Washington, DC. These extraordinarily brave actions in his era are illustrative of Ashley's courageous leadership. They reflect the Ashley family's place in history on the scales of justice and equality for all people.  During his tenure in Congress, James Ashley served as chairman of the Committee on Territories, and he was later appointed Governor of Montana. Congressman Thomas Ludlow Ashley, great-grandson of James Ashley from Lucas County, Toledo, Ohio, served a quarter century, 13 terms, from January 1955 to January 1981. During his tenure, he served as the chairman of the Select Committee on Energy where he was chosen by then-Speaker Thomas Tip O'Neill to prepare comprehensive legislative proposals across congressional committees to regain America's energy independence.  During that era of the 1970s, that landmark legislation, the Energy Conservation Act of 1976, and subsequent Carter administration energy independence proposals became America's first step on an arduous journey into a new energy age.  He also served as chairman of the Committee on Merchant Marines and Fisheries and as assistant majority whip for the Democrats in the House.  Lud was an outstanding leader in both community development and energy policy. As Chair of the Housing and Community Development Subcommittee for the Banking Committee, he, like his great-grandfather before him, championed social justice. He wrote and gained passage of the Demonstration City Act and the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 and 1977 to rebuild America's cities and communities in the wake of the civil rights era.  Indeed, the very establishment of the Department of Housing and Urban Development during the Lyndon Johnson administration was made possible by Lud's effective and dogged congressional leadership. Housing for the less fortunate and more sustainable communities across our country were made possible through his unyielding and creative efforts. A banker's banker, he also gained passage of the Bank Merger Act of 1966, the Export Development Administration Act of 1969, the Export Expansion and Finance Act of 1971.  A World War II hero, Congressman Ashley also served in the U.S. Army prior to his service in the U.S. House. Subsequent to his career in Congress, Congressman Ashley founded a consulting firm in Washington, DC, and now resides in Traverse City, Michigan.  I would ask my colleagues to please join me in supporting this bill in honor of two centuries of a family's service to America by the Ashley family and their two outstanding sons whose commitment to America is historic. Ohio is proud to claim these two favorite sons, men of principle, as people who changed America for the better.  I thank my dear colleague from Texas, Congresswoman Johnson for yielding to me. I thank Congressman Kuhl, and I thank the leadership here for allowing us from the proud Buckeye State of Ohio to place the Ashley family's name on our revered Federal courthouse in perpetuity.
