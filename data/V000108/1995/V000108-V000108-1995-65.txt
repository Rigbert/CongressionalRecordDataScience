Speaker, it is my great honor to rise today to pay tribute to the late Mr. Irv Lewin. On October 27, 1995, the Salvation Army-East Chicago Corps is dedicating the Irv Lewin Fellowship Hall.  Irv served as a board member for the Salvation Army-East Chicago Corps for over 35 years. During a portion of this period, he served as chairman of the board. What is to be dedicated as the Irv Lewin Fellowship Hall is an area for the feeding program sponsored by the Salvation Army. According to the Salvation Army-East Chicago Corps: ``Irv gave untiring support to the Salvation Army through unparalleled service and commitment.''  Irv, who passed away earlier this year, was a resident of East Chicago for many years. He also resided in Hammond and Highland for a portion of his life. Irv was a graduate of McKinley Grade School and Roosevelt High School, both of East Chicago. Irv then graduated from Indiana University, where he played the clarinet with the Indiana University marching band.  After graduating from college, he served with the U.S. Army in World War II, and, later, became a co-owner of Lewin's Clothing Store in East Chicago with his brother, Ken. In addition, Irv was an educator at Indiana University Northwest in Gary, as well as Calumet College of St. Joseph. However, Irv is probably most well known for his 35 years as a radio commentator for WJOB Radio Center in Hammond. During his career at WJOB, he helped organizations by fulfilling requests from community, nonprofit agencies.  Irv was not only committed to the goals and success of the Salvation Army, but the community as a whole. Irv was a past exalted ruler for the Elks Lodge #981, as well as chairman of the Lake County Polio Foundation and the United Jewish Appeal. Moreover, Irv served as past president for the East Chicago Chamber of Commerce, East Chicago Community Chest, East Chicago Lions Club, East Chicago Board of Education, and the Calumet College of St. Joseph. Irv was a board member of the 1st Bank of Whiting, Katherine House of East Chicago, the American Legion Post #369, and B'nai B'rith. For 13 years, Irv served as the commissioner of higher education for the State of Indiana.  All this dedication proved to be successful as Irv earned the Man of the Year Award from St. Joseph College, a Sagamore of the Wabash from former Governor Orr, and a place in the East Chicago Hall of Fame.  Irv Lewin is survived by his children, Paul and Stuart Lewin, Rosemarie Broach, Carol Bogushi, and Judi Bach, as well as many grandchildren. He rightfully deserves the great honor of having the Irv Lewin Fellowship Hall dedicated to his memory by the Salvation Army-East Chicago Corps. Indiana's First Congressional District has surely benefited from Irv's dedication and commitment to improve the quality of life for all residents of northwest Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other colleagues to join me in commemorating the memory of this great man.                          ____________________
