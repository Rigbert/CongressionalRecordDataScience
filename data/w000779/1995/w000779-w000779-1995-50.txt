Chairman, this is a straightforward amendment to protect the rights of private homeowners whose property values would be reduced by $10,000 or more when a developer fills in a wetland.  Right now the bill creates a double standard. There are one set, a generous set of rules for protecting the rights of those who want to develop property, and a far weaker set of rules for the neighboring homeowners who live nearby. If we do not vote to correct this double standard, Members will find citizens coming up to them and asking, Why did you vote to lower the property value of my house?  Here is why Members are going to get that question: By voting for this bill there are going to be more wetlands filled. Wetlands help limit flooding by acting as a huge sponge that can soak up water and rainfall. When a wetland is filled, the excess water has to find someplace to go, and that could be the basement or the backyard of the homeowners living downstream from the development.  That is why Members are going to get asked, if we do not vote to correct the double standard in this bill, why they have been willing to go along with reducing the value of their neighbor's house under this bill.  In addition, for those who are concerned about the deficit issues in this bill, this amendment should also be appealing. A 1992 congressional budget analysis estimated the cost of compensating wetland owners for not developing their property could be as high as $10 to $15 billion. The entire corps regulatory budget is in the millions.  Let us make sure that we recognize that those who develop property in our country deserve fair treatment. But let us also recognize that the homeowners who live next door to wetlands that are going to be filled under this legislation also deserve fair treatment.  Vote to give those homeowners a fair shake by supporting this amendment.
