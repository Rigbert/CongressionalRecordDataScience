 President, I have some sympathy for what the Senator from Connecticut says because so many times I have said to my constituents, this is voluntary. You are going to have your choice to go into another plan or change plans. I emphasize the ability to change plans. In addition, we have to have some stability even in the early years. Most importantly, when we are developing a new prescription drug benefit, the most vast improvement in Medicare in 35 years, I think it demands more stability than when you get down the road a ways.  I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.
