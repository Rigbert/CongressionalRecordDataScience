 President, saying my name now in 30 seconds, but I will try.  I basically believe that this is a bad amendment, and the reason I believe it is a bad amendment is because it makes women in the Federal work force second-class citizens. The amount of taxpayer money in this is minimal, maybe $1 per $1,000. The fact is that most private health care plans afford a woman this opportunity.  The arguments on abortion on demand, I think, are ridiculous. That is not real life, that is not the way women are. So I believe the amendment that passed earlier this morning is the amendment that we should abide by. And in that respect, I am very hopeful there will be a very strong vote.  I thank the Chair.
