 This was a despicable act. Our Nation should have no tolerance for those who desecrate and vandalize the graves of brave Americans.  The men and women who are buried at Riverside National Cemetery and other national cemeteries have paid the ultimate price for our freedom. They deserve our deepest respect and our eternal thanks.  Today I am introducing the Veterans' Cemetery Protection Act. This bill will create a criminal penalty of up to 10 years in prison for vandalism or desecration of a national cemetery.  If the criminals try to profit from stolen property the penalty is increased to up to 15 years in prison or a $250,000 fine.  Many of you have already asked to cosponsor this legislation. If you are not yet a cosponsor and would like to show your support, please contact my office.                          ____________________
