Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, the Power Marketing Administration's Western Area Power Administration, Southwestern Power Administration, and Southeastern Power Administration are responsible for maintaining and operating over 18,000 miles of high-voltage electrical transmission lines, providing an important contribution to the movement of electrical power across our country. They also have hundreds of substations and communications sites, most located in remote areas. These facilities have been subjected to increased incidents of vandalism.  This bill would give the agencies authority to curb this threat to Federal property and our Nation's power infrastructure by vesting them with the authority to pay rewards to individuals that offer information leading to prosecution of vandals. These rewards would be limited to $1,000 each and would be paid out of existing appropriations.  The Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, and Bonneville Power Administration already have such authority. Bonneville estimates that they save $800,000 annually by successfully applying this program to protect Federal property. The Department of Energy has asked that we extend this authority to the other power marketing administrations, and I urge my colleagues to do so by adopting this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
