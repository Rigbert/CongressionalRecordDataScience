REID. Mr. President, I would be happy to agree to having a vote at 5 o'clock and having the time between now and then evenly divided. I frankly don't think we are going to be using any more time, so if you need more time on your side, you could have part of ours.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur at 5 o'clock and that the time between now and then be evenly divided.
