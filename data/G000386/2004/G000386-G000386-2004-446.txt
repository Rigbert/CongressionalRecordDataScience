 President, I ask unanimous consent that all after the enacting clause be stricken and that the text of S. 671, as amended, be inserted. I further ask unanimous consent that H.R. 1047, as amended, be read the third time and passed; that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table en bloc; and that S. 671 be returned to the calendar.
