Congressman Jim Moran's Speech at his 20-Year Gala Celebration--March                                 29, 2011       I have the best job in the world--representing the best      educated, most diverse workforce in the strongest economy in      the country.       Of course, there's always going to be a gap between what      business can produce and what government can provide. In      Northern Virginia much of that gap is filled with the      personal generosity of most of you in this room. So, on      behalf of the beneficiaries of your generosity, let me thank      you again for your unselfishness.       After 65 years of life and 30 years in politics, I've come      to realize some things that may have not been as apparent      when I started out. First of all, the tragedy of so many      lives I've come into contact with, didn't occur when they      drew their last breath, but rather when they dreamt their      last dream. The tragedy of life is what we let die inside us      while we live.       Societies have many of the same organic qualities as      individuals and what strikes me     as I speak tonight is that this nation, which our founding      fathers intended to serve as the brightest and most moral      beacon of hope and enlightenment for all mankind, is in      danger of losing its energy and its luster. It's not lights      out time, but the light is dimming. Confidence and optimism      is giving way to pessimism and cynicism.       The fact that we can't even see our way through to funding      the Federal Government is an example of what I'm talking      about. Many in today's Congress have said they will not vote      to fund our Treasury obligations when we hit our national      debt ceiling in a matter of weeks. The seed corn for our      future growth--education, Head Start, research and      development, roads, rails, clean water infrastructure,      environmental preservation, the arts and humanities, are all      being cut into the bone in the pending HR1 Appropriations      Bill.       I'm in this job because I believe deeply in my heart in the      American dream and I believe in the essential role of the      Federal Government in the fulfillment of that dream.       Government can't and shouldn't try to solve every problem,      right every wrong, or even rectify every inequality. Its job      is to be a catalyst and a gap-filler and the option of last      resort. To do the things that the private sector can't or      won't.       For example, the private sector alone can't afford the kind      of basic research that DARPA and the National Science      Foundation invested in that produced the internet, GPS, the      human genome, and cures for so many of our diseases. And if      we want to unravel the mysteries of what lies under the sea      and above the sky, if we want to find a permanent cure for      Alzheimer's and cancer and autism, and if we're going to      secure clean, sustainable sources of energy, then the Federal      Government needs to be seen as a partner worth the trust and      the investment of the American people and its politicians.       The private sector can't finance all our interstate roads      and high-speed rail and mass transit systems. The private      sector can't fund the infrastructure to separate storm water      from drinking water or salvage Puget Sound or the Chesapeake      Bay or the Great Lakes. And neither the private sector nor      most of the parents of this country can take on the task of      educating our future workforce.       Those are inherently governmental responsibilities and we      ought not shrink from them.       If we truly believe in the future of this country then we      have to be willing to make the investments necessary to      ensure that brighter future. That means you don't cut corners      on research opportunities, you don't shortchange your      transportation systems, and you don't lay off more than      200,000 teachers, as we've done over the last two years,      while the number of students has increased by 750,000.       Of course, we have to reduce the deficit and ultimately      balance our budget--but you can't fight two wars, expand      Medicare and invest billions in our homeland's security with      two deep tax cuts.       We're bringing in revenue today that amounts to 15% of GDP.      We've never had a strong, stable, modern economy without      investing at least 20% of our GDP in military security and in      our domestic physical and human infrastructure. But, as the      Bowles/Simpson Commission emphasized, spending at 25% of GDP      is just as unsustainable as taxing at 15%.       Our tax code has got to be made simpler and fairer. Warren      Buffet is right to ask why his secretary pays 25% of her      income while he only pays taxes on 10% of his wealth. And      it's fair to ask why Exxon Mobil, GE, NewsCorp, Bank of      America, and dozens of other multinational corporations are      paying zero taxes to the U.S. during some of their most      profitable years, while other corporations with much less      profit are paying 35%.       It's not their fault. It's ours in the Congress.       We lose a trillion dollars a year in so-called tax      expenditures, much of which can only be justified in a      political context. And while I'm an ardent capitalist, I      don't think we should be taxing those making $250,000 a year      at the same rate as we tax those making $25 million a year.       We also have to rein in health care costs. They're      crippling our economy. Medicare and Medicaid spending has      doubled over the last 25 years as a percent of GDP. It      doesn't make sense that we should be living shorter, less      healthy lives, while spending twice what any other country is      spending on its health care. The reason is that we reimburse      for the quantity of services provided, rather than the      quality of care needed. Hopefully, the health care reform      bill that was fought over so vehemently will fix that.       A couple other things I have come to realize over the last      20 years is that the best social program is a good job and      the key to economic prosperity and social stability is a      strong middle class. Neither a survival of the fittest      society nor a winner-take-all economy is in anyone's long-     term best interest.       Carrying on the theme of societies functioning very much      like individuals, I think we all have kind of a burning flame      inside of us. Some call it our soul or the human spirit, but      it does seem as though when we look the other way from the      poor, shut our doors to the homeless, close our consciences      to the sick and needy, that flame burns less bright, and      eventually goes out. . . I think that can apply to our nation      as well.       And in that regard, let me say a word about immigration. I      just came from a ten-day trip to Colombia, Panama, Guatemala,      and Mexico City. The Chinese, Canadians and Europeans are all      filling the gap in Colombia and Panama left by our inability      to reach a deal with them--a free trade deal that primarily      lowers their tariffs on our goods and services.       But in Guatemala, fully half the population is stunted from      malnutrition and crime is so pervasive a young person is more      likely to be shot in a crime than to study in a college. In      Mexico, 97% of the crimes committed are never prosecuted. The      kids go to school for only four hours a day, but only 13% of      their teachers can pass a high school equivalency exam.       What would you do as a parent in a situation like that? I      think I know what you would do, because it is exactly what I      would do for my own children--you would risk everything to      pursue your dream of a better life for your kids. And that's      exactly what the bravest, boldest and most entrepreneurial      do.       And it is because people from all over the world have made      that decision to come to America for the same reasons our      ancestors did, that we've been able to constantly renew and      reinvigorate our population and our workforce. That's why I'm      a cosponsor of a bill that makes the highest achieving      children of immigrants eligible for college, regardless of      their parents' status and why I support the bill that      requires English fluency, civics knowledge, paid-up back      taxes, and no criminal record to get in the back of the line      for citizenship. That's what they say amnesty is all about. I      think it's what America is all about.       And finally--Libya. Who among you, if you saw a well-known      bully beating up on defenseless people with a tire iron,      wouldn't grab that tire iron out of his hands?       Gaddafi is not Mubarack of Egypt or King Hussein of Jordan,      or President Saleh of Yemen or the Khalifa family of Bahrain.      He's a truly bad guy. He's using foreign mercenaries to      torture and kill his people, who I believe just want some      semblance of dignity, opportunity and human rights. Human      rights that their peers throughout the Middle East are now      willing to risk their lives for. President Obama has done the      right thing by leveling the playing field.       The reason we've made the extraordinary investments we've      made to create the strongest, smartest military in the world      is to make this a better, safer world for everyone, and in so      doing, to insure a more peaceful world for ourselves.       And when we seize the moral high ground, we will always win      not just the battle, but the war of ideals and values. Those      same values and ideals motivated my father to serve in World      War II and to take advantage of the GI Bill and to save and      sacrifice to get all seven of his children through college,      and it's why I'm so genuinely humbled by the idea that I've      been able to serve in the U.S. Congress for the last 20      years--and why I am so deeply grateful to all of you for      affording me that opportunity.       Thank you.                          ____________________
