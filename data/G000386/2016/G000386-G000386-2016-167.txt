 President, I am pleased we are considering the bill before us entitled the ``Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act''--acronym CARA--and that we are on the floor discussing this very important issue.  Since I spoke about the bill earlier this week, I will not have any more opening remarks at this point. I look forward to a bipartisan process where we are able to consider many amendments and move this bill forward.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
