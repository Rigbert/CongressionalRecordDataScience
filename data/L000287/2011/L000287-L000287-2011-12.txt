Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the American people have grown weary of war. War destroys the dreams, the hopes, the aspirations, and the longings of a people.  A wise man once said, ``Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, hopes of its children.''  These are not the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. These are not the words of Gandhi. These are the words of a five-star General, President Dwight Eisenhower.  We have spent billions of dollars. Thousands of our sons and daughters have been left dead on the battlefield and scarred by the brutality of war. I'm glad that the President is bringing 10,000 soldiers home from Afghanistan, but we must do more to end this war and start investing in our future.  We cannot continue to fund this war while we tell our seniors there is no money for Medicare. We cannot fund war and tell our children and young mothers that we won't pay for food stamps. We cannot pay for war while our bridges and our roads are crumbling.  We cannot afford to make bombs and guns. We must use our resources to solve the problems of humankind, to build and not to tear down, to reconcile and not to divide, to love and not to hate, to heal and not to kill.  If we want to create a beloved community, create a beloved world, a world that is at peace with itself, if that is our goal, our way must be love, peace, and nonviolence, skilled diplomacy not military might.  We must lay down the tools and instruments of war and violence. Stop paying for war. Believe in the power of peace and end this war.
