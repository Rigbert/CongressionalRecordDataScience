Mr. Speaker, I submit for the benefit of the Members a copy of the cost estimate prepared by the Congressional Budget Office for H.R. 2841, an act to amend the Revised Organic Act of the Virgin Islands to provide for greater fiscal autonomy consistent with other United States jurisdictions.                                      Congressional Budget Office,                                                U.S. Congress,                               Washington, DC, September 28, 1999.      Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, Committee on Resources,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has      prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 2841, an act to      amend the Revised Organic Act of the Virgin Islands to      provide for greater fiscal autonomy consistent with other      United States jurisdictions, and for other purposes.       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be      pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is John R.      Righter, who can be reached at 226-2860.           Sincerely,                                               Dan L. Crippen,                                                         Director.               Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate                           September 28, 1999       H.R. 2841--An act to amend the Revised Organic Act of the      Virgin Islands to provide for greater fiscal autonomy      consistent with other United States jurisdictions, and for      other purposes--as passed by the House on September 27, 1999       H.R. 2841 would provide the government of the Virgin      Islands, a territory of the United States, more flexibility      in issuing general obligation debt (that is, debt that the      Virgin Islands secures by pledging its full faith and      credit). Specifically, the legislation would allow the Virgin      Islands to issue general obligation debt for any public      purpose authorized by its legislature. It also would remove      certain types of debt from the territory's limit on aggregate      debt and would allow its government to pay bondholders on a      monthly or quarterly basis. The Joint Committee on Taxation      estimates that enacting H.R. 2841 would decrease governmental      receipts by about $2 million over the 2000-2004 period, with      the amount of forgone receipts totaling less than $500,000      for each year. The estimates loss of receipts would occur as      a result of the government of the Virgin Islands increasing      its amount of tax-exempt debt. Because the legislation would      affect governmental receipts, pay-as-you-go procedures would      apply.       In addition, the legislation would authorize the Secretary      of the Interior to enter into an agreement with the Governor      of the Virgin Islands to establish financial controls and      performance standards for the territory. Subject to the      availability of appropriated funds, CBO estimates that      providing the technical assistance would not significantly      increase costs at the Department of the Interior.       H.R. 2841 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector      mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and      would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments.      The legislation would provide significant benefits to the      government of the Virgin Islands.       The CBO staff contact is John R. Righter, who can be      reached at 226-2860. This estimate was approved by Peter H.      Fontaine, Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.                               ____________________
