Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a hero from my congressional district. On December 21, 2004, U.S. Army Specialist Jonathan Castro of my hometown of Corona, CA, was killed in Mosul, Iraq. Specialist Castro, along with 18 other American soldiers, died from injuries sustained when their dining facility was attacked. I would ask that the House of Representatives honor and remember this incredible young man who died in service to his country. Specialist Castro will be remembered as a hero who lived a life filled with compassion and a respect for all people.  Jonathan, son of Jorge and Vickie Castro, spent most of his life in Corona, CA. The summer after graduating from Corona's Centennial High School in 2001, he enlisted in the Army. He entered the military with the hope that it would enable him to pay his own way through school and would open his eyes to the world. He was assigned to the 73rd Engineer Company in Fort Lewis, WA, and was deployed to Iraq in October, 2004.  He is remembered not only for his caring nature, but also for his intelligence. He was a budding engineer with a talent for working with metals and wood, as well as having strong skills in computer-aided drafting. He demonstrated creativity and ingenuity during high school as he built his own electric guitar, as well as a full-sized electric car.  On December 1, 2004, in Mosul, Iraq, while sharing a meal with his fellow soldiers, the dining facility was attacked. This has been the deadliest blast to date at a U.S. military base in Iraq, with 22 people killed. Specialist Castro was only 21 years old. He is survived by his loving parents and seven brothers. Jonathan was decorated posthumously with the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.  Jonathan, and men and women like him, contribute to the incredibly rich history of our country. I commend all our service members who volunteer to defend our ideals of freedom and democracy.  I extend my ongoing thoughts, prayers and deepest gratitude to the Castro family. I hope they know their son and brother's goodness and sacrifice will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
