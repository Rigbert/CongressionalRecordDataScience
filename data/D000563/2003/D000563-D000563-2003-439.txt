ntal holdings1Total= 000>  This morning's newspapers across America disclosed we are facing a ental holdings1Total= 000>record-breaking budget deficit. We have gone, over the span of 3 years, ental holdings1Total= 000>from over $200 billion in surplus each year to over $450 billion in ental holdings1Total= 000>deficit. That does not count the Social Security portion which is about ental holdings1Total= 000>another $160 billion. We are facing record-breaking budget deficits. ental holdings1Total= 000>And now as we debate appropriations bills, these bills are not speaking ental holdings1Total= 000>to the reality of official spending under the Bush administration.ental holdings1Total= 000>  To think we would consider this Department of Defense bill and not ental holdings1Total= 000>include the money necessary for the war in Iraq is to suggest that this ental holdings1Total= 000>bill does not tell the whole story.ental holdings1Total= 000>  Just last week in the Armed Services Committee, Secretary Rumsfeld, ental holdings1Total= 000>our Secretary of Defense, appeared before the committee and was asked ental holdings1Total= 000>by Senator Byrd of West Virginia, what is the cost of the war in Iraq? ental holdings1Total= 000>Secretary Rumsfeld, in charge of the largest military operation on the ental holdings1Total= 000>face of the Earth, said, I don't know. Senator Byrd said, you better ental holdings1Total= 000>find out. These are questions asked by Congress of Secretaries of ental holdings1Total= 000>Defense through history. So there was a break in the action and ental holdings1Total= 000>Senators came over for a vote and when we returned, Secretary Rumsfeld ental holdings1Total= 000>said, I have been told it will be about $3.9 billion per month, roughly ental holdings1Total= 000>$1 billion a week for Iraq. When asked about Afghanistan, he suggested ental holdings1Total= 000>it would be somewhere in the range of $1 billion a month.ental holdings1Total= 000>  That means we are going to spend roughly $5 billion a month that is ental holdings1Total= 000>not accounted for in this bill. So we know we are going to spend the ental holdings1Total= 000>money. We are never going to shortchange our men and women in uniform. ental holdings1Total= 000>Why isn't this Bush administration, in all candor and honesty, coming ental holdings1Total= 000>to us with a bill that includes the costs of the war?ental holdings1Total= 000>  Senator Dorgan, my colleague from North Dakota, asked that obvious ental holdings1Total= 000>question and asked the Senate to vote on it. It will be interesting ental holdings1Total= 000>tomorrow to see if those who believe the Senate has a responsibility ental holdings1Total= 000>for oversight and also believe this administration has a responsibility ental holdings1Total= 000>to be honest about the costs of the war, will, in fact, support the ental holdings1Total= 000>Dorgan amendment. I certainly will. I hope my colleagues on both sides ental holdings1Total= 000>of the aisle will, as well.ental holdings1Total= 000>  This is a tough amendment because it puts the administration on the ental holdings1Total= 000>spot. They have to explain where they are going to come up with a ental holdings1Total= 000>substantial amount of money, but I think that is the burden they asked ental holdings1Total= 000>for when they assumed office. We need to face it squarely, as do they.ental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>  I also say, despite the obvious monetary costs of the war, what I ental holdings1Total= 000>find in traveling back to Illinois is the people are less concerned ental holdings1Total= 000>about the monetary costs than the human costs of this war. It is tough ental holdings1Total= 000>to calculate how many of our great men and women have died since ental holdings1Total= 000>President Bush declared military victory in the first part of May. But ental holdings1Total= 000>we know almost on a daily basis that we are losing some of our finest ental holdings1Total= 000>soldiers, men and women, well trained for military combat, who are now ental holdings1Total= 000>in the position of maintaining peace in Iraq, trying to establish a ental holdings1Total= 000>civil society. It is not an easy task. These men and women, trained ental holdings1Total= 000>with the highest technology, so successful on the battlefield, now find ental holdings1Total= 000>themselves on patrol, guarding college campuses, guarding museums, ental holdings1Total= 000>enforcing curfews, dealing with scuffles and fights in public ental holdings1Total= 000>marketplaces. As they go in to try to quell this violence and bring ental holdings1Total= 000>peace to the situation, sadly, many of them are being attacked by ental holdings1Total= 000>Iraqis. Some are being killed.ental holdings1Total= 000>  To those who follow this debate, I say we can try in this bill to ental holdings1Total= 000>ignore the dollar costs of this war but, trust me, families across ental holdings1Total= 000>America, the people of this country, know the human costs on a daily ental holdings1Total= 000>basis. They are asking us the hard questions.ental holdings1Total= 000>  Senator Lugar of Indiana, whom I respect very much, visited Iraq. He ental holdings1Total= 000>came back and said, in all candor, he believed we would be in that ental holdings1Total= 000>country for 5 years. He said he felt that was a minimum. I hope he is ental holdings1Total= 000>wrong. But I respect his judgment and his insight. If we are to be ental holdings1Total= 000>there for 5 years, if 150,000 troops or any portion of those troops ental holdings1Total= 000>will remain for that period of time, it is a massive investment by the ental holdings1Total= 000>United States in Iraq. It calls into question our basic strategy in ental holdings1Total= 000>trying to establish civil order.ental holdings1Total= 000>  I cannot for the life of me understand why this administration has ental holdings1Total= 000>not gone to the United Nations and asked them to assume responsibility ental holdings1Total= 000>with us for the future of Iraq. Why hasn't this government come to the ental holdings1Total= 000>Senate and asked the same thing? If we could replace American troops in ental holdings1Total= 000>the field, guardsmen and reserves who have been there for long periods ental holdings1Total= 000>of time away from their family, if we could replace themental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>[[Page S9394]]ental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>and bring them home by bringing in troops from other countries, that ental holdings1Total= 000>would certainly be very positive.ental holdings1Total= 000>  In this morning's newspapers Prime Minister Vajpayee of India said ental holdings1Total= 000>the United States requested 17,000 Indian troops and he declined the ental holdings1Total= 000>invitation. He said he might join an effort sponsored by the United ental holdings1Total= 000>Nations. Those are his conditions. I don't know the conditions of other ental holdings1Total= 000>countries.ental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>  What is clear to me now is that though the coalition of the willing ental holdings1Total= 000>was enough to win the military end of the war, the coalition of the ental holdings1Total= 000>willing is incapable of meeting the responsibility today of ental holdings1Total= 000>establishing and maintaining order in Iraq. That coalition has really ental holdings1Total= 000>come down to two major countries, Great Britain and the United States. ental holdings1Total= 000>We are shouldering this burden, not just on the monetary side but on ental holdings1Total= 000>the side of human cost.ental holdings1Total= 000>  I think this administration should be conscious of the fact that many ental holdings1Total= 000>Americans, supportive of the invasion of Iraq, supportive of ental holdings1Total= 000>eliminating Saddam Hussein, are now raising serious questions about the ental holdings1Total= 000>duration and cost of our occupation of Iraq.ental holdings1Total= 000>  The same thing can be said, obviously, of Afghanistan. I am a big ental holdings1Total= 000>supporter of Hamid Karzai. I think he has done a remarkable job as the ental holdings1Total= 000>leader in Afghanistan, bringing some order to a country which has known ental holdings1Total= 000>chaos for too many years. But we know he needs help. Too many tribal ental holdings1Total= 000>warlords control portions of the country that should be controlled by ental holdings1Total= 000>some central authority coming out of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan. ental holdings1Total= 000>That is not the case.ental holdings1Total= 000>  The President of Pakistan recently visited the United States. ental holdings1Total= 000>President Musharraf said to President Bush: If you want one piece of ental holdings1Total= 000>advice, send more troops to Afghanistan. We don't have enough people ental holdings1Total= 000>there to maintain order. Our troop strength is estimated to be between ental holdings1Total= 000>8,500 and 10,000. That points to the need for this bill to be more ental holdings1Total= 000>inclusive on the real cost of the war in Afghanistan and Iraq. We need ental holdings1Total= 000>to face this head on.ental holdings1Total= 000>  For the Department of Defense appropriations bill to speak to ental holdings1Total= 000>national security and ignore 150,000 men and women in uniform in Iraq ental holdings1Total= 000>and the cost to our country, as well as another 8,500 or so in ental holdings1Total= 000>Afghanistan, really misses the point. We need a bill that is complete. ental holdings1Total= 000>The Dorgan amendment will move us in that direction. I will support it ental holdings1Total= 000>tomorrow, and I hope my colleagues will join me.ental holdings1Total= 000>  I yield the floor.ental holdings1Total= 000>
