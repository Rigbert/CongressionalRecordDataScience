  I remind all of us as Americans that we have to be vigilant about what is around us, and when we are, we can make a difference in the lives of many people. The tragedy that occurred in Bellingham, WA, 10 years ago today will remain with me always and with the families of Bellingham and everyone else. But if we do our work and we remain vigilant and we fund the Office of Pipeline Safety and we insist on strong protections, we can protect families in the future. That is what is important about today.  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.
