Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman for his answer.  Another piece of business that has not been completed but is in the works or at least pending is the transportation reauthorization. Can the leader tell me whether or not there is an expectation of passing that bill or a relatively short-term extension prior to our leaving on whatever date we may leave?  I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding to me.  I will start by saying the House has not given up. We want to get this bill done. We have been working to get it done, and we hope to have a conference report for the Members before we adjourn. In the interim, we may have another short-term extension of the highway programs, and hopefully we will have a decision by the first of next week. In order to get the full 6-year highway bill done, I think a decision will have to be made by the first of next week as to how we would proceed.
