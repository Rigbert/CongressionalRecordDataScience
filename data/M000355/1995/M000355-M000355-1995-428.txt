 Abraham):  S. 300. A bill to reform the civil justice system, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.                     the lawsuit reform act of 1995  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, our civil justice system is unable to adequately serve the people who need it. Our legal system, over the last 30 years, has become inefficient, costly and unpredictable. People who need a forum to resolve a dispute find less and less satisfaction in our courts; they face interminable delays, contentious proceedings, and decisions that too often seem neither fair nor just. We must bring needed change to the courts before Americans lose confidence in one of the crucial pillars of our democracy.  Today I am introducing the Lawsuit Reform Act of 1995, designed to start the process for reforming our litigation system. The bill is intended to reduce some of the rewards that now exist for bringing a lawsuit and to introduce some incentives to resolve cases without resort to litigation.  Let's face it, Americans are sue happy. The United States has become a litigation prone society, with far reaching consequences: Too many lawsuits and clogged courts hurt the U.S. in the international marketplace. And, the threat of lawsuits impedes innovation and invention.  That our Nation has become a society of people too willing to sue each other is also a symptom of moral decay. Too often, we try to blame someone else for our situation, and with a lawsuit, we try get that someone else to foot the bill. So, we have to get rid of the incentives for suing, and we have to ensure that those who do [[Page S1850]] suffer losses get compensated fairly for those losses. The courts need to be available for those who have real disputes, and rationality, civility and fairness must be restored to our legal system.  The bill contains a number of provisions, some of which I have introduced in previous Congresses. Other provisions represent bold new directions for our legal system. For example, reform of attorney contingent fee arrangements--that is, limiting contingent fees to that portion of an award for which the attorney undertook risk and added value--will restore the balance to the lawyer-client relationship. It will remove the enormous financial stake trial lawyers now have in their clients cases, and it will significantly reduce the $13 to $15 billion paid in contingency fees. Incidentally, this provision has the endorsement of legal scholars from Judge Robert Bork to Normal Dorsen.  Another provision, early offer and recovery, will put more money in the hands of injured parties more quickly and effectively. In return for refraining from a lawsuit, an injured party would get all of his or her economic losses paid by the responsible parties. This mechanism has the potential to break the link between the litigation system and the overuse and abuse of the health care system. If an injured party gets a commitment to have all of his or her expenses paid, then there is no incentive to inflate expenses by making unnecessary trips to the doctor. And the 57 cents of every dollar spent in the litigation system as transaction costs associated with lawyers will be significantly decreased. Injured plaintiff will get much more than 43 cents of every dollar now spent on litigation.  The bill contains a loser-pays provision, restricted only to those who can afford to assume the risk of having to pay their opponent's legal fees. And, the bill includes needed limitations on punitive damages, reforms to the collateral source rule and an end to joint and several liability.  Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator Abraham. Although he is new to the Senate, he has extensive experience on this issue. Our bill contains some bold initiatives for reform. These changes will make a real difference in the legal system.  I am including in the Record a summary of the bill, and I will return to the floor on a regular basis to highlight the problems with our legal system and the reforms needed. I look forward to the Senate tackling legal reform in this Congress.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 Summary of Lawsuit Reform Act of 1995                              the problem       Over the last 30 years, the American civil justice system      has become inefficient, unpredictable and costly. Those who      need the court system to resolve their disputes face      interminable delay, much of which can be blamed on frivolous      lawsuits clogging the courts or upon unreasonable litigation      when a settlement could be achieved.       The threat of lawsuits impedes invention, innovation and      the competitive position our nation has enjoyed in the world      marketplace. No nation is as litigious as the United States.       It is imperative that we restore rationality, certainty,      fairness and civility to our legal system. For too long, a      group of trial lawyers have prevented efforts to bring      reasonable change to the legal system. Many of those who      practice in our nation's courts have a vested interest in      maintaining the status quo. But just as decisions about war      are too important to leave to the generals, legal reform is      simply too important to leave to the lawyers.       The Lawsuit Reform Act of 1995 contains a variety of      options for reforming the civil justice system.                   accountability in attorneys' fees       The legal system can be arcane and foreign to all but those      who make it their occupation. Consequently, clients must rely      on lawyers not only to handle their legal needs but even to      tell them what their legal needs are. As a result, lawyers,      like other experts in similar situations, are by the nature      of their work well positioned to take advantage of those who      come to them for assistance.       Most lawyers do not misuse their position. Unfortunately,      however, some do. Moreover, the organized bar, which has been      set up to serve as the principal mechanism for regulating      such abuses, has frequently--sometimes for good reason--had      considerable difficulty in drawing the line between      acceptable and unacceptable conduct.       One key area where these problems are apparent is in the      standard practice of taking tort cases on a contingent fee      basis. Contingent fees play an important role in allowing      plaintiffs to bring suit if their cases are legitimate, their      chances of recovery uncertain, and their resources limited.      But they have no place even where a plaintiff has limited      resources if the recovery is a virtual certainty. Many tort      cases are of the latter type, and the lawyers who take them      know it. Nevertheless, the lawyers still take them on a      contingent fee basis and collect very large fees because the      plaintiff does not know it.       This section is designed to put some balance in the lawyer-     client relationship. First, it requires that attorneys      disclose fee arrangements to the potential client and inform      the client that the contingent fee is not mandatory but an      option.       In addition, it limits the collection of a contingent fee      by an attorney to that portion of the award which was      achieved by the attorney's work and undertaking of risk. It      uses the party's own behavior to determine which portion of      the award that should be by setting out limits on the      attorney's contingent fee when a settlement is offered: if      the attorney is retained to advise the claimant on the      settlement offer, the attorney will be precluded from      charging a contingent fee; if the attorney's representation      results in an increased offer, the attorney may charge an      hourly or contingent fee, not to exceed 20% of the increase      in the offer; if the attorney obtains the settlement offer,      the contingent fee will be limited to 10% of the first      $100,000 and 5% of any additional amount. If the case goes to      trial, the attorney's contingent fee could only be based upon      the amount of the award that exceeds the settlement offer.      The effect is to limit the attorney contingent fee to that      portion of the case to which the attorney adds value.       Another provision requires judges, under Federal Rule of      Civil Procedure 11, to impose sanctions on attorneys who file      frivolous pleadings. Rule 11 was weakened in 1992 to give      judges the discretion to impose sanctions.       The final provision of this section introduces loser pays      in tort cases where the plaintiff seeks damages for physical      or mental injury, property damage or other economic loss.       In virtually every western nation except the U.S., the      loser pays for the costs of litigation. Within our own legal      system, we have dozens of fee shifting laws. But these have      become ``one way'' shifting, allowing only prevailing      plaintiffs to recover their attorneys' fees from losing      defendants.       This provision restores some balance in the system by      setting up a two way fee shifting that requires either losing      party in a tort case to pay the other's attorney's fees.       The loser pays rule is limited to the amount of fees owed      by the loser to its own attorney. And the loser pay rule will      not apply to those individuals and small businesses which can      least afford to pay. In addition, courts would retain      discretion to refuse to award attorneys' fees or reduce the      award if it would be in the interests of justice.                              early offer       A lawsuit can be avoided if the injured party gets fully      compensated quickly. Moreover, a defendant may be willing to      pay compensation but is prevented from doing so by the need      to make an offer that will also pay the plaintiff's lawyer      handsomely. This section creates sufficient incentives for a      prompt compensatory settlement that should overcome this      obstacle.       First, it sets up a mechanism allowing the potential      plaintiff to notify the potential defendants of the injury      and the compensation necessary. The potential defendant will      then be allowed to make an early offer to pay all economic      losses, including future economic losses; if it is accepted,      the matter is resolved without a lawsuit. If the plaintiff      elects to prove the elements of the case beyond a reasonable      doubt, including that the defendant was grossly negligent or      intentionally caused the injury, the plaintiff will not be      foreclosed from bringing a lawsuit.                    Fair Share Assessment of Damages       Defendants' liability, in the American legal system, is      often based upon the ability to pay and not on the degree of      responsibility. The doctrine of ``joint and several      liability'' permits a plaintiff to recover the entire damage      award from any of the defendants sued. If one defendant is      judgment-proof, but was 80% responsible, the plaintiff can      still get the entire judgment paid by another defendant, even      though that defendant was significantly less responsible.       This section reforms the doctrine of joint and several      liability and permits recovery from a defendant only for      damages attributable to the person's share of responsibility.      It applies to tort cases where the plaintiff seeks damages      for physical or mental injury, property damage or economic      loss.                      Eliminate Double Recoveries       A plaintiff can recover damages without regard to money the      plaintiff may be receiving from other sources, such as      disability insurance or a wage continuation program.       This section would put an end to these double recoveries by      prohibiting the inclusion of these collateral sources from      the proof of damages. And it prohibits subrogation      [[Page S1851]] claims by the entities providing these      collateral source payments. This provision applies to tort      cases where the plaintiff seeks damages for physical or      mental injury, property damage or economic loss.              Punitive Damages as Punishment, not Windfall       Those accused of a crime have constitutional protection;      they are informed of the charges against them and know the      punishment they face.       In many cases, civil defendants face punitive damage awards      that bear no relationship to the concept of punishment and      deterrence and are designed to further compensate the      plaintiff and his or her attorney. A reasonable limit on      punitive damages will serve the public policy objective of      punishment and deterrence. The bill limits punitive damages      in tort cases where the plaintiff seeks damages for physical      or mental injury, property damage or economic loss, to the      greater of $250,000 or three times compensatory damages.                     Alternative Dispute Resolution       Encouragement of ADR should be a focus of any civil justice      reform effort. However, ADR should not become another      procedural hurdle for litigants.       This section creates voluntary binding ADR. It requires, in      all federal question and diversity cases, parties be told by      their attorneys of ADR options. If parties agree to ADR, then      they are bound by its results.                Ensuring Expert Witnesses have Expertise       Too often, parties in a lawsuit bring in a witness asserted      to be an ``expert'' to offer an opinion which supports a      particular theory of the case. The 1975 Federal Rules of      Evidence--in allowing any expert testimony that might be      ``helpful'' to the jury--depart from the traditional      standard: that expert testimony should only be admitted if      its basis has ``gained general acceptance in the particular      field.'' The result has been a slippery slope to junk science      finding its way into courtrooms across the nation.       This section is designed to ensure the expert witness      actually has some expertise in a recognized field, and it      will require the disqualification of any expert witness whose      compensation is linked to the outcome of the case.                        Private Rights of Action       Too many judges have a tendency to imply a private right of      action in a law where Congress does not explicitly create it.      The result is excessive litigation and a power grab by the      courts never intended by Congress.       This section creates a rule of construction that federal      laws which do not expressly contain a private right of action      should not be interpreted to imply one.                       ``Opt Out'' by the States       States will retain the right to opt out of any one or more      of the provisions of this Act by affirmatively enacting      legislation to opt out.
