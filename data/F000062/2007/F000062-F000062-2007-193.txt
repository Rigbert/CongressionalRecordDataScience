 Through the Chair to the Senator from Massachusetts, he is dead right. This is $55 billion where the people affected by the bill pay for the costs. That is a big thing: $55 billion will flow to do what needs to be done, whether it is the biometric cards, whether it is the US-VISIT Program, whether it is the infrastructure at the border, whether it is the 5,000 additional Border Patrol; whatever it is in the bill, the fines are very heavy in this bill. Many people--and a reason why much of the immigrant community has become concerned about the bill--is because of the size of the fines. Nonetheless, we can make the argument that this bill will pay for itself, by and large. The fines are stiff to do that.
