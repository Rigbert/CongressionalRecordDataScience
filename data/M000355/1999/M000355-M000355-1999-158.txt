 President, the conference report making appropriations for fiscal year 2000 for Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies which is currently before the Senate contains language under the Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations account of the Natural Resources Conservation Service, NRCS, to utilize Emergency Watershed Protection Program monies to perform rehabilitation of designated dams constructed under the agency's watershed program. Is this correct?
