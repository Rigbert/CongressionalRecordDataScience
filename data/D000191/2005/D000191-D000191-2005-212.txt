Speaker, not too long ago we passed the so-called energy bill here in the House, and tonight we passed the Energy and Water Development appropriations bill. The question that the American people should ask as we head into the Memorial Day weekend is, what has the Republican Congress done to rein in price gouging by the oil industry and the OPEC oil cartel? The answer, if you look at these two bills, is: Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Nada. Zip.  If you would listen to the Republican President from the oil industry, the Republican Vice President rich from the oil industry, and the Republican Congress replete with donations from the oil industry, they are powerless in the face of so-called market forces to do anything about the price gouging of the American people.  Now, if this were really just supply and demand, maybe, maybe you could understand that. But it is a little more than that. The OPEC oil cartel conspires to restrict supply and drive up the price of oil in violation of all the so-called free trade agreements that this Republican Congress and this Republican President say should rule the world.  The World Trade Organization, well, I have asked this President four times now in writing to file a complaint about this illegal activity by the OPEC cartel. It violates the rules of the World Trade Organization, of which this President is such a great fan. Now, why will he not file a complaint? Of seven of the OPEC cartel, six are in the World Trade Organization and one wants to join. Tremendous leverage. File a complaint about their illegal activity. Save the American people from cartels that price-gouge them.  But, no, the President will not do that. Why is that? It is because the oil companies, from which the President has sprung forth, and the Vice President make a lot of money on this.Every time the oil cartels raise the price about two bucks a barrel, well, they take that plus another 10 percent for profit. So the higher the price, the bigger their profit.  If you look at the quarterly statements of the largest oil companies in the world, ExxonMobil and others, they are awash in tens of billions of dollars of cash extracted 10, 20, 30 cents at a time in excess profits from the American people at the pump.  Now, this is hurting real people. But this administration says they are powerless. This Republican Congress says they are powerless. They cannot take on the OPEC cartel. They cannot take on the price-gouging oil industry. They pass so-called energy legislation that says maybe 10, 12, 15 years from now, if there is any oil in ANWR, and if we can pump it, and if they do not take too big of a markup or price gouge on that, it will provide some price relief. That is their answer.  Today, in this bill there was nothing. They could not even adopt the minimalist study of what the OPEC cartel is doing to the American people. That was not allowed by the Republican majority. And they certainly could not allow the amendment that would stop the United States Government from buying from the oil companies at this extortionate price and pumping that oil into the ground for a future crisis.  This is a crisis now, today, for working American men and women, people who have to commute to work in my district by car. Small businesses across this country and big businesses and the airlines are going broke. But this administration says they are powerless, they can do nothing.  Well, guess what? The United States of America can do better, but we just have to get rid of the oil cartel. Not the OPEC oil cartel, but the oil cartel running the United States Congress and the White House and the Vice President's office.                          ____________________[Pages H3879-H3880]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                  OIL INDUSTRY AND OPEC PRICE GOUGING
