President, we need reform of the NSA program but not in this manner. Let's remember why this intelligence tool was put into place. It was enacted in the wake of the worst terrorist attack in our country that took the lives of nearly 3,000 people. We have testimony from the former Director of the FBI and from the former Deputy Director of the CIA telling us that had this tool been in place, it is likely--most likely--that the plot that killed nearly 3,000 people would have been uncovered. Why would we weaken the ability of our intelligence community at a time when the threats against this country have never been greater?  Let me address to my colleagues the privacy issue that has been raised--an issue that all of us care about. These data are far more safe, far more subject to privacy protections if they are held by the Federal Government where only 22 vetted and trained government employees have access to them instead of nearly 150 telecommunications companies that employ thousands of workers, and the government is going to have to go to those companies and ask for the data. That greatly exposes the privacy of individual Americans far more than the current system.  So for both of those reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose the bill of the distinguished Senator from Vermont. It is a mistake. It would make us less safe, and we have expert testimony telling us that.  Thank you, Mr. President.
