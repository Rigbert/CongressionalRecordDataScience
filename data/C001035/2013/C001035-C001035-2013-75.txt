I am pleased to be joined here by my colleague from Maine, Senator King. We have both heard from a number of our constituents in Maine who are concerned about the ambiguity in the bill that is currently before the Senate, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, with regard to the definition of ``agriculture employment'' for the purposes of the proposed W agriculture visa program. I would like to turn to Senator King to elaborate on the concerns that we've heard from constituents in our State.
