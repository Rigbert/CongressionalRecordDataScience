Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time, and I want to commend the chairman, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton), and the ranking member, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Boucher), for bringing this important measure to this body.  I stand in strong support of it and urge my colleagues to think as this bill moves forward how America can, in fact, be energy independent.                              {time}  1845  We are two-thirds dependent on foreign sources of supply, and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve offers us a temporary cushion here at home.  I think, as the bill moves forward in the other body and as compromises are reached, I would urge my colleagues to consider swapping a portion of the oil that is in the reserve for ethanol and biodiesel, or even as new fuel is purchased and there is currently a gap in the reserve of several million barrels, to consider looking at ethanol as one of the ways in which America can become more self-sufficient in fuel production and usage.  I would recommend a level of about 300 million gallons of ethanol and 100 million of biodiesel. Both of these are at competitive prices now if one looks at the market. And even if all of that were purchased and stored on farm, we would still only be looking at 1 to 2 percent of the entire fuel reserve being comprised of these biobased fuels.  In terms of what is happening in rural America today, this is absolutely a way forward for our country. And if one looks at the State of Ohio, we are one of the biggest ethanol users in the Nation. About 40 percent of the additives in our fuels, as opposed to MTBE, is actually comprised of biofuels, ethanol being the leading one.  So I would implore the chairman of the subcommittee and the ranking member, as these discussions proceed in the Senate, to please consider this. It would make economic sense. I think it makes defense sense. It certainly makes energy sense for our country in view of what is happening across our country with farmers facing the necessity of looking at new fuels. This is a wonderful new market.  In addition to that, representing the coal belt of America, from Pennsylvania through the Virginias, through Illinois, and so forth, I would also recommend looking at cleaning up coal and using the methane that can be spun off of that as another additive. I would hope that as these discussions proceed that those in charge of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve would also be looking at energy self-sufficiency for the Nation as an imperative.  I again commend the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Boucher) for this measure and thank him for yielding me the time.
