Speaker, today I am introducing with my colleague on the House Science Committee, Mr. Brown, legislation to reauthorize the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program [NEHRP]. Since its inception in 1977, NEHRP has contributed greatly to what we know about the science of earthquakes as well as to reducing our Nation's vulnerability to earthquakes. Earth science and seismological research performed through NEHRP has produced maps and seismic data from which we can determine seismic risks in a given location. And, NEHRP helped to develop the knowledge base that enables design and construction of new structures that are less likely to collapse during an earthquake.  The bill we are introducing today enables the program to continue its good work in earthquake research and hazards mitigation. Specifically, this legislation authorizes approximately $105 million in fiscal year 1998 and $107 million in fiscal year 1999 for the four NEHRP agencies, the Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA], the United States Geological Survey [USGS], the National Science Foundation [NSF], and the National Institute of Standards and Technology [NIST]. In addition, the bill provides $3 million in each of fiscal years 1998 and 1999 to the USGS for operation of the Global Seismic Network [GSN].  There are several provisions of this legislation which I would like to highlight which we believe will strengthen NERHP and provide for a more robust earthquake science and engineering research infrastructure into the next century: First, the legislation authorizes $8 million specifically for the USGS's external grants programs. This action is consistent with the Science Committee's ongoing efforts to recognize and support external programs within the science agencies. Second, this bill requires the Director of USGS to develop a seismic hazard warning system which will enable our Nation's vital lifelines such as electric utilities, gas lines, and high-speed railroads, to receive warnings in advance of an earthquake. It is hoped that these warnings will be provided in time to shut down the lifelines, thereby guarding against the catastrophic effects that occur when such facilities are ruptured or damaged by earthquakes. Third, this NEHRP reauthorization requires an assessment of regional seismic monitoring networks to determine the state of facilities and equipment. Fourth, the bill authorizes the Director of NSF to use funds to develop earth science teaching materials and to make them available to local schools. Fifth, the legislation directs the Director of USGS to improve hazards assessments of seismic zones in the United States. Sixth, the bill requires the Director of FEMA to assess and report on disaster training capabilities and programs offered by the agency. Seventh, finally, the bill requires the Director of NSF to work with the other NERHP agencies to develop a plan to effectively use earthquake engineering research facilities, which includes upgrading facilities and equipment and integrating innovative testing approaches.  Mr. Speaker, the legislation Mr. Brown and I are introducing today is reflective of the Science Committee's bipartisan efforts on behalf of Federal science and technology programs. The bill is a manifestation of a jointly shared goal to ensure that the Nation has a vital earthquake research enterprise which will continue to greatly contribute to better earthquake awareness, more widespread and effective earthquake mitigation, and ultimately, a reduction in lives and property lost from this hazard.                          ____________________
