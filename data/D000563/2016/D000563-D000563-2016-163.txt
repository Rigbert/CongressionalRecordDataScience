President, I rise to speak as in morning business.                               Zika Virus  Mr. President, the statement just made by the Senate Democratic leader on the Zika challenge to the United States is well documented. What is well documented is that the President of the United States came to Congress 4 months ago and said: We are facing a public health threat. Do something.  For 4 months the Republican-led Congress has done nothing. Meanwhile, the mosquitoes carrying this deadly virus are on the march.  This is a report from the New York Times from last week which I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record in its entirety.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, June 17, 2016]        U.S. Officials Are Surprised by Zika Rate in Puerto Rico                       (By Catherine Saint Louis)       Roughly 1 percent of recent blood donors in Puerto Rico      showed signs of active infection with the Zika virus,      suggesting that a substantial portion of the island's      population will become infected, federal health officials      reported on Friday.       From April 3 to June 11, testing of 12,700 donations at      blood centers in Puerto Rico identified 68 infected donors,      according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.       Over all, about 0.5 percent of donors had active Zika      infections, but the prevalence rose to 1.1 percent in the      week ending June 11. The virus, carried by the yellow fever      mosquito, has been linked to birth defects in infants and      neurological problems in adults.       ``There are a lot more Zika-positive people than we would      anticipate this early'' in the outbreak, said Phillip      Williamson, an author of the C.D.C. report and the vice      president of operations at Creative Testing Solutions, a      blood-donor testing laboratory.       Based on prior experience, Dr. Williamson said he would not      have expected so many Zika-infected donors until late June or      at early July.       The C.D.C. has estimated that as many as a quarter of the      island's 3.5 million people may become infected with the Zika      virus this year.       ``It's possible that thousands of pregnant women in Puerto      Rico could be infected,'' Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the agency's      director, told Reuters on Friday, leading to ``dozens or      hundreds of infants being born with microcephaly in the      coming year.''       Zika-contaminated donations are removed from the blood      supply. In the continental United States, where local      transmission of the virus has yet to be reported, most blood      banks are not yet using the experimental screening test used      in Puerto Rico, which was made by Roche Diagnostics.
