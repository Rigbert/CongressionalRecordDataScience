Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 1776, the American Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act of 2000. This is an important housing measure being debated before us today. My personal background in the real estate industry, I believe, has given me an insider's perspective on this issue and I am confident that this bill will significantly increase the affordability and accessibility of housing.  I understand the importance of affordable family housing to the American dream. Every American family should be given the ability to purchase and own a safe, well built home. I don't think anybody in the chamber would disagree that homeownership is a fundamental component of the American dream.  H.R. 1776 will make that American dream a reality for thousands of families.  One issue of great importance to my constituents in southern California, and others throughout the nation, is that alternative affordable housing be made available. An excellent example of just that has been manufactured housing. These factory-built homes are every bit as reliable as site-built homes, and are becoming increasingly the choice of many Americans.  As cochair of the Manufactured Housing Caucus, I am happy to see the provisions in this bill that seek to update and improve the housing regulations applied to manufactured homes. Particularly, the creation of a consensus committee--comprised of consumers, manufacturers and other housing industry partners--to make sure that the concerns of all parties are addressed. H.R. 1776 will improve the installation standards that protect consumers and provide a dispute resolution program for consumers at no cost.  Mr. Chairman, these new regulations allow the manufactured housing industry to compete fairly and continue to grow. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1776 and homeownership.
