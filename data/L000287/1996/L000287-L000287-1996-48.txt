Mr. Speaker, this morning the Associated Press reported that the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Bill Archer, has sent an intimidating letter to the Internal Revenue Service concerning an investigation the IRS has launched into a partisan political course Newt Gingrich taught at two Georgia colleges.  The IRS has good reason to investigate Speaker Gingrich. Allegations regarding the Speaker's abuse of tax exempt organizations have swirled for more than 2 years.  Mr. Speaker, it is fitting and appropriate for the IRS to investigate the serious allegations of misuse of nonprofit organizations by Speaker Gingrich.Mr. Archer ought to keep his hands off and let the IRS do its job. Not even the chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee can protect the Speaker from the justice he is due.                          ____________________
