 President, I rise today in strong support of a person from my hometown of Louisville, KY, Alice S. Fisher, who has been nominated to be Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division at the Department of Justice.  As I remarked at her confirmation hearing last year, Ms. Fisher is a battle-tested veteran of the war on terror. For the last year, she has again been on the front lines of that struggle.  She has, really, an outstanding and impressive record. She first joined the Justice Department in July of 2001 as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal Division. She was placed in charge of its counterterrorism efforts. Just 2 months later came September 11.  After that horrific day, our Government responded forcefully and quickly. Ms. Fisher's role was absolutely vital to that fight. She was responsible for coordinating all matters related to September 11 investigations and prosecutions. In addition, she headed up the implementation of the USA PATRIOT Act.  As a Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Ms. Fisher also headed up the Department's efforts to combat corporate fraud just when the collapse of Enron and other corporate scandals were front-page news. She also helped draft the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and worked closely with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  In July of 2003, Ms. Fisher left the Department to become a partner at Latham and Watkins, where she concentrated on litigation and white-collar crime.  Last spring, Alice Fisher again answered the call to join her country by rejoining the front lines on the war against terror when the President nominated her to head the Criminal Division.  As I mentioned earlier, the Criminal Division has many important responsibilities, among them national security prosecutions, both counterterrorism and counterintelligence, combatting gang violence and organized crime, prosecuting corporate fraud and identity theft, going after public corruption and protecting kids from child pornography.  For the last year Ms. Fisher has impressively led the Department in all facets of its operations while serving as a recess appointment. In this capacity, she has further demonstrated her expertise, determination and integrity. Alice Fisher is a proven leader.  Under her tenure, the counterterrorism section has convicted numerous terrorists, including Zacarias Moussaoui, the 20th September 11 hijacker. She created a new gang squad of experienced prosecutors to combat national and international gangs such as MS-13. She supervised the Enron task force resulting in the convictions of top executives Ken Lay and Jeffrey Skilling. She heads the Katrina Fraud Task Force which combats all fraud and corruption resulting from this national disaster. As of the end of July, the task force has charged 371 defendants. Under her leadership the Public Integrity Section has prosecuted major public corruption cases.  In addition, since the beginning of her tenure, the Department has aggressively prosecuted crimes against children. It is now coordinating 18 national child pornography operations.  Ms. Fisher was born and raised in my hometown of Louisville, KY, and is part of a close-knit family. Her father ran a chemical plant. Her mother worked the night shift as a nurse. She still has a lot of family back home in Louisville.  She earned her B.A. degree from Vanderbilt University and her law degree from Catholic University. Her husband, Clint, also serves our Nation as the Director of Aviation Policy for TSA. Last, but certainly not least, she is the mother of two boys, Matthew, age nine, and Luke, age five.  In a relatively short time, Alice Fisher has accomplished a great deal. She served her country after the September 11 attacks. She rose to become a partner in one of America's most prestigious law firms, and she then chose to forego a more lucrative career in private practice to come back in and serve her country again.  Alice Fisher knows that every day she works on behalf of her country she is working to build a stronger and safer America for her two children and for all of ours. Thanks to her, America is a safer place than it was on September 11, 2001.  A man who held the job for which Ms. Fisher has been nominated is her old boss, Michael Chertoff, a pretty good lawyer in his own right. Alice earned praise when he called her ``one of the best lawyers I've seen in my entire career.''  America needs Alice Fisher to be confirmed as the next Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division. I look forward to her confirmation. She is a wonderful person, an accomplished lawyer, and a Kentuckian of whom all America can be proud.  She has support from a number of groups I will make reference to, including the support of the Fraternal Order of Police, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association and the National District Attorneys Association. I ask unanimous consent those letters of endorsement be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 National District                                        Attorneys Association,                                  Alexandria, VA, August 17, 2006.     Hon. Arlen Specter,     Chairman Committee on the Judiciary,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Specter and Senator Leahy: I want to most      strongly support the nomination of Alice Fisher as the      Assistant Deputy Attorney General of the United States in      charge of the Criminal Division and urge her speedy      confirmation.       Ms. Fisher served her country well as the Deputy Assistant      General in the Criminal Division during a unique and tragic      time in this nation's history. During the period following      September 11, 2001, Ms. Fisher was responsible for managing      the Counter-Terrorism Section and worked on the development      of policy issues on criminal law enforcement and national      security.       Since her appointment as Assistant Attorney General in the      Criminal Division she has been responsible for the Department      of Justice's response to Hurricane Katrina and the aftermath      of widespread fraud; the development of a strategic plan to      address the burgeoning identity theft problem that confronts      this nation; child sexual exploitation issues; corporate      fraud; and public corruption issues.       Prior to Ms. Fisher's career in the Department of Justice      she also served Congress in her capacity as Deputy Special      Counsel to the United States Senate Special Committee to      investigate the Whitewater Development and Related Matters.       Given Ms. Fisher's experience in both the legislative and      executive branches of government and her exhibited level of      commitment to the Department of Justice I can think of no one      who would bring more ability to this position than she would.       If you have any questions or concerns in regard to my      support of Ms. Fisher please do not hesitate to contact me.           Sincerely,                                                Thomas J. Charron,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                            Grand Lodge, Fraternal                                              Order of Police,                                   Washington, DC, August 1, 2006.     Hon. Arlen Specter,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Ranking Member, Committee to the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman and Senator Leahy: I am writing on behalf      of the membership of the Fraternal Order of Police to advise      you of our support for Alice S. Fisher to be continued as the      next Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division at      the U.S. Department of Justice.       For more than one year, Ms. Fisher has served as Assistant      Attorney General for the Criminal Division as a recess      appointment. She has diligently served in this role and has      coordinated with law enforcement on a variety of issues,      including antiterrorism prosecutions, public corruption      cases, and child sex exploitation cases. Prior to this, Ms.      Fisher served as Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the      Criminal Division at the U.S. Department of Justice and was      responsible for managing both the Counterterrorism and Fraud      Sections at the Department. During her tenure, she was      responsible for coordinating the Department's national      counter-terrorism activities, including all matters relating      to September 11th investigations and prosecutions, terrorist      financing investigations, and the implementation of the USA      PATRIOT Act.       Her management of the Fraud Section included supervising      many investigations into corporate fraud, particularly in the      areas of securities, accounting, and health care. She worked      on a variety of policy matters relating to identity theft and      testified before the Senate Special Committee on Aging about      the impact of these crimes on our nation's senior citizens.       Currently Ms. Fisher's management of the Innocence Lost      Initiative, a cooperative effort to prevent and prosecute      child prostitution between the FBI, the Criminal Division's      Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section and the National      Center for Missing and Exploited Children, has led to 188      open investigations, 547 arrests, 79 complaints, 105      indictments, and 80 convictions in both the Federal and State      systems.       Ms. Fisher's experience as a litigator and policy-maker, as      well as her strong, positive relationship with the law      enforcement community, makes her an excellent choice to lead      the Criminal Division. The F.O.P. has no doubt that she will      continue to be an outstanding Assistant Attorney General, and      we urge the Judiciary Committee to expeditiously approve her      nomination. If I can provide any further recommendations for      Ms. Fisher, please do not hesitate to contact me or Executive      Director Jim Pasco in my Washington office.           Sincerely,                                                 Chuck Canterbury,     National President.                                  ____                                           Federal Law Enforcement                                         Officers Association,                                  Lewisberry, PA, August 31, 2006.     Hon. Harry Reid,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Reid: On behalf of the 25,000 members of the      Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA), I am      writing to you in support of the nomination of Alice S.      Fisher for the position of Assistant Attorney General of the      Criminal Division of the Department of Justice. Since her      nomination easily cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee in      May, we are now appealing to you in your leadership role as      the Senate Minority Leader to intervene and help bring this      important matter to the floor of the Senate for a full vote.       It our understanding that this process has stalled due to      the unfortunate invocation of partisan politics. As the      largest non partisan professional federal law enforcement      association, FLEOA would like to see Ms. Fisher's nomination      evaluated based on its merit. To that end, the membership of      FLEOA is convinced that Ms. Fisher's impressive credentials      would result in her being confirmed should the matter reach      the floor of the Senate.       Why is this matter important to the membership of FLEOA?      Several of our members have had the distinct pleasure of      working with Ms. Fisher, or have served on one of the many      task forces she oversees. Two notable examples are the      Katrina Fraud Task Force and the President's Identity Theft      Task Force. When you ask one our members about their      experience working with Ms. Fisher, the typical response is      an enthusiastic thumbs-up. Ms. Fisher has earned the      reputation as a tireless proponent of federal law      enforcement, and she commands the respect of our membership.       In her capacity as the Deputy Attorney General, Ms. Fisher      did an outstanding job leading the Enron Task Force. Again,      several FLEOA members who were involved in the Enron      investigation have nothing but the highest praise for Ms.      Fisher. A logical person that objectively reviews Ms.      Fisher's long resume of distinguished accomplishments can      only reach one conclusion: her confirmation as the Assistant      Attorney General for the Criminal Division will significantly      strengthen the law enforcement component of our nation.       While the threat of domestic terrorist attacks continues to      escalate, time does not take pause to accommodate indecision.      If we sit back and allow Ms. Fisher's recess appointment to      expire, then we become complicit in weakening the Department      of Justice. This is unacceptable to the membership of FLEOA.       We have reached a pivotal point in our government's history      where it has become increasingly difficult to recruit and      retain the best and the brightest minds to assume leadership      positions. If we don't make every effort to confirm the      nomination of Ms. Fisher, then who do we expect to get to      fill these important positions? More importantly, who will      the Attorney General have to turn to for assistance in      initiating and overseeing numerous federal law enforcement      task forces?       Senator Reid, the membership of FLEOA hopes that you will      consider the nomination of Ms. Fisher a priority matter. We      are prepared to provide you with additional recommendations      and anecdotal support if necessary. Please don't hesitate to      contact me or Executive Vice President Jon Adler if we can be      of further assistance. On behalf of the FLEOA membership, I      thank you for your leadership and your service to our great      country.           Sincerely,                                                       Art Gordon,                                               National President.  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.
