President, I rise today to recognize the accomplishments of a Vermont business and civic leader who is retiring today. Kenneth J. Leenstra is leaving as the president of General Dynamics Armament Systems in Burlington, VT. Over the past 35 years, he held several management positions at General Electric, Lockheed-Martin, and most recently at General Dynamics.  Ken oversaw the Burlington plant through the defense drawdown after the end of the cold war. It was a difficult time for the workers, and for managers like Ken who struggled to keep his plant efficient while orders dwindled. Through it all, Ken was dedicated to developing solutions that met the needs of his customers, and on maintaining a commitment to quality that meant that Burlington-made products were second to none. His commitment to quality earned his business numerous awards that are widely recognized across the defense industry.  On behalf of his many friends in the Burlington area, I want to express my thanks to Ken and his family and wish him the very best as he embarks on his retirement.                          ____________________
