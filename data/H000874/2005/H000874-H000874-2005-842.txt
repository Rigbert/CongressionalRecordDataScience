Speaker, today I rise to submit for the Record the compelling statement of Linda Howard Garrett who gave the valedictory address at the Ann Arundel Community College Commencement Ceremony on May 26, 2005.  Linda is a wonderful and inspiring example of someone who has the will and perseverance to make a brighter future for themselves and their family. Her determination and persistence to go back to school later in life shows that it is never too late to pursue the ``American Dream'' and succeed!  I was proud to join Linda at Anne Arundel Community College's Commencement and am pleased to submit her address for the Record.              Valedictory Address by Linda Howard Garrett       ``Good evening, President Smith, Congressman Hoyer,      Trustees, honored guests, faculty, staff, friends and      families, classmates.       If anyone had told me 2 years ago that I would be standing      here tonight, I would have stared in disbelief. It was with      great trepidation that I returned to school after 37 years,      and I wasn't sure I would succeed, much less excel. And yet      here I am--here we all are because of our hard work and      dedication to a goal.       Many people have asked me what motivated me to work so hard      and to remain so dedicated, and as I began to think about      that question, I realized there were several answers.       It helped to know that I was enrolled in one of the premier      paralegal studies programs in the country, and attending Ann      Arundel--a shining star in the Nation's network of community      colleges.       Of course there was my family who inspired me by their      unflagging support--especially my 14-year-old daughter who      temporarily relinquished her self-proclaimed position as      center of the universe and willingly assumed more      responsibility at home because I had a test scheduled or a      paper due.       And the professors who gave so generously of their time and      talents: Professors Kelly Koermer, Robyn Brown, Karen Cook,      Mona Clark, Stanley Robbins, Susan Kilgard, Richard      Faircloth, Sarah Glenn, Cathy Hayes, Sherry Hopkins, Wade      Taylor. I could go on and on as I'm sure each of you could as      you remember those dedicated teachers who were a profound      influence on you.       Sometimes it was a staff member--like Miss Ina in the      Florestano student lounge my first year. Even though she      wasn't officially scheduled to open until 8:30, she was there      every morning at least an hour early, dispensing hot coffee      and encouragement.       Often, it was a classmate: the student older than I--in his      seventies--still seeking knowledge and growth and      intellectual stimulation. Or the 18-year-old who took the      earliest classes available so she could hurry home to care      for her ailing mother. And all of the amazing single parents      juggling families and full-time jobs and still managing to      attend every class, turning in every assignment on time.       But perhaps the most compelling influence was a sense of      history and an appreciation for what many Americans take for      granted. I gained that appreciation while serving for 26      years with the U.S. Army. During that time I had the      opportunity to travel all over the world--from the Far East      to East Berlin. And the more I saw of the world, the more I      came to value the freedoms and opportunities that are      uniquely American. And at no time did I feel that      appreciation more than during a visit to Ellis Island.       Over a hundred years, ago, immigrants poured into this      country seeking a better life. And they weren't satisfied to      just be in America. They wanted to be Americans, and that      meant that they had to learn a new language and a new history      so they could pass a citizenship test. They sought out      classes wherever they could find them--in church basements      and elementary school classrooms and community halls.       So when it seemed he too much effort for me to write      another brief, or struggle to learn the arcane vocabulary of      the law or drag myself to one more early class, I would      remember those immigrants who, after working backbreaking 12-     , 14-, 16-hour days, went willingly, joyfully to class      because they understood that every step toward that classroom      brought them one step closer to realizing the American Dream.      And when I remembered them, I could not dishonor their memory      by turning in shoddy work or failing to fully embrace the      opportunity their legacy provided because from those humble      beginnings an entire system of adult education evolved.      Single scattered classes became     night school and then City College and junior college and      finally the community college, as we know it today.       And although at one time the classes at one of these local      colleges was considered less prestigious than at the four      year colleges, that is no longer true today. In response to a      growing need, as community colleges' facilities and curricula      expanded, so did their reputations. Today, while community      colleges continue to serve those who, because of families and      jobs, need to stay close to home, they also serve those who      recognize that many community colleges provide specialized      programs that rival those available at four-year      universities.       I hope that everyone of you as you go forward will also      look back and remember that you are carrying the torch for      all those educators and students whose commitment and vision      made today's community college a reality. And I hope you will      tell all of your friends and families and neighbors that the      first step toward realizing the American dream begins with an      education, and that a first-class, top-notch education is      accessible in their backyards, right here at Ann Arundel      Community College. I hope that you will never take for      granted the history of freedom and opportunity that mad it      possible for you to take that step. And I hope, as you go      forward, that you will never miss the opportunity to say,      with great pride, as I say tonight, I am a graduate of Ann      Arundel Community College.''                          ____________________
