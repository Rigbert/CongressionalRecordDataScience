Speaker, I rise to congratulate the College of Southern Maryland on its sixtieth anniversary. I join in thanking President Maureen Murphy, faculty, staff, students, and alumni on this milestone. Recognized by the 2019 Aspen Prize as one of the top 150 community colleges in the nation, the College of Southern Maryland provides thousands of students with pathways to successful careers.  Founded as the Charles County Community College in 1958, its first classes met in the evenings at La Plata High School. A decade later, the College's La Plata campus opened its doors, and branches were launched to serve St. Mary's and Calvert Counties in the years that followed. Its name change to the College of Southern Maryland in 2000 reflected a growing regional institution of higher learning. Now, as it begins its seventh decade serving the community, the College provides a broad range of associate degrees, certifications, skills training courses, and wellness programs.  Always adapting to meet the educational challenges of its day, the College continues to adopt new technologies to further its mission. It now offers twelve fully online degree programs and is committed to continued innovation in the design and implementation of curricula. The College has stayed true to its foundational principles of diversity, affordability, accessibility, and forging innovative partnerships that benefit students. More than sixty academic institutions have partnered with the College of Southern Maryland to offer guaranteed transfer admission to its graduates who complete their associate's degrees and meet other criteria.  I've been proud over the years to support the work of the College of Southern Maryland, including by securing $497,000 for its Nursing and Allied Health Care Training and Technology program in 2008 and $468,000 for its STEM Workforce Initiative in 2009. I was happy to be on hand when the clinical nursing lab was opened in 2010 as well as to help facilitate a U.S. Department of Labor grant of $1.5 million in 2012 for the College's program to teach juvenile offenders in-demand job skills for success in the workforce after their release. For the past six decades, the College has lived up to its vision of ``transforming lives through lifelong learning and service'', and I look forward to working with President Murphy and the entire College of Southern Maryland community to ensure that it can continue to do so.                          ____________________
