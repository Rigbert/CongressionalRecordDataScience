Speaker, before I yield the balance of my time back, it has been an honor and a pleasure to work with the chairman, the chairman of the subcommittee, and all of the Members on the other side. We did come together in a bipartisan fashion.  In a real sense, we all live in the same house--the American house--and we must continue to look out for this house, not just this building, but the more than 300 million people in our country. That is the right thing to do. That is the fair thing to do. That is the just thing to do.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
