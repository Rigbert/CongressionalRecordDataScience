Ninety-nine Senators agree to pass it and only 1 is objecting. It requires a rollcall vote when we come back in November. I hope we can have that rollcall vote perhaps in a timely rotation. And with 99 Senators who say they support it, the 1 Senator who has been blocking it can vote against it. But those of us who have been in law enforcement know how important it is.  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.
