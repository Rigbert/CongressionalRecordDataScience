 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by a high school student from Vermont, who was speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security      of a free state. The right of the people to keep and bear      arms shall not be infringed. That is the Second Amendment in      its entirety.       The Second Amendment was one of the first amendments to be      ratified being part of the Bill of Rights and is also the      shortest and arguably the vaguest of all amendments in the      constitution. Despite all of the discussions surrounding the      issue, it is still not clear precisely what the amendment      means.       The Second Amendment grew out of a law passed by British      Parliament during the latter period of the Colonial era. The      law effectively prohibited any colonist from possessing a      firearm of any kind so as to prevent any possibility of      rebellion. Eventually, of course, the colonists disregarded      that law, overthrew the British and set up their own nation.      Later once the Revolutionary War had been won and the United      States was relatively secure in its status as an independent      country, the founding fathers decided that it was necessary      to formally allow the people a means of defense against the      government.       One of the founding principles of the Revolution had been      that the people had the right to overthrow the government if      they believed it to be unworthy. One of the most effective      means to overthrow the government was, of course, with      firearms and so the Second Amendment was born.       Since the Second Amendment mentions the militia      specifically, one would assume that the right to keep and      bear arms relates specifically to the militia and that the      intended meaning of the Second Amendment was that the people      have the right to use arms as members of the militia in order      to protect themselves from tyrannical governments.       On the other hand, if one considers the state of the world      in 1791 when the Second Amendment was ratified, the notion of      the founding fathers allowing exclusively members of state      militias to bear arms seemed ridiculous. Most people in the      18th Century needed firearms in order to survive because most      food needed to be hunted. Personal firearms were a necessity      for survival and yet in today's society with cheap hamburger      in every supermarket and good steak in every expensive      restaurant, firearms are no longer necessary for survival.      Therefore, one of the original reasons for the Second      Amendment has perhaps been outlived.       What then is the use of the Second Amendment? I believe      that the Second Amendment's relevance in today's world      pertains to     the militia. It is essential for the survival of American      ideals that Americans have the right to overthrow corrupt      government. That was one of the main principles behind the      Second Amendment, that Americans should be allowed to possess      firearms in order to defend themselves as members of state      militias.       Regardless of the intentions of the Second Amendment, the      wording itself is rather vague. It does not specifically      state in the Bill of Rights the extent to which firearms      should be allowed. Therefore, it seems that simply from      reading the Bill of Rights and without accounting for other      factors, the possession of firearms can be limited although      not prohibited altogether.       It is also important to remember that the Constitution was      written with the awareness that it would be changed, that as      the world progressed, new issues would become important and      old issues would become less important.       We have repealed an amendment before and while I do not      necessarily advocate repealing the Second Amendment, the      amendments to the Constitution are not set in stone and if      times change, the Constitution ought to change with it.      Perhaps it is time to rethink the issue of gun freedom. Is      the possession of a firearm a general necessity? Is the      private possession of a handgun ever necessary? And, most      importantly, do the risks of gun freedom outweigh the      benefits?                               ____________________
