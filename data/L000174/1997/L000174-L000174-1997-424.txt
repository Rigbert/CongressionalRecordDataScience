As I referred to just before the Senator came on the floor, one of those amendments was, of course, to repeal an earlier amendment.  Mr. President, I see my friend from North Dakota and my friend from West Virginia on the floor. I will yield the floor with this.  When we started off in this Congress, each one of us swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution. That is our duty--all of us--to those who forged this great document. It is our responsibility to those who sacrificed to protect and defend our Constitution. It is our commitment to our constituents. It is the legacy to those who will succeed us just as it is showing our responsibility to those who stood up before us.  Mr. President, we talk about our children. My children will live most of their lives in this next century. I want them to have a constitution they can be proud of, not a constitution that fell, injured by momentary political passions.  I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from North Dakota.
