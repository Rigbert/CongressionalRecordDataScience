The bill affects no pending or decided cases except to the extent that courts have exempted major league baseball clubs from the antitrust laws in their dealings with major league players. In fact, Section 3 of the legislation makes clear that the law is unchanged with regard to issues such as relocation. The bill has no impact on the recent decisions in federal and state courts in Florida, Pennsylvania and Minnesota concerning baseball's status under the antitrust laws.
