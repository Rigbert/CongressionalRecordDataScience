 President, unless there is a resurrection that occurs here, talking in metaphorical terms, there is no possibility that the President will sign the bill with your amendment in it or not--zero, none, no possibility. I have been told that by the White House. There is not enough money, there is not enough time, there is not enough ingenuity and enough anything to make this bill palatable to the President, in just talking about the criminal justice side of things.  So I think the majority leader is absolutely, positively correct. I think we should do a managers' amendment on a few of the major chunks of the bill and get on with the show. This really is an exercise in futility.
