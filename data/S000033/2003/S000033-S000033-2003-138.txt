 Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Chairman, today we live in an age of exploding technological advances. Many of these new technologies offer the potential to improve the lives of people in the United States and around the world.  But, Mr. Chairman, some of this new technology also has the potential to do great harm to our people and to our environment. All too often, these dangers are magnified because the owners of technology are primarily interested in how much money they can make, rather than the betterment of society.  We have seen this in the area of genetically modified organisms that are finding their way into our food supply in the U.S. The legislation we are considering today concerns an even more important issue; namely, the cloning of human life itself. While I support stem cell research, the cloning of a human being for any purpose raises the deepest and most profound ethical and moral questions: questions about the sanctity or the uniqueness of each human person; questions about the evil of eugenics and genetic engineering in humans; and, equally important, questions about the ownership and use of cloned humans by an unregulated corporate biotechnology industry motivated almost exclusively by their quest for venture capital, short-term profits, and higher stock prices.  The speed with which human cloning technology has developed thus far has far outpaced our abilities as a society to wrestle with these questions.  Mr. Chairman, technology should not drive ethics and morality in this country and on this planet; ethics and morality should frame the acceptable limits of our use of technology. That is why I strongly support H.R. 534, which would ban all human cloning.
