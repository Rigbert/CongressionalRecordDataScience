The letter very forcefully, very eloquently makes the case why the interests of public health are not served by giving big tobacco further special legal protection. They write:       Special legal protections for tobacco are unfair      to patients and their families.  They write further:       Special legal protections for tobacco are bad for public      health, especially children's health.  They write:       Special legal protections for tobacco are undeserved.  And they write:       If passed, the special legal protections in the Commerce      Committee bill would be the biggest corporate giveaway in      history.  And then they say:       For the sake of public health and children's health, for      the sake of the people who are already sick and for those who      will become sick, and for the sake of holding the industry      accountable for its actions, we urge you to strip the special      legal protections from the bill.  I agree with Dr. Koop. I agree with Dr. Kessler. I agree that first and foremost we should protect the people of this country. We should protect the health of the people of this country. We should protect the children of this country. And we should not be giving special limits on legal liability to big tobacco.  I disagree with the position of the White House in trying to allow special legal protection and special immunity for the tobacco companies.  Yesterday, the President wrote to the Senate leaders that:       If a cap that doesn't prevent anybody from suing the      companies and getting whatever damages a jury awards will get      tobacco companies to stop marketing cigarettes to kids, then      it is well worth it for the American people.  Everybody agrees with that. What doesn't come out in the President's letter is this bill does have provisions that will prevent some parties from suing the tobacco industry. It does cap the total annual payments for the tobacco industry. The liability cap may very well affect the payment of future jury awards to tobacco victims.  So, I disagree with the White House and I disagree with those on both sides of the aisle who would limit some of the liability of the tobacco companies. If the tobacco companies hadn't faced unlimited liability for their actions, we would not even be here today. If the tobacco companies hadn't known that they could be sued, and sued successfully, they never would have admitted some of the things that have now come out. If the tobacco companies had not faced this, we never would have found out the years that they had lied. We never would have found out the internal memos where they were targeting 14-year-olds. We never would have found out even such things as their efforts to make cigarette placements in all kinds of movies, including, of all things, the ``Muppet Movie.'' These are things that we have found out only because they face that liability.  I concur with the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire. I am opposed to limiting liability. With that, I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1                                     Advisory Committee on Tobacco                                     Policy and Public Health,                                                     May 20, 1998.       Dear Senator Gregg and Senator Leahy: We are writing to      endorse and support the Gregg-Leahy amendment to S. 1415 to      eliminate all special liability protections for tobacco      companies. We wish you success and would urge your colleagues      to join with you in this effort.       Special legal protections for tobacco are unfair to      patients and their families.       Millions of Americans are now sick with tobacco-related      illnesses. Millions more will become sick in the future.      These are people who started to smoke at a time when the      tobacco industry lied about its products, hid scientific      studies, and shredded documents. Most of these people started      to smoke when they were children whom the industry targeted      for special marketing. To protect the industry now would      leave many of these patients, their families, and their      survivors without remedy.       Special legal protections for tobacco are bad for public      health, especially children's health.       Court oversight in the historic Minnesota suit led to the      disclosure of thousands of documents about the addictiveness      of nicotine and about the industry's plans to market to      children. Other legal actions have resulted in consent      decrees that will cut back on Big Tobacco's seduction of new      young smokers. Under the Commerce Committee bill, these state      and local suits would be impossible.       Special legal protections for tobacco are undeserved.       The tobacco industry has proven itself to be an      irresponsible corporate citizen. Extending protection to this      industry would be to subsidize and condone these activities.      No other industry, no matter how valuable to the Nation, has      such protections. We should not extend them to an industry      whose product that serves only to kill Americans prematurely.       The Senate should not provide special legal protections for      tobacco.       If an American jury finds tobacco companies owe damages,      the Senate should not overturn that verdict.       If the most skilled lawyers that money can buy cannot get      the tobacco industry out of court, the Senate should not      become its defenders.       If passed, the special protections contained in the      Commerce Committee bill would be the biggest corporate      giveaway in history.       For the sake of public health and children's health, for      the sake of the people who are already sick and those who      will become sick, and for the sake of holding the industry      accountable for its actions, we urge you to strip the special      legal protections from the bill.           Sincerely,     C. Everett Koop, M.D.     David A. Kessler, M.D.
