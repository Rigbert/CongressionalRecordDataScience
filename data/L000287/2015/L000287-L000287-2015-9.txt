Speaker, I want to thank my friend Mr. McGovern for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I must tell you, my heart is heavy. I am saddened by what has happened here in America. I thought that we have come much farther--much farther--along.  Growing up in rural Alabama, attending school in Nashville, Tennessee, now living in Georgia, I have seen the signs that said White and Colored--White men, Colored men, White women, Colored women, White waiting, Colored waiting.  During the sixties, during the height of the civil rights movement, we broke those signs down. They are gone. The only place that we will see those signs today will be in a book, in a museum, or on a video. If a descendant of Jefferson Davis could admit the Confederate battle flag is a symbol of hate and division, why can't we do it here? Why can't we move to the 21st century?  Racism is a disease. We must free ourselves of the way of hate, the way of violence, the way of division. We are not there yet. We have not yet created a beloved community where we respect the dignity and the worth of every human being.  We need to bring down the flag. The scars and stains of racism are still deeply and very embedded in every corner of American society. I don't want to see our little children--whether they are Black, White, Latino, Asian American, or Native American--growing upand seeing these signs of division, these signs of hate.
