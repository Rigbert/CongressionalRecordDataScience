Speaker, last Thursday, March 14, 1996, I inadvertently voted in favor of the Watt amendment which would have stricken the antiterrorism bill's--H.R. 2703--habeas corpus provisions. This was rollcall vote No. 64.  I wish to express on the record that I had intended to vote in opposition to the Watt amendment. I strongly favor limiting the ability of State death-row and other prisoners to challenge in Federal court the constitutionality of their sentences.                          ____________________
