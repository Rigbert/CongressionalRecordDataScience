 I want to also thank him for the work that he has done on the Visa Waiver Program. His staff and my staff and the staff on Homeland Security on both sides of the aisle and the staff on the Judiciary Committee on both sides of the aisle, including the leaders on both sides, have worked very hard.  I think we have come up with a bipartisan effort to keep America safer while at the same time providing for access to people who do not pose a threat to America or to Americans.  I thank him for his leadership on that. I am pleased to have had the opportunity to work with him, and I look forward to the bill's passing with big majorities next week. So I thank him for that.  Mr. Leader, there is indication that the appropriation bills, or the omnibus, as we are now calling it, will come to the floor. Can the leader tell me whether or not we are making any progress on riders?  Obviously, as I understand it, essentially, we have agreement on the allocation of the dollars, which of course is the responsibility of the Appropriations Committee, and that is what they do.  Clearly, we seem to be having difficulty with the so-called riders--that is, additions to the appropriations bill--which accomplish legislative objectives either through a ``none of the funds'' provision or a legislative provision which would require a waiver.  Does the gentleman know whether or not we are making progress on eliminating riders that are controversial so that we can move the bill in a bipartisan fashion next week?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  As the gentleman knows, negotiations are ongoing. The appropriators are working hard in trying to wrap up the bill, and I will advise the Members as soon as action is scheduled in the House.
