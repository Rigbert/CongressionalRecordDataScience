President, the majority leader came to the floor this evening and asked for permission to move to four pending amendments on the health care bill and it was not given. The Republican leader objected. We are hoping to renew that unanimous consent request tomorrow so we can wrap up the Omnibus appropriations bill and move quickly back to debate on the health care bill. I am hoping we can do that, in the interests of moving through some of the important amendments now pending.  We expect two votes tomorrow on motions to waive points of order with respect to the consolidated appropriations conference report. Those votes should require 60 affirmative votes. Senators will be notified when votes are scheduled. Senators should also be prepared for votes Saturday morning.                          ____________________
