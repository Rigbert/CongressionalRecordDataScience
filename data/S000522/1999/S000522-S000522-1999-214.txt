Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley) for his good, strong statement and for his work on this resolution.  Let me close very briefly. British justifications for not having an independent inquiry were further undercut by the Northern Ireland Independent Commission on Police Complaints, which expressed doubts that the RUC could objectively address Mrs. Nelson's earlier allegations of police harassment and threats.  The commission, after initially watching the RUC's investigation of itself, concluded that the RUC did not inspire confidence. The commission noted the need for independence and referred the matter to the metropolitan police in London for investigation even before Mrs. Nelson's tragic murder.  That referral report has leaked out since Mrs. Nelson's murder, and it is a scathing indictment of the RUC and its indifference to her safety. For example, the report says that of the RUC officers involved in the investigation, that there was, ``observable hostility, evasiveness and disinterest. One officer attended the interview 45 minutes late without explanation and smelled of alcohol.''  It is time now to act independently, to encourage real independence in this investigation and Pat Finucane and for protection of all the defense attorneys in Northern Ireland. That is why this resolution sends that clear message to the British.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Gejdenson).
