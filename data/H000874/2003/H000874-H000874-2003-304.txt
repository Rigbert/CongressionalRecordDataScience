Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. A question was posed and unanswered. We can wait for an answer, if my colleagues have one.  Is there no answer to the question?  Apparently, there is no answer, I tell the gentlewoman from Connecticut, to the question she posed. Let me tell her and my colleagues why.  Mr. Speaker, yesterday syndicated columnist Arianna Huffington, no Democrat and no liberal, and very wealthy, said this in the Los Angeles Times, and I quote: ``A magnetic compass always points north; a moral compass should always point out that heaping billions on the rich while ensuring that one out of six American children do not get a penny is dead wrong.''  Dead wrong. Arianna Huffington. Not the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), not the Democrats, not those fuzzy-headed liberals my Republican colleagues like to talk about, but Arianna Huffington. She continued: ``But that's exactly what congressional Republicans did in pushing through tax cut legislation last month, and that's what President Bush signed off on.'' Arianna Huffington.  Mr. Speaker, America now knows that the GOP's moral compass lies shattered on the conference room floor where the final deals on the Republican tax bill were cut 2 weeks ago.  Why did the majority leader leave the floor? The majority leader left the floor because he used an example just above the $28,000, where he would have been wrong. My colleagues, the moral compass is absent.  There was a report that showed that the policies in 2001 and 2003 are leading to a $44.4 trillion deficit. Who did that? Two people in the Bush administration asked to do that report and OMB. And guess what? They stonewalled the report. Why? Because they did not want the magnitude of the debt tax that we are imposing on every American family known while at the same time, when they had no lobbyist in that hall, those 12 million children, who did not have somebody highly paid to sit in that hallway and say do not cut us, found themselves cut out of the bill that in the still and dark of the night, with no Democrats present, was brought out to this floor, pages and pages of bill, with minutes to review it.  Arianna Huffington is correct. Shame, shame, shame.  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remaining 30 seconds. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so that we can help millions of children and working families. We have heard the other side defend the indefensible.                              {time}  1500  Mr. Speaker, if they do not want to help millions of working families, they should at least have the guts to go on record as voting no instead of hiding behind procedures. So let this House work its will. Let us have a little democracy in this Chamber. Vote on the previous question so we can bring up the Rangel bill and literally help millions of children in this country.Working Families Tax Credit Act of 2003--Summary of H.R. 2286, June 4,                                   2003       Republicans have left moderate-income families behind in      their zeal to cut taxes on millionaires, contrary to their      ``leave no child behind'' rhetoric.       H.R. 2286 helps moderate-income working families and is      revenue neutral.                               provisions       Provides Child Credit to More Working Families: Lowers to      $7,500 (from $10,500) the amount of the wages a family must      have before refundability of the child credit begins. This is      identical to a provision that was included in the house      Democratic alternative on the economic stimulus legislation.      The credit would be allowed for approximately 19 million      additional children by reason of this change.       Increases Benefit for Working Families: Increases partial      refundability from 10 percent of wages to 15 percent of      wages. Again, this is identical to a provision that was      included in the Democratic alternative. This would result in      an average credit increase of over $300 per child.       Helps Families of Soldiers in Combat: Allows refundability      for families of soldiers in combat zones even though combat      wages are not taxed.       Speeds up Marriage Penalty Relief for Lower Income Working      Couples: Makes effective immediately the marriage penalty      relief in the Earned Income Tax Credit that was provided in      the 2001 tax cut. This is the only marriage penalty relief      not accelerated in the recently enacted tax bill.       Does Not Increase the Deficit: Closes corporate loopholes:      prohibits tax shelters, and taxes corporations that move      headquarters offshore (expatriates).  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the amendment and description of the amendment be printed in the Record immediately before the vote on the previous question.
