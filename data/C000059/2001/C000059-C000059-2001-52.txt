Speaker, I am honored today to pay tribute to Dickey DeLoss as she is presented with the Gold Key Award from Soroptimist International of Riverside on April 24th. In my congressional district of Riverside, California, we are fortunate to have men and women that not only unselfishly give their time and talents to the community but find their own lives enriched in return. Dickey DeLoss epitomizes this and more.  Soroptimist International of the Americas, a volunteer service organization for women, was formed in 1921 with a simple mission--to ``make a difference for women.'' Members represent a wide array of professions, including doctors, attorneys, teachers, chief executive officers, business owners and government officials. The group's name comes from two Latin words meaning ``best for women.''  Dickey DeLoss, as a Soroptimist, has unquestionably become a leader of women in her community. Her service began more than 20 years ago. Since then, Dickey has given tirelessly, engaging in awareness, advocacy and action through an incredible array of community life, including volunteering with: Alternatives to Domestic Violence, Deaf Awareness Commission, Evergreen Cemetery, County of Riverside-Division on Student Programs, Law Enforcement Policy Commission, YWCA, Youth Accountability Board and Human Relations Commission for the City of Riverside.  As a realtor since 1967 and broker since 1969, Dickey has led the way for women in the Inland Empire and received countless awards and recognitions. In fact, she became only the second woman in the 20 year history of the Riverside Board of Realtors to be President in 1975 and was the first woman president of the Magnolia Center Chamber of Commerce. Dickey was honored as California ``Woman of the Year'' in 1995 and has received over 73 other awards.  Mr. Speaker, volunteers are critical to fostering a spirit of understanding, good citizenship and good government in the United States and worldwide. The women of Soroptimist International of Riverside exemplify this by offering young women role models, thereby assuring that an active interest in the civic, culture, social and moral welfare of our communities is passed on from generation to generation. I congratulate Dickey DeLoss on her award and commend her for her work within the community.                          ____________________
