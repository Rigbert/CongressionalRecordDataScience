President, this morning I rise in support of the Workforce Investment Partnership Act. This bill was unanimously passed out of the Labor and Human Resources Committee. It is good and sensible legislation, crafted in a bipartisan fashion. I commend Subcommittee Chairman DeWine and Senator Wellstone as well as Chairman Jeffords and Ranking Member Kennedy for their excellent leadership. There is one section in this legislation of particular importance to me; one that I believe merits special attention. If this body is successful in passing S. 1886, this program will benefit greatly. The section I am referring to is Job Corps.  Job Corps is America's only national residential education and training program for at risk youths. I emphasize only, Mr. President, because my colleagues need to be aware that there is no other program that annually assists more than 65,000 of this country's most disadvantaged young men and women to become meaningful and productive members of society. Job Corps is the largest and most comprehensive program that offers a second chance to those who would otherwise be left behind. The young men and women who make a commitment to themselves and the Job Corps program deserve our support. This program ensures them access to educational and vocational training, fully preparing them to meet the needs of this country's employers. Indeed, a recent survey of small businesses indicated that a lack of trained employees is the largest current impediment to business growth. As a result, the Job Corps program provides invaluable assistance not only to disadvantaged youth, but also to employers and the host communities of Job Corps centers, which benefit from community service projects completed by students.  This bill represents a comprehensive Congressional effort to enhance all components of the Job Corps program. Great pains have been taken to create a continuum from the day a Job Corps student is recruited into the program to the day that student starts his or her job, and beyond.  Mr. President, let me take a minute to expand on these improvements. Job Corps has been and continues to be a model for other education and training programs. The placement rate of the program is phenomenal: this year over 80% of Job Corps graduates will be placed in good paying jobs, enter the military, or go onto post-secondary education. The performance measurement standards of Job Corps have long been praised for being thorough and rigorous. These demanding standards have stimulated the program's ongoing self-assessment and improvement over the years. Thanks to this legislation, Job Corps' performance standards can serve as a model for other programs. With enactment of this bill, all programs under WIPA will be challenged to increase their performance and accountability to achieve the results Job Corps does.  Mr. President, support for this legislation will help Job Corps become even better. First, with this legislation, Job Corps will become a core partner with one-stop training centers, making sure that every young, disadvantaged person walking into a neighborhood one-stop site will learn about this program and know it is an option. If the young person is ready to commit to his or her future, pledging not to drink or take drugs, the program is ready to offer an intensive, self-paced, state of the art education and training. Second, every Job Corps campus will form partnerships with the private sector in order to develop training programs suitable for available, local employment; identify job opportunities for students; and help integrate the Job Corps campus and facilities into the fabric of a community. Third, a stringent process will be put in place to ensure that poor performing centers are quickly identified and offered help to improve their performance. Finally, every year, Congress will receive a report on the program's performance that will include how many students graduated from each center and from which trade, how many were employed, their wages when hired, and what these students are making a year later. This kind of information will be instrumental to make sure we improve upon the success that has been Job Corps' for more than 30 years.  Mr. President, in the Administration's current budget President Clinton has followed the initiative taken by Congress last year to moderately expand the program. Support for such expansion was demonstrated overwhelmingly when forty-one of my colleagues joined me in a letter to Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Harkin in support of this budget increase. Job Corps gains this breadth of support in Congress because Members are aware of the positive impact it has on literally millions of lives. This legislation improves upon a program with a demonstrated record of success. Therefore, Members can be confident that the program will continue to serve more disadvantaged young people with as high a rate of success. It is my hope, Mr. President, that soon the Job Corps program will become truly national, with a center in every state of our nation. My home state of Rhode Island is currently involved in the application process for a center. Our Governor, local elected officials, employers, educational institutions, and civic organizations have all committed to developing a high-performance center in our state. I have been actively working on the federal level to assist them.  Thank you, Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to support this worthy legislation.                     amendment no. 2329, as amended
