 President, if there is no further business to come before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the provisions of S. Res. 684 and do so as a further mark of respect for the late Joseph D. ``Joe'' Tydings, former Senator for the State of Maryland.  There being no objection, the Senate, at 9:39 p.m., adjourned until Friday, October 12, 2018, at 12 noon.                          ____________________
