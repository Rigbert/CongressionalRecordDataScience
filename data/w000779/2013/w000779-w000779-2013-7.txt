President, today I rise to introduce a bill to end the gridlock on the Oregon and California, O&C, lands and secure a new future. I recently unveiled my legislation in Oregon alongside Governor Kitzhaber, premier forest scientists, and a cross-section of supporters from timber, county, collaborative group and environmental interests. With the introduction of this bill, I look forward to working with supporters and interested parties, as well as the entire Oregon delegation, to end decades of uncertainty and broken forest policy with a science-driven solution.  The 2.1 million acres of O&C grant lands have a history known too well by Oregonians. After the Oregon and California Railroad violated the terms of its land grant, Congress revested the lands to federal ownership in 1916. In 1937, Congress directed how the Department of the Interior was to manage these lands and laid out a formula for distributing timber receipts to the 18 Oregon counties with O&C lands. The high logging harvests of the 1980s made way for the spotted owl timber wars, and today the lands are ground zero for the battle between those seeking to halt logging in the Northwest and those seeking to return to the unsustainable logging levels of a bygone era.  My bill ends the O&C gridlock by using science to guide management of the O&C lands while upholding bedrock federal environmental laws. This bill provides the jobs that Oregonians need, certainty of timber supply that timber companies require, and continued environmental protections that our treasures deserve. It is legislation that I believe can pass both houses of Congress and be signed by the President.  The first step the bill takes is to divide the O&C lands--with roughly half set aside for forestry emphasis and the other half for conservation emphasis--to put a stop to the uncertainty and conflicting priorities that have contributed to Federal management failure on these lands and produce wins on both sides of the historic timber conflict. The forestry emphasis lands will employ proven forestry practices, known as ``ecological forestry,'' to mimic natural processes and create healthier, more diverse forests. Modeling using Bureau of Land Management analysis confirms that ecological forestry will roughly double the harvest on O&C lands compared to the last 10 years, meaning more jobs for rural Oregon.  On the conservation side, my bill protects nearly a million acres of land, while designating wilderness lands, wild and scenic rivers, and other special areas. It creates 87,000 acres of wilderness and 165 miles of wild and scenic rivers. In all, it will permanently conserve nearly a million acres of O&C lands, which would be the single biggest increase in Oregon's conservation lands in decades. That includes special areas protected for recreation, which is an increasingly important part of our rural economy, and is responsible for 141,000 jobs in Oregon alone. Perhaps the most important conservation win in the bill is the first-ever legislative protection for old growth trees and stands on O&C lands.  This strategy of dividing the lands into conservation and timber emphasis and protecting old growth takes the most controversial harvests off the table. Timber harvests and thinning projects must protect water quality, highly erodible land, wetlands, endangered or threatened species, and tribal cultural sites. Mills and timber companies that rely on federal forests will have new certainty of a sustainable yield from the harvested lands. This bill upholds the Endangered Species Act and other bedrock environmental laws while providing expedited procedures and strict timelines for legal and environmental reviews. Two large scale environmental impact statements--one each for moist and dry forests--will study 10 years of work in the woods, rather than a single project. Anyone with concerns will have a chance to sue over those studies, but once the environmental review is approved, any timber sale consistent with the 10-year study can go ahead, without triggering a new legal stumbling block or procedural boulder that brings everything to a stop.  Above all, forest policy should be dictated by science, not lawyers. The forestry principles used in this bill are based on the work of Drs. Norm Johnson and Jerry Franklin, two respected Northwest forestry scientists, and built off of forestry approaches used around the globe. The bill also establishes the first ever legislative protections for O&C streams thanks in large part to the work of one of the Northwest's foremost water resources experts, Dr. Gordon Reeves. The Northwest Forest Plan's stream protections are extended to key watersheds and four drinking water emphasis areas, with additional lands designated for conservation, to protect drinking water. Science also guides how the agency can treat trees near streams and a scientific committee will evaluate stream buffers and reserves in areas dedicated to timber harvests, increasing or decreasing the boundaries as needed to address the ecological importance of streams. This acknowledges that one size does not fit all.  The bill also creates new tools to reduce fire danger in the dry forests of Southern Oregon. In areas that have grown prone to catastrophic fires, this bill reduces tree density and provides new tools for treating forest lands near residences. For the first time, county governments will have the flexibility to reduce fire danger within a quarter mile of homes, and private landowners can more easily protect against fire within 100 feet of their own homes.  The O&C solution that I present today will indeed secure a new future for the O&C lands. Management will be based on science, not lawyers. Counties will be able to count on dependable forest revenues. Communities will have steady jobs, and mill's timber to process, in place of a struggle to survive. My bill certainly doesn't provide everything all sides want, but it can get everyone what they need. I look forward to working with Congressmen DeFazio, Walden and Schrader and our colleagues in the Senate and House of Representatives to pass an O&C solution into law.                          ____________________
