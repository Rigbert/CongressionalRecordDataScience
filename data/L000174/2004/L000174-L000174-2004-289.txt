It cost him $5. We remember back to the days of the $500 hammer. He charges the Government $2,000 for an item that costs $5, but he does not lie about this. He does not conceal the cost. He simply says: Here is my bill.  He says: OK, it is $2,000. He paid $5. He does not conceal that cost. He does not lie. He just says: Here is the bill for $2,000. He has not lied. He did not conceal--the bill is not hidden somewhere else. It is a straight-out bill, but he is obviously gouging the Government, charging $2,000 for a $5 item. Does the Senator's statute cover that situation?
