President, I rise to introduce the Congressional Oversight Protection Act of 2002. The 107th Congress has truly been the Congress of the whistleblower. From Sherron Watkins who helped expose many of the misdeeds at Enron, to FBI Special Agent Coleen Rowley and others who brought needed public attention to some of the shortcomings of the FBI prior to 9-11, we have been eyewitness to the value of getting the inside story.  The 107th Congress has also been one of rejuvenated bipartisan oversight. On the Judiciary Committee we convened the first series of comprehensive bipartisan FBI oversight hearings in decades after I assumed the Chairmanship. The Joint Intelligence Committee is now conducting bipartisan hearings to ascertain what shortcomings on the part of our intelligence community need to be corrected so as not to allow the 9-11 terrorist attacks to recur. The Senate Banking Committee conducted extensive oversight of the SEC and its relationship with the accounting industry, to ascertain whether a new regulatory scheme was required. Both the Senate and House Judiciary Committees are attempting to ascertain how the new powers we provided in the USA PATRIOT Act are being used. These are only a few examples.  We have all been the beneficiaries of such increased oversight and the courage of the whistleblowers who provided information as part of that effort, because their revelations have led to important reforms. The Enron scandal and the subsequent hearings led to the most extensive corporate reform legislation in decades, including the criminal provisions and the first ever corporate whistleblower protections from S. 2010, the Corporate Fraud and Criminal Accountability Act, that I authored. The testimony of the rank and file FBI agents that we heard on the Judiciary Committee helped us to craftthe bipartisan FBI Reform Act, S. 1974. This legislation, which included enhanced whistleblower protections, was reported unanimously to the full Senate in April but is being blocked by an anonymous Republican hold. The same day as Coleen Rowley's nationally televised testimony before the Judiciary Committee, President Bush not only reversed his previous opposition to establishing a new cabinet level Department of Homeland Security, but gave a national address calling for the largest government reorganization in 50 years. In the last year we have learned once again that the public as a whole benefits from a lone voice in the government.  Unfortunately, the people who very rarely benefit from these revelations are the whistleblowers themselves. We have heard testimony in oversight hearings on the Judiciary Committee that there is quite often retaliation against those who raise public awareness about problems within large organizations even to Congress. Sometimes the retaliation is overt, sometimes it is more subtle and invidious, but it is almost always there. The law needs to protect the people who risk so much to protect us and create a culture that encourages employees to report waste, fraud, and mismanagement.  For those who provide information to Congress, that protection is a hollow promise. On one hand, the law is very clear that it is illegal to interfere with or deny, ``the right of employees, individually or collectively, to petition Congress or a Member of Congress, or to furnish information to either House of Congress, or to a committee or Member thereof . . .'' See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 7211. Amazingly, however, this simple provision is a right without a remedy. Employees who are retaliated against for providing information to Congress cannot pursue any avenue of redress to protect their statutory rights. The only exception to this applies to employees of publicly traded companies, who are now covered by the whistleblower provision included in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that we passed this year. Thus, under current law, government whistleblowers reporting to Congress have less protection than private industry whistleblowers.  This bill would merely correct this anomaly by providing government employees that come to Congress with the right to bring an action in court when they suffer the type of retaliation already prohibited under the law. Thus, it does not create new statutory rights, but merely provides a statutory remedy for existing law. That way, we can promise future whistleblowers who come before Congress that their right to access the legislative branch is not an illusion. We can also assure the public at large that our future efforts at Congressional oversight and improving the functions of government will be effective. This legislation is strongly supported by leading whistleblower groups, including the National Whistleblower Center and the Government Accountability Project, and I ask unanimous consent that their letters of support be printed in the Record.  For all these reasons, I urge swift passage of this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3137       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Congressional Oversight      Protection Act of 2002''.     SEC. 2. PROVIDING REMEDIES FOR RETALIATION AGAINST                    WHISTLEBLOWERS MAKING CONGRESSIONAL                    DISCLOSURES.       Section 7211 of title 5, United States Code, is amended--       (1) by inserting ``(a)'' before ``The right''; and       (2) by adding at the end the following:       ``(b) Any employee aggrieved by the discrimination of an      employer in violation of subsection (a) may bring an action      at law or equity for de novo review in the appropriate      district court of the United States, which shall have      jurisdiction over an action under this subsection, without      regard to the amount in controversy.       ``(c) Any employee prevailing in an action under this      section shall be entitled to all relief necessary to make the      employee whole, including--       ``(1) reinstatement with the same seniority status that the      employee would have had but for the discrimination;       ``(2) the amount of back pay lost as a result of the      discrimination, with interest;       ``(3) compensation for any special damages sustained as a      result of the discrimination, including litigation costs,      expert witness fees, and reasonable attorney fees; and       ``(4) punitive damages, in appropriate cases.       ``(d) Upon the request of the complainant, any action under      this section shall be tried by the court with a jury.       ``(e) The same legal burdens of proof in proceedings under      this section shall apply as apply under sections      1214(b)(4)(B) and 1221(c) in the case of any alleged      prohibited personal practice described in section 2302(b)(8).       ``(f) For purposes of this section, the term `employee'      means an individual (as defined by section 2105) and any      individual or organization performing services under a      contract with the Government (including as an employee of an      organization).''.                                  ____                                National Whistleblower Center,                                 Washington, DC, October 16, 2002.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy: I am writing to strongly support your      legislation, the Congressional Oversight Protection Act of      2002. The National Whistleblower Center (Center) is the pre-     eminent national organization that promotes effective      measures to protect whistleblowers who come forward in the      public interest at great risk to their careers. In that      regard, your introduction of this bill once again      demonstrates your leadership in understanding the importance      of whistleblowing and its role in our democratic process, and      the Center is pleased to support your bill and work hard to      achieve its swift passage.       In the wake of the events of 9/11, the stakes have been      raised for Congress to perform the most effective oversight      of the federal government. To do so, Congress must have      unfettered access to information. And that means that      citizens in both the public and private sectors must be free      to come forward to Congress with proper disclosures without      the fear of retaliation. Under current law, citizens have the      right to make disclosures to Congress, but there is no remedy      for them to protect their rights in the event of retaliation.      Your bill would provide such a remedy and, in doing so, would      put government whistleblowers on a par with whistleblowers in      publicly-held companies who have such protections under the      newly-passed Sarbanes-Oxley Act.       This year, the concept and importance of whistleblowing has      been etched indelibly on the minds of the public, thanks to      congressional investigations into Enron and other companies,      thanks to the joint investigation into intelligence lapses in      the government, and thanks to extensive media coverage of      these matters. The public's appreciation for the necessity of      whistleblowers and whistleblower protections creates an      atmosphere conducive to passing the Congressional Oversight      Protection Act at the earliest possible time. Your leadership      in trying to fill an important void in whistleblower law      should be commended and hailed by all those who support      ``good government.''       Once again, thank you for your continued leadership on this      and other whistleblower issues throughout the 107th Congress.      Please feel free to call on the Center to work together to      pass this bill.           Respectfully,                                                 Kris J. Kolesnik,     Executive Director.                                  ____                            Government Accountability Project,                                 Washington, DC, October 17, 2002.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy: This letter is to express unqualified      appreciation for introduction of the Congressional Oversight      Protection Act, providing access to jury trials in court for      federal whistleblowers and others who bear witness through      disclosures to Congress. This legislation reflects leadership      to close an inherent flaw that has prejudiced even the best      administrative law remedial systems. Administrative boards do      not have the judicial independence or resources for high-     stakes, politically sensitive whistleblower disputes with      national consequences. Ironically, those type of disputes are      the primary, most significant reason for enacting      whistleblower protection laws.       The legislation puts teeth into the congressional right to      know law, the Lloyd LaFollette Act of 1912. (5 USC 7211) That      law's purpose is simple, and fundamental--to protect the free      flow of information to Congress. It prohibits discrimination      for communicating with Congress. It was passed in response to      presidential gag orders that had imposed prior approval      before federal employees could communicate with Congress.      Flood statements before passage emphasized the free flow of      information as the lifeblood for Congress to carry out its      mission. The need is even greater when freedom of speech      means the freedom to warn Congress of national security      breakdowns, before the public suffers the consequences again.       Unfortunately, Congress failed to specifically provide      access to court to enforce Lloyd LaFollette rights. As a      result, it has been a right without a remedy. That means it      is of little more than rhetorical significance, and no      benefit to reprisal victims. Since 1912, 54 whistleblowers      have tried to assert their rights under this law. Fifty three      cases were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Consistently      the explanation is that     the statute did not provide the court with jurisdiction as      authority to act. The bill's purpose is to strengthen      Congress' right to know--a prerequisite for informed      oversight. The bill's strategy is to provide reinforced      protection, beyond normal civil service remedies, for those      who choose to communicate through and work with Congress.       There should be no question of the need for reinforced      protection of congressional whistleblowers. The system of      administrative civil service hearings was never designed for      major public policy disputes involving high stakes national      consequences and active congressional oversight. The      Administrative Judges who hear the cases have no judicial      independence and know they will be treated like      whistleblowers if they rule for those challenging politically      powerful government officials. As a result, those hearing      officers treat significant whistleblower cases like poison      ivy. Consistently, the administrative process has been a      black hole for politically significant disputes, with      decisions regularly not being finalized for years, and one      case still pending after 11 years. In a significant      environmental dispute involving millions of dollars in timber      theft, four Forest Service employees are still waiting for      their day in court after six years.       After lessons learned from the FBI's Coleen Rowley, it is      beyond credible debate that whistleblowers can make a major      contribution toward preventing another 9/11. Analogous      frustrations of Border Patrol, Customs Service, Department of      Energy, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Aviation      Administration and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission      whistleblowers illustrate an unmistakable pattern of ignoring      or silencing patriots on the front lines of homeland      security. As our nation's modern Paul Reveres, whistleblowers      are invaluable as an early warning signal to prevent      avoidable disasters.       It should also be clear, however, that this legislation is      a necessity to strengthen homeland security. It will not      solve the complex problems of the civil service system. But      it will give whistleblowers a credible remedy for the first      time in eight years, if they work with Congress. Increasingly      whistleblowers have been lionized for their bravery, but that      is no substitute for genuine, enforceable rights. Indeed, the      praise can ring cynically hollow to those whose careers are      in ashes for doing their duty. It is unrealistic to expect      whistleblowers to defend the public, if they cannot defend      themselves. Profiles in Courage are the exception, not the      rule. If successful, your initiative to add rights matching      the rhetoric supporting whistleblowers will be a good      government breakthrough.           Sincerely,                                                       Tom Devine,                                                   Legal Director.                                 ______                                       By
