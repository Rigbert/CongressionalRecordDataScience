President, one of the most amazing citizens of our remarkable State of Vermont is Antonio Pomerleau. Most people know him as Tony Pomerleau. My wife Marcelle and our children know him simply as Uncle Tony.  Tony and his wife Rita have been among the most generous contributors to the well-being of families in Vermont of anyone I know, and he did not come from a wealthy background. His parents, my wife's grandparents, came as immigrants to the United States from the Province of Quebec in Canada. Nonetheless, he and his wife Rita raised a family of 10 and also faced the tragedy of losing two beautiful daughters. Throughout it all, he has retained his position as a leading citizen of our State but even more so as an example to all of us.  Shortly before Christmas, Tony was named Vermonter of the year by our State's largest newspaper. With pride, I ask unanimous consent that the editorial about our Uncle Tony be printed in the Record so everyone throughout our great country can know about him.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, Dec. 24, 2006]                 Tony Pomerleau, Vermonter of the Year       He's 89 years old and still going like the Energizer bunny,      his family says.       Tony Pomerleau.       People know his name in this state. And those who know the      man consider themselves fortunate.       He is Santa Claus to countless children, the festive,      white-haired gentleman who has thrown a big party every      Christmas since 1982 for hundreds of children and their      families who might not be able to afford a celebration of      their own.       He is Mr. P, the delightful, generous soul who added a      holiday party for families of the Vermont Army National Guard      in 2004. It was a huge lift for the 800 or so people who      attended, and he did it again in 2005--and again this year,      opening the doors to all Guard families, with special      attention paid to the families of about 120 Guard members who      are still deployed.       Everyone is welcome. Everyone has a seat at Antonio (Tony)      Pomerleau's table.       It's Pomerleau's giving spirit that makes him so deserving      of the honor of Vermonter of the Year. His steadfast      commitment to Vermont and the people of this state make him a      fine choice.       As Robert Perreault of Hardwick said in his nomination      letter, ``He is extremely generous with his time, ideas and      money, to implement programs that have helped people,      especially the children and our Vermont Guardsmen and their      families.''       Pomerleau's niece, Marcelle Leahy, wife of Sen. Patrick      Leahy, encouraged her uncle to play a role in helping the      Guard families with whom she was working through the Guard's      Family Readiness Group. Pomerleau was more than happy to do      it.       It doesn't take much for Pomerleau to be persuaded to share      his good fortune with others. He ``came up the hard way,''      his son Ernie said last week. Tony Pomerleau has been there.       He was the third child of Ernest and Alma Pomerleau, a      hardworking French-Canadian couple who decided to try their      chances across the border in Vermont. When Pomerleau was 6      months old, the family moved to a dairy farm in Barton,      according to an unpublished biography the family has put      together.       As a child, Pomerleau was touched by two formative      incidents. First, he fell down the basement stairs at age 3      and was forced to wear an iron corset. Doctors feared his      life would be shortened.       ``He wasn't supposed to live beyond 12 years old,'' Erie      Pomerleau said. ``And here he is, 89 and still going      strong.''       The second incident, according to the family biography, was      something of a miracle. Alma Pomerleau took her son, age 10,      to Ste. Anne de Beaupre in Quebec--the shrine that is covered      in crutches and other medical aids left behind by countless      others who believed they were cured.       Alma removed young Tony's iron brace, and they returned      home to Vermont without it. Her son was fine.       ``Of course it was a miracle. It was my mother's prayers,''      Pomerleau said in the biography.       And so Tony Pomerleau gives back. He gives and gives,      according to the families, charities, schools and      organizations that have been touched by his spirit.       There's the renowned annual party, organized by the      Burlington Parks and Recreation Department, and paid for by      Pomerleau. Now there's also the Guard party. There is St.      Michael's College in Colchester, where Pomerleau, received an      honorary doctorate after years of contributing to the campus.      There is Burlington's Church Street, which he helped      rejuvenate in the 1950s. There is the Burlington Police      Department, where Pomerleau was a longtime police      comissioner. He bought the North Avenue building for the      police headquarters and has provided ongoing support for the      officers, such as laptop computers for their patrol cars.      There are the scholarships at Rice Memorial High School, the      renovations at Christ the King Church, the trips Pomerleau      has funded for Burlington schoolchildren, and the regular      donations to the American Red Cross, United Way of Chittenden      County and the Salvation Army.       Pomerleau started his entrepreneurial life as a child, soon      after he shed that iron brace. He sold haircuts and canaries.      He washed cars, ran errands and helped his family in their      general store in Newport. In 1942, after working for a      national shoe store chain up and down the East Coast, he      decided to settle in Burlington where he bought a failing      grocery store. Within three years, he owned four stores and a      wholesale beverage business. In 1951, he started his real      estate career and by age 45, he was a millionaire. Pomerleau      built Vermont's first shopping center in the 1950s, the Ethan      Allen Shopping Plaza, and then developed about 20 more.       He has lived large, and the beautiful Greek Revival      building on College Street that houses Pomerleau Real Estate      is a testament to that life.       Through it all, Pomerleau's wife, Rita, and 10 children,      two of whom have died, have been his main focus. Pomerleau is      also the proud grandfather of 13.       In many ways, Tony Pomerleau remains the optimistic boy who      left his iron brace behind at Ste. Anne de Beaupre.       ``Someone asked him the other day when he was going, to      retire,'' son Ernie said. ``And he said, `When I get old.' ''       Never get old, Mr. P. We like you the way you are.                          ____________________
