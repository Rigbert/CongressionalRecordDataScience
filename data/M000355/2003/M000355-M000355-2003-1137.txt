 President, this morning we will be resuming consideration of H.J. Res. 2, the appropriations bill. Under the order, following 5 minutes of debate, there will be a vote in relation to the Harkin amendment regarding Byrne grants. Following that vote, and an additional 5 minutes of debate, there will be a vote in relation to the Schumer amendment relating to port security. Members can, therefore, expect two consecutive votes to begin shortly. I understand additional amendments are expected and, therefore, Members can expect further rollcall votes today. It is hoped we can finish this bill today or this evening. If that is not possible, it is anticipated that the Senate will resume consideration of this bill on Tuesday after the holiday and remain in session until it is completed.
