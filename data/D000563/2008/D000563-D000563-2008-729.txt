We did speak this morning about that great game last night, and great praise to Stanford for yielding a wonderful squad and great players, too, and making it all the way to the finals. But a special praise to Pat Summitt and the Lady Vols from Tennessee. We had a special interest in the team because of Candace Parker. She is an extraordinary young woman, and watching her play with that physical challenge of her dislocated shoulder was an indication not only of her skill but of her courage.  When one of the players on the Tennessee team was injured toward the end of the game, you could sense the team feeling.
