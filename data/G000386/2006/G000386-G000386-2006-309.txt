 President, I rise to express concern about the consideration of comprehensive immigration reform legislation. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I have been involved in the democratic process of reviewing, amending, and voting on this year's immigration bill. I was one of six Republicans who opposed the legislation in the committee on March 27.  When the bill was brought to the floor of the U.S. Senate, a select group of Members forged a ``compromise'' that drastically changed title VI of the bill that deals with the 11 million illegal aliens currently in the United States.  The Senate had very little time to review the bill. Moreover, some Members opposed any amendment that would change the Hagel-Martinez compromise. I had numerous amendments that would have improved the bill. However, the other side of the aisle refused to let our deliberative body do its job.  As a representative of the people of Iowa, I believe amendments should be debated. Therefore, I have asked the majority leader to make me aware of any unanimous consent agreements that both sides aim to enter into before unanimous consent is agreed to. I ask unanimous consent that my letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                             United States Senate,                                          Charles E. Grassley,                                   Washington, DC, April 25, 2005.     Hon. William Frist,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC       Dear Leader Frist: I respectfully request that I be      consulted prior to the entering into of any and all Unanimous      Consent Agreements with regard to the Senate's ongoing      consideration of any and all immigration reform or border      security related legislation. This would include, but not be      limited to, S. 2611 and S. 2612. Thank you.           Sincerely,                                              Charles E. Grassley,     United States Senator                          ____________________[Page S3500]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                           IMMIGRATION REFORM
