 Lugar) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:                               S. Res. 30       Whereas there is a scientific consensus, as established by      the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and confirmed      by the National Academy of Sciences, that the continued      buildup of anthropogenic greenhouse gases in the atmosphere      threatens the stability of the global climate;       Whereas there are significant long-term risks to the      economy and the environment of the United States from the      temperature increases and climatic disruptions that are      projected to result from increased greenhouse gas      concentrations;       Whereas the potential impacts of global climate change,      including long-term drought, famine, mass migration, and      abrupt climatic shifts, may lead to international tensions      and instability in regions affected     and, therefore, have implications for the national security      interests of the United States;       Whereas the United States has the largest economy in the      world and is also the largest emitter of greenhouse gases;       Whereas the greenhouse gas emissions of the United States      are projected to continue to rise;       Whereas the greenhouse gas emissions of developing      countries are rising more rapidly than the emissions of the      United States and will soon surpass the greenhouse gas      emissions of the United States and other developed countries;       Whereas reducing greenhouse gas emissions to the levels      necessary to avoid serious climatic disruption requires the      introduction of new energy technologies and other climate-     friendly technologies, the use of which results in low or no      emissions of greenhouse gases or in the capture and storage      of greenhouse gases;       Whereas the development and sale of climate-friendly      technologies in the United States and internationally present      economic opportunities for workers and businesses in the      United States;       Whereas climate-friendly technologies can improve air      quality by reducing harmful pollutants from stationary and      mobile sources and can enhance energy security by reducing      reliance on imported oil, diversifying energy sources, and      reducing the vulnerability of energy delivery infrastructure;       Whereas other industrialized countries are undertaking      measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which provides      the industries in those countries with a competitive      advantage in the growing global market for climate-friendly      technologies;       Whereas efforts to limit emissions growth in developing      countries in a manner that is consistent with the development      needs of those countries could establish significant markets      for climate-friendly technologies and contribute to      international efforts to address climate change;       Whereas the United States Climate Change Science Program      launched by President George W. Bush concluded in April 2006      that there is no longer a discrepancy between the rates of      global average temperature increase observed at the Earth's      surface and in the atmosphere, strengthening the scientific      evidence that human activity contributes significantly to      global temperature increases;       Whereas President Bush, in the State of the Union Address      given in January 2006, called on the United States to reduce      its ``addiction'' to oil and focus its attention on      developing cleaner, renewable, and sustainable energy      sources;       Whereas President Bush has launched the Asia-Pacific      Partnership on Clean Development and Climate to cooperatively      develop new and cleaner energy technologies and promote their      use in fast-developing nations like India and China;       Whereas the national security of the United States will      increasingly depend on the deployment of diplomatic,      military, scientific, and economic resources toward solving      the problem of the overreliance of the United States and the      world on high-carbon energy;       Whereas the United States is a party to the United Nations      Framework Convention on Climate Change, done at New York May      9, 1992, and entered into force in 1994 (hereinafter referred      to as the ``Convention'');       Whereas, at the December 2005 United Nations Climate Change      Conference in Montreal, Canada, parties to the Convention,      with the concurrence of the United States, initiated a new      dialogue on long-term cooperative action to address climate      change;       Whereas the Convention sets a long-term objective of      stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere      at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic      interference with the climate system;       Whereas the Convention establishes that parties bear common      but differentiated responsibilities for efforts to achieve      the objective of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations;       Whereas an effective global effort to address climate      change must provide for commitments and action by all      countries that are major emitters of greenhouse gases,      developed and developing alike, and the widely varying      circumstances among the developed and developing countries      may require that such commitments and action vary; and       Whereas the United States has the capability to lead the      effort to counter global climate change: Now, therefore, be      it       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the      United States should act to reduce the health, environmental,      economic, and national security risks posed by global climate      change and foster sustained economic growth through a new      generation of technologies, by--       (1) participating in negotiations under the United Nations      Framework Convention on Climate Change, done at New York May      9, 1992, and entered into force in 1994, and leading efforts      in other international fora, with the objective of securing      United States participation in binding agreements that--       (A) advance and protect the economic and national security      interests of the United States;       (B) establish mitigation commitments by all countries that      are major emitters of greenhouse gases, consistent with the      principle of common but differentiated responsibilities;       (C) establish flexible international mechanisms to minimize      the cost of efforts by participating countries; and       (D) achieve a significant long-term reduction in global      greenhouse gas emissions; and       (2) establishing a bipartisan Senate observer group, the      members of which shall be designated by the chairman and      ranking member of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the      Senate, to--       (A) monitor any international negotiations on climate      change; and       (B) ensure that the advice and consent function of the      Senate is exercised in a manner to facilitate timely      consideration of any applicable treaty submitted to the      Senate.
