 President, I rise to note that since June 30 of this year, the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit has, once again, been allowed to lapse. As this body considers whether to enact a so-called ``extenders'' package, I want to urge my colleagues to include and pass a permanent extension of the Research and Experimentation tax credit.  The research and experimentation tax credit provides business an incentive to fund development of the technologies of tomorrow by providing a tax credit for investments in research.  The research and experimentation tax credit is an important element in the creation of strong economic growth and rising productivity. Industry leaders have credited it with spawning private enterprise investments. It is especially important to the high-tech and emerging growth industries that are driving the California economy. And, because it creates jobs and spurs economic activity, the research and experimentation tax credit helps to increase the tax base, paying back the benefit of the credit.  Yet, despite its many benefits, for 18 years the research and experimentation tax credit remains, inexplicably, a temporary tax provision requiring regular renewal.  In fact, since 1981, when it was first enacted, the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit has been extended nine times. In four instances the research credit had expired before being renewed retroactively and, in one instance, it was renewed for a mere six months.  This is not a process which is conducive to encouraging business investment in the innovative industries--high technology, electronics, computers, software, and biotechnology, among others--which will provide future strength and growth for the U.S. economy.  Earlier in this decade California was faced with its severest economic downturn since the Great Depression. Today, the California economy is healthy and vibrant, and it is so in no small part because of the critical role played by innovative research and development efforts in nurturing new ``high tech'' industries.  Today the 150 largest Silicon Valley companies are valued at well-over $500 billion, $500 billion which did not exist two decades ago. Much of this growth is a result of ability of companies to undertake long-range and sustained research in cutting-edge technologies. Scores of California companies--and companies across the country--owe much of their success and growth to the incentive provided by the research and experimentation tax credit.  Research and experimentation is the lifeblood of high technology development, and if we want to continue to replicate the successful growth that has characterized the U.S. economy during this past decade it is crucial that we create a permanent research and experimentation tax credit.  For example, Pericom Semiconductor, located in San Jose, has expanded from a start-up company in 1990 to a company with over $50 million in revenue and 175 employees by the end of last year and is ranked by Deloitte Touche as one of the fastest growing companies in Silicon Valley. According to a letter I received from Pericom, utilization of the research and experimentation tax credit has been key to their success, enabling them to add engineers, conduct research, and expand their technology base.  Indeed, according to a 1998 study conducted by the national accounting firm Coopers & Lybrand, a permanent credit will increase GDP by nearly $58 billion (in 1998 dollars) over the next decade. The productivity gains from a permanent extension will allow workers throughout the Nation to earn higher wages, and the additional tax revenue created by these new jobs will help pay back the benefit of the credit.  Whether it is advances in health care, information technology, or environmental design, research and development are critical ingredients for fueling the process of economic growth.  Moreover, aggressive research and experimentation is essential for U.S. industries fighting to be competitive in the world marketplace. For example, American biotechnology is the world leader in developing effective treatments and biotech is considered one of the critical technologies for the 21st century. With other countries heavily-subsidizing research and development, it is critical that U.S. companies also receive incentive to invest the necessary resources to stay on top of breakthrough developments.  I recently received a letter from the CEO of Genentech, for example, in which he wrote:       The R tax credit is especially important to Genentech and      our patients. Our newest therapy, Herceptin, which is used to      treat metastatic breast cancer, is a prime example. The early      clinical trials for Herceptin showed that it was a somewhat      effective treatment for metastatic breast cancer, but the      results were not particularly robust. It was a classic case      of a research project being ``on the bubble'' in terms of      deciding whether to go forward into the most expensive phase      of human clinical trials. However, because the value of the      tax credit to Genentech directly means that we are able to      move one additional drug candidate each year into clinical      trials, we were able to move forward with the Phase III      Herceptin clinical trial in late 1994. I dare say that      without the R credit, Herceptin might well not have become      a reality. Today, thousands of patients are receiving this      important treatment.  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the September 30, 1999 letter from Genentech Chairman Arthur Levinson be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              Genentech, Inc.,                            San Francisco, CA, September 30, 1999.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Hon. Barbara Boxer,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer. On behalf of      Genentech, I would like to thank you both for your long-     standing leadership and support for the Research and      Experimentation Tax Credit, more commonly known as the R      tax credit. Once again, however, we find ourselves in the      perilous position of the Congressional session quickly coming      to an end without providing an extension of the credit, which      expired on June 30, 1999. As you are well aware, the credit      is critical to California's economy, as the high technology      and biotechnology sectors count on the value of the credit to      continue the economic expansion our sectors have enjoyed for      the past few years.       The R tax credit is especially important to Genentech and      our patients. Our newest therapy, Herceptin, which is used to      treat metastatic breast cancer, is a prime example. The early      clinical trials for Herceptin showed that it was a somewhat      effective treatment for metastatic breast cancer, but the      results were not particularly robust. It was a classic case      of a research project being ``on the bubble'' in terms of      deciding whether to go forward into the most expensive phase      of human clinical trials. However, because the value of the      tax credit to Genentech directly means that we are able to      move one additional drug candidate each year into clinical      trials, we were able to move forward with the Phase III      Herceptin clinical trial in late 1994. I dare say that      without the R credit, Herceptin might well not have become      a reality. Today, thousands of patients are receiving this      important therapy.       Clearly, Genentech is among the most research intensive      companies in the world. In     1996, we invested $471 million, or 49% of our revenue, on      research and development and have consistently devoted more      than 30% of revenues to R in the subsequent years. But      research is our lifeblood. It gives life to the ideas we test      to treat serious, unmet medical needs. Our strong portfolio      of products is a direct reflection of the ideas our      scientists have brought from the lab to the patient. And, as      evidenced by our exciting pipeline, I firmly believe the best      of our science is yet to come.       Direct federal support for overall research has, for the      most part, been declining for over a decade. While a long-     term commitment to increasing funds available to the federal      government for basic research is important, maximizing      private industry innovation through a permanent R tax      credit is perhaps the most cost-effective means of ensuring      that high levels of private-sector investment will continue      to be made.       Your leadership and commitment to the R tax credit, has      resulted in great economic benefit for both our country and      for California. I encourage you to, once again, redouble your      efforts to extend the credit now so that greater economic      benefits and new therapies can benefit all Americans.       I have attached a couple of op-ed pieces regarding the      credit which I and others wrote, and which ran in the San      Jose Mercury over the last two years. I look forward to      continuing to work with you and your staffs in support of the      R tax credit.           Sincerely,                                        Arthur D. Leninson, Ph.D.,                             Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
