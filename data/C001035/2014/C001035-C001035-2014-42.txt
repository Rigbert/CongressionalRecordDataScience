Newport was built with a spirit of determination and resiliency that still guides the community today, and this bicentennial is a time to celebrate the generations of hard-working and caring people who have made it such a wonderful place to live, work, and raise families.  While this bicentennial marks Newport's incorporation, the year 1814 was but one milestone in a long journey of progress. For thousands of years, the region was the hunting and fishing grounds of the Abenaki, and the chain of lakes and streams formed their highway between the mighty Kennebec and Penobscot Rivers. The very name of the town a translation of Sebasticook, the Abenaki word for portage is evidence of the friendship between the first white settlers and the Native Americans.  The settlers were drawn by fertile soil, vast forests, and fast-moving waters, which they turned into productive farms and busy lumber mills that were soon followed by blacksmiths, leather manufacturing, textiles, and other endeavors vital to Maine's development. The wealth produced by the land, and by hard work and determination, was invested in schools and churches to create a true community. In the decades that followed, Newport became a center of industry and innovation with such remarkable endeavors as silk production, condensed milk manufacturing, and the fabrication of what were considered the finest carriages in Maine.  Today, the people of Newport continue to build. Their strong environmental ethic has helped make Sebasticook Lake a favorite recreation destination for residents and visitors. The Newport Industrial Center offers a home to new or expanding businesses, and the Newport Cultural Center contributes to a vibrant downtown.  A quality that runs through Newport's history is courage, best demonstrated by the memorial the town dedicated 3 years ago to SGT Donald Skidgel, who was awarded the Medal of Honor for giving his life to save the lives of his fellow soldiers in Vietnam. From the Civil War to the conflicts of our time, the names of some 500 patriots from Newport who have served our Nation with honor and defended our freedom with valor are inscribed on the Veterans Memorial.  This 200th anniversary is not just about something that is measured in calendar years. It is about human accomplishment, an occasion to celebrate the people who for more than two centuries have pulled together, cared for one another, and built a community. Thanks to those who came before, Newport has a wonderful history. Thanks to those who are there today, it has a bright future.                          ____________________
