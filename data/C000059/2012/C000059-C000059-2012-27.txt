Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Rosemary Bourns, who passed away on Wednesday, September 26, 2012. Rosemary was a pillar of the community in Riverside, California and she will be deeply missed.  In 1947, Rosemary and her newlywed husband Marlan moved to California from Michigan, and they began their electronics components manufacturing company in humble settings--the garage of their new home in Pasadena. While Marlan took care of the engineering side of the business, Rosemary oversaw the books and made sure that their house could accommodate the seven engineers working with her husband. The couple eventually moved the company, now renamed Bourns, Inc., to Riverside in 1950 to boost manufacturing operations in order to keep up with rising demand.  In her free time, Rosemary loved telling stories and arranging flowers. She and her husband always accomplished things as a team, from starting their business to moving it to Riverside. They also selflessly gave back to their community. In 1992, the Bourns family gave the University of California, Riverside (UCR) the single-largest donation it had received to that date, a $6 million gift for its new College of Engineering, eventually named Bourns College in the family's honor. In the years that followed, they continued to support the College, and the west engineering building was named Bourns Hall.  The way in which Rosemary lived her life should serve as reminder to others that an individual with drive, perseverance and a stellar work ethic can do great things. In 2000, Rosemary and her husband were recognized as UCR Laureates, and in 2010 the family was honored by the Inland Empire Center for Entrepreneurship with its Lifetime Award. University of California, Riverside Chancellor Timothy P. White said of Rosemary, ``On the UCR campus, Rosemary Bourns' name has been synonymous with the accomplishments of strong, hardworking women . . . She will always be honored through the accomplishments of the faculty and students in the Bourns College of Engineering.''  In addition to her husband, Rosemary is survived by her son Gordon; daughters Linda Hill, Anita Macbeth and Denise Moyles; 14 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.  Rosemary will always be remembered for her incredible contributions to business, her work ethic, generosity, and love of family. Her dedication to her work, family and community is a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will continue. I extend my condolences to Rosemary's family and friends; although Rosemary may be gone, the light and goodness she brought to the world remain and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
