Speaker, I didn't hear my friend saying that when John Boehner, Eric Cantor, and the whip asked for votes to keep the government open.  They got 84 of their colleagues on your side of the aisle to join them, making a total of 87, and the majority of your Members voted against your own leadership on the bill that they were proposing. So don't lecture me about voting ``no.''  I voted ``no'' because I think we should not have had a CR. I voted ``no'' because I think there are too many things left undone. I voted ``no'' because the American people expect us to get our work done, not to twiddle our thumbs while Rome is burning.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
