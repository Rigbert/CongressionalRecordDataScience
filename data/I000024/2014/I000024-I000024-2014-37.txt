President, it is my privilege also to honor the life and sacrifice of Army PFC Jerimiah J. Veitch, of Dibble, OK who died with four other servicemembers on June 21, 2007, of wounds suffered when his vehicle was struck by a rocket propelled grenade while serving his Nation in Baghdad, Iraq. He was assigned to 2nd Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division, Fort Carson, CO.  Born in Moore, OK, Jerimiah moved to San Jose, CA and then back to Dibble, OK with his mother Valorie Sanchez and stepfather Tony Sanchez before high school. According to his sister Amanda Testerman, he gave his all at Dibble High School where he graduated in 2005 so that he could play football and use the weight room.  A memorial service was held at Union Hill Baptist Church with interment in Dibble Cemetery in Dibble, OK.  At the funeral, LTC Steven Michael said that Jerimiah was only 5 foot 4 inches, but was ``strong as an ox, tenacious.'' One year he took second place in a State weightlifting competition, lifting more than 1,000 pounds in three lifts in the 132-pound weight class. More than 400 pounds of the total he lifted with a single deadlift.  After returning home from the Army he planned to go to Dibble, buy some land and build a house. He wanted to go to work for his stepfather in the roofing business. ``He is more of a son than anyone could ask for,'' his father said. ``He was my partner. He was the heart of our family.''  Jerimiah is survived by his mother Valorie Sanchez; stepfather Tony Sanchez; his sister Amanda Testerman; and two brothers Caleb and Jacob Veitch.  I extend our deepest gratitude and condolences to Jerimiah's family. He lived a life of love for his family, friends, and our country. He will be remembered for his commitment to and belief in the greatness of our Nation. I am honored to pay tribute to this true American hero who volunteered to go into the fight and made the ultimate sacrifice of his life for our freedom.                         Sergeant Ryan M. Wood
