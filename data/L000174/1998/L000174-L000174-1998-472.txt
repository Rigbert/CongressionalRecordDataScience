President, Marcelle and I loved our parents and we were loved by them. During the past decade and a half, we have seen them all leave--Howard, Phil, Alba, and Cecile. Such good friends and such good parents are in our memories today.  It is strange, but I still find myself stopping momentarily now and then as if to call each of them, perhaps to say thank you for all each gave, to tell them their love will live on in their children and their grandchildren, but I think they knew that. They knew how much their children loved them. They knew how much their grandchildren loved them. And at a time when it becomes almost a cliche to talk about family values, our parents gave such great family values to us. The love of all the children for them has been so strong, and the grandchildren, especially, were fortunate to have grandparents that they could know and love.  We lost Cecile last February, but this February, a year later, her first great grandchild, Roan Seamus Nichols Leahy, joined the family. Knowing Cecile, she would consider this timing quite fitting, and her wonderful heart, if she were still alive, would expand to include him in her love with all the rest of us.  I say au revoir, Maman.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
