 Obviously, the Postmaster General is not accustomed to taking positions on legislation up here. But his point is that this is in effect a transfer of cost to the postal ratepayers across America.  That is one of the reasons the Direct Marketing Association, the direct mail people--they are a private business--also opposes this, because in effect it is passing on to the postal ratepayers an enormous expense.  This bill is not free. The notion has been put forth that somehow the spending limits are free. In fact, it passes the cost on to the broadcasting industry and on to the postal patrons of this country.
