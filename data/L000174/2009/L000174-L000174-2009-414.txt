President, on the particular matter, the distinguished Senator from Arizona and the distinguished Senator from North Dakota have spoken about the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee, and I assume the chairman of the Rules Committee will speak about it. I also understand that Senators Schumer and Coburn have amendments. I urge them to come to the floor because there has been a request for a vote on the Isakson-Conrad amendment. I will not make a unanimous consent request at the moment, but it is our intent to have a vote on that around 4:20, 4:30--on the Isakson-Conrad amendment.  I understand, because of budget matters that come up tomorrow, there is an intent to try to finish this bill tonight. We can finish this bill tonight. I hope we could finish it before 6 or 7 or 8 o'clock. Having an Irish father and Italian mother, I come with a hopeful attitude by nature. But I note we will have a vote around 4:30, 4:20 or 4:30.  There are a number of matters. I see the distinguished and able chairman of the Banking Committee here. There are a number of matters within the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. I will let him speak to that.  I urge Senators who have amendments to bring them to the floor because as soon as we have no amendments apparently here, we are going to try to move to final passage.  I yield the floor.
