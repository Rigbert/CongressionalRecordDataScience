Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to acknowledge the presence of the ranking member, my good friend, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar). He has been absent from the floor because he was stuck in traffic. What better thing could happen to him today as we pass this magnificent bill. As we can see, he is here. I welcome him here, and we will be discussing this a little later on. Welcome.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Flake).                              {time}  1100
