Speaker, I am deeply, privileged today to extend on behalf of the Kaptur and Rogowski families and my brother Steve and myself sincerest appreciation to each of you for offering your support, comfort, and love to Hank's beautiful wife of 50 years, Jackie, and the entire Kalinski family; Linda and Bob, Diane and Jim, Debbie and Jeff; to Hank's sisters Vergie, Sophie, Esther and in memoriam of Angie, Jean and his brother Edward; to his treasured gandchilden, Brian, Heather, Matthew, Kevin, Eric, Shawn, Stacey, and in memory of Jason; and to his four great grandchildren, Tyler, Justin, Connor and Alexis; and his nieces and nephews.  We join together today to pay tribute, in sorrow, but also in celebration, of the life of a patriarch, the father of his family, of a truly good man from a working class family, who loved life. What a lasting gift Hank is to each of us--a happy man. He is smiling on us now, for surely he knew we would be here together with Jackie, at this family gathering. He enjoyed being with family more than anything else in the world. He is experiencing a peace now that the world could not give. Hank remains with us now in a spiritual way.  Hank had more than a smile. He had a grin. We all loved to laugh with Hank. That wonderful laugh that came from deep within--not too loud, but genuine. You knew he wouldn't want anyone to be sad, but to be gratified he lived the life he wished to live for most of his years. And Jackie, you and your family bestowed on him the greatest gift of his life--your unconditional and constant love.  As he was asked to bear this enormous cross of affliction for so many years, you walked at his side. He did so with a rare dignity born of uncommon strength and raw courage. He would want us to cheer his decade long marathon and his family's deep devotion. His suffering became a prayer for all of us and our poor world. Every person who witnessed this great ``Kalinski prayer of devotion'' was changed by its power. Who can ever forget the nurses and doctors who would be overcome by Hank's grin and laughter, even under the most difficult circumstances. The glint in Hank's eyes had no equal.  Now, can you imagine he was the father of three daughters, and the brother of five sisters. But, he was a man's man, a husband to an exceptional wife, a true friend to his sons-in-law, a man who knew how to stand by his loved ones, a builder, a veteran. He was always there, sometimes not uttering a word. He was a Gary Cooper type of character, a quiet strength. He didn't have to show it off.  Happy. Kind. Generous. Funny. Hardworking. Wise. A family man who took unending delight in his grandchildren andgreat-grandchildren crawling at his feet or sitting on his lap. You never heard him utter an unkind word. So many precious memories: Christmas, Easter, birthdays, weddings, anniversaries, parties and more parties. perch fishing, darts, his gardens, homemade gifts like the wooden horses that held address plates for our homes, Pearl and Wersell streets, his dog Puck.  I can recall how he went out of his way for each of us. He would make such an effort to meet me along the Lagrange Street Parade route, year after year. Always there. If Hollywood were to cast a true husband and father, brother and friend, they would cast Hank in the leading role.  You still will find him with you--in unexpected moments. You will know he is there, and everything will be all right. I once asked a holy woman why God gave such trials to people who are so good. ``To make us strong,'' she said. Hank taught us love, joy, and perseverance. He has been a man for others, who showed us how to love life.  May God carry his soul gently in his passage to peace. We know God joins with us today as we pray, ``Sleep well my good and faithful servant.''                          ____________________
