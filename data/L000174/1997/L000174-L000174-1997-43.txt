President, I commend the majority leader for deciding to take up the nomination of Jerry Friedman to serve as a judge for the Eastern District of Virginia. Judge Friedman's nomination was received by the Judiciary Committee on June 26, 1997. He appeared before us during a nomination hearing on October 28 and was reported favorably out of the committee on November 6.  From June 1985 to January 1991, Judge Friedman sat on the bench of the Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court in Virginia Beach, VA. Since 1991, he has served as a judge for the Virginia Beach Circuit Court. The American Bar Association gave Judge Friedman a unanimous ``well-qualified'' evaluation--its highest rating.  I would like to congratulate both Judge Friedman and his family. I look forward to his service on the U.S. District Court.                       nomination of norman moon  I am delighted that the majority leader has taken up the nomination of Norman Moon to serve as a U.S. District Court judge for the Western District of Virginia. Judge Moon has been sitting on the bench of Virginia State courts since 1974. He is currently serving as the chief judge for the Virginia State Appellate Court--a position which he has held since May 1, 1993.  Judge Moon has been a member of several legal and judicial-related organizations, including the National Institute of Trial Advocacy, the State-Federal Judicial Council for Virginia, and the National Council of Chief Judges.  We received Judge Moon's nomination on October 8, 1997. He appeared before the Judiciary Committee during a hearing on October 28 and he was reported favorably out of the Committee on November 6.  I congratulate Judge Moon and his family on his accomplishment and I look forward to his service as a U.S. District Court judge.  I would like to note that the nomination process experienced by Judge Moon has been the exception, not the rule, for this year. I hope that more judicial nominees will enjoy a similar experience in the future.                      Nomination of Stanley Marcus  I am delighted that the majority leader has decided to take up the nomination of Stanley Marcus to serve as a judge for the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Marcus is a graduate of Queens College of the City University of New York and the Harvard Law School.  Since 1985, Judge Marcus has served as a Federal district court judge for the Southern District of Florida. Prior to his Federal judgeship, Judge Marcus was employed as a special attorney, deputy chief and chief for the organized crime and racketeering section of the U.S. Department of Justice Detroit strike force.  The committee received Judge Marcus' nomination on September 25, 1997. He appeared before us during a nominations hearing on October 28 and was reported favorably out of the Judiciary Committee on November 6.  I congratulate Judge Marcus and his family, and look forward to his service on the U.S. Court of Appeals. Additionally, I would like to commend my fellow committee members on the expediency of this nomination. If all judicial nominations were advanced as efficiently as Mr. Marcus', the vacancy crisis facing the Federal judiciary would be easily solved.                          ____________________
