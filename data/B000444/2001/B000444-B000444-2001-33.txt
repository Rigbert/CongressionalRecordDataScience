 President, I am pleased to present to the Senate two multilateral conventions, negotiated within the UN system, to combat two specific aspects of international terrorism. The treaties, the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, and the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, will provide important tools to the President in the global campaign against terrorism.  The two treaties are similar in approach: they require parties to criminalize the proscribed behavor--engaging in international terrorist bombings and fund raising for international terrorism--and to either extradite an alleged offender to another nation that has jurisdiction to prosecute or to submit the case for prosecution.  The conventions have received increasing support from the nations of the world. In the last several weeks, many nations have signed or ratified the treaties. For example, when the Committee on Foreign Relations held a hearing on the treaties in late October, 58 countries had signed the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, but just four had become parties to it. As of today, according to the web page of the United Nations, 125 countries have signed the Convention, and 15 have become party to it. It will enter into force when 22 nations become party to it, so the Senate's action today will be an important step in helping bring the Convention closer to entry into force.  I applaud and support the global campaign against terrorism that President Bush has waged to date. If we have learned anything about foreign policy since September 11, it is the global leadership and multilateral cooperation are essential to combating the terrorist networks. If we want to use air power in Afghanistan, we need over-flight rights from countries around the region. If we want Al-Qaeda cells to be investigated and arrested, we need our foreign partners to join us in the effort. If we want bank accounts of Osama bin Laden and his cohorts frozen, we need the assistance of foreign governments and foreign bankers. In short, we cannot wage this campaign by ourselves.  I am pleased that the administration strongly supports these conventions. They will provide additional weapons in the terrorism campaign. They set international standards--which we will expect foreign nations to embrace and enforce. The International Conventionon the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism will be of particular importance in our continuing effort to squeeze the financial lifeblood out of the international terrorism networks.  Despite this support for multilateral approaches, I find puzzling the Administration's failure to seize the initiative in other contexts, especially at this time when so many countries are lining up on our side in the present conflict. The vicissitudes of the war on terrorism also present opportunities to the United States, if only we will seize them.  For example, we all know that rogue states and terrorists are trying to obtain biological weapons. In response to this challenge, the Administration--which earlier scuttled a draft compliance protocol to the Biological Weapons Convention--proposes that countries enact national legislation criminalizng violations of the BWC, improve bilateral extradition agreements, and adopt strict standards for access to dangerous pathogens. But as recently as earlier this week, at the BWC Review Conference held every five years, the U.S. delegation was resisting the idea of a protocol calling on countries to take those actions. It is a mystery to me why the Administration cannot see the virtue of global adherence to a set of standards in the fight to prevent biological terrorism.  Mr. President, the Committee on Foreign Relations recommended, by a unanimous voice vote, that the Senate advise and consent to the two treaties now before the body. I am pleased that my colleagues have given their strong support to these conventions.                          ____________________
