Chairman, I will raise the point of order once I get the clarification if, in fact, the gentlewoman can tell me. I am not trying to be argumentative. I am trying to find under clarification whether a point of order should lie against the gentlewoman's amendment. I have discussed this with the gentlewoman prior to discussion as of this late hour. What I am trying to determine is will her amendment in any way require anybody to come in and ask for information of our Nation's farmers. Will her amendment require anybody to go and obtain information? If the information does come in, will anybody verify it?                              {time}  2230
