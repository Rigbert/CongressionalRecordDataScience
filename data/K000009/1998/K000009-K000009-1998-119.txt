Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding career of a distinguished scholar and civic activist, Dr. Arthur J. Naparstek. On Saturday, May 30, 1998, Dr. Naparstek will be joined by his family and friends to celebrate his 60th birthday. It gives me great pleasure to wish my dear friend, Arthur, a very happy birthday.  Dr. Arthur J. Naparstek is a nationally recognized authority and leading theorist on community change and community organization. Since 1962 he has been extremely dedicated to improving the lives of those less fortunate by teaching others how to develop neighborhood strategies and coalitions to build stronger communities.  Since 1983, Dr. Naparstek has been the Coyle Professor of Social Work at the School for Applied Social Sciences at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland where he served as Dean for nearly a decade. As Director of the Cleveland Foundation Commission on Poverty from 1990 to 1993, Dr. Naparstek initiated the drafting of the commission's report which served as the basis for HUD's $2.6 billion Urban Revitalization Demonstration Act (HOPE VI). In July 1994, in recognition of his service to combat inner city poverty, President Clinton appointed Dr. Naparstek to the Board of Trustees of the Corporation for NationalService. Throughout his career, he has been an innovator, a reformer, a new idea creator. His pathbreaking research and testimony before Congress helped lead to passage of significant national legislation including: The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, The Community Revitalization Act, and the National Neighborhood Commission. His writings are prolific and span a wide range of subject areas: Rethinking Poverty Through a Community-Building Approach Initiative; Neighborhood Networks for Humane Mental Health Care; and Community Building: New Strategies for Community Development.  Arthur's unmatched commitment to community service is an example of a true American patriot as he remains extremely active in both the public and private sector. He has directed the Cleveland Foundation Commission on Poverty, worked with the National Center for Urban Ethnic Affairs, the Rockefeller Foundation, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the White House Conference on Neighborhoods and many other civic organizations. Dr. Naparstek is also the author of numerous reports, articles, and books that address the importance of community building and development.  Dr. Arthur Naparstek earned his doctorate from Brandeis University and his Master's Degree from New York University. He received his undergraduate degree from Illinois Wesleyan University. Dr. Naparstek is married to Belleruth, and they are the proud parents of Aaron, Keila, and Abram.  Americans all across this country should tip their hats to Dr. Naparstek, a lifelong prophet empowering people in our urban corridors to overcome poverty and hopelessness.  Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to wish Dr. Arthur Naparstek--a rare and gifted talent--a very happy birthday. Mazel tov.                          ____________________
