Speaker, the gentleman is correct. The chairman of our committee, and our committee, in my opinion, has tried to act as responsibly as we possibly can, and I count myself advantaged by having the opportunity to serve on the gentleman's committee, one of the fairest people on the floor of this House.  However, I think I did not misspeak, and what I said was during the month of September, the month before the end of the fiscal year, we have not considered one appropriation bill on the floor of this House. I agree with the gentleman from Florida (Chairman Young). My bill was one that passed. But in September not one bill have we considered on the floor.
