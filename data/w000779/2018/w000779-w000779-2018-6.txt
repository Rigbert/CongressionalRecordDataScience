President, I am placing a hold on S. 1010, the Register of Copyrights Selection and Accountability Act of 2017, out of deep concern for the implications of this bill for the Copyright Office and its administration of U.S. copyright laws. The Constitution delegates to Congress the power to ``promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.'' Currently, the Librarian of Congress appoints the Register, who acts under the Librarian's direction. The Librarian is uniquely positioned to bring to bear the interest of the public and concerns around freedom of speech, scholarship, access for the disabled and other societal values, as well as incentivizing creators to continue to innovate and produce new works.  At certain times, I have been deeply concerned that rights holders have seemed to capture the Copyright Office. Politicizing the appointment of the Register and reducing the influence of the Librarian would only cement that tendency. The voice of the public will always be more diffuse than those with vested interest in locking up works for as long as possible. Congress must ensure that all voices are heard, and the structure of the Copyright Office is integral to achieving that goal. Again, this is Congress's responsibility, and ceding ever more power to the Executive, as this bill does, over matters within our purview is an abdication of our responsibility which I believe we will regret.  For these reasons, I have placed a hold on S. 1010, and I encourage my colleagues to give serious consideration to the concerns I have expressed about this bill.                          ____________________
