Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I feel somewhat like the sinner appearing before the bishop when Your Honorable is in the Chair; but with all due respect, I do relish this moment. We are here today to support H.R. 3550, the Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users, known as TEA LU.  This bill is a result of a great deal of hard work and cooperation by the Members of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on a bipartisan basis.  I want to first thank the ranking minority member of our committee, my good friend, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar). He has been a real champion of transportation, working with me to craft this legislation.  I also want to thank the chairman of the Subcommittee of Highways, Transit and Pipelines, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Petri). His leadership and dedication contributed greatly to bringing this bill to the floor today.                              {time}  1030  He has traveled many, many miles to try to bring the information and gather the information from the citizens of this great Nation.  In addition, I appreciate the support and cooperation of the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski), ranking minority member of the subcommittee. This effort demonstrates that, through bipartisanship, working together in cooperation, we can achieve I believe great things and legislate great things in this body.  I particularly want to thank our Speaker, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hastert), for his leadership in moving this important legislation along. He has ensured that this body will be able to work its will and proceed as an independent branch of our government under our Constitution, and I do deeply appreciate his support.  In addition, we could not have brought this bill to the floor today without the support and assistance of the gentleman from California (Mr. Thomas) from the Committee on Ways and Means. Chairman Thomas is proposing some changes to existing law that will provide additional revenues into the Highway Trust Fund. His proposal makes it possible to achieve a better bill, and I appreciate his advice and counsel.  Lastly, I want to thank the gentleman from Iowa (Chairman Nussle) of the Committee on the Budget. He and his staff have been invaluable in ensuring that we continue the principles contained in TEA 21 that guarantee that highway trust funds will be spent on transportation, as promised to the American people. We have worked closely together to reach an agreement that meets both our needs at this point in time.  We have worked with other committee chairmen on provisions contained in the bill; and, without their help, we would not have been able to bring this bill to the floor today. We will continue to work with other committees in a cooperative fashion as we proceed to conference.  Mr. Chairman, traffic congestion, poor roads and hazardous highways are not Republican or Democrat problems. These are problems shared by all Americans, from all walks of life or economic conditions and all political parties.  Today, congestion on our highways is greatly reducing the quality of life for American families. Congestion, congestion, congestion causes over $67 billion in lost productivity and wasted fuels, $67 billion lost that produces nothing. It costs the average driver $1,160 a year and more than a week and a half spent stuck in traffic. I want to stress that again. Average driver, $1,160 a year and more than a week and a half spent stuck in traffic.  H.R. 3550 provides a new emphasis and a new program to relieve congestion, maximize roadway capacity and remove bottlenecks. In addition, more than 42,000 Americans are killed and 3.3 million are seriously injured each year on our highways. Nearly a third of the fatal crashes are caused by poor roads and roadside hazards. These fatalities are totally preventable.  H.R. 3550 creates a new core program for highway safety infrastructure improvements, a new high-risk rural road safety program and supports a number of safety programs aimed at human factors that contribute to accidents.  Mr. Chairman, we live in a global economy. Moving freight quickly and on time is absolutely essential to remain competitive and to retaining oureconomic well-being. Other countries, such as China, are investing first in their transportation infrastructure because they know that without roads they cannot grow their economies. The United States must be willing to make transportation a top priority if we are to retain our economic leadership.  H.R. 3550 funds five programs designed to improve movement of freight, including funding for border infrastructure, intermodal connectors, projects of regional and national significance and a new corridor infrastructure program.  The bill also provides funding for construction of dedicated truck lanes. This will mean not only faster moving of freight but a vast improvement in safety on increasingly crowded interstates.  Public mass transportation is a key component in our cities. Seniors, the disabled and low-income families rely heavily on public transportation. In addition, without transit our highways would be so congested that we would not be able to move at all.  Therefore, H.R. 3550 continues our commitment to provide for public transportation both to our cities and to many rural areas where the need is great.  America's transportation needs are obvious to anyone who spends time on our roads and highways. We are a Nation stuck in traffic. We based the funding level of H.R. 3550 on the administration's conditions and performance report which set forth the needs of our transportation system.  In addition, we received far more requests from Members for funding of projects than we could possibly accommodate. That proves to me that the needs are real and that they are growing.  Mr. Chairman, this has been never been a want bill. This is a needs bill for this great Nation. So I am disappointed we have had to reduce the funding for many of the very good programs that we proposed in H.R. 3550 as introduced.  Failure to address our transportation needs will leave our country behind in protecting our economy. Mr. Chairman, that is not acceptable to this chairman. It will reduce the quality of life of our citizens if we do not pass this bill.  H.R. 3550 is a bill which embodies our vision for a better transportation legacy for America's future. I urge everyone during this debate and discussion of the bill to be able to listen to the merits of the legislation and support what is right for America.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
