 President, today I pay tribute to my good friend Colonel Lewis Minor Stewart, U.S. Army, Retired. Lewis passed away on July 18, 2009. He was a personal friend and, along with his family, I mourn his passing.  Lewis was born on June 13, 1918, and raised in Marion, AL. He graduated from the Marion Military Institute and attended the University of Alabama School of Law. In 1941, Lewis joined the Army. He was a proud solider whose tours during World War II included fighting with the 261st Infantry, 65th Division, landing in LeHarve, France, and ending the war in Austria. Lewis went on to serve as regimental staff officer and then the commander of 24th Squadron, 4th Constabulary Regiment in Lenz, Austria, during the tensions of the Berlin airlift. He also served 16 months in Korea during the early occupation.  He was awarded several prestigious honors including the Legion of Merit, Bronze Star with Oak Leaf Cluster, Combat Infantry Badge, Expert Infantry Badge, Army Commendation Medal, Army of Occupation Medal, World War II Medal, American Campaign Ribbon, National Defense Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster, Korean Service Medal, Korean Conflict Ribbon, and theMiddle Eastern Campaign Ribbon. Lewis was also selected for the Infantry OCS Hall of Fame for obtaining field grade rank starting from the rank of private.  After a distinguished military career, in 1972 Lewis retired at the rank of colonel from the Army. Following his retirement, Lewis returned to Marion and remained very active in the community. He served as administrator for the local Public Housing Authority, formed Stewart Real Estate, rehabilitated two historic homes and a Marion commercial building, served as director of special services for the district attorney, 4th Judicial Circuit, AL. He was also deeply involved in the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Perry County Historical Society, and the Lions Club. As an active member of St. Wilfred's Episcopal Church, Lewis served as senior warden of the Vestry and led the revival of the church's historic cemetery.  Lewis is loved and will be missed by his two sons Lewis Minor Stewart, Jr. and SG Matthew Rebel Stewart, U.S. Army, Retired, as well as his four grandchildren, three great-grandchildren, and two sisters. Lewis was an inspiration to many and will be remembered as an outstanding husband, father, soldier, churchman, community contributor, friend, and leader.  I ask the entire Senate to join me in recognizing and honoring the life of my great friend, Lewis Minor Stewart.                          ____________________
