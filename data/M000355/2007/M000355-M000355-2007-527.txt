 President, let me just indicate that Republican Senators will be voting for cloture on the motion to proceed. The majority leader has it entirely correct. He and I will be discussing during the course of the day how to proceed, both on the Iraq issue and on the U.S. attorney proposal, and we will be, as I indicated, trying to reach an agreement on both of those matters.                          ____________________
