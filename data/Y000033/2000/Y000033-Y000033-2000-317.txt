Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I would tell the gentleman, I am going to support the amendment, and the good gentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. Clayton).  I think what we have to do is plant more trees. We also have to harvest them at the appropriate time, but there have to be more trees planted, because our forestry in the urban areas and in the rural areas is in decline because management has been very poor.  I have to lecture a little bit here. There is a concept that trees last forever. They do not. We ought to recognize that, because they do the best to clean the air up. They are the one, true purifier of our air, and dead trees or old trees that have reached their maturity and have begun to die do not clear the air.  I do not know how many read in the paper, we have a fire now in the Los Alamos area where there is a fire threatening our nuclear capability. We have to recognize that nature is well and good, but it is not necessarily as good as we can be in managing our forests.  I have traveled to Sweden, I have traveled overseas, where they today have managed their forests over the years because they recognize the value of live trees and what they do and how they clean the air and how they help mankind live.                              {time}  1230  So I am in strong support of this amendment, and I want to tell the gentleman, we will be willing to accept the amendment. And because the gentleman is running the time, I guess he will not object to his own amendment. But I do want to suggest to my colleagues that we have to look at the big picture. This is part of the big picture.  As far as the delicate balance, I have to tell the gentleman from California Mr. Pombo), my good friend, we have adopted five of the amendments that have been proposed to us. We have listened to the gentleman from Ohio Mr. Regula). We accepted one of his amendments. We have taken one from the gentleman from Montana Mr. Hill), the gentleman from New York Mr. Boehlert), and the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Souder). So we have adopted amendments.  So this debate has been very good, because we have listened to both sides. And where the amendments really can make sense, we have accepted them. But, again, I congratulate the gentleman from Colorado Mr. Udall) and the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. Clayton) on this amendment because I think it adds to the bill, and I hope the people of America recognize the importance of sound management, planting of new trees for the betterment of those people who live in the urban areas as well as the rural areas.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
