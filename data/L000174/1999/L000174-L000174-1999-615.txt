President, yesterday I questioned the Senator from Idaho on his exclusion, which at that time was to ``determine qualified civil liability actions should not include an action--'' and then there was nothing further until we got down to ``immunity.''  Now he has added a couple of other sections in there which were not in the bill yesterday.
