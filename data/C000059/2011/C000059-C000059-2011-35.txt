Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Riverside, California are exceptional. Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Brian Hawley is one of these individuals. On March 24, 2011, Brian was honored as the ``Volunteer of the Year'' at the 111th Inaugural Celebration of the Greater Riverside Chambers of Commerce.  Brian Hawley is Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of Luminex. Founded in 1994, this privately held, global, growing, and consistently profitable company develops distinctive data storage products based on proven technologies that tackle the complex challenges of storing, archiving, distributing and protecting data.  In 2002 and 2003, Luminex was named to the Deloitte Fast50 list as being one of the fastest growing technology companies in Southern California. In 2003, Luminex was one of the select few companies named to both the Inc. Magazine ``Inc. 500'' and Deloitte ``Fast 500'' as one of the 500 fastest growing companies in the United States.  Along with his co-founders, Luminex received the Spirit of the Entrepreneur award in technology, the Greater Riverside Chambers of Commerce Small Business Eagle award, the UC Riverside Bourns College of Engineering Honored Alumni Award, and was honored as a California Small Business of the Year.

He was called upon by the California Chamber of Commerce to testify in support of a bill that allows employees greater flexibility in their work week.  In light of all Brian has done for the community of Riverside, the Greater Riverside Chambers of Commerce named Brian their Volunteer of the Year.
