 President, I am pleased to introduce the ``Rim of the Valley Corridor Preservation Act.'' This legislation would expand the boundaries of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area by 191,000 acres.  This legislation would provide surrounding communities with much-needed access to nature and open space, while maintaining private property rights and existing local land-use authorities.  The proposed expansion is based upon findings of the National Park Service after a six-year special resource study of the area.  This study was directed by Congress in the Rim of the Valley Corridor Study Act, passed in 2008.  The National Park Service's recommendation takes into account over 2,000 comments received from the public, elected officials, local organizations, and other stakeholders.  This bill would add an additional 191,000 acres, known as the Rim of the Valley Unit, to the existing Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation area to provide members of the local community with improved recreational and educational opportunities.  The proposed expansion would also better protect natural resources and habitats, including valuable habitat for endangered wildlife, such as the California red-legged frog, mountain lions, bobcats, foxes, badgers, coyotes, and deer.  Notably, the ``Rim of the Valley Corridor Preservation Act'' would only allow the Department of the Interior to acquire non-Federal land within the new boundaries through exchange, donation, or purchase from willing sellers.  I want to highlight that this legislation will not create any additional liability or restrictions for private property owners.  This legislation will significantly expand outdoor recreational opportunities for residents of Los Angeles County, one of the most densely populated and park-poor areas in California.  In fact, 47% of Californians--that's six percent of the total U.S. population--live within two hours of the proposed expansion area. Enlarging the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, at no cost to U.S. taxpayers, will provide these communities with increased access to public lands and boost the local economy.  This bill enjoys the support of more than 50 local municipalities, community groups, and elected officials. It is the product of significant public engagement in the legislative process.  I would like to thank my colleague, Representative Adam Schiff, for re-introducing this legislation in the House.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the ``Rim of the Valley Corridor Preservation Act'' as quickly as possible.  Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.                                 ______                                       By
