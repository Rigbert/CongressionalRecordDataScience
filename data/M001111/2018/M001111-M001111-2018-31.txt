 President, as ranking member on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor,Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, I would like to recognize a public servant deeply committed to protecting and improving the health of the American people, Ms. Anne Houser. Anne will retire in January, after a distinguished 48-year career at the National Institutes of Health, where she has for many years been the principal liaison with the Appropriations Committees.  Over the course of her career, Anne has worked for eight NIH Directors, performing the essential but often overlooked role of helping the committees understand the agency's research and funding needs. It is the kind of low-key work that takes place behind the scenes, but has been essential to building the case in Congress for sustained increased investment in medical research. No matter the issue, or the time of the day or night that it might arise, Anne has always been there, supporting the case for research that will help lead to cures. Her honest, thoughtful, and helpful advice has been valuable to me and to everyone with whom she worked. In short, Anne has set the gold standard for how agencies can most effectively work with the committees that oversee them.  Both within NIH and in Congress, Anne is recognized as a consummate professional and an independent thinker who understands the issues, gets to the bottom of problems, and communicates those issues clearly to Members of Congress, our staff, and to the researchers she works with. Thanks to the dedication of Anne, not only is the NIH working better, but Americans are better off as well. Her absence will be a loss for everyone who depends upon her, but I am glad that she will have more time to spend with her friends and family, and especially her grandson, Alex, of whom she is so proud.                          ____________________
