Speaker, under Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution, the House of Representatives has the authority to originate revenue provisions; not the Senate, the Administration, or the U.S. Trade Representative. Later this month, the United States will host a Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Seattle, Washington. The Ministerial is expected to launch a new round of multilateral trade negotiations, based on a ``built-in agenda'' established in the Uruguay Round agreements which Congress ratified in 1994. That build-in agenda, which I whole-heartedly support, includes revisiting the existing WTO rules for agricultural trade, services trade, and intellectual property protection. Many of our trading partners have indicated that they would like to reopen the five year old agreement on Antidumping (AD) and Countervailing Duty (CVD) laws. By not giving the Administration the clear message from Congress that AD and CVD laws are not to be placed on the table for negotiations, we are essentially allowing the Administration to act on authority it does not have.  Dumped products are levied a tariff under existing U.S. law. These tariffs are revenue raisers which are paid directly to the U.S. Treasury. By allowing negotiations to be made which weaken our trade laws and let in more dumped products, the House would be turning over power to the Executive Branch given to it exclusively under the Constitution. Trade agreements and international treaties, as signed by the Administration, are binding under international law, whether or not they are approved by Congress. Article 6 of the original General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), signed in 1947, declares that dumping ``shall not be condoned.''  This resolution has privilege because only the House has the authority to alter existing revenue provisions. Allowing the Administration to negotiate AD and CVD laws would further diminish the loss of constitutional power the House has suffered over time. Strong antidumping and antisubsidy rules are a cornerstone of the liberal trade policy of the United States and are essential to the health of the manufacturing and farm sectors in the United States. Abolishing AD and CVD would remove these sectors from the U.S. economy, and lead to economic disaster.  Additionally, according to Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, the Congress has the power and responsibility to regulate foreign commerce and the conduct of international trade negotiations. An important part of Congress' participation in the formulation of trade policy is the enactment of official negotiating objectives against which completed agreements can be measured when presented for ratification.  Congress exercised that power in 1994 when it ratified the agenda for the Seattle WTO Ministerial, which included agricultural trade, services trade, and intellectual property protection. The agenda, enacted into Federal Law as P.L. 103-465, did not include antidumping or antisubsidy rules. More than 225 Members of Congress are concerned that a few countries are seeking to circumvent the agreed list of negotiation topics and reopen debate over the WTO's antidumping and antisubsidy rules. Congress has not approved new negotiations on antidumping or antisubsidy rules and has clearly, but so far informally, signaled its opposition to such negotiations. It has long been and remains the policy of the United States, as well as the international community, to support its antidumpingand antisubsidy laws and to defend those laws in international negotiations. In fact, Article 6 of the original General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), signed in 1947, declares that dumping ``shall not be condoned.''  Furthermore, Section 702 of House Rule IX, entitled ``General Principles,'' concluded that certain matters of business arising under the Constitution mandatory in nature for the House have been held to have a privilege which superseded the rules establishing the order of business. This is a question of the House's Constitutional authority and is therefore privileged in nature. In the 105th Congress, the House ruled favorably on a measure which contained a constitutional question similar to the one before it now. On March 5, 1998, the House held that H. Res. 379, a resolution which stated that only the House had the authority to originate a revenue provision, had privilege under Rule IX, and then approved the resolution. This resolution was in response to a Senate measure which infringed upon the House's constitutional duty by repealing a revenue provision and replacing it with a user fee. H. Res. 379 had privilege before the House because the Senate provision was a revenue reducing measure. The question of privilege currently before the House concerns the same principle. A trade agreement signed by the President commits the United States and is binding under international law, even if the Congress never ratifies it. Eliminating or weakening AD or CVD laws would reduce United States Treasury receipts, thus reducing overall revenue. If these laws are placed on the table for negotiations, it would give the Administration the authority to commit the United States to agreements under power it does not have. For these reasons, my motion has privilege.  The WTO antidumping and antisubsidy rules concluded in the Uruguay Round have scarcely been tested since they entered into effect and certainly have not proved defective. Opening these rules to renegotiation could only lead to weakening them, which would in turn lead to an even greater abuse of the world's open markets, particularly that of the United States. Avoiding another divisive fight over these rules is the best way to promote progress on the other, far more important, issues facing WTO members; and it is therefore essential that negotiations on these antidumping and antisubsidy matters not be reopened under the auspices of the WTO or otherwise. Under present circumstances, launching a negotiation that includes antidumping and antisubsidy issues would affect the rights of the House and the integrity of its proceedings.  A precedent exists for bringing H. Res. 298 out of committee and to the House floor immediately. On October 26, 1999, H. Con. Res. 190 was brought to the floor under suspension of the rules because it concerned the upcoming Seattle Round. This measure only had 13 co-sponsors, while H. Res. 298 has 228 co-sponsors. The majority of the House should be heard.  Two hundred and twenty-nine Members of the House of Representatives call upon the President: not to participate in any international negotiation in which antidumping or antisubsidy rules are part of the negotiating agenda; to refrain from submitting for congressional approval agreements that require changes to the current antidumping and countervailing duty laws and enforcement policies of the United States; and to enforce the antidumping and countervailing duty laws vigorously in all pending and future cases.  Mr. Speaker, this debate today is not about the merits of my resolution, nor is it about the 228 cosponsors who would like to see this matter resolved before the House. My question of privilege regards the sanctity of our proceedings as a House. The U.S. Constitution conveys upon this body the power to originate revenue provisions. It is not only our responsibility, it is our duty and obligation to send a clear message to the Administration that the United States House of Representatives will not weaken its trade laws. We need to live up to our obligations.  Mr. Speaker, since a majority of the Members of this House have signed onto the original resolution as cosponsors, I ask the Speaker to recognize any Member wishing to speak on the resolution.                          ____________________
