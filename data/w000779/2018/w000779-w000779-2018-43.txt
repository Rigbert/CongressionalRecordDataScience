President, today I want to recognize and honor the late Dr. Thomas C. Maness, dean of the College of Forestry at Oregon State University in Corvallis, OR, for his outstanding contributions to forest research and his efforts to grow the wood product industry in my State and nationwide.  Dr. Maness served as dean of Oregon State University's College of Forestry from 2012 until his death on July 12. He was a visionary leader in my State and was known around the world for his advocacy of science-based management in the stewardship of our lands and resources. Under his guidance, the College of Forestry earned worldwide recognition for its innovative research and is currently the top-ranked program in the United States and second in the world. Dr. Maness's leadership has improved the health of our lands, people, businesses, and ecosystems by bringing credible, relevant, and timely information and science to our public and private forest land managers.  Prior to arriving at Oregon State University, Dr. Maness worked in both the private and public sectors, logging substantial achievements managing lands in the northwest, honing his scholarship in forest science and engineered timber products in both Europe and Canada, even contributing to the research arm of the U.S. Forest Service here in Washington, DC. He spent a decade in the industry as a research engineer and founded the Canadian National Centre of Excellence in Advancing Wood Processing at the University of British Columbia. Working closely with industry, Dr. Maness advanced research in sawmill optimization and real-time quality control systems and believed deeply that his research efforts should be translated into practical use for professional foresters and manufacturers.  Dr. Maness built his career on collaboration and believed it was key to effective forest management. He worked tirelessly to bridge the urban-rural divide and bring new economic life to our forest-dependent rural communities by starting what is now a nationwide movement to use mass timber building components such as cross-laminated timber in tall buildings. He called it the Forest to Frame movement. Dr. Maness truly represents what I call the Oregon Way: bringing everyone together, using science, collaboration, and cooperation to foster healthy, working landscapes capable of supporting local economies and our strong stewardship values.  Healthy forests, people, businesses, and ecosystems are the heart of the Pacific Northwest, and Oregonians feel a strong connection to these values. Dr. Maness sought balance between these ideals and provided not only Oregonians, but the Nation, with sound guidance on all matters related to one of our greatest natural resources. Dr.Maness will be remembered for his tremendous contributions to forest management and science.                          ____________________
