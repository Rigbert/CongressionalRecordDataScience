  Aung San Suu Kyi has a cousin, an official spokesman, who resides in the United States and heads an organization called the National Coalition of Government of the Union of Burma. He is, in effect, Aung San Suu Kyi's spokesman in our country. He is here because he has to be here. He cannot be over there and continue to breathe. I have a copy of a letter dated July 12, 1996, from him on the very issue that we are debating here this morning. Dr. Sein Win says:       The immediate imposition of economic sanctions against the      ruling military junta is urgently needed. I do not take the      impositions of sanctions on my country lightly.  He understands what we are talking about here.       I and the democratic forces working to liberate our country      know that foreign investment serves to strengthen SLORC. It      is providing SLORC with the means to finance a massive army      and intelligence service whose only job is to crush      international dissent.  He goes on to say:       The situation in my country has deteriorated into free      fall.  He concludes by saying:       I urge you to stand on the side of 42 million freedom-     loving Burmese and support economic sanctions against this      rogue regime.  I certainly agree with my friend from Louisiana that the State Law and Order Restoration Council is no threat to its neighbors. It is not. It is a threat to its own citizens. That is what this is, a regime of terrorism against the Burmese people. If we do not impose sanctions unilaterally, who is going to start this? Who is going to take the lead if the United States does not? Sooner or later, if the international community is going to notice what is going on there and take some steps, it is going to happen because of American leadership.  Mr. President, I know the Senator from Missouri is anxious to speak. I will come back to this later. I yield the floor.
