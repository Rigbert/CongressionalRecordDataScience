Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a good amendment. I wish that it were in order, and I would vote for it. And I wish perhaps that we were not going to object. But we are. And I understand the ranking member's position. I, too, was adamantly opposed to this rule.  I am concerned, as I know the gentlewoman from Maryland (Mrs. Morella) is concerned, that we are designating salaries as the funding source here because we are squeezing salaries. And the gentlewoman from Maryland and I regretted that we lost a very important part of this bill as a result of an objection from one of the Members, over her objection and mine.  But we need to pursue this issue. We need to make sure that the Federal Government, as the gentleman from Virginia and the gentlewoman from Maryland have pointed out, is in fact a model employer.  My district is, I do not know the most but one of the most child-care-dependent districts in America because we have a lot of parents with a number of children who are either a single mother working or a single dad working or both parents working, so that child care is a necessity. And, of course, the Federal Government is the largest employer in our area.  So this is a critical necessity, not a luxury, not an optional requirement for families not just in this area but around the country. So that I congratulate the initiative that has been shown here, regret that I cannot vote for it at this point in time and hope that we will be able to support it and have it on the floor as soon as possible, and certainly we will support it at that time.
