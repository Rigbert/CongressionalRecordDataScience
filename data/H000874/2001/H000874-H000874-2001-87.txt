Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this bill. This is a reasonable bill, and I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Chairman Istook) and the staff for working closely with our staff and with me and with our Members on bringing this bill to the floor.  As I said, I believe it is a reasonable bill, a bill that is higher than fiscal year 2001 and about one-third higher than the President's request.
