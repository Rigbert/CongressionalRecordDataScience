Leader, I keep harping on this because I think it is important to make the point. Our folks are not included in whatever discussions are going on. As a result, we have no idea as to whether or not we think, in fact, Medicare is being strengthened or whether it is being weakened, whether prescription drugs are being made available to seniors, whether they are affordable, accessible, guaranteed, all of which we think is very important. We think this needs to be a voluntary program. I think we agree on that.  But as a result of not being included, we do not know, and we think it is not good for the process that whatever meetings are going on are not what we believe to be conferences of conferees because conferees are not being included. The gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell), specifically, have not been included, and they are chief conferees, as the gentleman knows. The gentleman from Texas is a conferee himself, as I understand. We would hope that if, in fact, they are going to bring this bill to the floor, and if, in fact, a real conference is to be scheduled that it be done soon and that all of the conferees be included to discuss the parameters of a bill which can pass both House and Senate and be sent to the President.  Of the appropriation bills the gentleman mentioned, does he know which ones are most likely to be on the floor next week?  Mr. DeLAY. A lot of people are working, conferees are working and have been working very hard. I anticipate all four that are eligible in conference, right now, could very well come to the floor sometime next week when they are finished, the Labor-HHS bill, the Interior bill, the Energy and Water bill and the Military Construction bill. These are very close to being settled. At least that is what I am being informed. I think those four bills could very well be voted on by next week.
