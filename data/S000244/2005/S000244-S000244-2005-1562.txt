Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman      from Florida. I rise to pay tribute to His Holiness, Pope      John Paul II, who in October marked his 25th year as Bishop      of Rome and Supreme Pastor of the Catholic Church.       I also wish to offer my sincere appreciation to all my      friends and colleagues in the House who have joined together      to urge the President to present the Medal of Freedom to Pope      John Paul II.       The celebration of the Silver Jubilee of Pope John Paul      II's pontificate is but the latest in a series of remarkable      milestones that have characterized his life and his ministry.       From his birth on May 18, 1920, Karol Jozef Wojtyla's life      has been intertwined with the fate of his native Poland and      synonymous with the struggle for his individual freedom and      dignity.       In 1978 when then-Cardinal Wojtyla, the Archbishop of      Krakow, was elected Pope, the world was a much different      place. For the more than 3 decades since Winston Churchill      delivered his famous ``Iron Curtain'' speech, people around      the world prepared for what many regarded as the inevitable      new war that would someday engulf the East and the West. To      win the Cold War, geopolitical strategists honed and      implemented various policies including the doctrines of      containment and mutual-assured destruction.       At this pivotal moment in history, when the status quo      included the subjugation of half the populations of Europe      and the omnipresent threat of nuclear annihilation, a      remarkable and energetic new Pope set foot on the world      stage. To many in the West, this new Polish Pope was an      unknown entity. While we recognized immediately his energy,      courage and leadership, these same qualities were reviewed      with suspicion by some in the East, particularly the      communist rulers in Poland.       Pope John Paul II's commitment to freedom, his affection      for his native Poland, and the devotion of his countrymen to      him were never more evident than the summer of 1980. That      August, the Solidarity Workers Union, which Cardinal Wojtyla      had nurtured and protected, organized a peaceful strike at      the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk.       With the Pope's portrait suddenly appearing everywhere and      the admonition from his inaugural sermon, ``Do not be      afraid,'' on the lips of the workers, his support and      reassurance provided vital sustenance for the strikers and      ignited a spiritual spark in their struggle to secure dignity      and freedom. Ultimately, that spark would lead to the demise      of Soviet communism and the liberation of hundreds of      millions in Eastern and Central Europe.       History has recorded the remarkable achievement of Pope      John Paul II and his relentless advocacy in pursuit of      individual dignity, freedom, and peace. The Pope has not      confined his efforts solely to the struggle against      totalitarianism. He has engaged wherever people are      downtrodden and oppressed.       Mr. Speaker, the Congress should pass House Concurrent      Resolution 313 and urge the President to present the Medal of      Freedom, our Nation's highest civilian award, to His      Holiness.       In authorizing the first Medals of Freedom in 1963,      President Kennedy proclaimed that persons who have made      especially meritorious contributions to the security or      national interests of the United States, world peace or      cultural or other significant public or private endeavors      should be so recognized. By any measure it is apparent that      there is no individual more deserving of this recognition      than Pope John Paul II.       Two other recipients of the Medal of Freedom, President      Ronald Reagan and Lady Margaret Thatcher, shared the Pope's      commitment to Solidarity in the 1980s. In my estimation,      their leadership changed the course of human history. In      1984, while welcoming the Pope to the United States,      President Reagan spoke of the connection between freedom, the      founding of our own Nation, and America's debt to His      Holiness.       President Reagan stated, ``I can assure you, Your Holiness,      that the American people seek to act as a force for peace in      the world and to further the cause of human freedom and      dignity. Indeed, an appreciation for the unalienable rights      of every human being is the very concept that gave birth to      this Nation. Few have understood better than our Nation's      founding fathers that claims of human dignity transcend the      claims of any government, and this transcendent right itself      has a transcendent source.''       The President went on to state, ``To us, Your Holiness, the      Holy See and your pastorate represent one of humanity's      greatest moral and spiritual forces,'' and ``your words, your      prayers and your example have made you, for those who suffer      oppression or the violence of war, a source of solace,      inspiration and hope.'' It is no exaggeration to recognize      that this remarkable man has brought hope, comfort and faith      to literally billions of people around the world during the      course of his ministry.       Three weeks ago today I was honored to be joined by 30      Members of the House in introducing this resolution. Since      that time we have gained additional support for which I am      grateful, and I particularly appreciate the work of the      gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Tom Davis) and the Committee on      Government Reform who reported our resolution to the floor in      such a timely manner.       As stated previously, our bipartisan resolution calls upon      the President on behalf of all the people of the United      States, to present the Medal of Freedom to Pope John Paul II      as a sign of our gratitude for his significant, enduring, and      historic contributions to the causes of freedom, human      dignity, and peace. We urge the President to do so without      delay.       Finally, I include an article by Carl Bernstein entitled      ``The Holy Alliance,'' which appeared in the February 24,      1992, edition of Time, as well as an article by Father Robert      A. Sirico entitled ``The Cold War's Magnificent Seven; Pope      John Paul II; Awakener of the East,'' which was published in      the Winter 1992 edition of Policy Review.       In closing, Mr. Speaker, I would invoke President Reagan      once more. When asked his assessment of the Pope before      meeting him the first time, the President replied, ``He is an      example of what so many people have always said about      Christian and Judaic tradition, and that is, that when really      needed, God provides a man. And I think in Pope John Paul he      did just that.''       Billions around the world are thankful that God has      provided such a man.       The articles referred to are as follows:                  [From Time Magazine, Feb. 24, 1992]                           The Holy Alliance                          (By Carl Bernstein)       Only President Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II were      present in the Vatican Library on Monday, June 7, 1982. It      was the first time the two had met, and they talked for 50      minutes. In the same wing of the papal apartments, Agostino      Cardinal Casaroli and Archbishop Achille Silvestrini met with      Secretary of State Alexander Haig and Judge William Clark,      Reagan's National Security Adviser. Most of their discussion      focused on Israel's invasion of Lebanon, then in its second      day; Haig told them Prime Minister Menachem Begin had assured      him that the invasion would not go farther than 25 miles      inside Lebanon.       But Reagan and the Pope spent only a few minutes reviewing      events in the Middle East. Instead they remained focused on a      subject much closer to their heart: Poland and the Soviet      dominance of Eastern Europe. In that meeting, Reagan and the      Pope agreed to undertake a clandestine campaign to hasten the      dissolution of the communist empire. Declares Richard Allen,      Reagan's first National Security Adviser: ``This was one of      the great secret alliances of all time.''       The operation was focused on Poland, the most populous of      the Soviet satellites in Eastern Europe and the birthplace of      John Paul II. Both the Pope and the President were convinced      that Poland could be broken out of the Soviet orbit if the      Vatican and the U.S. committed their resources to      destabilizing the Polish government and keeping the outlawed      Solidarity movement alive after the declaration of martial      law in 1981.       Until Solidarity's legal status was restored in 1989 it      flourished underground, supplied, nurtured and advised      largely by the network established under the auspices of      Reagan and John Paul II. Tons of equipment--fax machines (the      first in Poland), printing presses, transmitters, telephones,      shortwave radios, video cameras, photocopiers, telex      machines, computers, word processors--were smuggled into      Poland via channels established by priests and American      agents and representatives of the AFL-CIO and European labor      movements. Money for the banned union came from CIA funds,      the National Endowment for Democracy, secret accounts in the      Vatican and Western trade unions.       Lech Walesa and other leaders of Solidarity received      strategic advice--often conveyed by priests or American and      European labor experts working undercover in Poland--that      reflected the thinking of the Vatican and the Reagan      Administration. As the effectiveness of the resistance grew,      the stream of information to the West about the internal      decisions of the Polish government and the contents of      Warsaw's communications with Moscow became a flood. The      details came not only from priests but also from spies within      the Polish government.                            down with yalta       According to aides who shared their leaders' view of the      world, Reagan and John Paul II refused to accept a      fundamental political fact of their lifetimes: the division      of Europe as mandated at Yalta and the communist dominance of      Eastern Europe. A free, noncommunist Poland, they were      convinced, would be a dagger to the heart of the Soviet      empire; and if Poland became democratic, other East European      states would follow.       ``We both felt that a great mistake had been made at Yalta      and something should be done,'' Reagan says today.      ``Solidarity was the very weapon for bringing this about,      because it was an organization of the laborers of Poland.''      Nothing quite like Solidarity had ever existed in Eastern      Europe, Reagan notes, adding that the workers' union ``was      contrary to anything the Soviets would want or the communists      [in Poland] would want.''       According to Solidarity leaders, Walesa and his lieutenants      were aware that both Reagan and John Paul II were committed      to Solidarity's survival, but they could only guess at the      extent of the collaboration. ``Officially I didn't know the      church was working with the U.S.,'' says Wojciech Adamiecki,      the organizer and editor of underground Solidarity newspapers      and now a counselor at the Polish embassy in Washington. ``We      were told the Pope had warned the Soviets that if they      entered Poland he would fly to Poland and stay with the      Polish people. The church was of primary assistance. It was      half open, half secret. Open as far as humanitarian aid--     food, money, medicine, doctors' consultations held in      churches, for instance--and secret as far as supporting      political activities: distributing printing machines of all      kinds, giving us a place for underground meetings, organizing      special demonstrations.''       At their first meeting, Reagan and John Paul II discussed      something else they had in common: both had survived      assassination attempts only six weeks apart in 1981, and both      believed God had saved them for a special mission. ``A close      friend of Ronald Reagan's told me the President said, `Look      how the evil forces were put in our way and how Providence      intervened,' '' says Pio Cardinal Laghi, the former apostolic      delegate to Washington. According to National Security      Adviser Clark, the Pope and Reagan referred to the      ``miraculous'' fact that they had survived. Clark said the      men shared ``a unity of spiritual view and a unity of vision      on the Soviet empire: that right or correctness would      ultimately prevail in the divine plan.''       ``Reagan came in with very simple and strongly held      views,'' says Admiral Bobby Inman, former deputy director of      the CIA. ``It is a valid point of view that he saw the      collapse [of communism] coming and he pushed it--hard.''      During the first half of 1982, a five-part strategy emerged      that was aimed at bringing about the collapse of the Soviet      economy, fraying the ties that bound the U.S.S.R. to its      client states in the Warsaw Pact and forcing reform inside      the Soviet empire. Elements of that strategy included:       The U.S. defense buildup already under way, aimed at making      it too costly for the Soviets to compete militarily with the      U.S. Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative--Star Wars--became      a centerpiece of the strategy.       Covert operations aimed at encouraging reform movements in      Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland.       Financial aid to Warsaw Pact nations calibrated to their      willingness to protect human rights and undertake political      and free-market reforms.       Economic isolation of the Soviet Union and the withholding      of Western and Japanese technology from Moscow. The      Administration focused on denying the U.S.S.R. what it had      hoped would be its principal source of hard currency in the      21st century: profits from a transcontinental pipeline to      supply natural gas to Western Europe. The 3,600-mile-long      pipeline, stretching from Siberia to France, opened on time      on Jan. 1, 1984, but on a far smaller scale than the Soviets      had hoped.       Increased use of Radio Liberty, Voice of America and Radio      Free Europe to transmit the Administration's messages to the      people of Eastern Europe.       Yet in 1982 neither Reagan nor the Pope could anticipate      the accession of a Soviet leader like Mikhail Gorbachev, the      father of glasnost and perestroika; his efforts at reform      unleashed powerful forces that spun out of his control and      led to the breakup of the Soviet Union. The Washington-     Vatican alliance ``didn't cause the fall of communism,''      observes a U.S. official familiar with the details of the      plot to keep Solidarity alive. ``Like all great and lucky      leaders, the Pope     and the President exploited the forces of history to their      own ends.''                             the crackdown       The campaign by Washington and the Vatican to keep      Solidarity alive began immediately after General Wojciech      Jaruzelski declared martial law on Dec. 13, 1981. In those      dark hours, Poland's communications with the noncommunist      world were cut; 6,000 leaders of Solidarity were detained;      hundreds were charged with treason, subversion and      counterrevolution; nine were killed; and the union was      banned. But thousands of others went into hiding, many      seeking protection in churches, rectories and with priests.      Authorities took Walesa into custody and interned him in a      remote hunting lodge.       Shortly after Polish security forces moved into the      streets, Reagan called the Pope for his advice. At a service      of meetings over the next few days, Reagan discussed his      options. ``We had a massive row in the Cabinet and the      National Security Council about putting together a menu of      counteractions,'' former Secretary of State Haig recalls.      ``They ranged from sanctions that would have been crushing in      their impact on Poland to talking so tough that we would have      risked creating another situation like Hungary in '56 or      Czechoslovakia in '68.''       Haig dispatched Ambassador at Large Vernon Walters, a      devout Roman Catholic, to meet with John Paul II. Walters      arrived in Rome soon after, and met separately with the Pope      and with Cardinal Casaroli, the Vatican secretary of state.      Both sides agreed that Solidarity's flame must not be      extinguished, that the Soviets must become the focus of an      international campaign of isolation, and that the Polish      government must be subjected to moral and limited economic      pressure.       According to U.S. intelligence sources, the Pope had      already advised Walcsa through church channels to keep his      movement operating underground, and to pass the word to      Solidarity's 10 million members not to go into the streets      and risk provoking Warsaw Pact intervention or civil war with      Polish security forces. Because the communists had cut the      direct phone lines between Poland and the Vatican, John Paul      II communicated with Jozef Cardinal Glemp in Warsaw via      radio. He also dispatched his envoys to Poland to report on      the situation. ``The Vatican's information was absolutely      better and quicker than ours in every respect,'' says Haig.      ``Though we had some excellent sources of our own, our      information was taking too long to filter through the      intelligence bureaucracy.''       In the first hours of the crisis, Reagan ordered that the      Pope receive as quickly as possible relevant American      intelligence, including information from a Polish Deputy      Minister of Defense who was secretly reporting to the CIA.      Washington also handed over to the Vatican reports and      analysis from Colonel Ryszard Kuklinski, a senior member of      the Polish general staff, who was a CIA informant until      November 1981, when he had to be smuggled out of Poland after      he warned that the Soviets were prepared to invade if the      Polish government did not impose martial law. Kuklinski had      issued a similar warning about a Soviet military action in      late 1980, which led the outgoing Carter Administration to      send secret messages to Leonid Brezhnev informing him that      among the costs of an invasion would be the sale of      sophisticated U.S. weapons to China. This time, Kuklinski      reported to Washington, Brezhnev had grown more impatient,      and a disastrous harvest at home meant that the Kremlin did      not need mechanized army units to help bring in the crops and      instead could spare them for an invasion. ``Anything that we      knew that we thought the Pope would not be aware of, we      certainly brought it to his attention,'' says Reagan.      ``Immediately.''                           the catholic team       The key Administration players were all devout Roman      Catholics--CIA chief William Casey, Allen, Clark, Haig,      Walters and William Wilson, Reagan's first ambassador to the      Vatican. They regarded the U.S.-Vatican relationship as a      holy alliance: the moral force of the Pope and the teachings      of their church combined with their fierce anticommunism and      their notion of American democracy. Yet the mission would      have been impossible without the full support of Reagan, who      believed fervently in both the benefits and the practical      applications of Washington's relationship with the Vatican.      One of his earliest goals as President, Reagan says, was to      recognize the Vatican as a state ``and make them an ally.''       According to Admiral John Poindexter, the military      assistant to the National Security Adviser when martial law      was declared in Poland, Reagan was convinced that the      communists had made a huge miscalculation: after allowing      Solidarity to operate openly for 16 months before the      crackdown, the Polish government would only alienate its      countrymen by attempting to cripple the labor movement and,      most important, would bring the powerful church into direct      conflict with the Polish regime. ``I didn't think that this      [the decision to impose martial law and crush Solidarity]      could stand, because of the history of Poland and the      religious aspect and all,'' Reagan says. Says Cardinal      Casaroli: ``There was a real coincidence of interests between      the U.S. and the Vatican.''       The major decisions on funneling aid to Solidarity and      responding to the Polish and Soviet governments were made by      Reagan, Casey and Clark, in consultation with John Paul      II. ``Reagan understood these things quite well, including      the covert side,'' says Richard Pipes, the conservative      Polish-born scholar who headed the NSC's Soviet and East-     European desks. ``The President talked about the evil of      the Soviet system--not its people--and how we had to do      everything possible to help these people in Solidarity who      were struggling for freedom. People like Haig and Commerce      Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and James Baker [White House      chief of staff at the time] thought it wasn't realistic.      George Bush never said a word. I used to sit behind him,      and I never knew what his opinions were. But Reagan really      understood what was at stake.''       By most accounts, Casey stepped into the vacuum in the      first days after the declaration of martial law in Poland      and--as he did in Central America--became the principal      policy architect. Meanwhile Pipes and the NSC staff began      drafting proposals for sanctions. ``The object was to drain      the Soviets and to lay blame for martial law at their      doorstep,'' says Pipes. ``The sanctions were coordinated with      Special Operations [the CIA division in charge of covert task      forces], and the first objective was to keep Solidarity alive      by supplying money, communications and equipment.''       ``The church was trying to modulate the whole situation,''      explains one of the NSC officials who directed the effort to      curtail the pipeline. ``They [church leaders] were in effect      trying to create circumstances that would head off the      serious threat of Soviet intervention while allowing us to      get tougher and tougher; they were part and parcel of      virtually all of our deliberations in terms of how we viewed      the evolution of government-sponsored repression in Poland--     whether it was lessening or getting worse, and how we should      proceed.''       As for his conversations with Reagan about Poland, Clark      says they were usually short. ``I don't think I ever had an      in-depth, one-on-one, private conversation that existed for      more than three minutes with him--on any subject. That might      shock you. We had our own code of communication. I knew where      he wanted to go on Poland. And that was to take it to its nth      possibilities. The President and Casey and I discussed the      situation on the ground in Poland constantly: covert      operations; who was doing what, where, why and how; and the      chances of success.'' According to Clark, he and Casey      directed that the President's daily brief--the PDB, an      intelligence summary prepared by the CIA--include a special      supplement on secret operations and analysis in Poland.       The Pope himself, not only his deputies, met with American      officials to assess events in Poland and the effectiveness of      American actions and sent back messages--sometimes by letter,      sometimes orally--to Reagan. On almost all his trips to      Europe and the Middle East, Casey flew first to Rome, so that      he could meet with John Paul II and exchange information. But      the principal emissary between Washington and Rome remained      Walters, a former deputy director of the CIA who worked      easily with Casey. Walters met with the Pope perhaps a dozen      times, according to Vatican sources. ``Walters was sent to      and from the Vatican for the specific purpose of carrying      messages between the Pope and the President,'' says former      U.S. Ambassador to the Vatican Wilson. ``It wasn't supposed      to be known that Walters was there. It wasn't all      specifically geared to Poland; sometimes there were also      discussions about Central America or the hostages in      Lebanon.''       Often in the Reagan years, American covert operations      (including those in Afghanistan, Nicaragua and Angola)      involved ``lethal assistance'' to insurgent forces: arms,      mercenaries, military advisers and explosives. In Poland the      Pope, the President and Casey embarked on the opposite path:      ``What they had to do was let the natural forces already in      place play this out and not get their fingerprints on it,''      explains a analyst. What emerges from the Reagan-Casey      collaboration is a carefully calibrated operation whose scope      was modest compared with other CIA activities. ``If Casey      were around now, he'd be having some smiles,'' observes one      of his reluctant admirers. ``In 1991 Reagan and Casey got the      reordering of the world that they wanted.''                          the secret directive       Less than three weeks before his meeting with the Pope in      1982, the President signed a secret national-security-     decision directive (NSDD 32) that authorized a range of      economic, diplomatic and covert measures to ``neutralize      efforts of the U.S.S.R.'' to maintain its hold on Eastern      Europe. In practical terms, the most important covert      operations undertaken were those inside Poland. The primary      purposes of NSDD 32 were to destabilize the Polish government      through covert operations involving propaganda and      organizational aid to Solidarity; the promotion of human      rights, particularly those related to the right of worship      and the Catholic Church; economic pressure; and diplomatic      isolation of the communist regime. The document, citing the      need to defend democratic reform efforts throughout the      Soviet empire, also called for increasing propaganda and      underground broadcasting operations in Eastern Europe,      actions that Reagan's aides and dissidents in Eastern Europe      believe were particularly helpful in chipping away at the      notion of Soviet invincibility.       As Republican Congressman Henry Hyde, a member of the House      Intelligence Committee from 1985 to 1990, who was apprised of      some of the Administration's covert actions, observes, ``In      Poland we did all of the things     that are done in countries where you want to destabilize a      communist government and strengthen resistance to that. We      provided the supplies and technical assistance in terms of      clandestine newspapers, broadcasting, propaganda, money,      organizational help and advice. And working outward from      Poland, the same kind of resistance was organized in the      other communist countries of Europe.''       Among those who played a consulting role was Zbigniew      Brzezinski, a native of Poland and President Jimmy Carter's      National Security Adviser. ``I got along very well with      Casey,'' recalls Brzezinski. ``He was very flexible and very      imaginative and not very bureaucratic; if something needed to      be done, it was done. To sustain an underground effort takes      a lot in terms of supplies, networks, etc., and this is why      Solidarity wasn't crushed.''       On military questions, American intelligence was better      than the Vatican's, but the church excelled in its      evaluations of the political situation. And in understanding      the mood of the people and communicating with the Solidarity      leadership, the church was in an incomparable position. ``Our      information about Poland was very well founded because the      bishops were in continual contact with the Holy See and      Solidarnosc,'' explains Cardinal Silvestrini, the Vatican's      deputy secretary of state at that time. ``They informed us      about prisoners, about the activities and needs of Solidarity      groups and about the attitude and schisms in the      government.'' All this information was communicated to the      President or Casey.       ``If you study the situation of Solidarity, you see they      acted very cleverly, without pressing too much at the crucial      moments, because they had guidance from the church,'' says      one of the Pope's closest aides. ``Yes, there were times we      restrained Solidarnosc. But Poland was a bomb that could      explode--in the heart of communism, bordered by the Soviet      Union, Czechoslovakia and East Germany. Too much pressure,      and the bomb would go off.''                           casey's cappuccino       Meanwhile, in Washington a close relationship developed      between Casey, Clark and Archbishop Laghi. ``Casey and I      dropped into his [Laghi's] residence early mornings during      critical times to gather his comments and counsel,'' says      Clark. ``We'd have breakfast and coffee and discuss what was      being done in Poland. I'd speak to him frequently on the      phone, and he would be in touch with the Pope.'' Says Laghi:      ``They liked good cappuccino. Occasionally we might talk      about Central America or the church position on birth      control. But usually the subject was Poland.''       ``Almost everything having to do with Poland was handled      outside of normal State Department channels and would go      through Casey and Clark,'' says Robert McFarlane, who served      as a deputy to both Clark and Haig and later as National      Security Adviser to the President. ``I knew that they were      meeting with Pio Laghi, and that Pio Laghi had been to see      the President, but Clark would never tell me what the      substance of the discussions was.''       On at least six occasions Laghi came to the White House and      met with Clark or the President; each time, he entered the      White House through the southwest gate in order to avoid      reports. ``By keeping in such close touch, we did not cross      lines,'' says Laghi. ``My role was primarily to facilitate      meetings between Walters and the Holy Father. The Holy Father      knew his people. It was a very complex situation--how to      insist on human rights, on religious freedom, and keep      Solidarity alive without provoking the communist authorities      further. But I told Vernon, `Listen to the Holy Father. We      have 2,000 years' experience at this.' ''       Though William Casey has been vilified for aspects of his      tenure as CIA chief, there is no criticism of his instincts      on Poland. ``Basically, he had a quiet confidence that the      communists couldn't hold on, especially in Poland,'' says      former Congressman Edward Derwinski, a Polish-speaking expert      on Eastern Europe who counseled the Administration and met      with Casey frequently. ``He was convinced the system was      falling and doomed to collapse one way or another--and Poland      was the force that would lead to the dam breaking. He      demanded a constant [CIA] focus on Eastern Europe. It wasn't      noticed, because other stories were more controversial and      were perking at the moment--Nicaragua and Salvador.''       In Poland, Casey conducted the kind of old-style operation      that he relished, something he might have done in his days at      the Office of Strategic Services during World War II or in      the early years of the CIA, when the democracies of Western      Europe rose from the ashes of World War II. It was through      Casey's contacts, his associates say, that elements of the      Socialist International were organized on behalf of      Solidarity--just as the Social Democratic parties of Western      Europe had been used as an instrument of American policy by      the CIA in helping to create anticommunist governments after      the war. And this time the objective was akin to creating a      Christian Democratic majority in Poland--with the church      and the overwhelmingly Catholic membership of Solidarity      as the dominant political force in a post communist      Poland. Through his contacts with leaders of the Socialist      International, including officials of socialist      governments in France and Sweden, Casey ensured that      tactical assistance was available on the continent and at      sea to move goods into Poland. ``This wasn't about      spending huge amounts of money,'' says Brzezinski. ``It      was about getting the message out and resisting: books,      communications equipment, propaganda, ink and printing      presses.''                        Look for the Union Label       In almost every city and town, underground newspapers and      mimeographed bulletins appeared, challenging the state-     controlled media. The church published its own newspapers.      Solidarity missives, photocopied and mimeographed on      American-supplied equipment, were tacked to church bulletin      boards. Stenciled posters were boldly posted on police      stations and government buildings and even on entrances to      the state-controlled television center, where army officers      broadcast the news.       The American embassy in Warsaw became the pivotal CIA      station in the communist world and, by all accounts, the most      effective. Meanwhile, the AFL-CIO, which had been the largest      source of American support for Solidarity before martial law,      regarded the Reagan Administration's approach as too slow and      insufficiently confrontational with the Polish authorities.      Nonetheless, according to intelligence sources, AFL-CIO      president Lane Kirkland and his aide Tom Kahn consulted      frequently with Poindexter, Clark and other officials at the      State Department and the NSC on such matters as how and when      to move goods and supplies into Poland, identifying cities      where Solidarity was in particular need of organizing      assistance, and examining how Solidarity and the AFL-CIO      might collaborate in the preparation of propaganda materials.       ``Lane Kirkland deserves special credit,'' observes      Derwinski. ``They don't like to admit [it], but they      literally were in lockstep [with the Administration]. Also      never forget that Bill Clark's wife is Czechoslovak, as is      Lane Kirkland's wife. This is one issue where everybody was      aboard; there were no turf fights or mavericks or      naysayers.''       But AFL-CIO officials were never aware of the extent of      clandestine U.S. assistance, or the Administration's reliance      on the church for guidance regarding how hard to push Polish      and Soviet authorities. Casey was wary of ``contaminating''      the American and European labor movements by giving them too      many details of the Administration's efforts. And indeed this      was not strictly a CIA operation. Rather, it was a blend of      covert and overt, public policy and secret alliances. Casey      recognized that in many instances the AFL-CIO was more      imaginative than his own operatives in providing      organizational assistance to Solidarity and smuggling      equipment into the country. According to former deputy CIA      director Inman, Casey decided that the American labor      movement's relationship with Solidarity was so good that much      of what the CIA needed could be financed and obtained through      AFL-CIO channels. ``Financial support wasn't what they      needed,'' says Inman. ``It was organization, and that was an      infinitely better way to help them than through classic      covert operations.''       The Solidarity office in Brussels became an international      clearinghouse: for representatives of the Vatican, for CIA      operatives, for the AFL-CIO, for representatives of the      Socialist International, for the congressionally funded      National Endowment for Democracy, which also worked      closely with Casey. It was the place where Solidarity told      its backers--some of whose real identities were unknown to      Solidarity itself--what it needed, where goods and      supplies and organizers could be most useful. Priests,      couriers, labor organizers and intelligence operatives      moved in and out of Poland with requests for aid and with      detailed information on the situation inside the      government and the underground. Food and clothing and      money to pay fines of Solidarity leaders who were brought      before Polish courts poured into the country. Inside      Poland, a network of priests carried messages back and      forth between the churches where many of Solidarity's      leaders were in hiding.       In the summer of 1984, when the sanctions against Poland      seemed to be hurting ordinary Poles and not the communists,      Laghi traveled to Santa Barbara to meet with Reagan at the      Western White House and urge that some of the sanctions be      lifted. The Administration complied. At the same time, the      White House, in close consultation with the Vatican, refused      to ease its economic pressures on Moscow--denying technology,      food and cultural exchanges as the price for continuing      oppression in Poland.       Much of the equipment destined for Solidarity arrived in      Poland by ship--often packed in mismarked containers sent      from Denmark and Sweden, then unloaded at Gdansk and other      ports by dockers secretly working with Solidarity. According      to Administration officials, the socialist government of      Sweden--and Swedish labor unions--played a crucial role in      arranging the transshipment of goods to Poland. From the      Polish docks, equipment moved to its destination in trucks      and private cars driven by Solidarity sympathizers who often      used churches and priests as their point of contact for      deliveries and pickups.                         ``solidarity lives!''       ``The Administration plugged into the church across the      board,'' observes Derwinski, now Secretary of Veterans      Affairs. ``Not just through the church hierarchy but through      individual churches and     bishops. Monsignor Bronislaw Dabrowski, a deputy to Cardinal      Glemp, came to use often to tell us what was needed: he would      meet with me, with Casey, the NSC and sometimes with      Walters.'' John Cardinal Krol of Philadelphia, whose father      was born in Poland, was the American churchman closest to the      Pope. He frequently met with Casey to discuss support for      Solidarity and covert operations, according to CIA sources      and Derwinski. ``Krol hit it off very well with President      Reagan and was a source of constant advice and contact,''      says Derwinski. ``Often he was the one Casey or Clark went      to, the one who really understood the situation.''       By 1985 it was apparent that the Polish government's      campaign to suppress Solidarity had failed. According to a      report by Adrian Karatnycky, who helped organize the AFL-     CIO's assistance to Solidarity, there were more than 400      underground periodicals appearing in Poland, some with a      circulation that exceeded 30,000. Books and pamphlets      challenging the authority of the communist government were      printed by the thousands. Comic books for children recast      Polish fables and legends, with Jaruzelski pictured as the      villain, communism as the red dragon and Walesa as the heroic      knight. In church basements and homes, millions of viewers      watched documentary videos produced and screened on      the equipment smuggled into the country.       With clandestine broadcasting equipment supplied by the CIA      and the AFL-CIO, Solidarity regularly broke into the      government's radio programming, often with the message      ``Solidarity lives!'' or ``Resist!'' Armed with a transmitter      supplied by the CIA through church channels, Solidarity      interrupted television programming with both audio and visual      messages, including calls for strikes and demonstrations.      ``There was a great moment at the half time of the national      soccer championship,'' says a Vatican official. ``Just as the      whistle sounded for the half, a Solidarity Lives! banner went      up on the screen and a tape came on calling for resistance.      What was particularly ingenious was waiting for the half-time      break; had the interruption come during actual soccer play,      it could have alienated people.'' As Brzezinski sums it up,      ``This was the first time that communist police suppression      didn't succeed.''       ``Nobody believed the collapse of communism would happen      this fast or on this timetable,'' says a cardinal who is one      of the Pope's closest aides. ``But in their first meeting,      the holy Father and the President committed themselves and      the institutions of the church and America to such a goal.      And from that day, the focus was to bring it about in      Poland.''       Step by reluctant step, the Soviets and the communist      government of Poland bowed to the moral, economic and      political pressure imposed by the Pope and the President.      Jails were emptied, Walesa's trial on charges of slandering      state officials was abandoned, the Polish communist party      turned fratricidal, and the country's economy collapsed in a      haze of strikes and demonstrations and sanctions.       On Feb. 19, 1987, after Warsaw had pledged to open a      dialogue with the church, Reagan lifted U.S. sanctions. Four      months later, Pope John Paul II was cheered by millions of      his countrymen as he traveled across Poland demanding human      rights and praising Solidarity. In July 1988, Gorbachev      visited Warsaw and signaled Moscow's recognition that the      government could not rule without Solidarity's cooperation.      On April 5, 1989, the two sides signed agreements legalizing      Solidarity and calling for open parliamentary elections in      June. In December 1990, nine years after he was arrested and      his labor union banned, Lech Walesa became President of      Poland.       [Correction (Apr. 27, 1992): A short article accompanying      our report on the cooperative effort of President Reagan and      Pope John Paul II to assist Poland's Solidarity movement      [Cover, Feb. 24] incorrectly stated the U.S. position on      financial aid for family planning in foreign countries.

Robert A. Sirico)       The victory of the Free World in the Cold War ranks with      the victory of the Allies in World War II, the landing on the      moon, and the spectacular advances in health and prosperity      around most of the world as the most important achievement of      mankind in this century. There were countless heroes in the      defeat of Communism--among them the people of the former      Soviet empire whose indomitable spirit ultimately triumphed      over their enslavers, and the taxpayers of the Western      alliance who spent trillions of dollars over more than 40      years to protect their countries and civilization from the      Soviet threat. The West was also blessed by extraordinary      leaders and moral voices who defined the nature of the      conflict, galvanized the popular will to resist Communism,      and created the institutions that led to eventual victory.      Policy Review pays tribute here to seven of those leaders      whose words and deeds were essential for the wonderful events      of the last few years.       It was a nervous clique of geriatric Stalinists who watched      from Moscow in 1979 as millions of Poles poured into the      streets of Krakow to greet their native son Karol Wojtyla      when he returned to them as Pope John Paul II. A political      awareness dawned among these teeming masses when they saw in      one another's boldness the impotence of the dictatorship that      claimed dominance over their lives.       Nor were the only witnesses to these events Politburo      members and Poles. Lithuanians and Ukrainians, Hungarians and      Czechoslovakians also witnessed with astonishment the      unfurling of Solidarity banners in a Communist nation.       Perhaps it was not so astonishing to the new pope. As a      young boy Wojtyla used to pause for a few moments following      Mass to offer a series of prayers ``for the conversion of      Russia.''       From the outset, Wojtyla was a robust, intense, strong, and      disciplined young man. His charismatic personality was      augmented by his facility with languages and further honed by      theatrical training. His combination of fervent piety and      firm anti-Communism would serve him well in his future as      priest, bishop, and cardinal in Poland. In a country that is      itself 93 percent Roman Catholic, such a profession would      necessitate dealing with Russia's surrogates, sometimes      making strategic accommodations, without yielding the      moral ground to Communism.       John Paul comprehended the dynamics of Marxism both      intellectually and personally. He knew Communism well, so      well that some left-wing theologians initially mistook his      familiarity with Marxism for sympathy. They hoped he would      lead a new and enriched dialogue between Christianity and      Marxism. Instead, by virtue of his philosophical and      theological training, he was equipped both to refute      Marxism's logical errors, and also to offer a more compelling      alternative in its place.       As leader of the largest Christian religion, John Paul is      also the leader of a vast enterprise, joined by thousands of      subsidiary organizations. These are linked by a common set of      beliefs and symbols, enabling the transcendence of the usual      barriers of language, culture, and geographic border. This      expansive umbrella enabled him, through gesture, encyclical,      and homily, to inspire millions of people living under      regimes that violated their ability to work for authentic      liberty.                             moral conflict       During his pontificate, two other figures stepped onto the      world stage and occupied with him critical roles in the      momentous events that would unfold. A year after John Paul      assumed his place at the Vatican in 1978, Margaret Thatcher      came to occupy 10 Downing Street. About a year and a half      later, Ronald Reagan took up residency in the White House.       The common thread between John Paul, Thatcher, and Reagan      is that while they appreciated the art of politics, they      understood the global situation in fundamentally moral      categories. They understood, as few world leaders have      understood, that the argument in favor of freedom is a moral      argument as well as a political and economic one. Without the      moral dimension, the battles that these cold warriors waged      would have been meaningless and uninspiring.       The compelling dignity and moral depth of John Paul is      especially highlighted when he contrasted with the leaders of      another international religious body, and their posture      toward the dictatorships of Eastern Europe. I speak here, of      course, of the World Council of Churches. Almost from its      inception, and throughout the past 40 years, the socialist      penchants of the WCC prevented it from offering any kind of      principled opposition to the immorality of Communism.       ``Liberation'' was the central theme of the WCC's Nairobi      Assembly in 1975. South Africa was denounced alongside      ``white Atlantic nations''; the rights of aborigines in      Australia were defended even as the plight of migrant workers      in Europe was decried.       Yet a motion to include in this litany of injustice a      mention of religious repression in Russia was turned back.      Instead, the assembly would only acknowledge that it      ``devoted a substantial period of discussion to the alleged      denials of religious liberty in the USSR'' [emphasis added].       While the officers of the WCC were funding Marxist      guerrillas in Africa in the name of ``liberation,'' John Paul      was teaching the polish under ground in the effective use of      nonviolent resistance to totalitarianism. He did this in      his writings, as well as in the numerous meetings and      audiences he held with leaders of the underground.       No doubt historians who write on this period in years to      come will not only see the moral dimension, but also the      superb tactical insight of the use of nonviolence. Too      aggressive a stance on the part of the Polish underground and      the Soviet Union might have cracked down at a much earlier      and more vulnerable stage. Drawing on a tradition accustomed      to martyrs, whose blood, it is said, is the seed of the Roman      Catholic Church, prayer and determination in the face of      persecution resulted in one of the most radical yet bloodless      revolutions in world history.                           Spirit of Liberty       If there is one word to characterize the legacy John Paul      will leave to history, perhaps that word is liberty.       Historians will undoubtedly note the amazing move in the      Catholic world toward democratic political processes and free      economies in the period of this pope's reign. This is clearly      evident in Latin America where the Pope has confronted unjust      regimes of every stripe.       How fitting, then, that John Paul, this priest from Poland      who lived under what is arguably history's most immoral and      destructive political system, should have been the one to      write the epitaph for collectivism in its Communist,      socialist, and welfare statist incarnations. This he has done      in the form of his most recent social encyclical, Centesimus      Annus (``The Hundredth Year'').       Celebrating the centenary of Pope Leo XIII's pastoral      letter Rerum Navarum, Centesimus Annus looks at the events of      this age and envisions a world where government is strictly      limited and based on the rule of law; where free people trade      in free markets to produce a more prosperous economy for all      the world's needy; and where the social system is rooted in      moral and religious tradition.       It will be interesting to see whether this moral vision      will have greater impact on the West or on the former      republics of the Soviet empire that John Paul did so much to      free.
