President, we have a number of Members who are supposed to go to the Davos economic summit tomorrow night, and I would note I have talked with Senator Bennett of Utah, who is the senior Republican on that trip, and the trip that is set to leave tomorrow night will not. We will put it on hold until Thursday, to determine whether we can leave on Thursday.  If I could have the attention of the majority leader for a moment. I appreciate the majority leader has been very clear. I happen to concur with him that this is important and we should finish it. All we want to do is to know how it will go. There is a Judiciary Committee amendment to the bill. I would not anticipate taking a great deal of time on that, but I think the distinguished majority leader is doing the absolute right thing.  He has the worst job in America, trying to accommodate the schedules of 99 other people, plus his own, which usually comes in number 100 out of the 100. I am not in any way suggesting we change for the Davos summit. I will keep in touch with him, Senator Rockefeller, and others as we go forward. If it is possible for us to leave Thursday night, we will be able to leave Thursday night. But I would not suggest the bipartisan delegation go to Davos if this matter is pending.  I appreciate the distinguished leader spending a lot of time on the phone over the weekend and again today and I appreciate his consideration.
