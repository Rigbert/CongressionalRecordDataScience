Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing H.R. 5530, a bill that would strengthen VA's rights under law to collect reimbursement from certain third parties to cover the costs the Department incurs in providing health care to veterans covered by another private or public health plan. A number of these plans either refuse to reimburse, or are prohibited from doing so by current law. My bill, H.R. 5530, would fix this problem by eliminating these barriers to reimbursement for VA care.  Those who pay attention to such matters are aware that the VA health care system is seriously under-funded to meet the demands being placed on it by our nation's veterans. As Chairman of the authorizing Committee for the Department of Veterans Affairs, I have worked hard to ensure that VA health care has the resources it requires to provide high quality health care services in a timely fashion. However, today VA health care is in crisis, as increasing enrollment and rising health care costs have resulted in hundreds of thousands of veterans being forced to wait months, even more than a year, to see a VA doctor. A VA report recently said that over 300,000 veterans are now waiting over six months to be seen in VA primary care. This is not acceptable.  America's veterans did not ask us to wait while they finished high school, apprenticeships or college before being trained and sent into the European Theater of World War II as replacements for troops killed or taken prisoner of war at the Battle of the Bulge. They did not ask the U.S. Government to delay our call-up of WWII veterans in 1950 to go into the frozen confines of Korea to fight Chinese Communists along the 38th Parallel, or whether they could somehow postpone the horrible suffering caused by extreme cold weather at the Chosin Reservoir.  They were called, they answered, and they served. This is the way of America's citizen soldiers. Now, many of these veterans arecalling on their government to fulfill their promises and provide them health care through VA--many in their final years. They should not be told to wait because we lack the resources.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5530 would correct a number of deficiencies in VA's ability to recover the costs of care provided to veterans covered by other health plans. Since 1986, VA has had statutory authority to collect from traditional insurers such as Blue Cross-Blue Shield, Aetna, Mutual of Omaha and many others. These funds are used by VA to supplement appropriated funds to maintain high quality health care. VA also collects from so called ``Medi-gap policies'' that are an important adjunct to the Medicare program.  But VA is unable to collect from the massive managed care sector, accounting now for over two-thirds of all health plans in the United States, including the managed care plans within Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan. Nor can VA collect from the Medicare program with nearly 40 million eligibles. My legislation would require these federal programs to pay VA for care it provides to covered beneficiaries. This would increase the amount of money VA could collect by hundreds of millions of dollars each year--providing funds that are desperately needed to reduce these intolerable waiting lists and promote better use of all available health care resources.  I urge my colleagues to support and cosponsor this bill that will be an important supplement to a cash-strapped VA health care system charged with caring for many of our nation's heroes.                          ____________________
