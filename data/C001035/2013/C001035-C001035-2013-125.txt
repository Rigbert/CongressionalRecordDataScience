President, my amendment would allow for legislationsetting a more sensible definition of ``full-time employee'' under the Affordable Care Act. Under the Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare, the definition of a full-time employee averages just 30 hours a week. That definition is not found in other areas of the law. It is creating this perverse incentive where employers are actually reducing the number of hours their employees work in order to keep under that 30-hour threshold and thus avoid penalties.  All this amendment does, however, is call for a more sensible definition of what a full-time employee should entail. I ask unanimous consent that we voice vote the amendment.
