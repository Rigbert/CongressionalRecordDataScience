Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join those who have participated in public activities and forums this month to mark September as Dystonia Awareness Month. Public awareness events and campaigns help raise funds for improved research and treatment to one day find a cure.   Dystonia is a neurological movement disorder that causes muscles to contract and spasm involuntarily. It affects men, women, and children. Dystonia can be generalized, affecting all major muscle groups, and resulting in twisting, repetitive movements and abnormal postures. It can also be focal, affecting a specific part of the body such as legs, arms, hands, neck, face, mouth, eyelids, or vocal cords.   Dystonia is a chronic disorder producing symptoms that vary in degrees of frequency, intensity, disability, and pain depending on the type of dystonia. The inability to predict or control the movements of body parts vital to mobility and communication has a profound impact on an individual's life, and the lives of their loved ones.   I am proud to represent the Nachbar Family of Freehold, New Jersey. Janice and Len Nachbar are the incredibly devoted parents of Joanna--a beautiful, smart woman who is afflicted with dystonia. In their role as leaders of the Central New Jersey Dystonia Support and Action Group, they are active advocates on behalf of their daughter and the dystonia community. The Nachbars are just one of the thousands of families nationwide who are part of the Dystonia Medical Research Foundation which raises awareness for dystonia and provides support to patients, families, and caregivers.   Since I first met the Nachbars and learned of dystonia, I have repeatedly requested adequate appropriations for important research funded by the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense, and in 2015 I hosted a Congressional briefing where the Nachbars and other members of the dystonia community testified to the importance of funding and awareness for this terrible disorder.   Despite the prevalence of dystonia, awareness and proper diagnosis of this disorder is extremely limited. Many patients report that it took visits to numerous physicians over the course of years to get a correct diagnosis. Currently there is no single test to confirm the diagnosis of dystonia. Instead, the diagnosisrests in a physician's ability to observe symptoms of dystonia and obtain a thorough patient history.   In order to correctly diagnose dystonia, doctors must be able to recognize the physical signs and be familiar with the symptoms. In certain instances, tests may be ordered to rule out other conditions or disorders. The kind of specialist who typically has the training to diagnose and treat dystonia is a movement disorder neurologist. Awareness and recognition of dystonia is crucial.   I encourage my colleagues to learn more about dystonia, how it impacts the livelihood of their constituents, and honor the important work the Dystonia Medical Research Foundation, and families like the Nachbars, do to raise awareness and give hope to patients across the country.                          ____________________
