 President, It is with great pleasure that I inform you, my colleagues, and the Nation that Vermont's Champlain Housing Trust was selected as one of two recipients of the 2008 World Habitat Award, an honor presented annually by the United Nations.  Each year on World Habitat Day, the United Nations Agency for Human Settlements, which promotes socially and environmentally sustainable towns and cities with the goal of providing adequate shelter for all, presents these awards. Established in 1985, the World Habitat Awards are bestowed on projects that provide practical and innovative solutions to current housing needs and problems. One award is for a project in the global north and the other for a project in the global south.  I have a particularly deep and lengthy interest in the Champlain Housing Trust. It was established as the Nation's first municipally funded community land trust in 1984, when I was mayor of Burlington, VT. It has grown substantially, and today it is not only the first but the largest, community land trust in the country. It has provided a model for securing perpetually affordable housing that has been adopted by many other cities and municipalities across the Nation.  The program came into being because, in the 1980s, Burlington faced a number of housing challenges--and we were looking for innovative solutions. Among other issues that we faced was the reality that low and moderate income households, in the face of rapidly rising and fluctuating house prices, were threatened with displacement. We also believed that decent and affordable housing was a right of all people and not just a commodity for financial gain by a select few. As mayor of Burlington, I was very fortunate to have an outstanding staff as well as strong community input in helping to formulate this concept. Among many others who played an active role in developing what was initially called the Burlington Community Land Trust were Terry Bouricius, John Davis, Peter Clavelle, Michael Monte, Brenda Torpy, and Amy Wright.  When I entered the House of Representatives, my interest in land trusts did not abate. Encouraged by the growing land trust community across the Nation, I successfully introduced legislation that encouraged the use of the land trust model the Burlington community land trust had helped establish so that this model could be expanded to communities across the country.  Meanwhile, ably directed by Brenda Torpy and a legion of committed staff and volunteers over the past two and a half decades, the Champlain Housing Trust has continued to grow and expand its geographic reach, and has been met with unparalleled success. Thousands of low and moderate income families have been able to experience homeownership, while the trust has made great strides both toward revitalizing Burlington's historical Old North End neighborhood and expanding to three different counties in northwestern Vermont.  The Champlain Housing Trust is a model of democracy at the grassroots, involving homeowners, as well as government officials and members of the larger community, in its governance.  It has been a successful experiment that has revealed to the nation and, as this U.N. award demonstrates, to the world as well, how through the land trust concept, home ownership can be combined with making housing perpetually affordable.  The 2008 World Habitat Award is in recognition of all who have worked on establishing and expanding land trusts, all who have bought land trust homes, and all who have helped disseminate the land trust concept. And, in particular, it is a celebration of the wonderful work done by the Champlain Housing Trust.                          ____________________
