 President, I thank the Senator from New York for those comments. She put all of this in both a practical and fiscal perspective. I also thank the Senator from Michigan because he was right on. Do what we say, don't do what we do to every other nation. The nonproliferation treaty does not matter. It is just a terribly arrogant position for the United States to take and I think a morally wrong one.  How much time do I have, Mr. President?
