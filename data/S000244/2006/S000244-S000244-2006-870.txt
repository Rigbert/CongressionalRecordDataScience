Speaker, for purposes of floor consideration of H.R. 2965, the ``Federal Prison Industries Competition in Contracting Act of 2006,'' the Committee on the Judiciary sets forth, with respect to the bill H.R. 2965, the following estimate and comparison prepared by the Congressional Budget Office pursuant to section 402 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. This cost estimate is in addition to the one set forth by the Committee in H. Rept. 109-591.     H.R. 2965--Federal Prison Industries Competition in          Contracting Act of 2006       Summary: H.R. 2965 would amend the laws that authorize the      Federal Prison Industries (FPI), a government-owned      corporation that produces goods and services for the federal      government with prison labor. Under current law, most federal      agencies are required to award purchase contracts to FPI on a      noncompetitive basis if FPI has products available to meet      the agencies' needs and the cost would not exceed current      market prices. Such products include office furniture,      textiles, vehicle tags, and fiber optics. Under H.R. 2965,      this requirement to award noncompetitive purchase contracts      to FPI would be phased out over the 2007-2012 period.       The bill would authorize the appropriation of $357 million      over the 2007-2011 period for new FPI programs. In addition,      CBO expects that additional amounts would be needed to pay      for security costs at federal prisons. Assuming appropriation      of the necessary amounts, CBO estimates that implementing      H.R. 2965 would cost $445 million over the 2007-2011 period.      Federal agencies might be able to purchase some goods and      services less expensively because of the added contracting      flexibility the bill would provide, but CBO has no basis for      estimating such savings. The bill would have no significant      effect on net direct spending by FPI, CBO estimates.       H.R. 2965 contains an intergovernmental mandate as defined      in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA), but CBO estimates      that the cost to state, local, and tribal governments for      complying with this mandate would be insignificant and well      below the threshold established in the act ($64 million in      2006, adjusted for inflation). The bill contains no new      private-sector mandates.       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated      budgetary impact of H.R. 2965 is shown in the following      table. The cost of this legislation falls within budget      function 750 (administration of justice).------------------------------------------------------------------------                                         By fiscal year, in millions of                                                   dollars--                                      ----------------------------------                                        2007   2008   2009   2010   2011------------------------------------------------------------------------              CHANGES IN SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATIONEnhanced Vocational Assessment and Training:    Authorization Level..............      0     75     75     75     75    Estimated Outlays................      0     66     75     75     75FPI Public Service and Donation Programs:    Authorization Level..............      0     12     12     12     12    Estimated Outlays................      0     12     12     12     12Cognitive Abilities Assessment Demonstration Program:    Authorization Level..............      0      3      3      3      0    Estimated Outlays................      0      2      3      3      1Additional Security Costs:    Estimated Authorization Level....      4      5     21     32     38    Estimated Outlays................      4      5     20     31     37Total Changes:    Estimated Authorization Level....      4     95    111    122    125    Estimated Outlays................      4     85    110    121    125------------------------------------------------------------------------       Basis of estimate: CBO assumes that the proposed      legislation will be enacted near the beginning of fiscal year      2007 and that the authorized amounts will be appropriated for      each year. We estimate that implementing the programs      specifically authorized by H.R. 2965 would cost $348 million      over the 2007-2011 period. In addition, CBO estimates that      implementing H.R. 2965 would cost the Bureau of Prisons $4      million in 2007 and nearly $100 million over the 2007-2011      period for additional security officers to supervise inmates     who would no longer be working as a result of implementing      this legislation.     Enhanced in-prison vocational assessment and training       The bill would authorize the Attorney General to establish      a Federal Enhanced In-Prison Vocational Assessment and      Training Program in federal institutions and would authorize      the appropriation of $75 million a year beginning in fiscal      year 2008 for this program. Assuming the appropriation of the      specified amounts, CBO estimates that the enhanced program      would cost $291 million over the 2007-2011 period.     FPI public service and donation programs       The legislation would authorize the Attorney General to      establish a new FPI program in federal prisons that, subject      to appropriation of the necessary amounts, would produce      goods to be donated to nonprofit organizations instead of      being offered for purchase to the federal government. In      addition, FPI would be authorized to contract with nonprofit      organizations and certain public entities for the use of      inmate labor to provide charitable services. The bill would      authorize the appropriation of $12 million for fiscal year      2008 and $48 million over the 2008-2011 period for these      programs.     Cognitive Abilities Assessment Demonstration program       Section 10 would authorize the appropriation of $3 million      for each of the fiscal years 2008, 2009, and 2010 for the      Bureau of Prisons to establish a Cognitive Abilities      Assessment Demonstration Program in 12 federal institutions.,      The project would assess inmates' cognitive abilities and      perceptual skills to determine what rehabilitative activities      would be most successful. CBO estimates that this provision      would cost $9 million over the 2007-2011 period, assuming the      appropriation of the authorized amounts.     Additional security costs       H.R. 2965 would phase out the requirement for federal      agencies to purchase products and services from FPI. During      the next five years, CBO expects that FPI's total sales to      the federal government would decrease by about 25 percent,      assuming that FPI would succeed in selling some products and      services under competitive bidding procurements.       The bill would limit FPI's sales to federal agencies to 20      percent of the governmentwide purchases of the kinds of      products FPI produces and 5 percent of the kinds of services      it provides--regardless of whether the government purchase      contracts are awarded on a noncompetitive or competitive      basis. The legislation, however, would authorize FPI's      board of directors to allow FPI a greater market share if      an agency has requested additional products or services or      if necessary to sustain inmates' work levels. CBO expects      that few inmates would lose work over the next five years      as a result of this restriction on FPI's market share      because we expect that the board would try to maintain the      number of inmates working for FPI.       Because of the reduction in federal sales, CBO expects that      there would be a corresponding reduction in the number of      inmates employed by FPI. Currently, no funds appropriated to      the Bureau of Prisons are used to provide security to      prisoners participating in FPI programs during work hours      because this security is provided by FPI. Based on      information from the Department of Justice about the number      of prison security personnel needed to guard the prison      population, CBO estimates that an additional 50 security      officers would be needed in fiscal year 2007 to secure      prisoners no longer working for FPI; that number would grow      to more than 400 by 2011. CBO estimates that providing      additional security officers would cost $4 million in 2007      and nearly $100 million over the five-year period.     Changes in FPI's direct spending       CBO estimates that, under the bill, total receipts      collected by FPI would decrease over the 5-year period as      agencies procure fewer FPI products. But that reduction in      collections would be offset by a reduction in the cost to      produce such products. Therefore, CBO estimates that enacting      this legislation would result in no significant net change in      direct spending for each year.     Impact on other Federal agencies       The bill would phase out current requirements that federal      agencies purchase certain products and services from FPI on a      noncompetitive basis. That change might enable agencies to      acquire some products or services less expensively through a      competitive procurement process. In recent years, agencies      have purchased $800 million to $900 million worth of goods      and services from FPI. CBO has no basis for estimating the      savings that might result, but they would likely be a small      percentage of the total sales.       Estimated impact on State, local, and Tribal Governments:      H.R. 2095 contains an intergovernmental mandate as defined in      UMRA because it would require most work programs in state and      local prisons that provide services in interstate commerce to      obtain federal certification in order to continue operating      after September 2010 or after the end of their current      contract. CBO estimates that the administrative cost to      obtain this certification would be insignificant and well      below the threshold established in UMRA ($64 million in 2007,      adjusted annually for inflation). This bill would impose no      other significant costs on state, local, or tribal      governments.       Estimated impact on the private sector: This bill contains      no new private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA.

Sunshine, Assistant      Director for Budget Analysis.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Pages E1698-E1699]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov][Page E1698-E1699]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov][DOCID:cr12se06-66]                                  CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE FOR H.R. 2965                                 ______                                                     HON.
