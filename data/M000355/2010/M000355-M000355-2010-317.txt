 President, this resolution concerns a civil action filed against eight Senators for actions taken in their official capacity as legislators in the process of considering health care legislation. This lawsuit is not cognizable before the federal courts. The actions at issue in this case are part of the legislative process and are not subject to review by the courts. This resolution authorizes the Senate Legal Counsel to represent the Senators named as defendants in this case and to move for its dismissal.
