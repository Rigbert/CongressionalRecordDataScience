 President, I very much want to thank my colleagues for engaging in this discussion today. I ask unanimous consent to have the legal opinion sent to us by the GAO General Counsel printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:     Subject: Federal Aviation Administration--Authority to          Auction Airport Arrival and Departure Slots and to Retain          and Use Auction Proceeds                              Government Accountability Office                               Washington, DC, September 30, 2008.     Hon. James L. Oberstar,     Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,          House of Representatives.     Hon. Patty Murray,     Chairman, Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing, and Urban          Development, and Related Agencies, Committee on          Appropriations, U.S. Senate.     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,     Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Transportation,          Housing, and Urban Development, and Related Agencies,          Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate.     Hon. Frank R. Lautenberg,     Hon. Robert Menendez,     Hon. Charles E. Schumer,     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,     U.S. Senate.       This responds to your request for our legal opinion      regarding the authority of the Federal Aviation      Administration (FAA) to auction airport arrival and departure      slots. As part of its efforts to reduce congestion in the      national airspace, in April and May 2008, FAA issued proposed      regulations to conduct such auctions at three New York-area      airports--LaGuardia Airport (LaGuardia), John     F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), and Newark Liberty      International Airport (Newark) at some time in the future. In      August 2008, FAA announced that it was proceeding to auction      two specific slots at Newark on September 3, an action that      has since been administratively stayed. On September 16,      2008, FAA announced that ``[i]n accordance with rulemaking      activity that is not yet complete'' and ``if the rule is      adopted,'' it may auction slots at Newark, LaGuardia, and JFK      starting on January 12, 2009. As agreed with your staff, this      opinion addresses whether FAA has authority to auction slots      and if it does, whether it may retain and use funds obtained      through such auctions.       We conclude that FAA currently lacks authority to auction      arrival and departure slots, and thus also lacks authority to      retain and use auction proceeds. For the first time since it      began regulating U.S. navigable airspace nearly 40 years ago,      FAA now asserts that it may assign the use of that airspace      using its general property management authority. According to      FAA, slots are intangible ``property'' that it      ``constructs,'' owns, and may ``lease'' for ``adequate      compensation'' under 49 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 106 (l)(6) and (n)      and 40110(a)(2). An examination of those statutes read as a      whole, however, makes clear that Congress was using the term      ``property'' to refer to traditional forms of property. It      was not referring to FAA's regulatory authority to assign      airspace slots, no matter how valuable those slots may be in      the hands of the regulated community. Related case law      confirms our conclusion. The only other source of authority      for FAA to raise funds in connection with its slot      assignments is the Independent Offices Appropriations Act      (IOAA), 31 U.S.C. Sec. 9701, commonly referred to as the      ``user fee statute,'' but that authority is currently      unavailable. Since 1998, Congress has, through annual      appropriations restrictions, specifically prohibited FAA from      imposing ``new aviation user fees,'' and we conclude that      proceeds from FAA's proposed auctions would constitute such a      fee. Accordingly, in our opinion, FAA lacks a legal basis to      go forward with the Newark auction or any other auction, and      if FAA were to go forward with auctioning slots without      obtaining the necessary authority and retained and used the      proceeds, GAO would raise exceptions under its account      settlement authority for violations of the ``purpose      statute,'' 31 U.S.C. Sec. 1301(a), and the Antideficiency      Act, 31 U.S.C. Sec. 1341(a)(1)(A).                               background       FAA's control of congestion in the national airspace by use      of a ``reservation'' or ``slot'' system is not new. What is      new is FAA's proposal to assign the slots by auction. FAA      first instituted a slot control system nearly 40 years ago,      in 1968, in the so-called High Density Rule. See 33 Fed. Reg.      17896, 17898 (Dec. 3, 1968); 14 C.F.R. Sec. Sec. 93.121-     93.129 (1969). Supplementing the traditional first-come,      first-served traffic control system, the High Density Rule      capped the number of hourly arrivals and departures permitted      at five designated ``high density traffic airports''--     LaGuardia, JFK, Newark, Washington National Airport      (Washington National), and Chicago O'Hare International      Airport--and required air carriers to obtain a      ``reservation'' for these operations from Air Traffic Control      (ATC). The number of reservations available for assignment      varied by airport, time of day, and class of user.       In promulgating the High Density Rule, FAA acknowledged      that it was acting pursuant to its regulatory authority to      ensure the efficient use of the national airspace under      sections 307(a) and (c) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958.      33 Fed. Reg. at 17897, 17898. That act created FAA (as the      Federal Aviation Agency) and directed the FAA Administrator      to: ``assign by rule, regulation, or order the use of the      navigable airspace under such terms, conditions, and      limitations as he may deem necessary in order to insure the      safety of aircraft and the efficient utilization of such      airspace. He may modify or revoke such assignment when      required by the public interest. . . . [The Administrator      also] is authorized to prescribe air traffic rules and      regulations governing the flight of aircraft, for the      navigation, protection, and identification of aircraft, for      the protection of persons and property on the ground, and for      the efficient utilization of the navigable airspace. . . .''       Federal Aviation Act of 1958, Pub. L. No. 85-726,      Sec. 307(a), (c), 72 Stat. 731, 749-50, 49 U.S.C. Sec. 1348      (a), (c) (1968) (emphasis added). See generally Northwest      Airlines, Inc. v. Goldschmidt, 645 F.2d 1309 (8th Cir. 1981)      (upholding 1980 amendment to High Density Rule as exercise of      FAA's section 307(a) and (c) authority to regulate efficient      use of airspace).       Reservations under the High Density Rule initially were      allocated by agreements between the airlines (acting through      airport scheduling committees) and ATC and by rule, the vast      majority of reservations were set aside for assignment to      scheduled air carriers. See 14 C.F.R. Sec. 93.123(a) (1969).      Because only a few carriers held certificates of public      convenience and necessity for these airports, as required      prior to deregulation of the airline industry in the early      1980's, there was only limited competition for the      reservations. With deregulation, however, any licensed      carrier could service any high density airport, with the      result that airport scheduling committees could no longer      reach agreements acceptable to prospective new entrants and      incumbent airlines wishing to expand their operations.       To accommodate the resulting demand for reservations while      ensuring continuity of operations for carriers providing      regularly scheduled service, FAA amended the High Density      Rule effective in 1986. See 50 Fed. Reg. 52180 (Dec. 20,      1985). It again acknowledged that it was acting pursuant to      its regulatory authority under sections 307(a) and (c) of the      Federal Aviation Act to ensure the efficient use of the      national airspace. Id. at 52181. Under a      ``grandfather'' policy, FAA initially assigned most      reservations--now called ``slots''--to the carriers who      already held them under scheduling committee agreements.      For the first time, FAA also authorized carriers to sell,      lease, or otherwise transfer the slots among themselves,      subject to confirmation by FAA and to a determination by      the Secretary of Transportation that transfer ``will not      be injurious to the essential air service program.'' Slots      could be withdrawn at any time for FAA operational needs,      and under a ``use-or-lose'' provision, slots not used 65      percent of the time would be recalled. FAA made clear that      ``[s]lots do not represent a property right but represent      an operating privilege subject to absolute FAA control.''       In issuing the 1986 amendments, FAA noted that it had      decided not to pursue a proposal it had made in 1980, to      assign slots by means of an auction. It explained this was      because ``legislation would be required for the collection      and disposition of the proceeds.'' Id. at 52183. FAA noted      that ``several unresolved legal questions'' had been raised      by the Department of Justice which DOJ believed would make an      auction ``impractical,'' citing the Independent Offices      Appropriations Act (IOAA), 31 U.S.C. Sec. 9701, commonly      referred to as the ``user fee statute.'' IOAA could be      problematic, FAA noted, ``if these proceeds were to be      applied for airport improvements . . . .'' Id. As FAA had      explained in its earlier proposal, this is because ``in      accordance with [IOAA], the money received as a result of any      auction system will not be retained by DOT but will be paid      into the Treasury of the United States. Other disposition of      the revenues . . . [is] not now authorized by statute.'' 45      Fed. Reg. 71236, 71240, 71241 (Oct. 27, 1980).       Over time, Congress became concerned that the High Density      Rule, particularly the 1986 amendments, hurt competition,      unfairly favored incumbent airlines, and was not the best      means to reduce congestion. After enacting several measures      in the 1980s and 1990s requiring greater access for certain      service providers, in 2000, Congress directed FAA to phase      out the High Density Rule altogether, at LaGuardia, JFK, and      O'Hare, no later than January 1, 2007. At about this same      time, Congress also began to enact annual appropriations      restrictions prohibiting FAA from promulgating any ``new      aviation user fees'' unless specifically authorized by      statute. The first of these restrictions was enacted in 1997      for fiscal year 1998, and the most recent was enacted in 2007      for fiscal year 2008.       As the 2007 High Density Rule phase-out deadline      approached, FAA remained concerned about congestion. In      August 2006, it therefore proposed to continue caps on hourly      arrivals and departures at LaGuardia and to assign the      majority of slots (now called ``operating authorizations'')      to incumbent carriers. 71 Fed. Reg. 51360 (Aug. 29, 2006).      FAA also now proposed to set expiration dates for most slots,      with 10 percent of the slots each year to be redistributed,      as they expired, using a market-based mechanism yet to be      determined. FAA could not propose a specific market mechanism      at that time, it explained, because it lacked authority to do      so and would be seeking such authority from Congress: ``[FAA]      will seek authority to utilize market-based mechanisms at      LaGuardia in the future [to allocate capacity]. Such      legislation would be necessary to employ market-based      approaches such as auctions or congestion pricing at      LaGuardia because the FAA currently does not have the      statutory authority to assess market-clearing charges for a      landing or departure authorization. If Congress approves the      use of market-based mechanisms as we plan to propose, a new      rulemaking would be necessary to implement such measures at      LaGuardia.''       Id. at 51362 (emphasis added); see also id. at 51363. FAA      subsequently requested such authority from Congress, but it      has not been enacted. When FAA was unable to finalize its      2006 proposal before the January 1, 2007 phase-out deadline,      it issued a series of temporary ``capping orders''      maintaining caps and slots at LaGuardia, JFK, and Newark.       Finally, as noted above, in April and May 2008, FAA issued      its most recent proposals for a cap and slot system at      LaGuardia, JFK, and Newark. FAA proposes to continue to      assign the majority of slots to incumbent carriers and, as in      its 2006 proposal, to withdraw a portion of the slots for re-     distribution (along with unassigned slots). However, calling      its 2006 legal analysis ``overly simplistic'' and      ``incorrect,'' FAA now proposes to do what it previously      stated it had no authority to do: assign the withdrawn slots      by auctioning slot ``leaseholds'' to the highest bidder. The      proceeds from the auctions would either be retained by FAA      and used to mitigate congestion in the New York City area or,      after deducting FAA's administrative costs, paid to the      airline that previously held the auctioned slot. To impose      caps on hourly arrival and departure slots, FAA continues to      rely on its regulatory authority to ensure efficient use of      the airspace, now codified at 49 U.S.C. Sec. 40103(b)(1),      (2). See 73 Fed. Reg. at     20846, 29626. To assign the slots by auctioning slots      leaseholds, FAA for the first time relies on its general      authority to lease or otherwise dispose of ``property'' under      49 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 106 and 40110. See id. at 20853, 29631.                                analysis       Whether FAA may raise funds in connection with its      assignment of slots--by holding a slot auction, imposing a      user fee, assessing a tax, or by some other mechanism--     depends on whether it has the proper statutory authority.      Congress has granted FAA explicit statutory authority to      collect fees in several different situations, but no explicit      authority exists for the imposition of fees related to the      assignment of slots. We therefore look to whether FAA has any      other authority that would permit it to auction slots.     I. FAA's authority to auction slots under its property          disposition authority       In evaluating whether FAA may assign slots using its      general property disposition authority, it is important to      understand what a slot is. FAA has consistently characterized      a slot as an ``operating authorization'' or ``operational      authority'' to conduct one operation (arrival or departure)      in the airspace during a specified time period. At the five      high density airports, this authorization is in addition to      the authorization or ``clearance'' that must be obtained from      ATC to operate within the airspace at those facilities. 14      C.F.R. Sec. Sec. 91.131(a)(1), 91.173. While these two      authorizations differ in some respects--clearances are      normally required of all users of this airspace, while slots,      due to capacity demands, are issued only to some users--both      constitute regulatory permission without which aircraft may      not be operated. So understood, a slot is a regulatory      license--a legal permission, revocable by FAA, to conduct an      act that otherwise would not be permitted.       As FAA itself emphasizes, it is also important to      understand that caps and slots are two interconnected parts      of FAA's regulatory structure to ensure the efficient use of      the airspace. 2008 FAA Letter at 1. Limiting aircraft traffic      by capping the number of arrivals and departures reduces the      amount of traffic that is airborne, but it does not avoid the      backup of aircraft seeking access to the air traffic system      or provide a mechanism for prioritizing traffic. Assigning      slots accomplishes this objective; without slots, traffic      will queue on a first-come-first-served basis (as it does at      non-slot controlled airports), undermining scheduling.      Whether the assignment system is called a reservation system,      an operating authorization system, or a slot system, the use      of an assignment mechanism is key to accomplishing what FAA      believes is necessary to promote orderly and efficient      traffic flow and use of airspace.       According to FAA, however, slots are not a license but      ``property'' that it ``acquires'' or ``constructs'' and, as      the property ``owner,'' may ``lease'' using its general      property disposition and contracting authority in 49 U.S.C.      Sec. Sec. 106 (l)(6) and (n) and 40110(a)(2). Section      106(n)(1) authorizes FAA: ``(A) to acquire (by purchase,      lease, condemnation, or otherwise), construct, improve,      repair, operate, and maintain--(i) air traffic control      facilities and equipment; (ii) research testing sites and      facilities; and (iii) such other real and personal property      (including office space and patents), or any interest therein      . . . as the Administrator considers necessary; [and] (B) to      lease to others such real and personal property . . . .''       Section 106(l)(6) authorizes FAA: ``[to enter into] such      contracts, leases, cooperative agreements, or other      transactions as may be necessary to carry out the functions      of FAA.''       Section 40110(a)(2) authorizes FAA: ``[to] dispose of an      interest in property for adequate compensation. . . .''     (All emphasis added.)       As evidence that these provisions authorize slots to be      ``leased'' as ``property,'' FAA points to bankruptcy      proceedings where slots subject to lease have been accorded      some proprietary status. 2008 FAA Brief at 41-43. FAA asserts      that it, too, has a property interest in slots subject to      lease because: (1) FAA has sovereignty over U.S. navigable      airspace; (2) airspace has been characterized as ``public      property;'' (3) FAA regulates the use of navigable airspace;      (4) as a ``product'' of its regulation, FAA has      ``constructed'' slots as an ``intangible property interest''      in airspace use; and (5) as the slot ``constructor,'' FAA      ``owns'' and may ``lease'' its ``intangible'' slots. FAA      states further that it may--in fact, must--charge ``adequate      compensation,'' and even ``market prices,'' for this      ``property'' under 49 U.S.C. Sec. 40110. 2008 FAA Brief at      41, 50-53.       As discussed below, however, slots are not ``property''      subject to FAA's property disposition authority. Nor are they      the mere ``product'' of FAA regulation; they are FAA      regulation. Moreover, FAA's argument that slots are property      proves too much--it suggests that the agency has been      improperly giving away potentially millions of dollars of      federal property, for no compensation, since it created the      slot system in 1968.                                   A.       Parsing its property acquisition and disposition      authorities under 49 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 106(n) and 40110(a)(2)      and applying general dictionary definitions, FAA maintains      that when it uses its regulatory authority to delineate a      time period for authorized takeoff or landing--a slot--it      ``constructs'' or ``acquires'' an intangible ``property''      interest in airspace use that it may ``lease'' to others for      ``adequate compensation.'' 2008 FAA Letter at 2-3; 2008 FAA      Brief at 47-48. ``Understanding Congressional will requires      more than the mechanical application of dictionary      definitions,'' however, see Faircloth v. Lundy Packing Co.,      91 F.3d 648, 660 (4th Cir. 1996) (Michael, J., concurring and      dissenting), and it is a cardinal rule of statutory      construction that statutes must be read as a whole, ``since      the meaning of statutory language, plain or not, depends on      context.'' King v. St. Vincent's Hospital, 502 U.S. 215, 221      (1991) (citations omitted). When taken in context and read as      a whole, the term ``property'' as used in FAA's statute      clearly refers to traditional property, not to FAA's      regulatory licensing authority over the use of navigable      airspace. Almost all of the ``property'' examples listed in      49 U.S.C. Sec. 106(n)(1) are traditional tangible property--     real estate, equipment, and infrastructure--and the      legislative history repeats the same examples. See H. R.      Conf. Rep. 104-848 (1996) at 107, 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3703,      3729. The other example referenced in Sec. 106(n)--a patent--      has long been recognized as intangible property. Other      terminology used in Sec. 106(n)(1) reinforces that Congress      was referring to traditional property. For example, the      statute refers to property that is ``leased'' and      ``condemned'' (applied to traditional real property) and      ``constructed, improved, repaired, operated, and maintained''      (applied to traditional real and personal property). Under      the statutory construction rule of ejusdem generis, ``such      other . . . property . . . or any interest therein'' as used      in Sec. 106(n)(1)(A) must mean property of a nature similar      to the traditional real and personal property examples cited      in the statute. This would not include FAA's regulatory      authorizations for aircraft takeoffs and landings--that is,      slots.       The structure of FAA's statutory authority and its      legislative history support this conclusion. Congress has      given FAA different authorities to carry out different      responsibilities--it has regulatory authority in 49 U.S.C.      Sec. 40103 to ensure the safe and efficient use of the      navigable airspace, and property acquisition and disposition      authority in 49 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 106 and 40110 to support      FAA's mission and general operations. As relevant here, FAA      has had these same basic authorities since its creation in      1958. The fact that Congress authorized FAA to carry out its      regulatory responsibilities (including assignment of slots)      under the strictures of Sec. 40103 undercuts FAA's argument      that Congress simultaneously authorized FAA to carry out many      of these same responsibilities under the very different      strictures of Sec. Sec. 106 and 40110. Congress has never      suggested as much in the half-century of FAA's existence,      nor, until 2008, has FAA. Thus FAA may not rely on its      general property disposition authority to carry out its      regulatory slot assignment functions. See, e.g., American      Petroleum Inst. v. EPA, 52 F.3d 1113, 1119-20 (D.C. Cir.      1995) (EPA cannot rely on general rulemaking authority to      regulate air pollutant in manner conflicting with authority      specific to that pollutant and ``cannot uncouple the first      sentence of [Clean Air Act provision] from the rest of the      section in order to expand its authority beyond the aims and      limits of the section as a whole.'').       Finally, FAA's reading of its property authority,      particularly the purported significance of a 1996 amendment      to that authority, is unavailing because it would interfere      with Congress' constitutional prerogatives to set      programmatic spending levels and oversee agency activities.      U.S. Const. Art. I, Sec. 9, cl. 7. As noted above, in the      past FAA has considered imposing a user fee under IOAA in      connection with its assignment of slots. Congress also has      considered FAA's imposition of user fees. In FAA's 1996      reauthorization legislation, for example, Congress authorized      FAA to charge certain cost-based user fees, but called for      further study of the agency's funding needs and funding      mechanisms. See Air Traffic Management System Performance      Improvement Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-264, Title II,      Sec. Sec. 221(12), 273, 274. And in 1997, Congress enacted      the first of its now-annual appropriations restrictions      expressly prohibiting FAA from imposing any ``new aviation      user fees'' without specific statutory authority. FAA      nevertheless asserts that when Congress amended its property      authority in the 1996 reauthorization act by enacting      Sec. 106(n)--which clarified FAA's property acquisition      authority to include personal as well as real property, and      authority not just to ``acquire'' property but, as discussed      above, to ``construct, improve, repair, operate, and      maintain'' it, see Pub. L. No. 104-264, Sec. 228, codified at      49 U.S.C. 106(n)--this amendment granted FAA authority to      ``construct'' and auction slots. 2008 FAA Brief at 47-48.      Given Congress' substantial concerns about FAA's imposing      user fees in 1996 and its outright ban on new FAA aviation      user fees the following year, we find it highly unlikely that      Congress at the same time authorized FAA to obtain non-     appropriations funding through the ``back door'' of its      general property disposition authority.                                   B.       Case law regarding the legal status of slots and regulatory      licenses confirms our conclusion that slots are not      ``property'' in the hands of FAA. To demonstrate that slots      are property, FAA cites three bankruptcy cases--In re McClain      Airlines, Inc., 80 B.R. 175 (Bankr. D. Ariz. 1987); In re      American Central Airlines, 52 B.R. 567 (Bankr. N.D. Iowa      1985); and In re Gull Air, Inc., 890 F.2d 1255 (1st Cir.     1989)--which considered whether an airline in bankruptcy had      a sufficient proprietary interest in its slots to include      them as ``property of the estate'' (or in McClain, an      interest in a right to seek restoration of a withdrawn slot).      2008 FAA Brief at 42-43, 61; 2008 FAA Letter at 3. The courts      in these cases focused in part on the fact that after FAA's      1986 amendments to the High Density Rule, carriers could      sell, lease, or otherwise transfer slots among themselves.       The cases do not support FAA's position. At most, they      recognize the undisputed fact that slots have value in the      hands of carriers to whom they are assigned, at least when      the slots are transferable to other carriers. The decisions      do not address the issue we face here: the nature of slots      when they are unassigned and ``held'' by FAA. In fact, the      cases underscore the limited nature of slots even after they      are assigned: they remain subject to FAA withdrawal at any      time for operational reasons and to FAA recall for non-use.      In Gull Air, for example, the most recent, and the only      appellate court, decision cited by FAA, FAA itself argued      that slots were not the carrier's property but rather,      as specified in FAA's regulations, ``operating privileges      subject to absolute FAA control.'' 890 F.2d at 1258. The      First Circuit Court of Appeals ruled only that slots'      transferability under the High Density Rule created a      ``limited proprietary interest in slots'' that is      ``encumbered by conditions that FAA imposed in its      regulations.'' Id. at 1260. The court declined to decide      whether the slots constituted ``property of the estate''      because whatever that interest was, it was lost      automatically under FAA's ``use or lose'' requirement when      the airline ceased operations. Thus Gull Air stands only      for the proposition that slots have one characteristic of      property--transferability--which may qualify slots as      ``property of the estate'' under the Bankruptcy Code when      held by carriers. This is a far cry from finding that      slots are FAA's ``property'' subject to its property      disposition statute.       Furthermore, even if slots were not transferable, there is      little doubt that they have value to carriers. Yet the U.S.      Supreme Court has made clear that the fact that a government      license is valuable to the license holder does not render the      license ``property'' in the hands of the issuing agency.      Rather, the license is ``no more and no less than [the      agency's] sovereign power to regulate.'' Cleveland v. United      States, 531 U.S. 12, 23 (2000). In Cleveland, the Supreme      Court had to decide whether a Louisiana video poker machine      license was ``property'' under the federal mail fraud      statute, which makes it a felony to use the mail to further      ``any scheme . . . to defraud, or for obtaining money or      property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses . . . .''      18 U.S.C. 1341 (emphasis added). Upholding the rulings of      five circuit courts of appeals, the unanimous Supreme Court      ruled that the licenses were not ``property'' when held by      the issuing state agency:       ``Without doubt, Louisiana has a substantial economic stake      in the video poker industry. The State collects an upfront      `processing fee' for each new license application . . ., a      separate `processing fee' for each renewal application . . .,      an `annual fee' from each device owner . . ., an additional      `device operation' fee . . ., and, most importantly, a fixed      percentage of net revenue from each video poker device . . .      It is hardly evident, however, why these tolls should make      video poker licenses `property' in the hands of the State.      The State receives the lion's share of its expected revenue      not while the licenses remain in its own hands, but only      after they have been issued to licensees. Licenses pre-     issuance do not generate an ongoing stream of revenue. At      most, they entitle the State to collect a processing fee from      applicants for new licenses. Were an entitlement of this      order sufficient to establish a state property right, one      could scarcely avoid the conclusion that States have property      rights in any license or permit requiring an up front fee,      including drivers' licenses, medical licenses, and fishing      and hunting licenses. Such licenses, as the Government itself      concedes, are `purely regulatory.'''     531 U.S. at 22 (second emphasis added).       FAA compares its proposed slot leases to patents, a type of      intangible property it is authorized to dispose of under 49      U.S.C. 106(n)(1)(A)(ii). 2008Sec. FAA Brief at 33, 51. But      the Cleveland Court rejected this patent analogy, which had      been made by the United States:       ``[T]hese intangible rights of allocation, exclusion, and      control amount to no more and no less than Louisiana's      sovereign power to regulate. . . [T]he state's right of      control does not create a property interest any more than a      law licensing liquor sales in a State that levies a sales tax      on liquor. Such regulations are paradigmatic exercises of the      States' traditional police powers.       ``The Government compares the State's interest in video      poker licenses to a patent holder's interest in a patent that      she has not yet licensed. Although it is true that both      involve the right to exclude, we think the congruence ends      there. Louisiana does not conduct gaming operations itself,      it does not hold video poker licenses to reserve that      prerogative, and it does not ``sell'' video poker licenses in      the ordinary commercial sense. Furthermore, while a patent      holder may sell her patent . . ., the State may not sell its      licensing authority. Instead of a patent holder's interest in      an unlicensed patent, the better analogy is to the Federal      Government's interest in an unissued patent. That interest,      like the State's interest in licensing video poker      operations, surely implicates the Government's role as      sovereign, not as property holder.''     531 U.S. at 23-24 (emphasis added).       Just as Louisiana did not run the video poker machines in      Cleveland, so FAA does not operate commercial air carriers.      Just as Louisiana regulated gaming as part of its police      power to protect the public welfare, so FAA regulates air      traffic as part of its responsibility to ensure efficient use      of the national airspace. As in Cleveland, the fact that      FAA's slots have value to slot holders does not transform      them into alienable ``property'' in FAA's hands. FAA seeks to      distinguish Cleveland because the licenses there were not      transferable, and because a rule of leniency applicable to      criminal statutes drove the Supreme Court's interpretation.      As noted above regarding Gull Air, however, slot      transferability is irrelevant to FAA's ``property'' rights      because slots do not acquire this trait until after FAA      assigns them. And while FAA's property disposition provisions      are not criminal statutes, studied skepticism in defining      their reach is also warranted. In this regard, there is an      acute public interest in protecting Congress' exercise of its      constitutional responsibility to set spending levels through      the appropriations process, and as discussed above, this      would be jeopardized if FAA could circumvent the      appropriations process by obtaining funding through slot      auctions.     II. FAA's authority to auction slots under its user fee          authority       Because FAA may not auction slots under its property      disposition authority and has no explicit authority to charge      a fee for the assignment of slots, the only other arguable      authority on which FAA could rely is IOAA. That authority is      currently unavailable because as of fiscal year 1998,      Congress has prohibited FAA's imposition of any new aviation      user fees unless it obtains specific statutory authority.      Because FAA lacks authority to collect such fees, if it      nevertheless goes forward with an auction, it may not retain      or use the proceeds.       To understand the impact of Congress' prohibition, some      context and a brief history are helpful. FAA is funded from a      combination of sources, which can be roughly divided into      three types: excise tax revenue, General Fund appropriations,      and reimbursements from services provided and user fees      charged. FAA, Fiscal Year 2007 Performance and Accountability      Report, at 121. For the last 10 years, Congress has annually      prohibited FAA from implementing any ``new aviation user      fees'' not authorized by Congress. The prohibition first      appeared in the 1998 Department of Transportation and Related      Agencies Appropriations Act and stated:       ``[N]one of the funds in this Act shall be available for      the Federal Aviation Administration to plan, finalize, or      implement any regulation that would promulgate new aviation      user fees not specifically authorized by law after the date      of enactment of this Act.''       Pub. L. No. 105-66, 111 Stat. 1425, 1429 (1997). At the      time, the Conference Committee expressed ``very serious      concerns,'' ``on both technical and policy-related grounds,''      about new aviation user fees that FAA had proposed. The      Committee made clear that the existing excise tax system,      supplemented by appropriated funds, would provide sufficient      revenue for FAA without new fees. H. R. Rep. No. 105-313 at      40-41 (Conf. Rep.) (1997). The Committee specifically      acknowledged the authority that IOAA generally provides to      agencies and made clear that it intended to restrict this      authority in FAA's case:       ``The conferees are aware of FAA's opinion that the agency      has the legal authority to establish new user fees under the      generic authority provided in the User Fee Statute, and do      not wish to see FAA circumvent the legislative process and      avoid the normal cost controls which apply to other federal      agencies through the administrative implementation of new      user fees. The conferees emphasize, however, that this      provision does not prevent the FAA from implementing new      user fees. It only provides that such fees must be      specifically authorized by the Congress.''       Id. at 41. A slightly modified version of the restriction      has been included in every subsequent yearly appropriation.      The 2008 fiscal year prohibition states:       ``[N]one of the funds in this [Appropriations] Act shall be      available for the Federal Aviation Administration to finalize      or implement any regulation that would promulgate new      aviation user fees not specifically authorized by law after      the date of the enactment of this Act.''       Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-161,      121 Stat. 1844, 2379 (2007).       In considering the fiscal year 2008 prohibition, the House      Committee on Appropriations commented on its ``serious      concerns about the impact of user fees,'' and the Senate      Committee on Appropriations expressed its desire that ``any      degradation in the Committee's ability to annually set      programmatic spending levels and oversee the agency's      spending habits as part of the reauthorization process should      be strenuously resisted.''       This fiscal year 2008 prohibition precludes FAA's use of      IOAA as authority to auction slots because FAA's slot      auctions would amount to a ``new aviation user fee'' not      specifically authorized by law. FAA has never previously      imposed a fee for authorization to use navigable airspace at      a specific time; thus FAA's slot auction would constitute      exactly the type of ``new aviation user fee''     that Congress has prohibited. Indeed, FAA recognized that      slot auctions would constitute a user fee when it proposed to      institute such a fee in 1980, and again in 1986 when it      decided not to do so. FAA also appeared to recognize that      slot auctions would constitute a user fee in 2006 and 2007      when, in the face of the annual appropriations restrictions,      it promised to and did seek legislation authorizing it to      conduct the auctions. FAA's April 2008 proposal in fact      acknowledges that because of the appropriations restriction,      FAA ``continues to believe that it cannot rely on a market-     based [slot] allocation method under a purely regulatory      approach, which is why it explicitly sought legislation on      this matter.'' 73 Fed. Reg. at 20846, 20852.       FAA suggests that because it will conduct the Newark      auction by solicitation of bids for slot leases, rather than      by issuance of a new regulation, the language of the 2008      Consolidated Appropriations Act--which prohibits ``any      regulation'' imposing new aviation user fees--does not apply.      2008 FAA Brief at 61 n. 36. Contrary to FAA's suggestion,      because the auction would, in effect, amount to a user fee      under IOAA, and IOAA requires agencies to prescribe      regulations to impose new user fees, see 31 U.S.C.      Sec. 9701(b), implementation of the auction would require a      new regulation. FAA cannot elude the requirements of      otherwise applicable law simply by failing to follow the      law's requirements. ``It is axiomatic that an agency cannot      do indirectly what it is not permitted to do directly.''      Forest Products Laboratory Agreement with University of      Wisconsin, 55 Comp. Gen. 1059 (1976).       FAA points to examples of other agencies auctioning or      charging market-based fees for use of public lands or other      public ``property.'' 2008 FAA Brief at 48-49. These are      inapposite because unlike FAA, those agencies had specific      statutory authority for their activities. See, e.g, 16 U.S.C.      Sec. 472a (U.S. Department of Agriculture auction of timber      rights on National Forest Service land); 43 U.S.C. Sec. 315b      (U.S. Department of Interior issuance of grazing permits for      public lands for ``reasonable fees''). FAA's most analogous      example is the Federal Communications Commission's auction of      license rights to the electromagnetic spectrum. Again,      however, Congress has specifically authorized the FCC to      conduct such auctions, including specifying the conditions      necessary for auction, bidder qualifications, and treatment      of auction proceeds. See 47 U.S.C. Sec. 309(j). As discussed      above, despite FAA's specific requests, Congress has given      FAA no comparable auction authority.       Finally, even if Congress were to remove the annual      appropriations restriction that prohibits FAA from      promulgating new aviation user fees, without other specific      authority, it could impose only a cost-based fee, not the      type of market-based fee it seeks to obtain by auctioning      slots to the highest bidder. Under IOAA, when an agency is      but one actor in the marketplace, it acts in a commercial,      non-governmental capacity and may charge a fee based on the      market price of the service provided. When instead an agency      exercises its sovereign power and regulates activities based      on public policy goals--as FAA would be acting, if it were to      auction slots--it acts in a regulatory capacity, and user      fees are limited to the agency's costs of providing the      specific benefit to the individual recipient. If FAA's fee      were based on market value and exceeded its cost of providing      the slot to the recipient airline, the fee could rise to the      level of a tax. A tax would be beyond IOAA's grant of      authority and FAA would have to have some other      Congressionally-delegated authority to impose it. National      Cable Television Ass'n, Inc. v. United States, 415 U.S. 336,      341 (1974); National Park Service--Special Park Use Fees, B-     307319, Aug. 23, 2007.                               CONCLUSION       We conclude that FAA may not auction slots under its      property disposition authority, user fee authority, or any      other authority, and thus also may not retain or use proceeds      of any such auctions. Going forward with the planned Newark      auction or any other auction would be without legal basis,      and if FAA conducted an auction and retained and used the      proceeds, GAO would raise significant exceptions, under its      account settlement authority, 31 U.S.C. Sec. 3526, for      violations of the ``purpose statute,'' 31 U.S.C.      Sec. 1301(a), and the Antideficiency Act, 31 U.S.C.      Sec. 1341(a)(1)(A).
