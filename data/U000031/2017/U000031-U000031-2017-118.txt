Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, this bill authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, upon request, to extend by 6 years the time period during which construction must commence on the Flannagan Dam and Reservoir Hydroelectric Project located in Dickenson County, Virginia. Additionally, FERC may reinstate the construction license if it is expired.  The bill, again, passed under suspension in the 114th Congress, and I would hope that we could do the same today in a bipartisan way.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I again rise in support of legislation by Mr. Griffith, H.R. 447, which would extend the deadline for commencement of construction of the Flannagan Hydroelectric Project, to be located at the Army Corps of Engineers' John W. Flannagan Dam on the Russell Fork River in Dickenson County, Virginia.  The licensee for the Flannagan Hydroelectric Project did not commence construction by the already-extended deadline in January 2016. Legislation is now required for the project to move forward.  The bill would authorize FERC to extend for up to three consecutive years the date by which the licensee is required to commence construction.  During the last Congress, the full House of Representatives passed similar legislation by voice vote. I once again hope my colleagues will help me in supporting passage of H.R. 447. Let's get this one built, too.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
