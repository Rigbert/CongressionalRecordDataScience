I want to thank our very distinguished conference chair for his eloquent defense of innocent human life, for his steadfastness on this issue, and point out when my good friend and colleague mentioned Planned Parenthood, I think most Americans would be shocked and dismayed and even discouraged to learn that Planned Parenthood alone performs approximately 300,000 abortions in their own clinics every year, and that number is going up.  They seek even more money from the Federal Government, in part to expand their capability, their capacity. More clinics equals more dead babies and more wounded mothers.  I yield to my good friend and colleague from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett), Scott Garrett.
