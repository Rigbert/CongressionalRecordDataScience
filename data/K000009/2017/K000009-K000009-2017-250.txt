Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Phil Walton, who is retiring from public service after a remarkable 42 year career with the Social Security Administration. Mr. Walton exemplifies the sterling qualities of a public servant who upholds the highest standards of federal service: one of a loyal and enlightened corps of highly trained, honorable civil servants. The administrative capabilities of individuals like Mr. Walton hold this Republic together.  Phil Walton began his career with the Social Security Administration in Rock Island, Illinois, where he started as a claims representative. He soon began rising through the ranks as a field representative, operations supervisor, operations officer, area administrative assistant, executive assistant and district manager. He was first named District Manager in Chillicothe, Ohio, moving to Toledo, Ohio in 1993 where he has ably guided the Toledo agency since.  In addition to his leadership of the Toledo Social Security Office, Phil has been an active community leader since his arrival to the Toledo area. He served as a Cubmaster, Den Leader and Area Commissioner for the Boy Scouts of America. He has been a member of the Friends of Wood County CASA, currently serving as Board Chair. He has also served on the Advisory Board of the Toledo Legal Aid Society.  As a member of the National Council of Social Security Management Associations, Phil was awarded the Public Service Award in 2009 ``in recognition of his years of volunteer work.'' Erin Thompson, public affairs specialist for the Toledo Social Security Office, stated, ``We would like to take the time to thank Phil Walton for his 42 years of service with Social Security, where he started as a Claims Representative in 1975 in Rock Island, Illinois and completes his career as a District Manager of Toledo downtown, where he has been since 1993. In addition to leading the Toledo office, he has been on numerous boards, most notable as the Chairperson for the Area Office on Aging 2009 to the present. In addition to his service for seniors, he has also served as Board President for the Friends of Wood County CASA from 2007 to present.''  Phil has given of his time and talents to the Area Office on Aging of Northwest Ohio Board of Directors, serving in various capacities since 1993 and as Board President since 2009. Billie Johnson, President and CEO of the agency, notes ``Phil Walton has been a dedicated Board member of the Area Office on Aging of Northwestern Ohio, Inc. for more than twenty years. His leadership, compassion and wisdom helped the agency grow and develop many vital services for older adults, caregivers and disabled persons living in northwest Ohio. Phil helped the agency navigate through several monumental funding challenges. He has given his time, personal resources and energy to so many people and various communities in northwest Ohio. We are extremely grateful for his commitment, dedication and leadership. Phil is the current Board Chairman for the Area Office on Aging.''  American labor leader Walter Reuther said, ``There is no greater calling than to serve your fellow men. There is no greater contribution than to help the weak. There is no greater satisfaction than to have done it well.'' Phil Walton's life and career have been given over to serving his fellow citizens, to helping the weakest among us--those who are elderly, those who are disabled, children. He has done it very well. His legacy is in the lives which were made better for his efforts, in those with whom he worked to ensure a top-notch federal government agency and services, in the organizations which have benefitted from his investment and leadership, and a community richer for his contributions. On this day as Phil turns the page from career to retirement, we offer a most heartfelt ``thank you'' for his extraordinary commitment to our nation and its people. As he ends his public life and looks toward retirement, he has fulfilled Mohammad Ali's call that ``Service to others is the payment you make for your space here on earth.''                          ____________________
