Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 655) condemning the crackdown on democracy protestors in Tiananmen Square, Beijing, in the People's Republic of China on the 15th anniversary of that tragic massacre.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 655       Whereas the United States was founded on the principle that      all men and women are created equal and entitled to the      exercise of their basic human rights;       Whereas freedom of expression, assembly, association, and      religion are fundamental human rights that belong to all      people and are recognized as such under the United Nations      Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on      Civil and Political Rights;       Whereas the horrific events of June 3-4, 1989, in Tiananmen      Square, Beijing, in the People's Republic of China, reminded      the world that these universal human rights are denied to the      citizens of the most populous nation on earth by the      Communist Party that rules in China;       Whereas in recent days the Communist Government of China      has stepped up harassment of the relatives of people who lost      their lives in the 1989 crackdown on democracy protestors in      Tiananmen Square, in an apparent effort to control dissent      ahead of the 15th anniversary of that tragic massacre;       Whereas in recent weeks China's Communist Party leaders      have been working to eliminate the residual influence of Zhao      Ziyang, who was purged as Communist Party chief for opposing      the 1989 crackdown on the Tiananmen protests, and are trying      to erase his name from history;       Whereas Zhao was last seen in public on May 19, 1989, when      he tearfully begged student protesters to leave Tiananmen      Square, and was then promptly put under house arrest and      purged;       Whereas the Communist Government of China declared martial      law the next day and troops backed by tanks crushed the      student movement on June 3-4, 1989;       Whereas the demonstrations in Tiananmen Square were the      manifestation of a democratic movement that had begun to      spread across China following the death of the former General      Secretary of the Communist Party of the People's Republic of      China on April 15, 1989, and that had given rise to peaceful      protests throughout China calling for the establishment of a      dialogue with government and party leaders on democratic      reforms, including freedom of expression, freedom of      assembly, and the elimination of corruption by government      officials;       Whereas after that date thousands of pro-democracy      demonstrators continued to protest peacefully in and around      Tiananmen Square in Beijing until June 3 and 4, 1989, when      Chinese authorities ordered the People's Liberation Army and      other security forces to use lethal force to disperse      demonstrators in Beijing, especially around Tiananmen Square;       Whereas the report of the Chinese Red Cross on June 7,      1989, and the United States Department of State Country      Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1989, gave various      estimates of the numbers of people killed and wounded in 1989      by the People's Liberation Army soldiers and other security      forces, and it is now believed by many that thousands were      killed;       Whereas 20,000 people nationwide suspected of taking part      in the democracy movement were arrested and sentenced without      trial to prison or reeducation through labor, and many were      reportedly tortured;       Whereas the Communist Government of China continues to      suppress dissent by imprisoning pro-democracy activists,      journalists, labor union leaders, religious believers, and      other individuals in China and Tibet who seek to express      their political or religious views in a peaceful manner;       Whereas credible sources estimate that the Communist      Government of China continues to imprison as many as 2,000      Tiananmen Square activists, such as Yang Jianli, and denies      such activists their basic human rights, such as access to      legal counsel, contact with their families, and trials within      reasonable times;       Whereas security agents of the People's Republic of China      have detained Chinese citizens who were planning activities      to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square      massacre, including the preparation of a video for      presentation at this year's United Nations Human Rights      Commission meeting in Geneva on the deaths of their relatives      and other victims who perished in Tiananmen Square;       Whereas coincident with the 15th anniversary of the      Tiananmen Square massacre, the Communist Government of China      has frustrated the efforts of Chinese citizens in Hong Kong      to establish a gradual and orderly process toward universal      suffrage and the democratic election of the legislature and      chief executive in Hong Kong as promised at the time of the      reversion of Hong Kong to China in 1997 and as envisioned by      the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region;       Whereas despite an unprecedented public protest in Hong      Kong on July 1, 2003, reminiscent of protests in Beijing      shortly before June 4, 1989, the Standing Committee of the      National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China      declared on April 26, 2004, that universal suffrage would not      apply to the selection of the Chief Executive in Hong Kong in      2007 or to the selection of members of the Legislative      Council in Hong Kong in 2008; and       Whereas June 4, 2004, is the 15th anniversary of the date      of the Tiananmen Square massacre: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--       (1) expresses sympathy to the families of those killed,      tortured, and imprisoned as a result of their participation      in the democracy protests of June 3-4, 1989, in Tiananmen      Square, Beijing, in the People's Republic of China, and to      all those persons who have suffered for their efforts to keep      that struggle alive during the past 15 years, and to all the      people of China who lack fundamental human rights;       (2) commends all persons who are peacefully advocating for      democracy and human rights in China;       (3) calls upon those nations participating in the 2008      Olympic Games in Beijing to use opportunities created by the      Games to urge China to fully comply with the United Nations      Declaration on Human Rights;       (4) calls upon the Communist Government of China, its      National People's Congress, and any other groups appointed by      the Communist Government of China to honor its pledge of a      ``high degree of autonomy'' made at the time of the Hong Kong      reversion in 1997, by permitting immediate elections for the      Legislative Council of Hong Kong according to rules approved      by the Hong Kong people through an election-law convention,      referendum, or both, and by leaving all revisions of Hong      Kong law to a legislature elected by universal suffrage; and       (5) condemns the ongoing and egregious human rights abuses      by the Communist Government of China and calls on that      Government to--       (A) reevaluate the official verdict on the June 4, 1989,      Tiananmen pro-democracy activities and order formal      investigations into the reported killing, torture, and      imprisonment of democracy activists with the goal of bringing      those responsible to justice;       (B) establish a June Fourth Investigation Committee, the      proceedings and findings of which should be accessible to the      public, to make a just and independent inquiry into all      matters related to June 4, 1989;       (C) release all prisoners of conscience, including those      persons still in prison as a result of their participation in      the peaceful pro-democracy protests of 1989, provide just      compensation to the families of those killed in those      protests, and allow those exiled on account of their      activities in 1989 to return and live in freedom in China;      and       (D) release Dr. Yang Jianli, an organizer of the Tiananmen      Square protests of 1989, who has been illegally detained      incommunicado by the Communist Government of China since      April 26, 2002, and whose wife and 2 children are United      States citizens, and put an immediate end to the harassment,      detention, and imprisonment of all Chinese citizens      exercising their legitimate freedoms of expression,      association, and religion.
