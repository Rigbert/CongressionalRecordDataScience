This Republican filibuster, like that of Judge Jordan, is very hard to understand. Jesse Furman is an experienced Federal prosecutor who has prosecuted international narcotics trafficking and terrorism and consulted on some of the Southern District's most complex cases, including the Galleon insider trading case, the prosecution of former Madoff employees, and the Times Square bomber case. A dedicated public servant, Mr. Furman has been a law clerk at all three levels of the Federal judiciary, including as a clerk to Supreme Court Justice David Souter.  I got to know Mr. Furman when he was the counselor to Attorney General Michael Mukasey. That is right: The Senate Republicans are filibustering someone strongly supported by President Bush's Attorney General who was himself a Federal judge. When Mr. Furman's nomination was before the Committee last summer, Attorney General Mukasey wrote to the Committee in strong support:       All I can hope to add is my own belief that he is a person      to whom one can entrust decisions that are consequential to      the lives of people and to the general welfare of the      populace, with confidence that they will be made wisely and      fairly . . . and I urge that he be confirmed.  Former Supreme Court clerks who served at the same time as Mr. Furman, including clerks for conservative Justices such as Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Thomas, and Justice Scalia wrote in support of Mr. Furman's nomination, stating that, ``Mr. Furman has demonstrated his deep respect for and commitment to the rule of law, over and above politics or ideology.''  With this bipartisan support, the strong support of his home state Senators, and his impressive background, Mr. Furman's nomination was reported by the Judiciary Committee on September 15, without opposition from a single member of the Committee. We should have voted on his nomination many months ago, and certainly before the end of the last session. Senate Republicans have blocked this nomination for over five months without any explanation.  Sadly, this is not the first New York judge to be filibustered by Senate Republicans. Just a few years ago, Judge Denny Chin, an outstanding nominee with 16 years of judicial experience, was delayed from being elevated to the Second Circuit for four months until the Majority Leader forced a vote and he was confirmed 98 0.  Last May, the Majority Leader was required to file for cloture to end the filibuster of Judge Jack McConnell of Rhode Island. By rejecting that filibuster, the Senate took a step toward restoring a longstanding tradition of deference to home state Senators with regard to Federal District Court nominations. The Senate turned away from a precipice. It is wrong now for us to approach that precipice again. Filibustering this nomination would set a new standard for obstruction of judicial nominations.  Indeed, I have looked back over the last six decades and found only four district court nominations--four in over 60 years, on which cloture was even filed. For two of those, the cloture petitions were withdrawn after procedural issues were resolved. In connection with the other two, the Senate voted on cloture and it was invoked and the filibuster ended. All of those nominations were confirmed.  From the start of President Obama's term, Republican Senators have applied a heightened and unfair standard to President Obama's district court nominees. Senate Republicans have chosen to depart dramatically from the long tradition of deference on district court nominees to the home state Senators who know the needs of their states best. Instead, an unprecedented number of President Obama's highly-qualified district court nominees have been targeted for opposition and obstruction. That approach is a serious break from the Senate's practice of advice and consent. Since 1945, the Judiciary Committee has reported more than 2,100 district court nominees to the Senate. Out of these 2,100 nominees, only six have been reported by party-line votes. Only six total in the last 65 years. Five of those six party-line votes have been against President Obama's highly-qualified district court nominees. Indeed, only 22 of those 2,100 district court nominees were reported by any kind of split roll call vote at all, and eight of those, more than a third, have been President Obama's nominees.  Democrats never applied this standard to President Bush's district court nominees, whether in the majority or the minority. And certainly, there were nominees to the district court put forth by that administration that were considered ideologues. All told, in eight years, the Judiciary Committee reported only a single Bush district court nomination by a party line vote. President Obama's nominees are being treated differently than those of any President, Democratic or Republican, before him.  When I first became Chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 2001, I followed a time when Senate Republicans, who had been in the majority, had pocket filibustered more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominations, blocking them with secret holds in backrooms and cloakrooms, obstructing more with winks and nods, but with little to no public explanation or accountability. I worked hard to change that and to open up the process. I sought to bring daylight to the process by making the consultation with home state Senators public so that the Senate Republicans' abuses during the Clinton years would not be repeated.  When Senate Democrats opposed some of President Bush's most ideological nominees, we did so openly, saying why we opposed them. And when there were consensus nominees--nominees with the support of both Democrats and Republicans--we moved them quickly so they could begin serving the American people. That is how we reduced vacancies in the presidential election years of 2004 and 2008 to the lowest levels in decades. That is how we confirmed 205 of President Bush's circuit and district nominees in his first term.  Now we see the reverse of how we treated President Bush's nominees. Senate Republicans do not move quickly to consider consensus nominees, like the 14 still on the Senate Calendar that were reported unanimously last year and should have had a Senate vote last year. Instead, as we are seeing today and have seen all too often, Senate Republicans obstruct and delay even consensus nominees, leaving us 43 judicial nominees behind the pace we set for confirming President Bush's judicial nominees. That is why vacancies remain so high, at 86, over three years into President Obama's first term. Vacancies are nearly double what they were at this point in President Bush'sthird year. That is why 130 million Americans live in circuits or districts with a judicial vacancy that could have a judge if Senate Republicans would only consent to vote on judicial nominees that have been favorably voted on by the Senate Judiciary Committee and have been on the Senate Executive Calendar since last year.  This is an area where we should be working for the American people, and putting their needs first. It is the American people who pay the price for the Senate's unnecessary and harmful delay in confirming judges to our Federal courts. It is unacceptable for hardworking Americans who are seeking their day in court to find seats on one in 10 of those courts vacant. When an injured plaintiff sues to help cover the cost of medical expenses, that plaintiff should not have to wait for years before a judge hears his or her case. When two small business owners disagree over a contract, they should not have to wait years for a court to resolve their dispute. With over 20 judicial nominees favorably reported by the Committee and cloture motions being required for consensus nominees, the Senate is failing in its responsibility, harming our Federal courts and ultimately hurting the American people. Is it any wonder that barely 10 percent of the American people view Congress favorably?  The slow pace of confirmations of President Obama's judicial nominees is no accident or happenstance. It is the result of deliberate obstruction and delays. For the second year in a row, the Senate Republican leadership ignored long-established precedent and refused to schedule any votes before the December recess on the nearly 20 consensus judicial nominees who had been favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee. Here we are in the middle of February fighting to hold a vote on one of the 18 nominees who should have been confirmed last year. Fourteen of the nominees being blockaded by Senate Republicans were reported with the unanimous support of their home state Senators and every Republican and every Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. The result of these Republican delay tactics is clear--we are far behind the pace set by the Senate during President George W. Bush's first term, with a judicial vacancy rate nearly twice what it was at this point in his first term.  During President George W. Bush's administration, Republican Senators insisted that filibusters of judicial nominees were unconstitutional. They threatened the ``nuclear option'' in 2005 to guarantee up-or-down votes for each of President Bush's judicial nominees. Many Republican Senators declared that they would never support the filibuster of a judicial nomination--never. Yet, only a few years later, Senate Republicans reversed course and filibustered President Obama's very first judicial nomination, that of Judge David Hamilton of Indiana, a widely-respected 15-year veteran of the Federal bench who had the support of the most senior and longest-serving Republican in the Senate, Senator Lugar. The Senate rejected that filibuster and Judge Hamilton was confirmed.  But the partisan delays and opposition have continued. Senate Republicans have required cloture votes even for nominees who ended up being confirmed unanimously when the Senate finally overcame those filibusters and voted on their nomination. So it was with Judge Barbara Keenan of the Fourth Circuit, who was confirmed 99 0 when the filibuster of her nomination finally ended in 2010, and Judge Denny Chin of the Second Circuit, an outstanding nominee with 16 years judicial experience, who was ultimately confirmed 98 0 when the Republican filibuster was overcome after four months of needless delays. Just this week the long-delayed nomination of Judge Adalberto Jordan to the Eleventh Circuit was confirmed 94 5.  This obstruction is particularly damaging at a time when judicial vacancies remain at record highs. There are currently 86 judicial vacancies across the country, meaning that nearly one out of every 10 Federal judgeships remains vacant. The vacancy rate is nearly double what it had been reduced to by this point in the Bush administration, when we worked together to reduce judicial vacancies to 46.  Some Senate Republicans are now seeking to excuse these months of delay by blaming President Obama for forcing them to do it. They point to President Obama's recent recess appointments of a Director for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and members of the National Labor Relations Board. Of course, those appointments were made a few weeks ago, long after Judge Jordan's nomination was already being delayed. Moreover, the President took his action because Senate Republicans had refused to vote on those executive nominations and were intent on rendering the Government agencies unable to enforce the law and carry out their critical work on behalf of the American people. Some Senate Republicans are doubling down on their obstruction in response. They are apparently extending their blockage against nominees beyond executive branch nominees to these much-needed judicial nominees. This needless obstruction accentuates the burdens on our Federal courts and delays in justice to the American people. We can ill afford these additional delays and protest votes. The Senate needs, instead, to come together to address the needs of hardworking Americans around the country.  I, again, urge Senate Republicans to stop the destructive delays that have plagued our nominations process. I urge them to join us not only in rejecting the five-month filibuster of Mr. Furman's nomination, but also in restoring the Senate's longstanding practice of considering and confining consensus nominees without extended and damaging delays. The American people deserve no less.                               Exhibit 1                   Congress Has No Date for the Prom                           (By Gail Collins)       I am shocked to report that Congress, the beating heart of      American democracy, is unpopular.       Not unpopular like a shy kid in junior high. Unpopular like      the Ebola virus, or zombies. Held in near-universal contempt,      like TV shows about hoarders with dead cats in their      kitchens. Or people who get students to call you up during      dinner and ask you to give money to your old university.       The latest Gallup poll gave Congress a 10 percent approval      rating. As Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado keeps pointing      out, that's lower than BP during the oil spill, Nixon during      Watergate or banks during the banking crisis.       On the plus side, while 86 percent of respondents told      Gallup that they disapproved of the job Congress was doing,      only 4 percent said they had no opinion. That's really a      great sense of public awareness, given the fact that other      surveys show less than half of all Americans know who their      member of Congress is.       So little attention, yet so much rancor. We're presuming      that this is because of the dreaded partisan gridlock, which      has made Congress increasingly unproductive in matters that      do not involve the naming of post offices.       And Congress is listening! Lately, we have been seeing      heartening new signs of bipartisan cooperation. For instance,      the House and Senate are near an agreement on the payroll tax      cut, namely that it will continue and not be paid for.       This is actually sort of a tradition. No matter who is in      power in Washington, Congress has always shown a remarkable      ability to band together and pass tax cuts that are not paid      for. It's like naming post offices, only somewhat more      expensive.       But there's much, much more. For instance, both chambers      recently approved a big new ethics reform bill that would ban      members of Congress from engaging in insider trading.       Perhaps you imagined that this was already against the law.       This piece of legislation had been lying around gathering      dust since 2006. But, this year, the House and Senate decided      to stand tall and pass it as a matter of principle. It had      nothing to do with a ``60 Minutes'' report that made the      whole place look like a convention of grifters. Totally      unrelated. This was simply a bill whose time had come.       And that bill would probably already be signed into law      were it not for a disagreement over whether to require the      high-paid professionals who poke around Congress collecting      information that might be of use to their Wall Street clients      to register the same way lobbyists do.       You'd think this would be easy to sort out since most      members of the House and the Senate have gone on the record      in favor of registering these guys.       But, no, the idea ran afoul of the House majority leader,      Eric Cantor, the Darth Vader of Capitol Hill. Cantor says the      idea should be studied, which is, of course, legislatese for      ``trampled to death by a thousand boots.''       Still, the good news is that the basic idea of prohibiting      members of Congress from using the information they acquire      in the course of their public duties to engage in insider      trading did pass both chambers by enormous majorities.       Yippee.       And the bipartisan cooperation keeps rolling on. This week,      the Senate confirmed Judge Adalberto Jose Jordan to a seat on      the federal Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta.      A visitor from another country might not have appreciated the      proportions of this achievement, given the fact that Jordan,      who was born in Cuba and who once clerked for Sandra Day      O'Connor, had no discernible opposition.       But Americans ought to have a better grasp of how the      Senate works. The nomination's progress had long been      thwarted by Mike Lee, a freshman Republican from Utah, who      has decided to hold up every single White House appointment      to anything out of pique over . . . well, it doesn't really      matter. When you're a senator, you get to do that kind of      thing.       This forced the majority leader, Harry Reid, to get 60      votes to move Judge Jordan forward, which is never all that      easy. Then there was further delay thanks to Rand Paul, a      freshman from Kentucky, who stopped action for as long as      possible because he was disturbed about foreign aid to Egypt.       All that is forgotten now. The nomination was approved, 94      to 5, only 125 days after it was unanimously O.K.'d by the      Judiciary Committee. Whiners in the White House pointed out      that when George W. Bush was president, circuit court      nominations got to a floor vote in an average of 28 days.       No matter. Good work, Senate! Only 17 more long-pending      judicial nominations to go!       Meanwhile, the House named a post office in Missouri for a      fallen Marine.
