 President, I rise today to honor a venerable institution of higher learning from my home State of Kentucky the University of Pikeville. UPike, as it is more commonly known, is celebrating 125 years of educating young minds on its campus in eastern Kentucky.  September 16 marked 125 years since the first classes were held at what was then called Pikeville Collegiate Institute. The college was founded by a group of Presbyterians, and has maintained its religious foundation ever since.  In addition to its religious background, UPike has also always maintained a strong commitment to its community. The university invests deeply in the Appalachian region through community service projects, humanitarian efforts, and its educational offerings. As former President Hal Smith remarked at the anniversary ceremony, UPike's mission has always been ``to provide educational opportunity for the youth and adults of this region.''  Three other former presidents, as well as the current President Dr. James Hurley, were in attendance Tuesday for the ceremony. During the ceremony, Dr. Hurley announced a campaign to raise $75 million for the university. It is a fitting endeavor to ensure many more years of excellence in education at the University of Pikeville.  I now ask that my Senate colleagues join me in paying tribute to the University of Pikeville's 125 years of excellence in education.  WYMT Mountain News recently published an article detailing the University of Pikeville's 125th anniversary ceremonies. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: University of Pikeville Kicks Off 125th Anniversary by Honoring Four                            Former Presidents                         (By Hillary Thornton)       Pikeville, KY. (WYMT).--Four former University of Pikeville      presidents were on hand for a ceremony that was all about      honoring their past and celebrating their future. As Tuesday      marks 125 years since the first class was held at the      Pikeville Collegiate Institute . . . now known as UPike.       Opening convocation officially starts the school year,      however this year also marks the 125th anniversary.       Through all those years, the many additions and changes . .      . all agree the mission of the institution remains the same.       Former President Hal Smith (1997-2009) says, ``To provide      educational opportunity for the youth and adults of this      region.''       President James Hurley calls it a very surreal day, as he      honors four past presidents with honorary degrees from the      institution they say continues to break barriers and exceed      expectations.       Smith says, ``Each of us laid a little bit of a foundation      for the things that are happening and clearly I think the      future is very, very bright.''       To help ensure another 125 years of success at UPike, Dr.      Hurley announced a $75 million comprehensive capital      campaign.       ``Investing in the future of Central Appalachia . . . with      the decline in the coal industry we have to think about a new      economy, an economy based on education,'' explains Hurley. He      adds, ``That is going to be our focus . . . we are going to      raise 75 million dollars to invest in new infrastructure.''       KYCOM student Fritz Stine says, ``I think this definitely      shows that we are moving in this trajectory and we are      spearheading the future of the area.''       ``Working to honor their past, while planning for and      celebrating their future.''                          ____________________
