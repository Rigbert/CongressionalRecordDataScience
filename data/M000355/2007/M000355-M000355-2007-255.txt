 President, in 1992, a Mississippi lawyer named Leslie Southwick wanted to serve his country in the Armed Forces. At 42, he was too old to do so, but service to others is a duty that Leslie Southwick has always taken very seriously, whether in the Justice Department or on the State bench or with Habitat for Humanity or in doing charity work for inner-city communities. So in 1992, 42-year-old Leslie Southwick sought an age waiver to join the U.S. Army Reserves.
