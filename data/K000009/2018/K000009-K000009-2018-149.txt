Speaker, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary evolution of the Toledo Sister Cities International (TSCI) presence in the City of Toledo as an umbrella group for the ten Sister Cities/regions which constitute this membership. Members and friends are gathering this weekend to celebrate its silver anniversary.  As TSCI celebrates its 25th anniversary, our community is also proud to celebrate what is regarded as the very first Sister City agreement when, in 1931, the Association of Two Toledos linking Toledo, Ohio with Toledo, Spain was born. That was years before President Dwight Eisenhower, in 1956, called for ``citizen diplomacy'' to create sister city relationships with the goal of promoting world peace. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., this organization oversees the establishment of sister city relationships which are mayor to mayor agreements that are initiated by citizens in interested cities across the globe and approved by local governing bodies.  In 1985, a relationship with Qinhuangdao, China was initiated, and it became a sister city to Toledo. Qinhuangdao and Toledo are both known as ``The Glass City'' because of their history of glass production.  When the oppression of communism ended in 1989 in Poland, a core group including Councilwoman Eleanor Kahle, future Councilman Peter Ujvagi, Ann Galloway and Sister Ann Frances Klimkowski, and myself discussed the formation of an association to reach out to cities coming to the light of freedom. Szeged, Hungary became the first Sister City in this new approach in 1990 andPoznan, Poland followed in 1991. We proudly welcomed our newest partners with the mayors and leaders of each community coming together in cultural, economic, educational and humanitarian exchanges.  In 1992 an advisory board of community leaders, the Lucas County Port Authority, Toledo Edison, the Private Industry Council, and the City of Toledo came together to form Toledo Sister Cities International in order to unite existing sister city relationships and develop future affiliations. Twenty-three members of the civic, business, educational, and legal professions created the Founding Board of Trustees in 1993, and the formal incorporation of TSCI as a not-for-profit organization was finalized that year.  The first International Youth Academy was offered by TSCI in 1997, in which students from the Sister Cities attend a three-week long immersion in the culture and language, living with host families in the cities. TSCI also sponsors an international festival each year, during which members of our region share their heritages in a daylong display of heritage, culture, and food showcasing uniqueness while highlighting commonality around the world. Toledo and TSCI were proud to be the host of the Sister City International Conference in 2002, which brought 600 delegates and 300 guests from 28 countries from around the world to Northwest Ohio.  As the years continued, Toledo Sister Cities International flourished. A regional agreement with Lebanon's Beqaa Valley was established in 1998. Relationships were later cemented with Toyohashi, Japan in 2000; Tanga, Tanzania in 2001; Delmenhorst, Germany in 2002; Coimbatore, India in 2010; Hyderabad, Pakistan in 2011; Qinhauangdao/Nanchong, China in 2017 and Coburg, Germany in 2017.  While the stories behind each Sister City are unique, the way that each relationship was established was not--it all came about because people in the Toledo area and throughout the global community found a need to connect with those from another nation. The idea for `citizen diplomacy' has not diminished as time has marched on. The work that the Toledo Sister Cities International continues to do on behalf of our communities is extraordinary. I am pleased to join Toledo Sister Cities International as we celebrate its 25th Anniversary, reflecting on the past, looking forward to the future, and inspired by an incredible journey of international citizen diplomacy.                          ____________________
