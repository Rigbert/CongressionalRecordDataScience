President, I am delighted that the Senate confirmed A. Richard Caputo to be a U.S. District Judge for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. Mr. Caputo is a well-qualified nominee.  The nominee has decades of legal experience in the private practice of law at the firm of Shea, Shea & Caputo in Kingston, PA. Prior to joining this firm, he served the public interest as a assistant public defender in Luzerne County, PA. The American Bar Association has found him to be qualified for this appointment.  We first received Mr. Caputo's nomination on July 31, 1997. He had a confirmation hearing on September 5. He was unanimously reported by the committee on November 6. With the strong support of Senator Specter, this nomination has moved expeditiously through the Committee and the Senate.  I congratulate Mr. Caputo and his family and look forward to his service on the district court.                          ____________________
