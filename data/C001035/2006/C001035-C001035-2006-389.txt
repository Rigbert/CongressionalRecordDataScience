President. I was aware that was the case, but I thought it would be helpful to our colleagues to better understand the state of play.  Mr. President, I made some preliminary comments this morning. I do want to explain further the concept of the Office of Public Integrity, but I know the Senator from Illinois had asked that I yield to him some time. In the interests of accommodating his schedule, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Illinois to speak in support of the amendment.
