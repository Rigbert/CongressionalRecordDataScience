I would hear from him and he would chastise me for praising him, because Bobby always finds others to praise. I have probably risked that already, but I want people to know that this is a man who has done so much for the world and a man who should feel so honored by what he did to create the International Campaign to Ban Landmines and by its receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize.                          ____________________
