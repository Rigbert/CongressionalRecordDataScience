 And I ask the Senator from Iowa, the President said in the State of the Union, the key to the future of the American economy is to make the tax cuts for the wealthiest people in America, permanent law.  I ask the Senator from Iowa, as he has traveled his State and I have traveled mine, as well, has the Senator found with the working families, a hue and cry, demands to keep President Bush's tax cuts in place, tax cuts that have basically given us the biggest deficit in the history of the United States and have failed to create jobs? Has the Senator heard this in the State of Iowa?
