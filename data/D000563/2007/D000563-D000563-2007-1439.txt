President, I rise today to congratulate Illinois State University, ISU, as it marks its 150th year of providing an outstanding college education to students in the State of Illinois.  Illinois State University commemorates its 150th anniversary this year with a year-long celebration that begins with Founders Day on February 15, 2007. ISU was founded as Bloomington-Normal in 1857. The school was Illinois's first public university and is one of the oldest institutions of higher education in the Midwest. Abraham Lincoln himself drew up the legal papers to establish the University, which has grown from a small teachers' college to a premiere liberal arts university. The University now serves more than 20,000 talented undergraduate and graduate students from across the country and from 88 nations.  For 150 years, Illinois State University has prided itself on providing a high quality education at a cost within the reach of most students. In fact, ISU is ranked nationally as one of the 100 ``best values'' in public higher education, according to Kiplinger magazine. ISU students can choose the program that best fits their academic needs from among 63 undergraduate programs in more than 160 fields of study. In particular, I commend Illinois State for its successful College of Education, which continues the University's long tradition of educating teachers. ISU is one of the 10 largest producers of teachers in the Nation. In fact, nearly 1 in 7 Illinois teachers holds a degree from ISU. By educating future teachers, Illinois State University has played an invaluable role in shaping the education of Illinois children.  Illinois State hosts a large and successful athletics program. During the past 23 years, the ISU Redbirds have won 125 league titles in 19 intercollegiate sports. Redbird competitors have gone on to be professional athletes, Olympians, and World Series Champions, as in the case of pitcher Neal Cotts, an ISU alumnus and member of the 2005 World Champion Chicago White Sox team.  Students at Illinois State are encouraged to embrace the University's motto, ``Gladly we Learn and Teach,'' both in and outside the classroom. Many students choose to take part in public service and outreach programs that provide learning and service experiences beyond the classroom. ISU also participates in the American Democracy Project, an initiative that prepares students to be engaged in a competitive global society.  Illinois State University has proven itself to be a tremendous asset to the students and citizens of Illinois for the past 150 years. I congratulate the University on its 150th anniversary, and I look forward to many more years of excellence in education and academic advancement in the future.                          ____________________
