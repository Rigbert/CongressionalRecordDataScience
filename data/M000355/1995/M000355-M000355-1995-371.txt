 President, it is required by paragraph 4 of rule 35 that I place in the Congressional Record notices of Senate employees who participate in programs, the principal objective of which is educational, sponsored by a foreign government or a foreign educational or charitable organization involving travel to a foreign country paid for by that foreign government or organization.  The select committee received notification under rule 35 for William Triplett, a member of the staff of Senator Bennett, to participate in a program in Abu Dhabi sponsored by the Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce from March 9-23, 1995.  The committee determined that no Federal statute or Senate rule would prohibit participation by Mr. Triplett in this program.  The select committee received notification under rule 35 for Senator Bond  and two members of the staff, Warren Erdman and Brent Franzel, to participate in a program in the Republic of China on Taiwan, sponsored by the Chinese National Association of Industry and Commerce, from April 18-21, 1995.  The committee determined that no Federal statute or Senate rule would prohibit participation by Senator Bond, Mr. Erdman, and Mr. Franzel in this program.
