 I did not see or hear ``the budget for this coming year.'' I know the Committee on the Budget marked up the budget yesterday. As I understand it, they completed their work, and they have reported a budget. I do not see it on the calendar for next week, which means that the earliest we could consider a budget would be April.  Speaker Ryan, as the majority leader knows so well, indicated we are going to pursue regular order, which would be the adoption of a budget, the establishment of a 302(a) allocation, which means the overall expenditure level for discretionary spending, and then the markup and consideration in this House of the 12 appropriation bills.  It would appear, if we are not going to do it next week, could we expect to see the budget on the floor, Mr. Leader, in April?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  The gentleman is correct that the Committee on the Budget successfully reported a budget resolution last night. I want to take a moment to thank Committee on the Budget Chairman Tom Price for his work, and the whole committee.  There are more conversations among Members which will be required before moving the budget to the floor, and therefore it will not be scheduled for the upcoming abbreviated week, but I will let the gentleman know as soon as we do schedule it.
