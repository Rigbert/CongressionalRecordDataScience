President, very briefly, I thank Senator Lugar and Senator Biden, in particular, for working this arrangement out with Senator Dorgan and me. We think this is a waste of money. We are anxious to talk about it tomorrow after folks have had a chance, overnight, to look at it.  I thank the Presiding Officer for the chance to make these brief remarks.
