Pallone) for putting this special order together this evening so we can place on the record a number of our deepest concerns about the way in which contracting is being handled relative tothe war in Iraq, and particularly some of what appears to be war profiteering by some of the highest officials in our government and some of the private firms with which they have had association.  I came down here this evening because as a member of the Committee on Appropriations, when funds were being debated for Iraq and Afghanistan, I was denied the opportunity, and I emphasize, denied the opportunity to even offer an amendment to require competitive bidding in any contract associated with this war effort. I could not believe that I was not even allowed to offer the amendment. I remember I was told, ``Well, you know, Congresswoman, they are going to take care of that over on the Senate side,'' I mean, ``in the other body.''  I said, ``Oh, are they?''  Then I found out the way they are going to take care of it is only to allow a provision to be offered for reporting back. That means once the horse was out of the gate, maybe some contracts would be reported back, but there would be no competitive bidding. Then I learned this last month that only the contracts after March 1 might be reported back.  I said, ``No, no, no, what about the contracts for Halliburton and Bechtel that preceded March 1? That is what is at issue in the current supplemental that is working its way through this Congress.''  I thought, oh, that is very interesting.  So I cannot get competitive bidding considered as a real amendment. Even in the reporting-back amendments it is everything that comes after March of this year, maybe, and we closed the door on what happened before March 31 of this year.  So my question is, who is trying to hide what? Who is trying to hide what?  So I come down here as a disgruntled Member tonight, because I should have been allowed the opportunity. We are not talking about tiddly-winks here. We are talking about the largest supplemental in American history. $87 billion was just voted out of this House, and yet there were no requirements for competitive bidding, and the reporting-back requirements are flawed. We need to know who got how much money and we need to understand who is benefiting from the taxpayers' largess and who is profiteering.  The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) has put on the record some very important information, and it has to do with the amount of money that Halliburton is being paid to move petroleum and gasoline from Kuwait to Iraq. Now, remember, Iraq has the second-largest oil reserves in the world, and it is estimated that it would normally cost 70 to 98 cents for a gallon of gasoline to move from Kuwait to Iraq.  Well, how come Halliburton is charging upwards of $1.78, anywhere from $1.48 to $1.78 a gallon, and the American people then are paying for that differential? How is that happening in all of this?  There is an estimate that Halliburton is actually making from this anywhere between $300 million and $900 million, because about a third of the dollars they are getting relate to the transport of fuel from Kuwait to Iraq. So this is not something small. This is not a little asterisk or a little tiddly-wink or whatever. This is a huge amount of the additional funds that we were requested to spend as a Congress.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reported that as of September 18, last month, the United States had paid Halliburton over $300 million to import approximately 190 million gallons of gasoline into Iraq, and that meant that on a per-gallon basis for that tranche of shipment of fuel, Halliburton charged the United States an average price of $1.59 a gallon to import gasoline into Iraq. And that did not include Halliburton's additional fee of 2 percent to 7 percent, which increases the cost to our taxpayers to $1.62 to $1.70 per gallon for fuel that should move at a rate in that region of anywhere between 73 cents, as I said, and 98 cents a gallon.  Somebody is making an awful lot of money. Halliburton has received over $3 billion in task orders relating to the war and reconstruction in Iraq, and most of that is not competitively bid. When did we ever have contracts of that magnitude not competitively bid?  I would just like to place on the record, if I might this evening, information on the amount of compensation that Vice President Cheney, who had been the chief executive officer of Halliburton, is receiving.  Vice President Cheney made a statement on national television that he was not receiving any compensation, had no financial interest in Halliburton, and I would beg to say I think he has forgotten some pretty important facts, even that his own financial disclosure forms reveal. For example, a special report done for the Congressional Research Service indicates that he is in fact receiving deferred salary and holding 433,333 Halliburton stock options. I wish to place on the record tonight what he is receiving in deferred salary and what he is receiving in stock options and other benefits.  Let me start with deferred salary. Deferred salary paid by Halliburton to Vice President Cheney in 2001 equalled $205,298. I think when you have that much money and you are getting your salary as Vice President, my question is, why do you not donate it? Why do you even take this money?  In 2002, his deferred salary from Halliburton was $162,392. Halliburton is scheduled to make similar payments to him in 2003, 2004, and 2005, and he has an ongoing corporate relationship from company funds that are being paid.                              {time}  2230  In terms of stock options, his financial disclosure form stated he continued to hold these stock options, and they are in three categories. There are 100,000 shares valued at $54.50 a share, so for that tranche of shares, that value is $5,450,000. He then has 333,333 shares, and I wonder how that number was picked, valued at $28.12, and then he has 300,000 shares. Imagine. I mean, I do not know how many people here own stock, but 300,000 shares valued at $39.50 is a huge amount of money. The total value of these shares right now is over $26,674,990.  So to say that the Vice President has no interest in Halliburton's future, one would have to be a fool, or not be able to read, even to hold that position. He absolutely has a financial interest in this company. His family has a huge financial interest, and it is a gross interest. It is not some side issue. The Vice President's deferred compensation and stock option benefits are in addition to a $20 million retirement package paid to him by Halliburton after only 5 years of employment. I would like to know how many Americans listening tonight have a $20 million retirement package for only working 5 years.  I think of how many of our people have lost their retirement packages. I have people in my district struggling to hold on to benefits and are paying more for health insurance from the retirement programs they had been promised. A third of the private sector plants in this country have gone belly up or have been cut. I can see why this Vice President cannot identify with the pain of unemployment or the pain of 45 million Americans without health insurance, or the pain of Americans who cannot afford prescription drugs. He is not even living in the same world. Halliburton paid him $1.4 million in cash bonus in 2001, and that does not include the millions of dollars of compensation paid to him while he was employed by the company.  So I wanted to thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) for putting this Special Order together tonight. What was interesting about the no-bid contracts that Halliburton received when we had Hurricane Isabel and that made the front pages all over the country, including here in Washington, the Bush-Cheney administration slipped in an additional $300 million in no-bid contracts to Halliburton, and it was placed, I do not know, on page 27 or 35; it was buried somewhere in the paper that weekend. But, literally, that brought the total amount of taxpayer dollars paid to Halliburton to over $2.25 billion, of which $1.25 billion, and this is not million, even million would be a lot, but this is $1.25 billion from the no-bid exclusive contract given to Halliburton.  Mr. Speaker, I am really pleased tonight to be down here to help place this on the record as one Member who was denied the ability in her own committee and on this floor to offer a competitive bidding amendment for all contracts related to the war effort.
