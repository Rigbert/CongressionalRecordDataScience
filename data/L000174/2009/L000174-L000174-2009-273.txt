I would also note this gives us plenty of time.  We get elected in November, most of us--the first week in November--and when we are new Senators, we find it difficult to put everything together in 2 months, to go into the Senate in January. We should at least give the same courtesy to a Justice of the Supreme Court that we expect the American voters and taxpayers to give us.  I yield the floor.
