Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from California (Chairman Thomas) and the ranking member, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), for bringing this legislation before us today.  I want to thank my friend and my colleague, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Watts), for being the chief sponsor of this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, when we walk through the halls of this building, we do not see anything that tells the story that African-American slaves helped build this magnificent building: no drawings, no murals, no paintings, no statues, nothing. Slavery is part of our Nation's history of which we are not proud. However, we should not run away or hide from it. The history of the Capitol, like the history of our Nation, should be complete.  As the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Watts) pointed out, it was not until this year, 200 years after the opening of the Capitol for the first session of Congress, that records were uncovered which prove what many of us have already known or maybe some of us assumed, that African-American slave labor was used in the building of the United States Capitol.  These men, these slaves, laid the very foundation of our democracy. Yet, they were denied the right to participate in our democracy. Indeed, generations of their offspring were denied the right to vote.  Mr. Speaker, with this resolution, H.R. 368, we will honor the slaves who helped build the Capitol. We will study the history and contributions of the African-Americans who helped construct one of the greatest symbols of democracy in the world, this building, the United States Capitol.  Mr. Speaker, we will have a fitting and lasting tribute to these men, black men, slaves, in a permanent place here in the United States Capitol.  I urge all of my colleagues to vote for the passage of House Concurrent Resolution 368.
