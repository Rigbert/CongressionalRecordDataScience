 President, I rise to speak about a young Kentuckian who was taken from this world entirely too soon. CPL Joshua M. Moore of Lewisburg, KY, was lost in Baghdad while serving our country. He was 20 years old.  In the early morning hours of May 30, 2007, Corporal Moore was driving a humvee when an improvised explosive device set by terrorists went off.
