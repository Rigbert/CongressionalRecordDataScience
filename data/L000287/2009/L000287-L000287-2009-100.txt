I would like to thank my colleague for yielding. I have been sitting here and I have been listening to the people on the other side. It is unbelievable; it is unreal. Our country is in trouble; deep trouble. The economy is in a ditch.  This President has offered a plan, a plan that he believes and 85 percent of the American people believe that it will work. Have you been reading the newspapers, watching television, or seeing the polls?  It is time for us to wake up and do what is right, do what is fair.  When President Clinton left the White House, he left a surplus. He put more than 22 million people to work. Under the last administration, you left a debt. Hundreds and thousands of millions of citizens have lost their jobs, and now you are standing here today whining.
