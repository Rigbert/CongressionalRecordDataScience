  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the full court corporate press for fast track legislation is on. The USA NAFTA captains are back. Remember these folks, colleagues? These are the same corporate CEO's that came here and promised NAFTA would be a boon for American workers. We would run trade surpluses with Mexico. Our people would be in full employment.  Guess what? These same folks are back. Their salaries are up dramatically, their profits are up, but 43 percent of them have laid off American workers. They have moved the jobs to Mexico. Twenty percent of them are documented for threatening their workers with moving their jobs to Mexico unless they accept lower wages, but for us, is it not wonderful? Twenty percent of them are also in the top givers of soft money to politicians.  They are here now in the back rooms and trying to get into your offices. Say no to the corporate money. Say yes to the American workers. Say no to fast track, no, no, no.                          ____________________
