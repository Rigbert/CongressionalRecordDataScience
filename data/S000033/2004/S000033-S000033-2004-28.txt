 Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time, to conclude the debate from our side, by asking for support for what really is a very commonsense amendment.  I think the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Taylor) said it all. If people want to go to the Cayman Islands, if they want to go to Bermuda, that is their right. No one is questioning their right. But they cannot abandon their country, go abroad, and then say, oh, yeah, by the way, I do not want to paymy taxes, but I sure do want Washington to subsidize my business.  So I want to urge support for an amendment that has broad tripartisan support, support of the AFL-CIO, the U.S. Business and Industry Council, the Teamsters, the United Steel Workers, Taxpayers for Common Sense, and Citizens Works.  This is an amendment that will tell corporate America that if they want the benefits that U.S. taxpayers provide to them, they cannot run away and avoid their taxes.
