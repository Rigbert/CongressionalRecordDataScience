We still have to go to the House, and Senator Boxer and I are hoping we are going to be able to resolve this. In fact, we may see House action as soon as next week. I know there are some Members in the House who have said they are going to make it difficult on Chairman Shuster to pass the WRDA bill because it doesn't have the Senate provisions that address the water crisis across our Nation that involves failing and outdated critical infrastructure and the situation in Flint. I promise to address this in conference. I have been standing with my colleagues in Michigan from the beginning on our fiscally responsible solution to help the Flint community, and I will continue to do so in conference.  So let me be clear. It would be a shortsighted mistake for those trying to help the people of Flint to prevent the quick movement of WRDA in the House so we can conference immediately. I am confident that is going to happen, and this bill will become law before the end of this Congress. I just want to be sure we got that in the record before the vote took place today.
