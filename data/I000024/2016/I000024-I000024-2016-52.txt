President, first of all, let me say something about this. I would ask if Senator Boxer would like to be heard before I make some remarks on this or if we can have a colloquy, in which case I would ask a question. We have done some good things in our committee, and we have two different people who don't think alike on a lot of issues. However, we both agree that infrastructure is important. We got through a highway bill that many people said couldn't be done. It hadn't been done since 1998, and we were able to do that significantly. We got through the chemical bill, about which a lot of people said ``No, that is not going to be done,'' and yet we did.  I look at this, and we have many things right now that should go into a WRDA bill. Initially, the Water Resources Development Act was going to be coming up every 2 years. We went through a period of time when that wasn't the case. Both the minority and the majority of our committee, the Environment and Public Works Committee, have agreed that we should get back to that 2-year cycle. That is what we are doing today.  I would ask Senator Boxer: Do you agree that we have done a pretty good job on some of these and we need to keep going?
