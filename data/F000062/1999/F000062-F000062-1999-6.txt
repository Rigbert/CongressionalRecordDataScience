 President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senator Boxer in introducing a bill to designate the United States Post Office located at 14071 Peyton Drive in Chino Hills, California, as the ``Joseph Ileto Post Office.'' This post office would be designated in memory and in celebration of the life of Joseph Santos Ileto, the Filipino American postal worker who was brutally gunned down during his postal route in August by Buford Furrow, Jr., a white supremacist. Only hours earlier, this same assailant opened fire on the North Valley Jewish Community Center, wounding three young children, one teenager, and one elderly woman.  Joseph Ileto touched many lives. He was a kind-hearted, intelligent man who gave so much to those he loved and even to those he did not know. He was known for his unselfishness and his willingness to give a helping hand to anyone in need. In fact, the day Joseph Ileto was killed, he was filling in for another mail carrier, as he had done so many times before. His life and death exemplify the ultimate sacrifice of public service, which we too often take for granted. As a U.S. Postal Service employee, he served our nation with honor and dignity and died doing his job.  My heart goes out to the Ileto family, who is grieving over the death of their son, brother, and friend. Despite the sadness of their loss, they can be proud that the life and spirit of Joseph Ileto lives on. His death only confirms the urgency in which we as a community must take a strong stand against hate crimes and racism. The number of hate crimes in the U.S. has increased during the last five years, and the time is now to have dialogue and pass meaningful legislation to address this issue. As a first step, it is my hope that we can expedite passage this bill, to remember and honor the life of Joseph Ileto.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1964       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF JOSEPH ILETO POST OFFICE.       The United States Post Office located at 14071 Peyton Drive      in Chino Hills, California, shall be known and designated as      the ``Joseph Ileto Post Office''.     SEC. 2. REFERENCES.       Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper,      or other record of the United States to the post office      referred to in section 1 shall be deemed to be a reference to      the Joseph Ileto Post Office.                                 ______                                       By
