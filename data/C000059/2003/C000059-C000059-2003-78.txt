Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to Riverside County are exceptional. Riverside County has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give time and talent to making their communities a better place to live and work. David Zappe is one of these individuals. This year David will retire from the Riverside County Flood Control and Water Conservation District after providing more than 33 years of loyal, consciences and outstanding engineering and management service period.  A native born Californian, David attended public schools in Riverside and Palm Springs, California. In 1969 he graduated from California State Polytechnic College in Pomona, California with a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering. As a student he was a member of the Engineer Honorary Fraternity, Sigma Phi Alpha.  After his graduation David was employed by the Riverside County Flood Control and Water Conservation District as a Junior Engineer. He was quickly promoted to Associate Civil and Senior Civil Engineer position. As Senior Civil Engineer, David supervised the District's Project Planning Section. In 1983 David was promoted to the position of Flood Control Principal Engineer, with the responsibility for management of the Administrative Division, one of five divisions in the District. In 1992, he was promoted to the position of Assistant Chief Engineer and was responsible for coordination of District activities involving the District's six division and other governmental and private entities in the execution of the District's mission. In 1996 David was promoted to the position of General Manager-Chief Engineer.  The Riverside County Flood and Water Conservation District presently employees a staff of approximately 175, forty of which are graduate engineers and thirty eight are registered civil engineers in the State of California. Under David's exemplary leadership the District continues to pursue an aggressive effort to design and construct needed flood control infrastructure.  In addition to his degree in Civil Engineering, David completed the Advanced Management Program and the Executive Management Program at the University of California, Riverside. He has been a registered Civil Engineerin the State of California since 1972. He also is a member of ASCE and APWA.  David's tireless work and unwavering loyalty will long be remembered. His commitment to the excellence of the District has contributed immeasurably to the betterment of Riverside County. His involvement in the community makes me proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that the District and many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he retires.                          ____________________
