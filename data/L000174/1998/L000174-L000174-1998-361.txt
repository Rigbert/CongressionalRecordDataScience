President, many of the times I have spoken about Vermont, I have talked about the fact that in small cities and towns everybody knows everybody else. We are a State of neighbors, from the stores on the corner to the places of worship and our town squares.  Recently, the Burlington Free Press wrote an article about John Adams. He has spent 40 years fitting shoes and boots and footwear for the people of Burlington, VT, and its surrounding areas.  When they were writing this article, it brought back to my wife and myself the memories of going into that samestore with John Adams with our young children, lining them up, getting their shoes. Those children are all grown now. And John Adams is still there. He is still one of the reasons why I love my home in Burlington and why Vermont always has been and always will be home.  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Burlington Free Press, dated Sunday, April 19, 1998, entitled ``Shoe Biz'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, Apr. 19, 1998]                                Shoe Biz                          (By Melissa Garrido)       John Adams remembers when Oldsmobiles rolled down Church      Street. He recalls the days when ladies strolled by the shops      in matching handbags, hats and high heels. And he can't      forget the time Abernethy's department store gave away mink      scarves for its 105th anniversary in 1951.       Burlington's main drag has changed since then. One thing      hasn't changed: People are still wearing the wrong shoes.       ``You could see where the wrinkle is on his shoe. It's in      the wrong spot--he's wearing his shoe too big,'' said John      Adams, peering over his square glasses at a man in clunky      sneakers hoofing past his store, Adams Boots & Shoes.       Adams, 73, has been selling shoes on upper Church Street      for more than four decades. To him, the street is the heart      of Vermont. He made his best friends and found prosperity      here. He watched Abernethy's endure a fire and remembers when      expensive leather shoes cost $15.       As businesses came and went, Adams' customers grew out of      Stride Rites into Florsheim Royal Imperials. He has outlasted      almost every other entrepreneur on Church Street.       ``I've had the privilege of going from the old days to the      new days,'' Adams said in his raspy voice. A quiet man, Adams      sometimes winds up when he tries to make a point, and uses      his hands to recount a story.       ``I saw . . . (Church Street) transform into the      Marketplace,'' he said. ``Every time they put a brick down,      it was a step toward another year.''                              First steps       Adams' shoe career began in the 1950s, when he quit his job      installing radio and television towers around the United      States for a construction company. He felt the job was too      dangerous a way for a husband and father to earn a living.       In the late 1950s, he landed a position as a shoe clerk      with the Massachusetts-based Dennis Shoe Company, which      rented retail space at Abernethy's, the old Vermont landmark      on the corner of Church and Pearl streets.       ``I didn't ask how much it paid,'' he said. ``I just came      up to work.''       Adams had no clue he would remain in the foot business      until the turn of the century.       In 1983, a year after Abernethy's closed, Adams relocated      the Dennis Shoe Co.'s operation to Almy's in the University      Mall. In 1984, the shoe company moved back downtown into the      Gladstone building, but went out of business the same year.      Adams bought the small store and renamed it Adams Boots &      Shoes.       ``I was excited about it,'' Adams said. ``But I still      wasn't my own boss. The customers were the boss; they still      are.''       In 1996, he moved across the street, back into the original      Abernethy's building on upper Church Street, to make room for      the Eddie Bauer store.       ``The store has been his life,'' said Adams' 46-year-old      son David, a senior vice president at Vermont National      Bank. ``It's what keeps him going.''       ``All he does is talk about the store,'' he said.                             Personal touch       With a shiny shoe horn tucked in his back pocket, Adams      bent down and pressed the outer edge of Alex Brett's foot to      feel the girth of a shoe. He tugged on the tongue, poked at      the space between the 11-year-old's big toe and the tip of      the shoe, and squinted as he examined the vamp.       ``I like the way this one feels better,'' Adams told Alex's      father as he squeezed the sides of the left 8\1/2\ oxford.       ``Which one feels better?'' he asked the boy.       ``The left.''       Adams tossed his hands in the air and grinned: ``I might be      old, but I can still tell the difference.''       The shoe store owner still runs his business the old-     fashioned way.       He special-orders shoes, calls his elderly female customers      ``young gals,'' and he never lets customers put on and take      off their own shoes.       ``There's nothing that irritates me more than a clerk who      watches a customer put on a shoe,'' said Adams, who calls      himself a shoe fitter, not a shoe salesman. Unlike the      average part-time shoe clerk, he brings a formal education in      fitting shoes to his trade.       Decade after decade, his customers return, first with their      children, then with their grandchildren. They come for his      personal service and his expertise in fitting children's      shoes.       For Sen. Patrick Leahy, the shoe fitter is part of his      fondest memories from his days as a Burlington prosecutor in      the 1960s. Leahy used to buy shoes from Adams for his      children when they were in grade school. Leahy remembers when      Adams would line the three up and measure their feet with a      cold, metal Brannock, a device used to gauge the size and      width of a foot. ``He never lost his patience even when the      youngest one was squirming,'' Leahy said.       ``In an impersonal world, it's kind of nice to walk in      somewhere and not only do you know the person in the store,      but they know you and actually care,'' he said, ``We still      have places like this in Vermont, and that's why it will      always be home.''                              slower pace       These days, Adams is trying to stay in business as the mom      and pop shops are replaced by franchises. The four blocks of      Church Street between Main and Pearl Streets have become a      melange of tourists toting shopping bags, students in      backpacks heading into bars, and downtown employees grabbing      a quick bite to eat.       ``I have no intentions of giving up, and I don't intend to      retire,'' Adams said.       Business trends do not shock the entrepreneur.       ``Everyone is concerned about Wal-Mart and the other      stores. I'm not a lover of the big-box stores, but they do      bring in an extra 5,000 people.       ``That just means we have to work a little bit harder,'' he      said.       Like the business in his store, Adams is slowing down.       A couple of years ago, he was diagnosed with cancer. Though      he says he has ``licked it,'' he doesn't like to talk about      the ailment that keeps him away from his customers about one      day a week--not even to his employees.       ``I can't wait to go to work the next morning, because you      have your mind on other people,'' Adams said. ``You forget      the aches and pains.''       Aches and pains brought Jan Lawrence of Williston to Adams      about 30 years ago. Her daughter was having foot problems,      and a Barre doctor suggested she take her to Adams to have      her feet fitted properly.       ``You spend anything you want on clothes,'' said Lawrence,      52, ``but never gyp on a shoe, because you'll have foot      problems later on in life.''       Today, Lawrence buys her shoes from only Adams.       ``You are important to John at all times,'' she said.      ``Even when he is not feeling well, he does his best to serve      you and your needs.''       As Adams moves toward the millennium, he is adamant about      remaining a part of Church Street. The shop owner is eager to      see new stores like Filene's sprout in downtown and lure      customers. He hopes a new department store might rekindle the      heyday of Abernethy's.       ``It was a lot more fun in those days than it is today,''      Adams said. ``It was a slower pace back then. Everyone is      always in a rush today.''
