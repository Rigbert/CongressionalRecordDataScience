President, we have before the Senate one of the most important pieces of legislation that the Senate will consider this year, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1998, the so-called ISTEA II bill. The bill touches every American, from Vermont to Florida, from Washington State to Washington D.C. ISTEA II, with its transit and safety subtitles, will spend more than $215 billion over six years on our nation's highways, transit systems, and safety programs.  That is a lot of money, but it is sorely needed. The United States has the largest transportation system in the world--170,000 miles of National Highway System routes, 900,000 miles of other Federal-aid roads, and 3.7 million miles of public roads. Prior to 1991, our national priority had been on building the national Interstate system which had been under construction since 1957. Six years ago, thanks to the leadership of Senators Moynihan and Chafee, this nation made a fundamental change in the way that it allocates its public investment in transportation. That change was based on the premises that local people understand local needs, that funding should be flexible, and that transportation should contribute to meeting national environmental and public health goals. In my estimation, ISTEA has been a resounding success.  The bill before the Senate will come to be known as ISTEA II. I want to commend the managers of the bill,Senators Chafee and Baucus, for crafting a landmark piece of legislation. This bill is good for the nation and good for my state of Vermont. It maintains and enhances our transportation commitments in ways that Vermonters will be proud of.  First of all, the bill maintains its flexibility. Vermont will retain full authority, in partnership with local governments, to decide an appropriate level of investment in roads, bridges, bicycle paths, and transit. One of the most important additions to this bill is a provision that will allow Vermont to spend its highway money on Amtrak capital improvements. Our small state has two successful Amtrak trains, both of which operate with assistance from the state. If this provision survives the conference committee with the House of Representatives, Vermont Amtrak service can be expanded to include even more communities. In western Vermont, our Ethan Allen train could be expanded to serve Bennington, Rutland, Middlebury, and Burlington.  The second goal that this bill will accomplish is that it strengthens ISTEA's commitment to the environment. There is increased funding for congestion mitigation, a new wetlands restoration pilot program, continued funding for recreational trails, and a greater than 25% increase in funds for bicycle transportation and pedestrian walkways.  Finally, this bill will bring more resources to Vermont. It will give Vermont a major boost in highway and transit funding, so we can better maintain our existing roads. We need the funds. For example 41% of Vermont's bridges are structurally deficient, the 11th worst rate in the nation. Today we get about $78 million in federal highway funds. Under the bill which we will pass today, Vermont will annually receive $118 million on average for the next six years.  Operating assistance for transit will increase from about $1.5 million annually to $1.8 million annually. A new $750 million trade corridor and border infrastructure program will result in enhancements at Vermont's border with Canada. A big reason for the increase for Vermont's funds is because, for the first time since 1993, every cent of the gasoline tax will be spent on roads. For the last six years, 4.3 cents of the gas tax have been dedicated to reduce the federal deficit. But with the federal budget in balance for the first time in 30 years, we can now spend those funds on badly needed transportation infrastructure.  We live in a competitive world, Mr. President. Many of our economic competitors pay their workforce much less than comparable workers here in the United States. Yet we often not only compete with the world, but we lead it in many industries. One of the big reasons why we compete and win is because we have a superior transportation infrastructure. Mr. President, this bill will modernize our infrastructure, while protecting the environment and giving Vermonters unprecedented choice in how to spend federal funds. I am proud to vote for the bill, and I hope that the Senate preserves as much of it as possible in conference.             MON VALLEY-FAYETTE EXPRESSWAY/SOUTHERN BELTWAY
