Speaker, it is my distinct honor to congratulate the Lithuanian American Council of Lake County, IN, and the Lithuanian community on the 77th anniversary of Lithuanian independence.  [[Page E368]] The Lithuanian American Council will celebrate Lithuanian independence, which occurred in 1918 as the Lithuanians were freed from the Soviet Union. They will mark this joyous occasion on Sunday, February 19, 1995, at St. Casimir's Church in Gary, IN. Following tradition, the anniversary ceremony will begin with a church service starting at 11:30 a.m. After the church service, the Lithuanian American Council will hold a flag raising ceremony outside of St. Casimir to honor those Lithuanians who pledged their allegiance to independence for their people. The event will then conclude with a dinner in the church hall.  I would like to take this opportunity to commend the Lithuanian American Council of Lake County's officers, including: Vincent J. Gumulauskis, who has been president for 3 years; Pete D. Auksel and Casimir Balt, both of whom are vice presidents; Birute Vilutis, secretary; and Walter Ruzga, treasurer. Allow me to also commend the board of directors, whose members include Rev. Ignatius Urbonas, Aleksas Degutis, Alex Navardauskas, Dan Pauls, Frank Petrites, Brone Tampauskas, and Izidorius Tavaras. Finally, I would like to commend every member of the Lithuanian American Council for the loyalty and enthusiasm they have displayed toward their ethnicity.  The Lithuanian American Council of Lake County, IN is a branch of the Lithuanian American Council. It was founded in 1940 and originated in large cities such as Boston, Chicago, and New York. The organization in Lake County initially was headquartered at St. Francis in East Chicago, IN, until recently when the building was demolished. The organization was then moved to St. Casimir where its home is today.  It is my sincere hope that 1995 will bring renewed prosperity for all members of the Lithuanian community and their families. May this 77th anniversary celebration prove to be a most joyous occasion.                          ____________________
