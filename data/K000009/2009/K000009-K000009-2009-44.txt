Speaker, I rise this evening to remember L. William Seidman, known to many as Bill. Among his many life accomplishments, he served as chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation through the recovery of the savings and loan industry following the massive scandals and excesses of the 1980s. He was a patriot, a wry intellect, and a very sharp financial system regulator.  Sadly, America lost Bill in mid-May, but his legacies will remain with us for years to come. Beyond his financial expertise, he led the effort for the creation of a State college in his home State, in the Grand Rapids, Michigan, area known as Grand Valley State University.  Education is a key indicator of individual success, and through the leadership of Bill Seidman, young and old alike can further their learning and obtain new skills to achieve their dreams. I can see why this achievement was said to have been one of Bill's proudest.  I've had the great privilege in my life of working with Bill Seidman during my own career, and most recently I invited him here to Congress to meet Members to engage his experience, along with that of Bill Isaac, another former effective Chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, on the current financial crisis and the paths these two experts could suggest to resolve it and accelerate its resolution.  Of his major concerns, based on a life dedicated to finance and prudent banking system regulation and performance, Bill Seidman felt that the lack of regulation in the derivatives market, including credit default swaps, was a severe and continuing problem. He discussed how former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan opposed regulating these instruments because they were agreements between sophisticated parties and need not be regulated.                              {time}  2115  Seidman strongly disagreed, stating that he felt that the credit default swaps market was a dishonest one. His words were prophetic.  Seidman also felt that securitization lay at the heart of the housing crisis because of the way the practice is carried out. He said they take a bunch of mortgages, they bundle them up, and then they sell them off without any connection to the value of what they are selling. He said, ``If you can make money off garbage, go ahead and sell garbage, as long as you don't have to deal with it later.''  Both Bill Seidman and Bill Isaac really advised America that we needed to fix securitization, including making sure that bankers have real ``skin in the game,'' that is, hold on to some of the risk rather than passing it all forward. I couldn't agree more strongly. It's time for transformation in these instruments and in the overall financial system.  Our Members were honored to be discussing such matters with Mr. Seidman, as he had served as financial adviser to four Presidents, served as Chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation during a most difficult time as he helped steady our economic ship of State. And during his tenure, one of the Nation's largest banking scandals, the savings and loan crisis, unfolded, arising again out of a housing crisis.  Under his watch, the FDIC, through the Resolution Trust Corporation, was created to take over the troubled thrifts and resolve them. Bill oversaw that as Chair of the FDIC and closed or reorganized 747 institutions during the banking excesses of the 1980s. Their assets totaled over $400 billion.  The assets were seized and sold at bargain prices through the Resolution Trust Corporation, and the goal of getting the maximum for those toxic assets and reducing taxpayer exposure was primary. Still, that mess cost over $124 billion to the U.S. taxpayer. Stability was established at a great price, but after his tenure, rather than Congress tightening down on bad behavior and improving financial system regulation, it just opened the doors and rewarded bad behavior, and it carried us to our current sad state of affairs.  America will miss Bill Seidman's wisdom, his insight, his experience. Hecontinued his knowledge and advice right up until the day we lost him. May we remember Bill. We thank his family for his hard work and dedication to his callings and the lessons he learned and taught us. We need to reread his words and to act thoughtfully and swiftly to solve the current crisis facing our Nation. I know he would want that for sure.  I extend the sympathies of this Congress and our hope for strength to his family in the coming days to endure his loss, to Bill's wife, his children, his grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. He truly was a great American.  Our country was strengthened by his service and it is with a sad and grateful heart and mind that I yield back the balance of my time this evening.                          ____________________
