I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I would like to have a quote here from someone who, I think, is quite prominent: You go under; you go around; you go through it. What they need is more manpower and more technology.  That was the Acting Chief of Staff for the White House, Mick Mulvaney, when, perhaps, he was a little more independent as a Member of the United States Congress. That was August 25, 2015.  I would ask: What has changed since then? Well, he now works for the President. That is a change.  Donald Trump, during his campaign, was real hardline on immigration, but he kept forgetting to mention immigration in some of his speeches. So his staff came up with a mnemonic. They said: Well, he is a builder. If we say ``wall,'' he will remember it.  And the President did. It was just an afterthought. It was: How are we going to get him to give his hard line on immigration during his campaign speeches and get rousing going. Let's use the wall.  The wall then became a life unto its own, as a campaign promise, not as something that is effective.  As we have talked about before, the drugs, use a trebuchet or a catapult. Use a drone, tunnels--really common, tunnels--and, of course, legal border crossings.  This is an end conclusion to a campaign promise for his base but not what is in the best interests of the United States of America in terms of preventing the shipment of illegal drugs.  Now, I don't know where the gentleman came up with that new statistic that three times as many drugs were intercepted outside the ports of entry, unless he was using the Coast Guard, which he may have been, because the Coast Guard intercepted more drugs than every other agency of the Federal Government, combined, in the maritime route.  Unfortunately, as the former Commandant of the Coast Guard said: We can identify 80 percent with our intel, 80 percent of the drug shipments coming in on a maritime basis, but the Coast Guard only has the resources to intercept 20 percent.  So I guess that is probably where that statistic came from.  The Coast Guard is doing a great job with inadequate resources. In the bipartisan compromise, they got some additional money for air and marine assets, three multi-enforcement aircraft. They could use a heck of a lot more.  Why don't we get that 80 percent? Why don't they have resources to get that 80 percent that they know about, and then let's get better intel and get the other 20 percent.  And then let's scan 100 percent of the vehicles coming across the border. I have been at the border, when, through intuition, a Border Patrol agent found drug smuggling. I just happened to be there that day. I mean, it was just sort of a: Whoa, Congressman, you might like to see this.  The guy drove up to the border. He had a birthday cake and a bottle of tequila on the seat. The Border Patrol guy said: Hmm, something is suspicious. Take the truck over there.  They scoped out the gas tank. They found big blocks of drugs in the gas tank.  Was that because we had sophisticated technology and when the guy pulled the truck up we could use that technology? No, it was the intuition of the Border Patrol agent.  I said: How did you know to go and really search through that guy's vehicle?  He said: Well, there was nothing on his key ring. There was only one key in the ignition. He was a throwaway.  The cartel was probably paying him 10,000 bucks or something to drive that stolen or purchased pickup truck across the border concealing drugs, and the human element caught that guy.  There aren't enough Border Patrol agents. They have openings. They are not adequately compensated. They weren't paid during the shutdown, but they were still working at the border. They are the first line of defense.  But they also need new technology. We can't install all that technology to scan 100 percent of the vehicles coming through unless we invest a lot of money in improving the border crossing because we will have trucks backed up 100 miles back into Mexico because of the amount of commerce that comes across.  So what are we going to do? We are going to build a stupid, static wall over there and over there, and we are still going to let, probably, 85 percent of the vehicles go through without applying technology.  Guzman, sitting in his jail cell, is probably just chortling over this. He is saying: Boy, are those Americans stupid. Why don't they get the technology they need to scan the cargo that we are hiding in very sophisticated ways in tractor trailers, in pickup trucks, in individual passenger vehicles? Why don't they intercept the drugs that are coming in through the oceans that they even know about and they are not intercepting them?  No, we are going to build a dumb wall.  And, by the way, when the Republicans were in charge, we had a vote on that and it failed. If this was such a crisis and such a great idea when the Republicans controlled the House, the Senate, and the White House, why didn't they make it a priority?  Well, they didn't make it a priority because they thought it was a stupid idea. But now it is a political thing. This is a victory for the President. It excites his base. It energizes his base. He has to have it, so he declares a national emergency.  The emergency is political. It is not national security. It is not drugs.  We have a humanitarian crisis at the border--yes, we do--and what is a wall going to do about that?  They come to the border. They stand there and they say: We want to apply for asylum in the United States.  If they come across in a remote area, they hope they come across a Border Patrol agent because they want to surrender at the moment, right there, and get some shelter and get medical care. They are now organizing busloads to come up from Guatemala and Honduras.  We are not dealing with the root problems down there, and we are not dealing with the smugglers who are now hiring very nice, luxury buses as opposed to the old ride on that killer train that people used to take to come up, when there were smugglers who would often rape them, kill them, rob them, whatever else. Now they have converted to: Oh, let's put them in a luxury coach and they will have rest stops and everything else.  This has become big business. Why aren't we doing something about that? The wall will do nothing about that--nothing.  Why, why, why are we going to waste billions of dollars on a medieval fortress that won't work?  I urge my colleagues to vote and override the veto of the President of the United States; restore the integrity of the Congress of the United States and the appropriations process under Article I of the Constitution of the United States.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question. =========================== NOTE ===========================     March 26, 2019, on page H2812, the following appeared: Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.
