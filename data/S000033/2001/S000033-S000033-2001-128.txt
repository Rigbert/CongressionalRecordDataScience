 Meanwhile, one could be a mother raising two kids making $22,000 a year. Do Members know what that tax cut is? Zero, not one nickel.  So it seems to me not only is the Bush tax proposal grotesquely unfair, giving huge tax breaks to the people who need it the least, but it is absolutely irresponsible.  President Bush, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), myself, the American people, do not know what the economy will be next year, in 5 years, and certainly not in 10 years. Nobody knows.  For years and years, our conservative friends have been saying, we cannot spend money we do not have. We have to be cautious with the taxpayers' money. But they have decided to give out at minimum $1.3 trillion or probably a lot more over a 10-year period. Meanwhile, back in Vermont and throughout this country, young people who graduate from a 4-year college are ending up at $19,000 in debt, on average. Lower-income kids are ending up even more in debt, and that does not count the debt incurred by the young man's or woman's parents.  For the first time in many years, a lot of low-income high school graduates are thinking twice about whether or not they want to go to college. Meanwhile, Pell grants and other student aid programs for college students have in no way kept pace with the escalating cost of college, putting enormous stress on the middle class.  Yes, we have hundreds of billions of dollars available for tax breaks for the richest 1 percent; no, we cannot significantly increase Pell grants and other student aid programs for the middle class.  Just last Saturday in South Royalton, Vermont, I held a town meeting on an issue which needs an enormous amount of discussion and awareness, an increase in awareness, in public consciousness. That is the absolute crisis that exists in child care in this country today.  I find it appalling that there are people who would come up to this podium and talk about family values and their love of children and working families, and continue to ignore the crisis in child care which goes on in America today.  The reality, in my State and virtually all across this country, is that working families cannot find quality, affordable child care. It is much too expensive. Meanwhile, child care workers themselves are working for horrendously low wages. If they are running their own home centers, in some cases they are making below the minimum wage.  The turnover among child care workers is extremely high. People are not getting the training that they need.  Study after study demonstrates what common sense tells us, that the first 5 years of a child's life are the most formative years. What kind of Nation are we when we are ignoring the needs of millions of children? The end result is that while we do not put money in the front end in terms of child care, what we are doing certainly is puttingmoney in the back end when these kids fail out of high school and end in jail, and we are spending $25,000 for them in jail, but we are not paying attention to their needs in child care.  The reality in child care is that huge numbers of women are now in the work force. They need help. As a society we have to pay attention. I think it makes a lot more sense to put money into child care, put money into financial aid for college students, rather than give tax breaks to people who do not need it.  I yield to my friend, the gentleman from Oregon.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Remember, as we are having this conversation, that the Republicans adjourned the House earlier today so they could go down to a $15 million, $25,000 a plate fundraiser. I have to say, most of the issues we are talking about here tonight are not very well represented at that event.  If I could just go back to tax cuts for a moment, one thing, of all the strange things this administration has said recently, or of this 1950s energy policy they gave us, which is just a tremendous, tremendous windfall for the oil, gas, and coil industry, was one where the administration said, well, we are putting an immediate stimulus, so-called, into the tax cut, around $100 million, and that money can be spent by the American people to pay the higher fuel bills.  First off, of course, approximately half of that is going to go to the people at the top who are not noticing the higher prices. Then when we divide up the rest of that among all the other Americans, it is not going to pay for a tank of gas at this inflated price-gouging we are seeing at the gas pump, let alone what we are seeing with the thousand percent run-up in electric prices in the West.  It is almost kind of like a Marie Antoinette ``Let them eat cake'' kind of thing; we are giving them some crumbs, what is their problem? They are going to get a little bit of money back. So what if they are being gouged at the pump by Enron, Dynegy, Synergy, all these other companies, Reliant, of course, being my favorite.  Just a minute on that. I have to refer to the fact that the Reliant Energy Company, based in Houston, Texas, according to the San Francisco Chronicle on Sunday, was gaming the California energy market on 10-minute increments. That is, they actually had their plant operators in the two crummy plants they bought in California at a very cheap price, old plants, they actually had them on the line to their traders on the floor in Houston.  The traders on the floor in Houston, as soon as they saw energy prices go down, would tell them to shut the plants down. As soon as they saw energy prices go up, they would tell them to crank the plants up. Of course, this wears the plants out quickly, causes them to go down, and hurts the energy supply.  But Reliant and Enron and Dynegy and Synergy and Exxon-Mobil and all the others, they are downtown eating caviar, popping very expensive champagne, and having a good old time with the President, and the Americans are being told, do not worry, there is a tax bill moving through Congress that will help you pay for a tank of gas.                              {time}  2100  Now, of course, you buy more than one tank a year. You are going to be kind of netted out on this issue.  Well, we cannot do anything about that. That is the free market. It is not the free markets. It is market manipulation. It is price gouging. It is lack of action against the OPEC cartel.  It is lack of action by the Bush Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to reign in what their own staff has said are unjustifiable prices in the wholesale energy.  The pattern here just runs through everything and it all comes back to follow the money. The money runs straight down to 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, or whatever the address is at the White House there. That is where it is going and that is where it is flowing.                Announcement by the Speaker pro tempore
