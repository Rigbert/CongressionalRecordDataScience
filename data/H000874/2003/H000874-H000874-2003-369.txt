I certainly agree with him that in the long term the best solution is the creation of an economy that creates sufficient jobs for all Americans who are seeking jobs.  My friend knows that there are 6 million Americans who are unemployed at this point in time, the highest unemployment we have had in approximately a decade. It is nice to say that if we pass those bills, we will create new jobs, but the people who lose their unemployment at the end of this month and who will not have sufficient funds to pay their mortgages, to purchase groceries for their families, are going to have little solace because we are going to pass some bill that will create some jobs sometime down the road. But I appreciate the gentleman's observation.  Does the gentleman want to make an additional comment?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I must admit that I am not an expert on unemployment insurance, but it is my understanding that the unemployment insurance program is still in place, and 26 weeks, every State in the Nation gets 26 weeks when they are let off.  I know the gentleman is referring to those that are running to the end of their benefits. I might point out to the gentleman that that is not 6 million people, and those extensions of benefits are still in place for those that are still receiving benefits.  Having said that, there is time, if we can work out some sort of agreement, to do something for those that may have their benefits expiring. So there is time to work, and there are vehicles by which we could do it. But I hope the gentleman is not suggesting that we go beyond regular order in accomplishing passage of such legislation.
