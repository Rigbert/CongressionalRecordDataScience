 President, I certainly think the cooperation we have had from the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Nickles, helped to move this bill along. Even though he has not liked some parts of the bill, he has been cooperative all the way through the process and, more importantly, through the crucial time of conference.  There is a claim that pharmacies are concerned about beneficiary access to pharmacies, pricing transparency issues, and insurance risk.  I understand the concerns of pharmacists with regard to local access. This bill provides several provisions to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries are provided with adequate choice and easy accessibility to local pharmacies.  First, the conference report provides choice to beneficiaries by containing an ``any willing provider'' provision. This provision requires prescription drug plans to accept any and all pharmacies willing to agree to the terms and conditions of the plan. By adding this provision, we have given all pharmacies, big and small, the chance to participate in the modernization of Medicare.  Second, the conference report provides beneficiaries with convenient access to pharmacies by adopting the TRICARE standard for prescription drug plans. In urban areas, 90 percent of beneficiaries would have a pharmacy within two miles of their residence; 90 percent of beneficiaries in suburban areas would have access to a pharmacy within five miles of their home; In rural areas, plans would be required to provide 70 percent of beneficiaries with a pharmacy 15 miles within their residence.  By adopting this standard, beneficiaries are ensured adequate convenient access to pharmacies of their choice.  The conference report also requires that plans permit beneficiaries the ability to fill their prescriptions at a community pharmacy rather than through the mail. Again, ensuring access to local pharmacies.  In addition to providing convenient, local access to pharmacies, the conference report provides safeguards to ensure fair drug pricing and protects pharmacies from insurance risk.  Under the report, pharmacy benefit manager's, PBMs, would be required to disclose all discounts, rebates, and charge backs given to them by drug manufacturers. This places local pharmacies on a fair playing field with PBMs.  The report also prevents insurance risk to pharmacies by clarifying that pharmacies could not accept insurance risk.  This conference report adequately addresses the concerns of pharmacies and pharmacists alike. It makes sure that beneficiaries have local and convenient access to pharmacies, provides transparency pricing, and protects pharmacies from insurance risk.                      Revisions to H. Con.
