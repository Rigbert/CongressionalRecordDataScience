 I ask the Senator from Iowa, hasn't he heard, as I have from people in my State, how vulnerable they are when you empower health insurance companies to bail out when you need them the most? If we voted with the Senator from Wyoming, we would empower the health insurance companies at the expense of vulnerable people who may face an accident or a diagnosis tomorrow that changes their lives. Isn't that what this gets down to in its most basic form? Do we want to give power to the people who are insured or power to the health insurance companies? As I understand the Senator from Wyoming, he thinks the health insurance companies should have the power and we should not be providing protection to the people who need it most.
