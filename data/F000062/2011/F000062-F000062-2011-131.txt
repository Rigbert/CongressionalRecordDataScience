 President, today I wish to pay tribute to Gerry Counihan, an extraordinary man and a wonderful example for us all.  Gerry is a familiar face and a friend to the Members of this body.  Each of us who have made the trip into this historic Capitol Building and boarded the elevator to cast a vote on this floor has been warmly welcomed or helped in some way by Gerry.  Gerry's life has had its share of challenges.  He was born with a learning disability, but with his trademark determination and optimism he beat the odds and graduated from Franciscan University in 1988.  Gerry first came to work here on Capitol Hill in 1991, and he returned in 1997 to take a job as a tour guide.  His enthusiasm and his love of American history made him an outstanding guide and a dedicated public servant.  Gerry also helped many visitors to our Capitol cope during a time of tragedy.  He gave the first public tour of the Capitol after two police officers were killed in 1998.  In 2001, Gerry gave the first tour when the Capitol reopened following the terrorist attacks of September 11.  In my opinion, this is a testament to the dedication and the patriotism Gerry has shown during his many years of service to our country.  In May 2007, Gerry was the victim of a brutal home invasion and assault. After this senseless act of violence, he was told by his doctors that he may never walk again.  But Gerry has never taken no for an answer.  After months in the hospital and grueling rehabilitation, Gerry returned to the Capitol, eventually taking a job as an elevator operator.  Again, Gerry impressed all of us in the Senate with his dedication and his generous spirit.  Gerry will soon begin a job at the Department of Health and Human Services. I know I speak for all of us when I say that HHS is lucky to have him.  Gerry makes the Senate a brighter place, and I am truly sorry to see him go. I admire his optimism, his dedication, and especially his courage in the face of adversity.  I wish Gerry well as he moves onto this exciting new challenge.                          ____________________
