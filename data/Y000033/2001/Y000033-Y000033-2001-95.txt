This is the language negotiated with the Senate side. It is not everything I wanted. I had 60,000 pilots sign a petition asking for permission to carry a weapon on board with proper training. I supported that. I talked about that in conference, but it was not a doable thing.  Right now, though, I have suggested that the pilots, under the negotiations, which they have to negotiate with every contract they do with the airlines, that that be part of the negotiations. I believe we will see a lot of airlines, just as United already is saying that their pilots will carry stun guns, that they can argue this with their parent companies in their negotiations.  Again, this is a compromise. It is the best I could do in this conference on this issue itself.
