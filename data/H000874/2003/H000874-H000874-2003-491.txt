Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman for that comment.  The gentleman indicated that next week we will be taking up the budget. Can the gentleman tell me whether or not all substitutes that are requested from the Congressional Black Caucus, from the Progressive Caucus, from the Blue Dogs and from the Democrats on the Committee on the Budget will be made in order? I see the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Rules is standing.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?
