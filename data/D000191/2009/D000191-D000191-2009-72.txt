  Mr. DeFAZIO. Last week the Congressional Oversight Panel of the so-called TARP program, the bank bailout program, announced that George Bush and his buddy, Henry ``Hank'' Paulson from Wall Street but who, for a little while stood in as Secretary of the Treasury, paid $254 billion for $167 billion worth of assets in the name of the American taxpayer. They lost 34 cents on every dollar.  Now, how is it that Henry ``Hank'' Paulson came out of Wall Street with $700 million? He was so smart, but somehow, as Secretary of the Treasury, he couldn't get full value for the dollar for the American taxpayer?  We want our money back. It's time to impose a tiny transfer tax on all securities exchanges and derivatives on Wall Street to pay back the taxpayers for the still unfolding scandal.  We want our money back.                          ____________________
