 As many of the banks who volunteered to do foreclosure moratoriums, along with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, have ended those moratoriums, foreclosures are rising again and expected to continue to rise even with administration programs up and running. Between the first of this year and April 22, in my home county of Lucas, the major county I represent, 442 foreclosed properties have been sold.  Now, would you think that's good? Who do you think is buying those homes? The very same institutions that made the liars' loans and subprime loans in the first place, Deutsche Bank, followed by Citigroup, by Wells Fargo, by U.S. Bank, Fifth Third and JPMorgan Chase, HSBC, you know the names, or their subsidiaries.  So, they foreclose, they buy, then they sell, pulling profit each step of the way, while destroying neighborhood after neighborhood, community after community in their wake.  When are we going to stop letting Wall Street make money coming and going while people lose their homes and our communities are destroyed?                              {time}  1930  Now, who do they sell to? That's interesting. All to absentee investors who don't care or don't even know where we reside. Absentee investors across our country and, in many cases, across the world.  Of the 442 properties sold--get ready for this--93 percent--93 percent--were sold to banks or to absentee investors. I don't call that community reinvestment. I call that community disemboweling, community disinvestment.  These buyers have no connection to Ohio or our community. They have no tie to our people. They merely seek to make more profit off the anguish of places such as where we reside, through the foreclosure process, as unemployment skyrockets. Communities do not have the tools to defend themselves from this predatory pillage.  Realtors from our district are telling us that the same banks purposely are slowing down short sales of properties, pushing off sellers, and leaving properties vacant. Why? To make more money again.  Federal policy should support Main Street families regaining equity and hope. Wall Street is rigging every transaction to laden their pockets--at the expense of the very taxpayers that supported them when they were crashing, and continue to support them as they stabilize. Business as usual for Wall Street--never doing for others, but profiting at everyone else's expense.  Foreclosures weaken communities. Absentee investors do the same. We see home prices fall, which leads to more foreclosures as communities weaken and mortgages go underwater. People in communities are drowning across this country. To jump in and save them will require creative, big picture-thinking that goes beyond the gains of these big banks or the silos of governmental programs and goes beyond the benefit of one institution over another.  We must let the FDIC and SEC deal with troubled banks and their ledgers and our financial system as they are designed to operate. Any Federal agency that deals with housing and foreclosures and jobs must join forces in designing funding mechanisms to radically transform the most hard-hit communities across our country. I would start with those that are now at double-digit in unemployment and foreclosures. Saving them will save more than just those communities. It will begin to breathe life back into our Nation's economy.  It's time Main Street was put ahead of Wall Street. And it's time that this Congress paid attention to what is happening coast-to-coast.  I will place in the Record material from the New York Times of this week.                 [From the New York Times, May 4, 2009]                      As Foreclosures Surge . . .       The Obama administration sat by last week as 12 Senate      Democrats joined 39 Senate Republicans to block a vote on an      amendment that would have allowed bankruptcy judges to modify      troubled mortgages.       Senator Obama campaigned on the provision. And President      Obama made its passage part of his antiforeclosure plan. It      would have been a very useful prod to get lenders to rework      bad loans rather than leaving the modification to a judge.       But when the time came to stand up to the banking lobbies      and cajole yes votes from reluctant senators--the White House      didn't. When the measure failed, there wasn't even a      statement of regret.       Mr. Obama's plan to keep struggling Americans in their      homes now relies on lenders to voluntarily rework bad loans.      The plan provides ample incentives, including payments to      servicers who successfully modify loans and, in some cases,      payments to mortgage investors who agree to modifications.      Whether that will be enough remains to be seen.       The administration estimates that its plan will prevent      three million to four million foreclosures, but it will take      several months before there is enough data to evaluate. In      the past, however, voluntary modifications have failed to      curb the rise in foreclosures. The number of foreclosure      filings in March was very high, with estimates between      290,000 and 341,000.       Even if lenders do agree to modify loans, many Americans      will still be in trouble. That's because nearly 14 million      homeowners are ``under water''--they owe more on their      mortgages than their homes are worth.       In a bankruptcy, such homeowners would likely have their      loan principal reduced, lowering their payments and helping      them to rebuild equity. In a typical voluntary loan      modification, however, the monthly payment is reduced, but      not the principal. That puts under-water borrowers at high      risk of redefault, because there is no equity to fall back on      if a financial setback leaves them unable to make mortgage      payments.       The negative feedback loop--foreclosures beget falling home      prices, which beget foreclosures, further weakening the      banks--is well under way. We hope the president's plan can      break the loop, but without bankruptcy reform it is going to      be a lot harder.  In fact, last week we lost what one can say was a final hope for some Americans. With their mortgage completely underwater, credit card bills unpaid, home heating or cooling bills unpaid, healthcare bills unpaid and less food on the table . . . they turn to bankruptcy. This is the last chance and last hope for people who have tried everything else humanly possible to crawl out from under their debt. The decision is hard. Their hearts and souls demoralized, they turn to bankruptcy.  Currently, bankruptcy does not include dealing with one's primary residence. The House passed bill H.R. 1106 included ``cramdown'' provisions. Not ideal. Not what anyone wants to do, but a tool to help some of the most desperate Americans settle debts and begin again.  No such luck . . . the amendment in the Senate to achieve such a path was defeated. The New York Times editorial harkens this to a negative feedback loop. . . .                          ____________________
