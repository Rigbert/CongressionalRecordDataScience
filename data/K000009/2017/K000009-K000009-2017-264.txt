Speaker, I rise today to recognize a momentous occasion in the life of the Sylvania congregation of the Sisters of St. Francis. The Sylvania Order of the Sisters of St. Francis celebrated its centennial year in 2016. Our entire community honors the noteworthy contributions of the Franciscan's 100 years of noble service through a celebratory mass.  It was Bishop Joseph Schrembs of the Toledo Catholic Diocese who initially requested religious sisters to teach the children of Polish immigrants in Toledo's Catholic Schools. On December 8, 1916, the Sylvania Franciscans were founded as a province of the Sisters of St. Francis in Rochester, Minnesota. The Sisters were stationed at St. Hedwig School in the North End of Toledo which served as a hub of Polish life in the city. After 89 acres of land was purchased in 1917 through the Rochester community, the Sisters were formally established in Sylvania, Ohio. They were known as the Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate Conception and were led by Mother Adelaide.  In the century that followed, the Sylvania Franciscans branched out from their original call to teach the city's Polish immigrant children. They began sharing the Franciscan presence in ministries spanning health care, housing, human services and pastoral care, in addition to education. The Sisters' work is carried forth in eight states and the country of Haiti with 150 Sisters serving our human family.  The Sisters' ministries are founded on the ``core values of reverence, service, community, stewardship.'' The Franciscan Sisters are called ``like Francis of Assisi to live the Gospel in joyful servanthood among all people. The Sisters of St. Francis of Sylvania, Ohio as messengers of peace, commit themselves to works that reverence human dignity, embrace the poor and marginalize, and respect the gift of all creation.'' Living Christ's message described in Matthew 25:40 ``whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.'' The Sylvania Sisters of St. Francis celebrated their centennial year as an integral part of our community. Their imprimatur is seen everywhere, from the beautiful elegiac campus in Sylvania, to the schools, caring services and hospitals in which they minister, and the Sylvania Franciscan Village which was established to integrate the Sisters' ministries.  In addition to traditional ministries, the Sylvania Sisters of St. Francis are leading efforts toward peace and justice and restoring nature. The Sisters note, ``We believe that nature, the arts and culture, and the goodness around us nurture our souls and make us sensitive to Mother Earth and her people.'' It is that connection that truly defines the Sisters of St. Francis. A walk on the grounds of the Sisters of St. Francis is to behold the beauty of nature in all of its glory, to hear the silence and to feel God's presence everywhere.  From the barracks and strawberry patch Mother Adelaide and the 22 pioneering Sisters first established, the grounds of the Sisters of St. Francis now feature many buildings in which the Sisters live and work, shrines, grottos, a prayer garden, the Portiuncula Chapel and adjacent Lourdes University. Its mission-style buildings showcase stunning mosaics and works of art crafted by the Sisters themselves. It is truly an oasis of peace and tranquility.  St. Francis of Assisi said, ``Preach the Gospel at all times and when necessary use words.'' Throughout their one-hundred-year history the Sylvania Sisters of St. Francis have lived this truth. Their presence and their good works demonstrate Christ's path and God's deep love. As the kind and generous Sisters go forth toward their next centennial, let us be mindful of the history, but with a vision for the future. Our community gratefully and enthusiastically joins with them to celebrate the life of this vital and cherished congregation that is the Sylvania Sisters of St. Francis.                          ____________________
