It is accurate that no one on our side of the aisle supported the final budget.  The fact is, for the first time in years, a budget was brought to the Senate floor. Senator Murray presided over a very open process with debate and with plenty of opportunity for amendments to be offered. There is simply no reason the very reasonable approach suggested by Senator McCain that would allow us to go to conference should not be adopted.  We have called repeatedly for a return to regular order in this body. Regular order is going to conference. Both the House and the Senate have passed budget resolutions, and it is important that there be a conference committee to work out the differences, which are considerable, so that we will have a framework with binding allocations for the Appropriations Committees.  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question, just one question?
