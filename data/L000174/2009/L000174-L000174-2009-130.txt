President, many of us have been touched by a family member or friend who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. In fact, more than 5.3 million people in the United States are living with Alzheimer's, which translates into a new case every 70 seconds. As our Nation ages, more and more cases will develop each year and an estimated million new cases will be diagnosed annually by 2050. I am proud be a cosponsor of S. 1492, the Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act of 2009 which helps fund Alzheimer's disease research, gives assistance to caregivers, and increases public education about prevention of Alzheimer's.  It is not just the elderly who are diagnosed with Alzheimer's. My good friend Diane Wolk of Castleton, VT, in her early fifties was diagnosed about a year and a half ago with early onset Alzheimer's. Instead of hiding her diagnosis or giving up hope, Diane now travels the State and the country sharing her experience with others. Through promoting education and early intervention, Diane helps patients and their family members recognize their symptoms and seek diagnosis and treatment. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a story from the Burlington Free Press about Diane's courage and perseverance in the face of an overwhelming diagnosis.  Marcelle and I are so proud of her, and of the inspiration she gives to Alzheimer's patients in Vermont and nationwide. She is a true hero.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  [From the Burlington FreePress.com]                        Lessons From Alzheimer's                           (By Sally Pollak)       Diane Wolk spent her adult life as an educator, a teacher      or principal in Vermont public schools. One day this summer,      Wolk said she had another lesson she'd like to share with      people--perhaps her most important.       Wolk's teaching moment came in a lounge at Fletcher Allen      Health Care. She was in Burlington with her husband, Dave      Wolk, to undergo an experimental treatment for Alzheimer's      disease, a degenerative brain disorder Wolk was diagnosed      with two years ago.       Diane Wolk wanted to tell people that in the face of      confusing symptoms and diagnosis with a ``scary'' illness, it      is both possible and important to approach the situation in      an honest, upbeat and life-affirming way.       ``You have to take the fear out of the diagnosis,'' Wolk,      58, said. ``It's not a death sentence. You can curl up and      die or you can do something. I'm always the teacher, and if I      can help someone else, I will.''       Wolk is hopeful that talking about her experience with      Alzheimer's, which she developed at an unusually early age,      might help others recognize symptoms, seek medical care, find      courage and summon an upbeat attitude.       ``I have a very easy life,'' she said in the hospital. ``I      have a wonderful husband. This is a little setback, but      things are good. Very few people get out of this life      unscathed. I try to stay active and upbeat. People deal with      all kinds of difficult situations, and this one--it's really      just bad luck.''       Wolk is married to Dave Wolk, 56, the president of      Castleton State College and     former Vermont Commissioner of Education. They've been      married 18 years, a second marriage for both. They have four      children in their 20s, two sons and two daughters.       Diane Wolk, has a Ph.D. in educational leadership from the      University of Vermont, and a long and varied career in      Vermont education. She's taught students from elementary      school to graduate school, directed the student-teacher      program at Castleton State, and served as chairwoman of the      state Board of Education.       Wolk retired in 2006 from her job as principal of Northeast      Elementary School in Rutland City, bringing to a finish a      Vermont career that started in 1972. That year, she was hired      to teach first grade at Barstow Memorial School in      Chittenden, where she taught for 18 years.       Her last two years as principal in Rutland, Wolk found it      increasingly difficult to run the school, she said.       ``I was off my game,'' Wolk said. ``I was getting confused,      and I thought it was the stress of being principal. I was      forgetting things and repeating myself. I wasn't myself.''       Leaving her profession meant saying goodbye to a vital part      of her life, but it was an important step in her care, her      husband said.       ``She loved the kids and the teachers and the families. She      missed that part,'' Dave Wolk said. ``In terms of her well-     being, it was helpful to her. She recognized that      intuitively.''                        ``Tough thing to learn''       The problems Diane Wolk perceived at work--memory loss,      confusion, repeating herself, frustration--had been      noticeable to her family and close friends since early 2004,      her husband said. The family was concerned enough about the      symptoms that Diane Wolk went to her doctor to check it out.       She was ultimately diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in      2007 at the University of Vermont's Memory Center, where she      saw its founder, neurologist William Pendlebury.       ``It was a tough thing to learn,'' Wolk said. ``I think I'm      still absorbing it.''       She has come to understand that the best approach for her      is: ``OK, it's a new day. Let's see what we can do.''       This means Wolk--who considers herself a high-energy      person--is adjusting to a slower pace. She's learned to take      naps when she's tired. She tries not to ``bug'' her husband      too much. She says she sometimes feels like she's in a haze.       ``You get angry at yourself because there are these moment      where you know what you want to do and you can't,'' Wolk      said. ``And it just gets very frustrating and scary.''       ``I've always felt that I've been in tune with my body,''      Wolk said. ``If I need to sleep, I sleep. If I need to be in      sunshine, I'll be in sunshine.''       David Wolk keeps track of her medicine, her meals, her      schedule and other aspects of family life. Their children are      a great support and visit home often, the Wolks said.       ``We've downsized our lives,'' Diane Wolk said. ``We pick      and choose when we want to stay in or go out. I have a great      group of friends, and socializing when you have Alzheimer's      is very, very important.''       Dave Wolk says he tries to minimize the stress in Diane's      life, not an easy endeavor for a college president and      primary caregiver of an Alzheimer's patient.       ``She's my No. 1 priority, and president of the college is      my No. 2 priority,'' he said.       His responsibilities include bringing Diane from their home      on the Castleton campus to Fletcher Allen Health Care every      six weeks for medical treatment.       She is enrolled in a clinical drug trial at UVM with      intravenous infusions every 13 weeks, brain scans and memory      tests.       The care provided by Pendlebury extends beyond his leading      the clinical study, the Wolks said. He is ``wise and      gentle,'' Dave Wolk said.       ``He's very calm, very wise and very uplifting,'' Diane      Wolk said. ``He doesn't let you get down. He gives you the      information you need and says here is what you can do with      it. He's salt of the earth.''       One conversation with Pendlebury was particularly important      and especially hard to confront, they said. Pendlebury      advised the Wolks to complete advance directive documents, to      put in writing their wishes about medical care and treatment      options while they are capable of making such decisions.       ``Nobody wants to realize their own death. Everybody thinks      you've got plenty of time,'' Diane Wolk said. ``But we had      those choices to make. Now everybody knows exactly what our      wishes are, and it ended up being very comforting.''                         ``Cherish the moment''       The Wolks make an effort to find comfort where they can.      This means hanging out with family and friends, taking a July      trip to Citi Field to see Paul McCartney, Diane Wolk's other      big crush, and practicing a certain acceptance of each day,      each moment.       ``I've been trying to embrace something akin to a Buddhist      philosophy,'' Dave Wolk said. ``I try not lament the past and      I try not to worry about the future. I'm trying to embrace      the moment, cherish the moment.''       Yet he is fully aware that Alzheimer's is, in his words, a      ``nasty, progressive disease that's full of doom and gloom.''       As he cares for his wife, and makes arrangements and      schedules to help ease her way through the day, Dave Wolk      remains in awe of her sunny nature.       ``If you approach Alzheimer's the way Diane Wolk approaches      it--in a very upbeat, positive manner--I believe it can      extend life. And extend the quality of life,'' he said.       Diane Wolk has suffered a decline in her short-term memory      over the past couple of months. She is confused about the day      and date, and sometimes can't remember what happened      yesterday or what's planned for tomorrow.       For Diane Wolk, the ``mystery of the brain'' makes      Alzheimer's a particularly frightening disease, she said.      When people are scared of something, they shy away from it.      They don't want to talk about it, she said.       ``If somebody is struggling with this disease and not      knowing where to go or what to do, there's a lot of help out      there,'' Wolk said in July at the hospital.       Dave Wolk remembers the first time he and Diane went to      Fletcher Allen for her IV treatment. She receives the      intravenous in the oncology unit, where patients go for      chemotherapy.       The Wolks were there for seven hours, and they watched      cancer patients come and go.       ``Diane kept saying how fortunate we are,'' Dave Wolk said.      ``She is such an amazing, inspirational person. I know of no      greater profile in courage.''                          ____________________
