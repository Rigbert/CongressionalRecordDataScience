President, when companies make headlines today it is often for all the wrong reasons: outrageous bonuses, tax avoidance, fraud, profiteering, etc. Yet many of the companies that provide jobs are conscientious corporate citizens that try to treat workers fairly and at the same time create good products that consumers want and maximize profits for their shareholders. I believe that we should reward such companies for providing good jobs to American workers and create incentives to encourage more companies to do the same. The Patriot Employers Act does just that.  This legislation, which I am introducing today along with Senator Brown, would provide a tax credit to reward the companies that treat American workers best. Companies that provide American jobs, pay decent wages, provide good benefits, and support their employees when they are called to active duty should enjoy more favorable tax treatment than companies that are unwilling to make the same commitment to American workers. The Patriot Employers tax credit would put the tax code on the side of those deserving companies by acknowledging their commitments.  The Patriot Employers legislation would provide a tax credit equal to 1 percent of taxable income to employers that meet the following criteria.  First, invest in American jobs. Maintain or increase the number of full-time workers in America relative to the number of full-time workers outside of America, maintain corporate headquarters in America if the company has ever been headquartered in America, and maintain neutrality in union organizing drives.  Second, pay decent wages. Pay each worker an hourly wage that would ensure that a full-time worker would earn enough to keep a family of three out of poverty, at least $8.50 per hour.  Third, prepare workers for retirement. Either provide a defined benefit plan or provide a defined contribution plan that fully matches at least 5 percent of worker contributions for every employee.  Fourth, provide health insurance. Pay at least 60 percent of each worker's health care premiums.  Fifth, support our troops. Pay the difference between the regular salary and the military salary of all National Guard and Reserve employees who are called for active duty, and continue their health insurance coverage.  In recognition of the different business circumstances that small employers face, companies with fewer than 50 employees could achieve Patriot Employer status by fulfilling a smaller number of these criteria.  There is more to the story of corporate American than the widely-publicized wrongdoing. Patriot Employers should be publicly recognized for doing right by their workers even while they do well for their customers and shareholders. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Brown and me in supporting this effort. Our best companies, and our American workers, deserve nothing less.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 829       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
