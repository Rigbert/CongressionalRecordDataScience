President. I rise today to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the town of Berwick, ME. As the ninth incorporated town in Maine, Berwick holds a very special place in our State's history, and one that exemplifies the determination and resiliency of Maine people.  While this landmark anniversary marks Berwick's incorporation, the year 1713 was but one milestone in a long journey of progress. It is a journey that began thousands of years earlier with Native American villages on the banks of the Piscataqua and Salmon Falls Rivers. In 1631, barely a decade after the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock, Ambrose Gibbens established a settlement at Quampeagan Falls and built the first sawmill in North America. That manufacturing heritage has remained strong in the three communities known today as The Berwicks, from the textile and iron works of the 18th century to the cutting-edge biotechnology and aerospace industries of today.  Industry is only part of Berwick's story. During the Revolutionary War, the town provided two full companies to fight for America's independence, more than many towns of greater size. The courage and character demonstrated by the townspeople in standing for liberty echo throughout Berwick's history. In the years before the Civil War, the many churches in town were powerful voices for the abolition of slavery. During that terrible conflict, more than 200 of Berwick's young men fought, and many died, so that all might live in freedom. The town's honor roll of current military personnel demonstrates an ongoing commitment to our Nation's founding principles.  This anniversary is not just about something that is measured in calendar years. It is about human accomplishment. We celebrate the people who, for more than three centuries, have pulled together, cared for one another, and built a great community that is a wonderful place to live, work, and raise families. Thanks to those who came before, Berwick has a wonderful history.Thanks to those who are here today, it has a bright future.                          ____________________
