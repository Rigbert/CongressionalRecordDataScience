Unfortunately, the gentleman has not been here that long to recognize one thing: we try to notify everybody. Every one of the bills have had direct notification to the persons involved. The Committee on Commerce, the chairman signed off on this legislation. It directly affects his district.  Everybody that is in this bill that affects someone's district has signed off. If the gentleman believes in a representative form of government, that is the criteria. To my information, there has been nobody who has objected to these. We have been in contact with the White House. We have been in contact with Senator Daschle on a daily basis. We have been in contact with every Member dealing with a provision in this bill.  Now, if some staff do not like this, just keep in mind this is about representation of those people elected. It is about nothing else. This is getting into the waning hours, and if the gentleman does not want to pass this legislation, fine. It does not bother me a bit, but I have been trying to work with Senator Daschle, and if the gentleman does not want to vote for this bill talk to Senator Daschle. He asked me to do this. I am doing it for him. I am doing it for those people involved in this bill, and that is what a chairman is supposed to do.  This is not a process that we go through that takes a long period of time. One tries to get it done; notify those people who are affected; ask them whether they like it or not. If they like it, it works well, nobody objects to it, including the administration, then we do it.
