President, I rise this afternoon to offer an amendment with my Republican colleague from Maine on the Labor and Human Resources Committee, Senator Susan Collins, and we are joined by a host of other colleagues--Senator Kennedy, Senator Chafee, Senator Smith of Oregon, Senator Harkin, Senator Dodd, Senator Conrad, Senator Levin, Senator Kohl, Senator Wyden, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Murray, Senator Wellstone, Senator Bingaman, Senator Reid of Nevada, Senator Feingold, Senator Dorgan, Senator Torricelli, Senator Kerrey, Senator Johnson, and Senator Landrieu. I believe this indicates the widespread depth of concern and support for maintenance of the State Student Incentive Grant Program, or SSIG, as it is known.  This is a remarkable program, which requires State governments to match Federal resources on a dollar-for-dollar basis and provides direct higher education grant assistance to needy students. I had originally intended to offer, along with my colleague Senator Collins, an amendment which would have restored SSIG funding to last year's level of $50 million, but out of deference to the subcommittee chairman and also because of a lack of sufficient offset, the amendment today adds back $35 million for SSIG with an offset of unobligated balances from prior years.  In accepting this change, it is our intent to work with Chairman Specter and Senator Harkin, as they have agreed, to ensure that funding for SSIG, at no less than $35 million and hopefully even more, is secured during conference deliberations with the other body.  Mr. President, I want to tell all of my colleagues why this amendment and saving student aid funding is so vitally important.  SSIG is critical to higher education, critical to the dreams of more than 700,000 students across the Nation and 13,000 students just in my home State of Rhode Island alone.  We are all familiar with another higher education grant, the Pell grant, and, as I think many in this Chamber, as well as students, parents, and those involved in higher education know, the purchasing power of the Pell grant has fallen drastically in comparison to inflation and the skyrocketing cost of college education. Students have searched for other sources of need-based higher education grants and have come to rely upon SSIG, the State Student Incentive Grant.  With a relatively modest amount of Federal funding, this essential program encourages States to provide need-based financial aid to students in the form of grants and community service work study awards.  SSIG grants are targeted to the neediest undergraduate and graduate students. The average family income for SSIG recipients in 1991-92 was approximately $12,000, which is below the Federal poverty level for a family of four. The average SSIG-supported grant was about $1,200 in 1995-96. This program reaches those families who are most desperately in need of support to send their children to college.  Moreover, this program is extremely efficient. Every SSIG dollar goes to the students. These funds are not used in any way to cover administrative costs.  With an SSIG expenditure at the Federal level of $63 million in fiscal year 1996, the program leveraged more than $784 million in State matching funds and served more than 700,000 students across America. In Rhode Island, an SSIG Federal expenditure of roughly $334,000 leveraged over $8 million in Rhode Island expenditures, serving more than 13,000 students.  The history of this program is simple. Before its enactment 25 years ago, only 26 States provided need-based assistance to students. Now, all 50 States provide such assistance.  While SSIG has been successful in increasing State aid, it is not true that it has outlived its usefulness. The statutory purpose of SSIG is not simply to start up State programs. Instead, its purpose is to encourage and assist States in making need-based grant and community service work-study awards to students.  Indeed, if SSIG is eliminated, nine States, including Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, and Mississippi, could lose their entire grant program. In these States, SSIG funds represent 25 percent or more of their entire student grant program. It is unlikely they would sustain these programs without this Federal assistance and encouragement. In addition, if SSIG were eliminated, 43 States have already said they would reduce the number and amount of need-based grants, according to the National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs. Thirteen States could face a 40-percent drop in funding for need-based grants, according to PIRG's Higher Education Project.  Even with Federal funding, my home State of Rhode Island failed to maintain funding for the State grant program in 1993 and lost Federal SSIG funding. So Rhode Island, a State known for its commitment to education, also faces serious harm to its need-based program.  How could SSIG have outlived its usefulness if States have already or are threatening to shut down student grant programs and cut student aid?  Even the Appropriations Committee has noted that there is wisdom in maintaining funding for this program. In this Congress, the Senate will work on the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, which covers most higher education grants and loan programs including Pell grants and SSIG. During this reauthorization process, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, on which I serve, along with Senator Collins, will comprehensively review all higher education aid programs. Prior to the Labor Committee's work, I believe it would be inappropriate and unfair for Congress to eliminate a successful program like SSIG. It is a program thatdeserves support, but also deserves review, which it will receive in the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act.  It is also interesting to note that at a time when the majority party in this Congress is calling for more Federal money to be returned to the States, eliminating SSIG would end a successful program that gives States substantial flexibility and resources to help them help their citizens on to a better life.  In addition, it is important to note in the recent budget, we have gone a long way in providing tax incentives to send young people to college, tax credits and deductions from taxes, but the people that are served by SSIG are those that cannot readily use the tax system to help their children go to college. In this way, SSIG is vitally important because it is a grant program directly to those low-income Americans that need a chance to share in the same opportunity that we have, in our wisdom, provided through the tax system to upper-income and middle-income Americans.  Now, let me emphasize that SSIG is more important than ever as college costs continue to grow faster than income and grant aid, and as the grant-loan imbalance widens. In 1975, 80 percent of student aid came in the form of grants and 20 percent in the form of loans. Now, the opposite is true.  Let me also add that low-income students are finding it particularly hard to afford higher education. Less than 50 percent of high school graduates with family incomes under $22,000 go on to college, while more than 80 percent of their higher income counterparts go on to pursue education beyond high school. Frankly, if we do not reverse this trend, if we do not let every segment of our society go on to higher education, we will continue to develop a bifurcation of our society and our economy as young people with a chance to go on to college gain skills that make them employable and, indeed, enhances their incomes and ability to seize all the opportunity in our society, while others are left out. We cannot let that happen.  SSIG continues to make a difference for needy students in many States. However, I again remind my colleagues that nine States would likely end their grant programs without Federal encouragement and funding. Moreover, 43 States have said they would cut grants if SSIG were eliminated.  Mr. President, we should be helping all our citizens achieve the American dream by ensuring access to higher education, especially for hard-working families whose wages have not kept up with inflation.  Our amendment seeks to provide $35 million for SSIG. It is not a lot of money in a bill that contains more than $269 billion in funding, but it will make a huge difference to the students who rely upon it.  This amendment, I understand, is agreeable to the chairman and the ranking member and they have committed to work with Senator Collins and myself to fight for this funding in conference.  I have a letter from the American Council of Education in support of the amendment, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         American Council on Education, Office of the President,                                                  August 29, 1997.       Dear Senator: The associations listed below, representing      the nation's 3,700 colleges and universities, strongly urge      you to support the amendment that will be offered by Senators      Jack Reed (D-RI) and Susan M. Collins (R-ME) during floor      consideration of the Fiscal Year 1998 Labor, Health and Human      Services, and Education appropriations bill. This amendment      will restore funding for the State Student Incentive Grant      (SSIG) program, which serves as an effective inducement for      states to maintain need-based student financial assistance      programs.       In eliminating funding for the SSIG program, the Senate      Appropriations Committee expressed the view that the need      exists for an ongoing source of federal support that      encourages and leverages state contributions, along with its      hope that the imminent reauthorization will succeed in      modifying and strengthening SSIG. We believe this will be      accomplished, and we have submitted recommendations designed      to achieve this goal.       However, we believe that the current program is both      misunderstood and undervalued in terms of its unique role in      the array of existing student aid programs. Within the last      six years, for example, SSIG's maintenance of effort      requirement has prevented cuts or forced the restoration of      funding of state grants in Massachusetts, Arizona, Rhode      Island, Connecticut, and Oregon. Further, terminating the      program will have punitive consequences for the 680,000      students whose average award of over $1,200 offers them an      essential alternative to borrowing. SSIG cuts also will be      felt by graduate students, since SSIG is the only Title IV      grant program for which they are eligible.       Terminating SSIG also will further strain the already      frayed relationship that exists between the state and federal      governments, families, students, and institutions. While      students and their families have borrowed increasingly      greater amounts; while institutions have increased      institutional student aid from $1 billion in 1979 to more      than $10 billion in 1995; and while the federal government      has arrested and begun to reverse the decade-long decline in      the value of Pell Grants, states have cut spending on higher      education to pay for increased expenses in Medicaid and      corrections programs. Between 1985 and 1997, the share of      state budgets dedicated to higher education fell from 14      percent to 12 percent. Indeed, one analyst has now concluded      that if state support for higher education continues to      decline at the rate we have seen in the last two decades, it      could begin to hit zero in some states early in the next      century.       We believe that the SSIG program still plays an essential      role in leveraging a state/federal partnership in the      provision of need-based student aid. We oppose SSIG's      elimination, and we urge your support of the Reed/Collins      amendment to restore its funding.           Sincerely,                                             Stanley O. Ikenberry,                                                        President.       On behalf of the following associations: American      Association of Community Colleges, American Association of      State Colleges and Universities, American Council on      Education, Association of American Universities, National      Association of Independent Colleges and Universities,      National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant      Colleges.
