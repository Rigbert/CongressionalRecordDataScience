 DASCHLE. Yes.  Mr. McCONNELL. I want to give the leader an update. We have had very fruitful negotiations today on the technical corrections package. I see my friend from Wisconsin. We have been bouncing back and forth for a couple of days. We are very close to finishing that. I hope we will be able to enter into a unanimous consent agreement that would advance the cloture vote sooner and have a limited time agreement under which you can have a scheduled cloture vote; then, hopefully, some kind of agreement related to the technical package--a Senate resolution that both sides agree on, with a brief debate, giving the proponents and opponents of the bill enough time to describe their views, and then go to final passage, all of which I hope can be done in a few hours. I am optimistic that it won't take much of the Senate's time to complete this job.  I see my friend from Wisconsin on the floor. I hope he will see things the same way I do and we might be able to get this off of your plate sometime tomorrow.
