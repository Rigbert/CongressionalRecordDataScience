 President, I am pleased to hear the Senator from Nevada indicate that we might be able to confirm four district judges this afternoon. I can't speak for the minority leader, but I assume he would think that would be a wonderful idea and would be a step in the right direction.  I am in a curious position of being the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations supporting the underlying bill and thinking it is necessary that it be passed sometime soon. At the same time, as a member of the Judiciary Committee, I am terribly concerned about the slow pace of the confirmation of judges. This is a serious situation.  Just last week we lost another judge. Charles Wolle of the Southern District of Iowa announced he was taking a senior status.
