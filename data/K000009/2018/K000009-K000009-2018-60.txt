Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chairman, this amendment does not prevent any current regulations on current wetlands. Again, it goes after the aggressive rulemaking that EPA, with their cohorts in the Army Corps, have put upon landowners and farmers and ranchers in more recent years.  So, if we sit back and watch bureaucrats attempt to gain control over every ditch, puddle, and pond they canget their hands on, then we are in a bad way in agriculture and, as well, the sacred private property rights our country is founded on. It is a major threat to the livelihood of ag and rural America.  So, again, the intent here is not to roll back any current wetlands but simply to allow people, if they want to make crop changes, they want to make decisions on their land that they are paying the property tax on, they are paying the mortgage on, if they want to change their use of the land, they should have that right in the United States of America and not have to get permission for something that has been--the key words here--prior converted under the law.  Mr. Chairman, I ask for ``aye'' votes of this body, and I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).  The amendment was agreed to.                Amendment No. 10 Offered by Mr. Gohmert  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 printed in part B of House Report 115-712.
