What is the difference between President Obama and President Bush's nominees? If it made sense to be operating at full strength with a Republican President, shouldn't it be operating at full strength under a Democratic President?  The Senate should consider Judge Wilkins based on his qualifications, and not hide behind some pretextual argument that most Americans can see through. As today's Washington Post editorial states, ``It's transparently self-serving of GOP lawmakers to oppose D.C. Circuit nominees only when it's a Democrat's turn to pick them.'' I as unanimous consent to have this editorial printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 17, 2013]          Judicial Nominees Face Unfair Hurdles in the Senate                        (By the Editorial Board)       Senate Republicans on Monday are likely to take a vote that      is unfair, unwise and bad for the functioning of the      government. Again.       For the third time in three weeks, the Senate will consider      a presidential nominee to the powerful U.S. Court of Appeals      for the District of Columbia Circuit. The first two nominees,      Patricia Millett and Cornelia Pillard, failed to attract the      60 votes necessary to clear GOP filibusters. There's little      reason to think that dynamic will change for the third, Judge      Robert Wilkins.       Senate Republicans are not assessing these nominees on      their merits, as each deserves. Rather, Republicans have made      them victims of a toxic and unresolvable ``debate'' about the      proper size of the D.C. Circuit. Republicans accuse President      Obama of attempting to tilt its ideological balance, which,      of course, he is. And they argue that the court isn't busy      enough to require its vacant seats to be filled. Democrats      insist the court still needs more active judges, and they      point out that Republicans attempted to fill the court during      the George W. Bush years, when the caseload wasn't much      different.       But the question of whether the D.C. Circuit needs all 11      of its judicial slots doesn't need to be resolved to offer      the president's legitimate nominees a fair up-or-down vote,      and Republicans are wrong to use that as a pretext to block      them. It's transparently self-serving of GOP lawmakers to      oppose D.C. Circuit nominees only when it's a Democrat's turn      to pick them. If Republicans truly are concerned that the      court is too large, they should offer a plan to reduce its      size--in future presidencies. That would separate raw      partisan motivation from authentic concern about the state of      the court system, and it's the only sensible way to make      changes to its size amid sharp partisan contention. In the      meantime, Republicans should give the president's legitimate,      well-qualified nominees a fair hearing, instead of degrading      further the already-broken process of staffing the government      and the courts.       If the ``debate'' about the D.C. Circuit's size should      doesn't end that way, Democrats might end it in another. Some      of them would like to unblock the road for the president's      nominees by forcing rules changes that would limit the      filibuster. Following the rejection of the two women and Mr.      Wilkins, who is African American, even some fairly even-     keeled senators might be inclined to agree. That's a perilous      path for the chamber that both sides probably would regret      taking.       Instead, adults in the GOP should finally get together with      Democrats and hammer out an understanding--the way previous      judicial nomination crises have been resolved.
