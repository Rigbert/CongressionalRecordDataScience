 President, I want to first associate myself entirely with the remarks of the Senator from Texas. He was speaking very articulately for himself. But he was also speaking for me and a lot of other people, I believe, here in the Senate when he was talking about the problems with H.R. 10. There are a lot of good things in H.R. 10. But one of the most reprehensible things, I believe, Mr. President, is the expansion of the Community Reinvestment Act. Senator Gramm has gone to great lengths to explain that tonight.  But before any of my colleagues would think about voting for the bill, if it comes up, H.R. 10, I think they ought to ask themselves and ask their local bankers, small bankers, the small directors and the officers if they in America support these measures that I think are reprehensible, such as increased administrative enforcement authority of the regulators to fine directors and officers of banks up to $1 million a day for CRA noncompliance. That is not the law today.  Two, that would make activities like insurance sales, or mutual fund sales, subject to CRA compliance on all depository institution affiliates on an ongoing basis. That is not the law today; and regulatory authority to shut down any affiliate within the holding company if just one subsidiary depository institution falls out of CRA compliance.  Just think about this. These are sweeping, sweeping changes in the law as we know it today.  Senator Gramm talked at length about passing this banking reform bill--and I think it has a lot of reform in it--and keeping CRA neutral; not bother or try to repeal the CRA law as it exists today, although I personally would like to; leave it alone for another day, but not to try to expand it, either.  Those are some of my concerns.  Senator Gramm and I have offered and we are hoping to negotiate with the proponents of this legislation for a resolution to the problems dealing with CRA issues. I will go over them one more time.  Mr. President, it would apply to the formation of financial services holding companies the same CRA structure that applies to the formation of bank holding companies today. I don't see anything wrong with that. It would be uniform, and it makes a lot of sense.  Second, Mr. President, any financial institution that has been found to be in compliance with CRA in its most recent exam shall be deemed to be in compliance with CRA for all purposes and for any action until its next regularly scheduled CRA exam.  And, thirdly--I think this is very important--to put forth some language in there dealing with antifraud, antibribery provisions, and to say basically that it shall be illegal for any financial institution in connection with the CRA review evaluation or consideration to give anyone not employed by the bank any grant or subsidy in cash, or in kind, or to establish any quota, or set aside for employment, management, sales, purchases, or other business activities other than activities voluntarily undertaken by the financial institution to meet the credit needs of the local communities in which the financial institution is chartered.  This makes a lot of sense to me. I think it makes sense that people would focus in on this as we debate this bill.  But I just want to again say that we should go ahead if we could knock out and make CRA neutral in this; go ahead and work on the merits of H.R. 10, which are many, and try to do something. If we can't, Senator Gramm--and there will be others--and I are going to do everything we can to protect our rights here in the Senate.                          ____________________
