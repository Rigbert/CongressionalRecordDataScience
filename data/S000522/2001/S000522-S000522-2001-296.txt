Reclaiming my time, I think that is excellent. The National Science Foundation is currently drafting a facilities management and oversight plan and is expected to present a final draft to the National Science Board at their August meeting. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Research, I will be holding a hearing early in September to review this policy and try to ensure that it will adequately address concerns with regard to accounting, appropriate management, and construction oversight of NSF projects.  Scientific experiments are, by their nature, high-risk ventures that challenge the state of the art, if you will, in a number of technologies. As a result, these projects require rigorous cost and schedule control systems so that management can identify problems early and minimize the impact on the total project cost and success. Just as importantly, these projects require a management team that is extremely knowledgeable about the underlying science and has extensive experience in the management of large-scale, complex scientific projects.  I hope that our two committees can continue to work together to ensure that NSF has the resources and personnel it needs to manage these large, taxpayer-supported projects.
