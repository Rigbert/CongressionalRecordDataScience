President, various Senators have been coming over and bringing up amendments and speaking to them. I encourage others, if they have them, to do that. I know that we are trying to accommodate the committees that are meeting, hearings that are going on, and so forth, and trying to stack votes when we can. But I know the chairman and I wish to finish the bill at a relatively expeditious time. I mention this for what it is worth. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
