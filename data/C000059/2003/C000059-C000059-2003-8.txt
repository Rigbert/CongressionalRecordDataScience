 Madam Speaker, once again I want to commend the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Linder) for his leadership on this bill. As the chairman of the Subcommittee on Water and Power, I have witnessed firsthand throughout this country water problems that tend to grow, not shrink, as our country faces the problem of less water and water quality issues throughout our country.  Vision is an important thing that we do around here that sometimes we forget. The gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Linder) certainly is showing vision to make sure that we have adequate water in the future.  The 21st Century Water Commission, I refer to it as the Linder Water Commission, will recommend a strategy that recognizes and respects the primary role of States and water rights laws while eliminating duplication and conflict among governmental agencies. This is an incredibly important strategy. We need dependable water supplies that are safe and secure for our future generations.  Again, I commend the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Linder) for his leadership.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
