Joseph, Michigan who passed away on January 7, 2008.  Kathleen was a loving, selfless woman who will be greatly missed in her community. Nothing made Kay happier than being with her large family who is spread out from coast to coast. Kay also had the enviable ability to make the life of anyone she encountered about town a little bit better that day.  Born March 12, 1926, in Kalamazoo, Kathleen completed grade and high school at Western Michigan (then) College. Recognized in grade school for her athleticism, her interest in high school focused on music, culminating as drum majorette and band master. She completed her education at Kalamazoo Business College, and then went on to a career at Kalamazoo Vegetable Parchment (KVP) Corp. In 1970 she was married to a childhood friend, and with her children they came to Stevensville, to be near the lake she had loved as a child. In 1983, Kay and her husband moved to Baroda where they created Senior Life Manor, a foster care home. Retiring 10 years later, they returned to Stevensville, and later to their present home in St. Joseph Township. Kay is survived by her husband of 37 years, Dell; five children. Susan (Robert) Vandervliet of Mineral, Virginia, Thomas (Rhonda) Rabbers of St. Joseph, James (Mary) Rabbers of Stevensville, Jodi Rabberts of Arlington, Texas, and Daniel (Diana) Rabbers of Peoria, Arizona; a step-son, Dale (Jackie) Gaut of Hudsonville, MI; 12 grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. Kay's mother and father, Harold and Doris Hudson, preceded her in death.  Therefore Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the life of Kathleen Gaut. May she rest in peace in heaven.                          ____________________
