President, I am pleased to introduce legislation to honor one of the great contributors to our national postal system, Horatio King, by naming after him the Paris Hill Post Office in Paris, ME, the town of his birth. My colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, joins me in this effort.  Horatio King had a long career serving the public as a newspaper publisher and postal employee, eventually working his way through the ranks to become Postmaster General under President Buchanan. All told, he served under three Presidents.  His career with the Postal Service began in 1839, when he was appointed by then Postmaster General Kendall to a postal position that required him to leave Maine and reside in Washington, DC. In 1850, he became affiliated with the foreign mail service and was instrumental in developing this aspect of our postal system. His efforts were recognized in 1854 when he was appointed first assistant Postmaster General, a post he would hold until becoming Postmaster General in 1861, shortly before the outbreak of the Civil War.  Horatio King did not end his service, however, after reaching this pinnacle. In 1863, President Lincoln recognized his steadfast devotion to the Union and, although King was of the opposite political party, named him to a commission charged with carrying out the Emancipation Proclamation in the District of Columbia.  King was also a man of letters, and was well known for his literary evenings which did much to elevate the culture in Washington at a time when it was a much smaller and less diverse town than the one of today. He would frequently publish newspaper and magazine articles and lectures, and even published a book of travel sketches upon returning from a tour of Europe.  Today, the birthplace of Horatio King remains well preserved and cared for by my constituents, Janice and Glenn Davis, as the lovely King's Hill Inn.  Horatio King served Maine well by serving America well. It is appropriate that Congress recognize his contributions by naming the Post Office in the town of his birth for him and, along with Senator Snowe, I am delighted to have the opportunity to introduce legislation to accomplish this.                                 ______                                       By
