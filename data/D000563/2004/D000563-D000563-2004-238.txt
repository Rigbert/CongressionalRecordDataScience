 Madam President, I thank the chairman of the committee, Senator Warner of Virginia, and my close friend and colleague on the Democratic side, Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, for their support of this amendment.  I think this amendment comes at the right moment in history. All across the world, many who are our friends and those who are not question whether the United States is abandoning its time-honored commitment to oppose torture, cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment of detainees and prisoners.
