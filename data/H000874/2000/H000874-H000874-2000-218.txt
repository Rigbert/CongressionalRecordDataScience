They did not cancel one Head Start program under their administration, I told the chairman, and he said that, as well. It was Donna Shalala that came along and said if Head Start is not working, we are going to shut down programs.  Mr. Chairman, the chairman of our committee continually says, regrettably, we do not have the money. He does not say we ought not to do it. He says, regrettably, we do not have the money. That is a self-imposed tax-cutting limitation. That is why we do not have the money, because they have determined that the wealthiest in America needed more than the children in America.  The President does have a program, as the chairman knows. For the jurisdictions that have the money to sell bonds he allows a tax credit, which makes them a little cheaper and therefore easier to sell, and therefore easier to proceed to provide the classroom space that our children so desperately need and that teachers need to have safe schoolrooms in which to teach.  This program supplements it for the neediest children in America. Are we so parsimonious that we will not do that for the neediest children in America?  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Does the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Bonilla) claim the time of the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Porter)?
