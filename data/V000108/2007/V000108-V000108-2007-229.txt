Lisa's numerous contributions to her community are worthy of the highest admiration, especially her service as the director of the Challenger Center of Northwest Indiana in Hammond, Indiana. Lisa passed away on Friday, May 11, 2007, and following services at the Sheets Funeral Home in Lowell, she will be laid to rest on Tuesday, May 15, 2007, at Plum Grove Cemetery, also in Lowell.  Lisa was an integral part of the success of the Challenger Learning Center of Northwest Indiana. Housed on the Purdue University--Calumet campus in Hammond, Indiana, the Challenger Learning Center provides a worthwhile educational resource to area schools. Under Lisa's direction, this 8-year old program has opened the window to space exploration to students who might otherwise have no exposure to our final frontier.  Lisa's passion for the Challenger Learning Center of Northwest Indiana is entwined into the legacy of this program. Completely devoted to improving and modernizing educational, opportunities for children, Lisa created programs at the center that simulated space missions, integrating information provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, into real-life missions controlled and operated by students. These missions not only offered students the chance to experience life as astronauts, but also taught valuable life skills, such as teamwork and cooperation, that they are able to apply to other facets of their academic development.  Thanks to Lisa's selfless dedication to actively pursuing funding for the center, thousands of students throughout the First Congressional District have had the unique opportunity to participate in the programs at the center which instill and increase students' enthusiasm for science, math, and technology. Further, her innovative approach to education fomented a genuine excitement among the students' attitudes toward math and science. Lisa was truly the backbone of the Challenger Learning Center and will be sorely missed by all the individuals with whom she worked so diligently to provide this resource to the region.  Lisa is survived by her loving husband, Tom; two sons: Ethan and Ryan; one daughter, Cassie Karney; mother, Karen Stover of Elwood, IN; father, Max (Mary) Stover of Kokomo, IN; one brother, Mike (Billie) Stover of Elwood, IN; one sister, Jennifer (Shaun) Boetjjer of Galveston, IN; and several nieces and nephews. Lisa also leaves to cherish her memory many other family members and friends who will forever remember her devotion to, not only her community, but to her family as well.  Madam Speaker, I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring Mrs. Lisa Austgen for her outstanding devotion to Indiana's First Congressional District. Her unselfish and lifelong dedication to the young people of northwest Indiana is worthy of the highest commendation. Lisa's selflessness was an inspiration to us all, and I am proud to have represented her in Congress.                          ____________________
