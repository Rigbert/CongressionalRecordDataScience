President, I come to the floor today to honor a great educator in my home State. John Niebergall of Sherwood, OR, has been recognized as a White House ``Champion of Change.'' John's tremendous recognition and White House visit is well deserved. As an educator for more than 30 years, he has provided so many students at Sherwood High School with hands-on learning opportunities that prepare them for a 21st century career after graduation.  On May 4, I had the opportunity to visit Sherwood High School to witness firsthand the remarkable projects students were turning out in John's Mobile Makerspace. Students enrolled in his career and technical education programs--otherwise known as CTE courses--showed me their expertise handling a laser-cutter and a 3-D printer. John's students also have access to a welding shop and woodworking shop, where one student showed me a guitar he was building. It was clear to see that students participating in John's classes were excited about their work and motivated to be creative in the workspace.  Research has shown that students enrolled in CTE courses graduate from high school at a higher rate, and students enrolled in these courses are more likely to show up to class. After getting a tour of John's engineering classes and woodshop classes, it is no surprise to me that Sherwood High School is a high-performing school. The connection between good CTE programs and student success could not be clearer.  I am committed to supporting programs like the ones John teaches in Sherwood and will continue to do all that I can to provide Federal and State-funded career and technical education courses at more schools in my home State. His model can--and should--be replicated around the country. That is why I was thrilled to take a ride in his ``Fab-Lab'' mobile trailer that was full of computers and manufacturing equipment. He takes this mobile trailer on the road to connect with other CTE teachers in Oregon. When teachers like John collaborate with other educators, more students benefit.  As part of the ``Champions of Change'' program, the White House recognizes Americans who are making positive changes in their communities. There is no doubt John is doing just that. I commend John for teaching a diverse course load that exposes students to the many different types of CTE fields they could pursue after high school.  To finish, I want to send a big thank you to everyone at Sherwood High School for allowing me to visit. And I want to send a big congratulations to John for this tremendous recognition. I look forward to working with him to promote Career and Technical Education programs in Oregon and across the country.                          ____________________
