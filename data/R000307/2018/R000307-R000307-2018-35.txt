President, just a comment, and I state to the Presiding Officer that I thank the Senator from Texas for his general support for the farm bill.  The issues Senator Cornyn has mentioned are very important. In the nutrition title, we have addressed deficiencies that he has mentioned. We have 10 States now that have private projects for job training to figure out what really works best. The law currently allows States to have job training and a worker program. Kansas has that law. I am sure Texas probably has the law.  I think we have achieved about as much as we can to at least determine where we are going. The House bill, with all due respect, has $8 billion in cuts, and then there are questions as to how that is implemented and what agency does that. Agriculture, I don't think, is prepared to really launch into a full program of job training. The one issue the Senator from Texas specifically mentioned that caused me to come down here and interrupt his great speech is, we do have that private part to supplement the Federal situation in the Food Stamp Program. I don't know if we have hit all three areas of concern he has mentioned, but we are pretty darn close.  I appreciate the Senator's interest. We are just trying to get a program that has better integrity, that works better, and is more efficient.  By the way, we deal with that bonus program, where some States--actually, only eight States--were not guilty of this, but a lot of States gamed the system, and we have taken care of that. We have taken a hard look at the nutrition program, but we don't declare the farm program to be a welfare program or try to put it into that kind of a description.  So, basically, I am just saying with the three things the Senator just mentioned, we tried to address all three. Now, perhaps, not to the degree that the distinguished Senator would like, but that is still up for consideration, and I appreciate his comments.
