I previously spoke against her on the floor and talked about the reason I was opposed to her as well as David Ogden for his representation of the pornography industry. It is kind of hard for me to understand how someone who is the No. 2 position in the Justice Department has a history of representing the pornography industry. Then, of course, the nominations of Dawn Johnson and Thomas Perrelli I am opposed to because of their strong pro-abortion positions.  But as far as Elena Kagan, it is important for those who are going to vote in favor of her to know some of the things that have happened in her background. Because of its great importance, the office of Solicitor General is often referred to as the 10th Supreme Court Justice.  When serving as a dean of Harvard Law School, she demonstrated poor judgment on a very important issue to me. Ms. Kagan banned the U.S. military from recruiting on campus. She and other law school officials sued to overturn the Solomon amendment. The Solomon amendment originated in the House. Congressman Jerry Solomon had an amendment that said no university could preclude the military from trying to recruit on campus. This was a direct violation of the amendment. She actually was claiming that the Solomon amendment was immoral. She filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court opposing the amendment. The Court unanimously ruled against her position and affirmed that the Solomon amendment was constitutional.  The Department of Justice needs people who adhere to the law and not to their ideology. While certainly I oppose many of the positions taken by these nominees, I am even more concerned that their records of being ideologically driven will weaken the integrity and neutrality of the Department of Justice.  I oppose the nomination of Elena Kagan.
