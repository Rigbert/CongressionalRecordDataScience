I hope the gentleman's correct.  My concern, and the concern on this side, continues to be the position--as Mr. Shuster, who is the one of the ranking members and whose dad, of course, chaired the Transportation Committee at one point in time. There was a story that Shuster acknowledged that the House GOP's leadership's inability to pass its 5-year, $260 billion transportation bill ``weakens our hand in conference.'' And this is what concerned me, Mr. Leader.  But he added, ``It's not an option to give away the House position.''  Now, he was referring to, of course, a bill which has not passed this House, has not even been brought to the floor of this House. And that article went on to say, House Republicans say they are willing to walk away from the highway bill talks if they cannot get what they want.  Now, this was an interview--I see Mr. Shuster on the floor, and Mr. Shuster's a friend of mine. I'll be glad to hear what he has to say on that matter, and I'll yield to him.
