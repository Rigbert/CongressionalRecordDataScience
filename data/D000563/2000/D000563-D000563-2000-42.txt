President, the pace of U.S. deployments and the use of force overseas has been a hot issue in policy debates in Congress and on the campaign trail. Presidential candidate, Governor George W. Bush, says that he will put an end to the Clinton Administration's ``vague, aimless and endless deployments;'' that he would replace ``uncertain missions with well-defined objectives.''  So the question is: Has the President improperly committed our forces overseas in major missions and at an unprecedented rate compared to his predecessors? I don't think so. I want to take some time today to look at the deployments in question and at deployment statistics. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the lists of deployments, so Americans can judge for themselves if they think there were missions that the military should not have undertaken.
