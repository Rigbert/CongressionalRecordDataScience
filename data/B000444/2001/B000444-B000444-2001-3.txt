 President, I rise today to pay tribute to the long and distinguished career of one of our Nation's top police executives, Philadelphia Police Commissioner John F. Timoney.  Commissioner Timoney will leave the Philadelphia Police Department in early January, and I want to highlight some of his achievements. I believe John's record of achievement will benefit America's police officers for years to come.  John Timoney immigrated to the United States from Ireland at the age of 13. In 1969, after graduating from high school, he joined the ranks of the New York Police Department. He spent the first twelve years of his career as a patrol officer and later a narcotics investigator on the streets of Harlem and the South Bronx. As his reputation for integrity, innovation, and perseverance grew, he rose through the department's management structure, eventually assuming the position of Chief of Department, the highest ranking uniformed position in the department. It was during Mr. Timoney's tenure in the upper echelons of the NYPD that New York's crime rate began to drop precipitously, due in no small part to the new management structure he instituted, merging the Housing and Transit Police Department with the NYPD. In 1996, upon his departure from the NYPD, then-Chief Timoney had accrued over 65 Department Medals, including the prestigious Medal of Valor.  After retiring from the NYPD, John entered the world of private security consulting, and offered his expertise and advice to law enforcement authorities all across the country and around the world. He served as Vice Chairman of the Irish Commission on Domestic Violence, and he advised Britain's Patton Commission, which focused on policing Northern Ireland.  In March of 1998, Philadelphia Mayor Ed Rendell appointed John Commissioner of the Philadelphia Police Department. His tenure in that position was marked by the same commitment to excellence and improvement which characterized his career in New York. John brought the innovative Compstat system to Philadelphia, and helped to reinvigorate the department. Running a department of 7,000 officers and 900 civilian employees is no easy task, and Commissioner Timoney's efforts to modernize the department have been rewarded by a decline in Philadelphia's crime rate.  While I thank John profusely for what he has done to make the streets safer for millions of New Yorkers and Philadelphians, I rise today for another reason: to thank Commissioner Timoney for the lessons that his expertise and experience have taught the entirety of the law enforcement community. While his achievements as a cop on the beat deserve our thanks, I want to make special mention of the contribution he has made to our understanding of how police departments can better employ their resources to combat crime across the country.  Commissioner Timoney's career in the upper echelons of law enforcement have been marked by two major paradigm shifts. Without them, law enforcement would not be nearly as successful. And because Commissioner Timoney's work represents what I think is the best of law enforcement--because I believe that we at the Federal level ought to encourage and promote police departments around the nation to promote just this kind of progress--I want to draw special attention to it.  First, Commissioner Timoney was at the forefront of efforts to get both the New York and Philadelphia Police Departments to embrace Compstat, a high-tech system which allows police departments to monitor and analyze crime data better, empowering them to re-deploy resources as needed.Compstat was revolutionary policing in both New York and Philadelphia, contributing to dramatic crime reductions in both cities.  Second, Commissioner Timoney has been an outspoken proponent of community policing, which was an integral portion of 1994's crime bill. The Commissioner has set a high standard in the practice of policing multi-ethnic and multi-racial communities by empowering precinct captains and other officers in local areas to develop constructive relationships with members of the communities they police. I've always believed that the more integrated cops are with the communities they serve the better. Commissioner Timoney has lived that principle, and the great accomplishments of his career are due in no small part to his promotion of community policing.  I am grateful to be able to call John Timoney a friend. The people of Philadelphia will miss his law enforcement expertise, the police officers of his department will miss his extraordinary leadership, and the nation's law enforcement executives will lose one of their brightest lights. Good luck in your future endeavors John. A grateful and safer nation thanks you for your service.                          ____________________
