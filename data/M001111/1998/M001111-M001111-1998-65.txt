 President, let me simply say the chairman states correctly that the transportation bill did go through in a hurry right before a recess, and we are now looking at technical corrections to that bill. That bill is at the desk, and we should have an opportunity to take a look at it, offer amendments, and vote it up or down.  Being as it is included within the IRS conference report, we don't have the ability to do that. I think many Members would very much like the opportunity to speak out on this issue. As we went home for the Fourth of July recess, many people heard from veterans in their States who are outraged this was included in the transportation bill. They would like the opportunity to make their voices heard on that.  If we are able to override the ruling of the Chair, we will have the opportunity to do that. That is simply what we are asking for today. It will not hold up the IRS reform bill. We can simply move that next week. It will allow Members to make their statements known and their views known ona very critical issue to many veterans in our country.
