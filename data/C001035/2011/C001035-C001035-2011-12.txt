President, it is imperative that American citizens detained on U.S. soil be entitled to every protection guaranteed by the Constitution. I am concerned, therefore, that not all of the detainee provisions in the bill provide explicit exemptions for U.S. citizens who might be detained in the United States.  Had the amendment been more narrowly tailored to address that concern, I would support it. However, I unfortunately cannot support the amendment as a whole because it is too sweeping and would eliminate provisions that are important to preserve because they undoubtedly make our country safer. For instance, if this amendment were to pass, the Administration would be free to transfer detainees to countries where there are confirmed cases of detainees who have been released returning to fight against the United States. In addition, the amendment would eliminate a provision that would prevent foreign fighters captured overseas from taking advantage of the very constitutional rights I want to ensure for American citizens.
