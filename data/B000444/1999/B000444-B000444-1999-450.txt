 President, I am pleased to join today with Senator Grassley and Senator Torricelli, along with our colleague from the Judiciary Committee, Senator Sessions, to introduce legislation to reform our nation's bankruptcy laws.  In a time of rising incomes, historic levels of job creation, and strong economic growth, America has seen an unexpected rise in the number of personal bankruptcies. Last year, 1.4 million Americans filed for personal bankruptcy, and we expect that number to grow again this year, as it has for the last 4 years. This means more people are filing for bankruptcy now than during the worst years of job losses in the 1980's.  Bankruptcy laws give Americans a very special kind of protection from the worst form of financial distress. As a nation of immigrants, our country isthe very embodiment of the idea of a fresh start. Bankruptcy protection was considered so important that it was among the specific powers granted to Congress in our Constitution. That is why we provide in law that no one should have to shoulder an unsustainable burden of debt, a burden that can hurt us all by threatening the weakest links in our society.  But at the same time, Mr. President, our nation is founded on the idea of personal responsibility, the only foundation that can sustain and protect our freedom. Until recently, bankruptcy was considered a stain on one's personal reputation, an admission of failure, something to be avoided at all costs. While we may sympathize with the special circumstances that can throw an individual into unexpected hardship, Americans expect that those who have the resources must meet their financial obligations.  But the explosion in the number of personal bankruptcies, in a time of economic prosperity, raises serious questions. Mr. President, every time one of us fails to pay a legitimate debt, the rest of us pay a little more, because of the higher interest rates lenders must charge to cover their loses. When the circumstances are unavoidable, and when it is clear that a fresh start is deserved, bankruptcy must be there for those who need it. But when those who have the ability to pay use the bankruptcy system to walk away from their debts, something is wrong.  It is now clear to most of us that our bankruptcy system--and the laws that guide it--are in serious need of reform. Last year, in the Senate, we passed a bipartisan bill by the nearly unanimous vote of 97 to 1 to fix the problems in our bankruptcy laws. While that proposal did not become law, we reached agreement that bankruptcy reform--done the right way--is something we all can support.  Working closely with his new ranking member, Senator Torricelli, Senator Grassley has once again shown us the leadership on this issue that he provided last year. I believe that we have built a foundation in this bill for a reasonable approach, one that restores some of the balance that has been lost in recent years. To that end, this legislation assures that those who have the ability to pay will continue to meet their obligations, and that bankruptcy is not seen as a financial planning device, but the last resort for the most extraordinary circumstances.  At the same time, again with the help of Senator Torricelli we have gone a long way toward addressing the honest concerns that many of our colleagues have expressed about the needs of those, like single parents and those who receive child support, who deserve greater protection.  This is a tough balance to strike, and I will continue to work with Senator Grassley, Senator Torricellie, and Senator Sessions, and with our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, to listen to the concerns of other Senators, to achieve the kind of consensus that we found here in the Senate last year.                                 ______                                       Mr.
