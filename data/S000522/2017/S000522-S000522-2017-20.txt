This bill also authorizes and directs the secretary to fund entities, including faith-based ones, that are effectively providing assistance to meet those needs on the ground.  It addresses another urgent aspect of this crisis: evidence linking specific ISIS perpetrators to specific atrocity crimes that is being destroyed or lost. And we have seen this in the past in Rwanda, in Sierra Leone, and in the former Yugoslavia. You have got to collect the information that is actionable in order to prosecute these crimes against humanity. This legislation directs that, and that is why it has the support of all four former U.S. Ambassadors at Large for war crimes issues.  It also directs the Secretary of State to work with foreign governments to ensure that they are including identifying information about suspected perpetrators in their security databases and security screening and are prosecuting perpetrators of these horrific crimes.  President Trump and Vice President Pence have strongly, publicly, and repeatedly committed the administration to providing relief to Christians, Yazidis, and other genocide survivors. This legislation tangibly supports this commitment and is a blueprint for action.  I especially want to thank tonight the coauthor of this legislation, Anna Eshoo. Her tireless efforts on behalf of all Christians and other persecuted religious minorities has been really fantastic, and I want to thank her for that and for working so cooperatively together with me and my staff and the full committee staff.  I would also like to thank the great staff work of Nathaniel Hurd, Piero Tozzi in my office, Matt McMurray in Anna Eshoo's office, Doug Anderson and Joan Condon in the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Roger Mahan and Luke Murry in the majority leader's office. And, as always, I want to thank Kelly Dixon, who ultimately helped us bring this legislation to the floor.  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the statement of Mr. Carl A. Anderson before the Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations. Opening Statement of Mr. Carl A. Anderson, Supreme Knight, Knights of                                 Columbus       (Before the Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health Global      Human Rights and International Organizations of the Committee      on Foreign Affairs, U.S. House of Representatives, at a      hearing titled The ISIS Genocide Declaration: What Next?, May      26, 2019)       Thank you for the opportunity to appear before this      subcommittee and to discuss the next steps that need to be      taken needed to protect the survivors of ongoing genocide in      Iraq and Syria. Let me begin by saying that the House of      Representatives, the State Department and the United States      Commission on International Religious Freedom are all to be      commended for the important step of declaring the situation      confronting Christians and other religious minorities in the      Middle East genocide.       The world's greatest humanitarian crisis since World War II      is unfolding now in the Middle East. In addition to millions      of refugees, many of the region's indigenous communities now      face extinction. These communities may disappear in less than      a decade. But their fate is not inevitable. The United States      can avert this unfolding tragedy.                       A unique historical moment       Around the world, people of good will, Muslim and non-     Muslim alike, wish to differentiate themselves from the      horrific and violent theology espoused by ISIS.       It is certainly true that such extremists make up a small      percentage of Muslims overall. But among the world's billion      Muslims, the majority simply want to raise their families in      peace and are scandalized by what ISIS is doing in the name      of Islam.       Prominent Islamic leaders and scholars from around the      world have recently taken an important step in the Marrakesh      Declaration. Attempts such as this, which seek to align Islam      with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights should be      supported.       At the same time, it is clear that Christians, and other      indigenous minorities, are experiencing genocide, at the      hands of the Islamic State and related groups. Their plight      is now at the top of the world's agenda in a way that it      never has been before.       These factors together create an unparalleled opportunity      for the United States, and for all those opposed to ISIS'      radical vision--Muslims and non-Muslims alike--to advance an      agenda of equality, justice, peace, and accountability in the      region.             Six principles for sound policy in the region       The United States can avert the extinction of indigenous      religious and ethnic communities in Iraq and Syria with a      policy that contains the following six principles:       (1) Increase aid and ensure that it actually reaches those      most in need;       We are reliably informed that official government and U.N.      aid does not reach the Christian genocide survivors in Iraq      and Syria.       Repeatedly, we hear from Church leaders in the region that      Christians--and other genocide survivors--are last in line      for assistance from governments. Significantly, the      Archdiocese of Erbil, where most Iraqi Christians now live,      receives no money from any government whatsoever. If      assistance from outside Church affiliated agencies ends in      Erbil, Christians there will face a catastrophic humanitarian      tragedy within 30 days. The situation is similar in Syria,      according to Christian leaders there.       Those who face genocide are a tiny fraction of the      population. They often must avoid official refugee camps      because they are targeted for violence there by extremists.      As a result, these minorities often do not get ``official''      aid. This will continue to be the reality unless specific      action is taken to bring the aid to where these minorities      are forced to reside by continuing violence.       The Knights of Columbus and others private sources have      responded to this situation. Since 2014, we have raised more      than $10.5 million for relief, assisting Christians and other      internally displaced persons and refugees in Iraq, Syria,      Jordan, and Lebanon. We have partnered with dioceses and      religious agencies working in the region to provide general      relief, food, clothing, shelter, education, and medical care.      In doing so we assist both Christians and non-Christians. We      are also working with church entities to ensure that they are      making use of all government or U.N. resources available.       But non-governmental organizations can only do so much.      Government aid is essential to the long-term survival of      these indigenous religious and ethnic minorities. It is      urgent that Congress appropriate funding to save those who      have escaped genocide. I urge you to consider special      emergency appropriations, however modest, to improve the      humanitarian conditions on the ground in Iraq.       This funding, whatever the vehicle, should come with      mechanisms in place--reporting     requirements and oversight--to ensure that American aid does      not get diverted from its intended purpose.       (2) Support the long-term survival in the region of these      ancient indigenous religious and ethnic communities;       In Iraq, the Christians population has declined by more      than 80 percent, and in Syria by nearly 70 percent.       American policy should recognize the important differences      in the situations of those fleeing violence and those      targeted for genocide. And we should prioritize the latter.       Consider this analogy. After World War II, there were      approximately 50 million refugees, and only a small fraction      were Jews. Yet the world understood that Jews, who had      survived genocide, faced a qualitatively different situation,      and deserved heightened consideration.       The same is true today for the indigenous religious and      ethnic minorities of the region. They have an indisputable      right to live in their country--in whatever region of it they      wish. Depending on the circumstances, this may mean where      they are originally from, or where they find themselves now,      but as survivors of an ongoing genocide, they deserve to be      prioritized, not left behind by American policy decisions.       (3) Punish the perpetrators of genocide and crimes against      humanity;       The United States should support action by the U.N.      Security Council to refer key perpetrators of genocide for      prosecution. Equally important, we should support the Iraqi      Central Government and the Kurdish Regional Government's      adjudication of the cases of thousands of ISIS fighters      and supporters who currently remain in local detention      centers.       As the population of captured ISIS fighters increases,      local detention centers and jails risk becoming their own      humanitarian issue. The need to improve this situation cannot      be overstated.       Additionally, although substantial evidence of genocide      exists, the United States should cooperate in taking further      action to develop additional documentation and preservation      before physical evidence is lost. Appropriations intended to      assist in the adjudication of ISIS fighters will be critical      in the coming months.       (4) Assist victims of genocide in attaining refugee status.       A news report last week indicated that of the 499 Syrian      refugees admitted to the U.S. in May, not one was listed as      being Christian or as explicitly coming from any of the      groups targeted for genocides. How long will this situation      be allowed to continue?       The U.S. should appropriate funding and work with the U.N.      High Commissioner for Refugees to make provisions for      locating and providing status to individuals--such as Yezidis      and Christians--that have been targeted for genocide. Many of      these genocide survivors fear going into official U.N.      refugee camps, where they are targeted. Thus they are      overlooked, and find it nearly impossible to acquire official      refugee status or immigrate.       Congress should act now. Senator Tom Cotton has introduced      the Religious Persecution Relief Act, S. 2708, to provide for      overlooked minorities in the prioritization of refugees. We      support this bill and urge its passage.       (5) Prepare now for foreseeable human rights challenges as      ISIS-controlled territory is liberated by ensuring that      Christians and other minorities have equal rights to decide      their future;       We should prepare now for the consequences of the      liberation of ISIS controlled areas, including Mosul and the      Nineveh Region, as well as regions in Syria. We are likely to      see another humanitarian crisis as civilians flee the      fighting or return to their former communities when fighting      ceases.       There has been much debate concerning plans for victims of      genocide in Iraq. Some have argued for returning people      safely to the Nineveh Region, others that they should be      allowed to stay in Kurdistan, still others that they be      allowed to immigrate. But these are not necessarily mutually      exclusive, competing proposals. People should be allowed to      decide their own future. And when they do, we should work to      ensure they are treated with fairness, dignity and equality.      This also means that it will be increasingly important to      ensure that the property rights and claims of minority groups      are respected.       (6) Promote the establishment of internationally agreed      upon standards of human rights and religious freedom as      conditions for humanitarian and military assistance.       The United States should advocate for full and equal rights      for religious and ethnic minorities in the region in exchange      for our military and humanitarian aid. A necessary first step      to prevent genocide is to overcome the social and legal      inequality that is its breeding ground.       Religious hatred, discrimination and second-class      citizenship too often constitute a way of life in the      region--and it is a way of life that is an antecedent to      genocide. We cannot accept one standard for human rights in      the region and another standard for the rest of the world.       The guarantees in the Universal Declaration of Human      Rights--and the First and Fourteenth amendments to our own      constitution--regarding equality under the law and freedom of      speech and religion must become a reality for all citizens of      Iraq, Syria and elsewhere throughout the region.                               Conclusion       The rich tapestry of religious pluralism in the region must      be preserved now or it will be lost forever. With its loss      will come increased instability and threats to our own      security and that of the world.       We have a unique opportunity--and some would say, unique      responsibility--to protect the victims of genocide. The      United States can provide such protection with a policy that      includes the principles outlined above. Mr. Chairman, thank      you very much for your leadership and that of the members of      this subcommittee.
