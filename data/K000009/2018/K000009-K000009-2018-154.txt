Speaker, control of energy equals national security.  I rise to warn how Russia through hybrid warfare seeks to destabilize and divide our closest European Allies through control of their energy supply. As Americans well know, whoever controls the energy spigot, controls the function of a nation. Russia uses its growing dominance of energy in Europe as its primary pressure point to destabilize the West and our alliances.  That is why I was floored that President Trump inserted himself so haphazardly into Europe's energy debate. Nord Stream II poses new, troubling dependency threats by Russia on Europe's energy security.  It boosts undemocratic Russia's claw hold on the European continent.  Russia is weaponizing energy in countries across Europe, including Germany and Ukraine, creating a dangerous new dependency by recipient nations. The fight for Ukraine's liberty depends on its energy independence in the future. The free world must help Europe and Ukraine to reduce their economic reliance on Russian gas.  Risking alienation of nations that share freedom's values is counterproductive. It aids and abets our enemies.  I include in the Record President Trump's and Putin's comments.  Excerpt of President Trump's and President Putin's Press Conference              Following Their Summit in Helsinki, July 2018 Responses to a question about energy in Europe and the Nordstream II                             pipeline project       Trump: Well, actually I called him a competitor. And a good      competitor he is. And I think the word ``competitor'' is a      compliment. I think that we will be completing when you talk      about the pipeline. I'm not sure, necessarily, that it's in      the best interests of Germany or not, but that was a decision      that they made. We'll be competing--as you know, the United      States is now--or soon will be, but I think it actually is      right now the largest in the oil and gas world.       So we're going to be selling LNG, and we'll have to be      competing with the pipeline and I think we'll compete      successfully, although there is a little advantage      locationally.       So I just wish them luck. I mean, I did. I discussed with      Angela Merkel in pretty strong tones. But I also know where      they're all coming from and they have a very close source. So      we'll see how that all works out.       Putin: We are aware of the stance of President Trump, and I      think that we, as a major oil and gas power, and the United      States as a major oil and gas power as well, we could work      together on regulation of international markets, because      neither of us is actually interested in the plummeting of the      prices. And the consumers will suffer as well, and the      consumers in the United States will suffer as well. And the      shale gas production will suffer. Because beyond a sudden      price breakup (ph), it's no longer profitable to--to produce      gas.       But nor we are interested in driving prices up, because it      will drain just as--just as from all other sectors of the      economy, from (inaudible) building (ph), et cetera. So we do      have space for cooperation here.       That's the first thing.       Then about the Nord Stream 2, Mr. President voiced his      concerns about the possibility of disappearance of transit      through Ukraine. And I reassured Mr. President that Russia      stands ready to maintain this transit. Moreover, we stand      ready to extend this transit contract that's about to expire      next year in case--if the dispute between the economic      entitles--dispute will be settled in the Stockholm      arbitration court.                          ____________________
