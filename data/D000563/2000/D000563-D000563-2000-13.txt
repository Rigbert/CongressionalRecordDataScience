President, I take this opportunity to clarify some issues related to the Chimpanzee Health Improvement, Maintenance and Protection Act by entering into a colloquy with my colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Bob Smith. Senator Smith, as my fellow prime sponsor of the Senate version of this legislation, S. 2725, I would first like to address the House amendment to the bill, which would allow for the possibility of temporarily removing certain chimpanzees from a sanctuary for medical research? Is it your understanding that the purpose of the CHIMP Act is still to provide a permanent lifetime sanctuary for chimpanzees who have been designated as no longer useful or needed in scientific research?
