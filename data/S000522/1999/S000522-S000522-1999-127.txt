Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the chairman of our Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific of the Committee on International Relations for a very, very fine amendment. I would hope the Committee on the Budget would not object, but it looks like they may.  We need safe embassies now, Mr. Chairman, and our diplomatic personnel overseas need and deserve that security. Moreover, the image of the U.S. should not be one of easy vulnerability. Where our posts are not secure and cannot be made secure, we need to build safe posts as soon as we can.  The fastest way to build them is for the private sector to put up the money and build them. We then lease-purchase over the years. The current rule requires us to score the whole multi-year lease-purchase in the first year. This amendment, instead, allows us to score only the annual expenditure. This change will expedite the necessary and urgent construction of safe posts without increasing any costs.  The scoring of lease-purchase properties on an annual basis was already included in the Foreign Relations Act for fiscal years 1994 and 1995, yet the administration has opined otherwise.  So I support this amendment of my colleague from Nebraska. It is a good amendment, it is common sense, and we should support it.
