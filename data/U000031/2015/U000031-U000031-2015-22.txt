Chair, this amendment requires the Department of Energy to study the maximum level of volatility that is consistent with the safest practical shipment of crude oil by rail. Every one of us here wants the safe transportation of all of our natural resources. Rail transport is getting larger and larger. We need to make sure that it is safe.  I think it is a worthy amendment. I would urge all my colleagues to support the amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey).
