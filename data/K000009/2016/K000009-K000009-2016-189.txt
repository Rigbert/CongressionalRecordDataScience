Speaker, I rise today to remember the honorable life of one of Toledo's daughters, Bonnie J. Sloan, an intellectual and a valued member of our community.  Bonnie was born in Toledo, Ohio on January 15, 1932 to Florence and Donald MacVay. She was a graduate of Waite High School and received a master's and doctoral degree from the University of Toledo, where she went on to teach.  Mrs. Sloan lived her life for her community and was a dedicated public servant, serving as a teacher and administrator in the Toledo Public Schools. Mrs. Sloan taught for a decade at Raymer School before becoming an assistant principal of McKinley School and later a principal of Burroughs School and Edgewater School.  During her tenure in the Toledo Public Schools, Mrs. Sloan was an elementary and curriculum supervisor. Under her leadership the school system developed a program to bring students from Northern Ohio colleges and universities into Toledo schools for teaching experience. Mrs. Sloan's top concern was always for the children she served, and she often commented to friends that she would greatly prefer to be in the classroom than an administrative office.  Her passion for education and instilling a thirst for knowledge did not end after her retirement from the Toledo Public Schools. Mrs. Sloan went on to work in higher education as a faculty member at Defiance College. After another decade Mrs. Sloan retired from teaching, but continued her work with Defiance College on the board of trustees.  Mrs. Sloan was also a distinguished author of several children's books, which she penned throughout her career. As in her professional life, Mrs. Sloan's personal life was also spent in service. She was a former president of Zonta Club II and the Flower Hospital Auxiliary, both cherished organizations that strengthen our community.  Bonnie was married to Gordon Sloan, a respected pharmacist, on June 16, 1956. They celebrated fifty years together before his passing on December 21, 2006. The couple liked to joke about their relationship, Bonnie being a ``city girl,'' and Doc being a ``country boy.'' Their nieces and nephews were also benefiters of Bonnie's generosity and loving guidance.  Bonnie cherished time spent with her nieces and nephews, including the hours in which she enlisted them to help set up her classrooms. Later in life, she would take joy in time spent with her great-nieces and great-nephews.  Bonnie will be remembered lovingly by her brother, Harry MacVay, sister-in-law Connie, nieces and nephews, and her many friends. We offer them our prayers and hope that they find comfort in the wonderful memories of such an outstanding public servant, who will be remembered with affection and gratitude for her probing intellect, kind heart, and dedication to advancing Toledo as a community, its children and its future.                          ____________________
