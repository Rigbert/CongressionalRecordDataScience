 President, recently I spoke about the annual certification process on drug cooperation. I wanted to follow up on those remarks. As I noted then, I believe it is important to address some of the myths that have grown up around certification. I also believe that it is important to put on record why we need to keep this process.  One of the reasons often advanced for doing away with the certification process is that it just makes administrations lie.  Now, in the first place, I don't believe that this is true. But even if it were, I do not see changing a valid oversight requirement by Congress on the premise that compliance makes liars out of the administration. It seems to me that if there is a law and the administration isn't being honest, then you take steps to hold it responsible. You don't shrug your shoulders and throw away the law. Where would we be if we did that routinely? We might as well forget about oversight. We might as well legalize lying.  Like many of my colleagues, I have had problems with the executive branch. I am aware of misconduct, misfeasance, and downright lying by executive branch agencies and agents.  But I do not believe that simple differences of opinion or interpretation necessarily constitute lying. It is even possible to disagree over policy without calling someone a liar for disagreeing. Misguided perhaps.  It is possible, then, that the administration and Congress might disagree over a particular certification decision without jumping to conclusions about motive. It is also possible to have such differences without concluding that the only proper recourse is to scrap oversight efforts. Accountability is essential to our political process. This holds true even when there are serious disagreements about outcomes and procedures.  The recent certification decisions on Mexico and Colombia are cases in point. This last March 1, the President decided to again decertify Colombia. At the same time, he decided to fully certify Mexico. Both decisions caused concern in Congress. It is important to understand that there were lots of different concerns. Additionally, many of these concerns arose from contradictory opinions.  Some felt that if Colombia was decertified Mexico should have been. Others believed that if Mexico was certified then Colombia should have been. Still others believed that both should have gotten national interest waivers. Because none of these views were vindicated in the actual decision, many have drawn the conclusion that certification didn't work. Or they have concluded the administration lied. The answer in either case seems to be, ``dump certification.''  As I have already said, I don't think this is the right course. I believe the view is wrong on both substance and process.  In the first place, when we in Congress created the certification process, we did not create a pass/fail system. Nor did we create a system of shared outcomes. That is, we created a process that evaluated each country on its own merits in fighting drugs. Just like we don't give everyone in school the same grade if they performed differently, we don't base certification decisions on group behavior. We designed the process to permit nuanced decisions. We recognized the need to draw conclusions based not on single issues or purely momentary situations.  At the same time, we realized that without the push of law the administration, any administration, would likely not have made drugs a major foreign policy concern. In that sense, Congress had a healthy incredulity of administration motives. I remind my colleagues that it was a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-controlled Senate that first passed certification during the tenure of a Republican President. We had a bipartisan wariness of the executive branch. It is, after all, the business of Congress to give administrations heck from time to time.  Initially, the administration resisted certification. It chose not to apply the standards in the law with any vigor. Indeed, the first countries to get decertified were all soft targets. Countries like Burma, Iran, and Syria.  These were countries we already disliked and with whom we had only limited dealings. Initially, no serious countries got decertified. Because of this history, a certain cynicism grew up around certification. There is also today an evident impatience with what is and must be a complex decision-making process.  That process has been around for 10 years. As with other cases, the longer the requirement has been on the books and the more Congress has insisted it be taken seriously, the more used and useful it has become. The process has gathered momentum. Last year, in fact, I asked the Congressional Research Service to review the merits of the certification process. That review, which is still available, makes clear how the certification process has matured and proved effective.  In the past several years, in fact, the list of countries decertified or given a national interest waiver has grown to include some real countries. Such countries as Nigeria, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, and Pakistan. Countries with which we have a wide variety of interests apart from drugs. Just a few years ago, no one in Congress believed that any administration would ever decertify Colombia. Certainly there was a lot of sentiment in Congress that believed the evidence justified decertification. But the conviction was that it wouldn't happen. It did.  Not only has the standard been applied with more rigor, it has also encouraged greater cooperation from certified countries. All in all, more countries now take as a given that drug control must be an important element in their thinking.  That list includes the United States. To voluntarily choose to abandon such a tool out of a passing frustration is not very sound policy.  But, as the list of affected countries has grown to include more significant U.S. partners, the more controversial certification has become. This was to be expected. When Burma squawked, few in this country cared. Few people cared internationally. The military rulers of Burma had few friends. With Colombia affected and Mexico implicated, however, the noise level has gone up considerably. Both here and abroad.  To me, this indicates that certification is working. As I noted in an earlier statement, the fact that countries such as Colombia are complaining about our process is no sufficient reason to change it, much less throw it overboard.  Conversely, the fact that there was a difference of opinion on whether to certify Mexico or not, is also no sufficient reason to scuttle the boat.                          ____________________
