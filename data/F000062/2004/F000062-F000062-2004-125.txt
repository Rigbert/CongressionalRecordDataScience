  Mr. McCAIN. Forty minutes equally divided, followed by a recorded vote, which would then be followed by final passage. I ask unanimous consent that after disposal of the pending amendment, no more amendments be in order, that there be 40 minutes equally divided between myself and Senator Feinstein, a vote on the amendment, followed immediately by a final passage recorded vote.
