m. on Wednesday. By previous consent, the Senate will proceed to a vote on the amendment following the use or yielding back of all the time. A vote on the Moynihan amendment, No. 2663, has been ordered to occur immediately following the vote on the Wellstone amendment.  Therefore, Senators may expect two back-to-back votes at approximately 10:30 a.m. tomorrow. If my plans work out, I prefer to have a third vote immediately afterwards on an amendment on which we are working to try to get consent. Then, in addition, other votes may be anticipated during tomorrow's session in an effort to complete the first session of the 106th Congress.  Therefore, Senators should adjust their schedules for the possibility of votes throughout the day and also into the evening on Wednesday. The leader appreciates the patience and cooperation of all of our colleagues as we attempt to complete the appropriations process.
