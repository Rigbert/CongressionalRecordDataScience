 Will the Senator agree with me that if you want to know what a country values, you should take a look at what its Tax Code says--who it makes pay, and what its budget is. I respectfully suggest that everything the Senator is saying--and I hope he continues to speak--reflects a fundamental difference in values--not just priorities, a fundamental difference in values between those who support this bill--they are not bad votes. It is not good and evil; it is a different value judgment. This tax bill neither reflects my priorities nor my values.  The Senator has laid out a number of items. He is going to lay out more. How do we explain that everybody in the Tax Code who is in a certain income tax bracket gets relief except people in the 15-percent tax bracket? How do you do that? It is a value judgment.  I assume our friends think, if you give the wealthier people a cut, and not the middle-income people and the little guy, that somehow that is going to trickle down. That is a value judgment, a fundamental value judgment.  How do we stand around and say, somebody who receives $100 million in inheritance should get a tax break when, at the same time, it is going to be paid for out of Social Security and Medicare surpluses? This is about values.  So I guess it is less a question than a statement. I hope the Senator lays out every one of these things because I think it is important the public understand so they can make clear choices. What do they value the most? This is a value judgment.  My friends on the other side always talk about values. Well, let me tell you, this is where the rubber meets the road. This reflects our values. I am where the Senator from Connecticut is. I hope he continues to educate me and the public about it. Make no mistake about it. It is not just priorities; it is about our basic values, what we value most.
