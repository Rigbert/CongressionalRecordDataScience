I thank the gentleman for his leadership and the expertise of being an OB-GYN who has been there and knows better than almost all of us how sacred and fragile the life is of an unborn child, as well as his or her mother.  I would like to yield to Jim Lankford from Oklahoma and thank him for being here this evening.
