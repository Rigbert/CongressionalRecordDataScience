President, I am pleased today to introduce the Capital Construction Fund Qualified Withdrawal Act of 2003. My friends and colleagues, Senator Smith and Senator Murray, join me in introducing this important bill.  In January of 2000, a fishery disaster was declared by the Secretary of Commerce for the West Coast groundfish fishery. Due to major declines in fish population, the Pacific Fisheries Management Council decreased groundfish catch quotas by 90 percent. Today, the groundfish fishery in Oregon and adjoining States in the Pacific Northwest continues to face daunting challenges as a result of this disaster. Fishery income has dropped 55 percent and over a thousand fishers face bankruptcy. The Pacific Fishery Management Council has called for a 50 percent reduction in fishing capacity as part of their strategic plan for the recovery of the fishery. This legislation supports this effort by reforming the Capital Construction Fund in a way that will ease the groundfish fishers' transition away from fishing.  The Capital Construction Fund, CCF, Merchant Marine Act of 1936, amended 1969, 46 U.S.C. 1177, has been a way for fishers to accumulate funds, free from taxes, for the purpose of buying or refitting fishing vessels. It was conceived at a time when the federal government wanted to help capitalize and expand American fishing fleets. The program was a success: it led to a larger U.S. fishing fleet. However, fish populations declined and the U.S. commercial fishing fleet is now over-capitalized. The CCF's usefulness has not kept up with the times, and now it exacerbates problems facing U.S. fisheries, including the West Coast groundfish fishery.  Now is the time to help fishers, who wish to do so, to leave the fleet.  In Oregon, the amounts in CCF accounts range from $10,000 to over $200,000. This legislation changes current law to allow fishers to remove money from their CCF for purposes other than buying new vessels or upgrading current vessels, without losing up to 70 percent of their CCF funds in taxes and penalties. This legislation changes the CCF so fishers who want to opt out of fishing are not penalized for doing so.  This bill takes a significant step towards helping fishermen and making the West Coast groundfish fishery and the commercial fishing industry sustainable by amending the CCF to allow non-fishing uses of investments. This bill amends the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 and the Internal Revenue Code to allow funds currently in the CCF to be rolled over into an IRA or other types of retirement accounts, or to be used for the payment of an industry fee authorized by the fishery capacity reduction program, without adverse tax consequences to the account holders. This bill will also encourage innovation and conservation by allowing fishers to use funds deposited in a CCF to develop or purchase new gear that reduces bycatch.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this legislation.                                 ______                                       By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Grassley, Ms.         Cantwell, and Mr. Domenici):  S. 1194. A bill to foster local collaborations which will ensure that resources are effectively and efficiently used within the criminal and juvenile justice systems; to the Committee on the Judiciary.  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators Domenici, Leahy, Grassley, and Cantwell, to introduce the ``Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act of 2003.'' This bipartisan measure would, among other things, create a program of planning and implementation grants for communities so they may offer more treatment and other services to mentally ill offenders. Under this bill, programs receiving grant funds would be operated collaboratively by both a criminal justice agency and a mental health agency.  The mentally ill population poses a particularly difficult challenge for our criminal justice system. People afflicted with mental illness are incarcerated at significantly higher rates than the general population. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, while only about five percent of the American population has a mental illness, about 16 percent of the State prison population has such an illness. The Los Angeles County Jail, for example,typically has more mentally ill inmates than any hospital in the country.  Unfortunately, however, the reality of our criminal justice system is that jails and prisons do not provide a therapeutic environment for the mentally ill and are unlikely to do so any time soon. Indeed, the mentally ill inmate often is preyed upon by other inmates or becomes even sicker in jail. Once released from jail or prison, many mentally ill people end up on the streets. With limited personal resources and little or no ability to handle their illness alone, they often commit further offenses resulting in their re-arrest and re-incarceration. This ``revolving door'' is costly and disruptive for all involved.  Although these problems tend to manifest themselves primarily within the prison system, the root cause of our current situation is found in the mental health system and its failure to provide sufficient community-based treatment solutions. Accordingly, the solution will necessarily involve collaboration between the mental health system and criminal justice system. In fact, it also will require greater collaboration between the substance abuse treatment and mental health treatment communities, because many mentally ill offenders have a drug or alcohol problem in addition to their mental illness.  The purpose of the ``Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act'' is to foster exactly this type of collaboration at the Federal, State, and local levels. The bill provides incentives for the criminal justice, juvenile justice, mental health, and substance abuse treatment systems to work together at each level of government to establish a network of services for offenders with mental illness. The bill's approach is unique, in that it not only would promote public safety by helping curb the incidence of repeat offenders, but it also would promote public health, by ensuring that those with a serious mental illness are treated as soon as possible and as efficiently and effectively as possible.  Among its major provisions, this legislation calls for the establishment of a new competitive grant program, which would be housed at the U.S. Department of Justice, but administered by the Attorney General with the active involvement of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. To ensure that collaboration occurs at the local level, the bill would require that two entities jointly submit a single grant application on behalf of a community.  Applications demonstrating the greatest commitment to collaboration would receive priority for grant funds. If applicants can show that grant funds would be used to promote public health, as well as public safety, and if the program they propose would have the active participation of each joint applicant, and if their grant application has the support of both the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, then it would receive priority for funding.  Additionally, the bill would permit grant funds to be used for a variety of purposes, each of which embodies the goal of collaboration. First, grant funds may be used to provide courts with more options, such as specialized dockets, for dealing with the non-violent offender who has a serious mental illness or a co-occurring mental illness and drug or alcohol problem. Second, grant funds could be used to enhance training of mental health and criminal justice system personnel, who must know how to deal appropriately with the mentally ill offender. Third, grant funds could be devoted to programs that divert the criminal justice system into treatment those non-violent offenders with severe and persistent mental illness. Finally, correctional facilities may use grant funds to promote the treatment of inmates and ease their transition back into the community upon release from jail or prison.  In specifically authorizing grant funds to be used to promote more options for courts to deal with mentally ill offenders, this bill builds on legislation that I introduced two years ago with my colleague from Ohio, Congressman Ted Strickland. That measure, which became law, authorized $10 million per year for the establishment of more mental health courts. I have long supported mental health courts, which enable the criminal justice system to provide an individualized treatment solution for a mentally ill offender, while also requiring accountability of the offender. The legislation we are introducing today would make possible the creation or expansion of more mental health courts, and it also would promote the funding of treatment services that support such courts.  In addition to making planning and implementation grants available to communities, the ``Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act'' also calls for an Interagency Task Force to be established at the federal level. This Task Force would include the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, as well as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Education, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the Commissioner of Social Security. The Task Force would be charged with identifying new ways that federal departments can work together to reduce recidivism among mentally ill adults and juveniles.  Finally, the bill would direct the Attorney General and Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop a list of ``best practices'' for criminal justice personnel to use when diverting mentally ill offenders from the criminal justice system.  Ultimately, this is a good bill and one that is long overdue. I encourage my colleagues to support this important legislative measure.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1194       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Mentally Ill Offender      Treatment and Crime Reduction Act of 2003''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, over 16      percent of adults incarcerated in United States jails and      prisons have a mental illness.       (2) According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and      Delinquency Prevention, approximately 20 percent of youth in      the juvenile justice system have serious mental health      problems, and a significant number have co-occurring mental      health and substance abuse disorders.       (3) According to the National Alliance for the Mentally      Ill, up to 40 percent of adults who suffer from a serious      mental illness will come into contact with the American      criminal justice system at some point in their lives.       (4) According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and      Delinquency Prevention, over 150,000 juveniles who come into      contact with the juvenile justice system each year meet the      diagnostic criteria for at least 1 mental or emotional      disorder.       (5) A significant proportion of adults with a serious      mental illness who are involved with the criminal justice      system are homeless or at imminent risk of homelessness; and      many of these individuals are arrested and jailed for minor,      nonviolent offenses.       (6) The majority of individuals with a mental illness or      emotional disorder who are involved in the criminal or      juvenile justice systems are responsive to medical and      psychological interventions that integrate treatment,      rehabilitation, and support services.       (7) Collaborative programs between mental health, substance      abuse, and criminal or juvenile justice systems that ensure      the provision of services for those with mental illness or      co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse disorders can      reduce the number of such individuals in adult and juvenile      corrections facilities, while providing improved public      safety.     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.       The purpose of this Act is to increase public safety by      facilitating collaboration among the criminal justice,      juvenile justice, mental health treatment, and substance      abuse systems. Such collaboration is needed to--       (1) reduce rearrests among adult and juvenile offenders      with mental illness, or co-occurring mental illness and      substance abuse disorders;       (2) provide courts, including existing and new mental      health courts, with appropriate mental health and substance      abuse treatment options;       (3) maximize the use of alternatives to prosecution through      diversion in appropriate cases involving non-violent      offenders with mental illness;       (4) promote adequate training for criminal justice system      personnel about mental illness and substance abuse disorders      and the appropriate responses to people with such illnesses;       (5) promote adequate training for mental health treatment      personnel about criminal     offenders with mental illness and the appropriate response to      such offenders in the criminal justice system;       (6) promote communication between criminal justice or      juvenile justice personnel, mental health treatment      personnel, nonviolent offenders with mental illness, and      other support services such as housing, job placement,      community, and faith-based organizations; and       (7) promote communication, collaboration, and      intergovernmental partnerships among municipal, county, and      State elected officials with respect to mentally ill      offenders.
