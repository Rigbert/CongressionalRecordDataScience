I thank the gentleman for yielding.  The feedback I get from individual workers in my district, they believe that stronger laws are needed to protect the secret ballot election process in the workplace. H.R. 800 would strip away this right from workers, and this is simply unfair.  Removing secret ballot elections is unfair to individual workers because it opens them up to retaliation. By having to publicly express support for or against any measure, this legislation would leave workers vulnerable to coercion and intimidation, and I cannot in good conscience support it.  Secret ballots actually enhance collective bargaining. Because I believe a worker's right to a secret ballot should be protected, I am cosponsoring the Secret Ballot Protection Act. This legislation would guarantee individual workers the right to secret ballot elections and ensure them the right to freely choose whether or not to join a union.  I urge my colleagues to stand up for individual worker's rights, to protect the secret ballot, and to vote against H.R. 800.
