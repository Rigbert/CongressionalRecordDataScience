 President, today I wish to pay tribute to a great entrepreneur, Mr. Daryl E. Harms. Daryl, who passed away on July 9, 2005, led a life of great purpose, from his childhood days in Illinois to his time as a businessman in Birmingham, AL. As the son of a farmer, Daryl learned the values of hard work, dedication and commitment, and he utilized these qualities throughout his life to dream big, conquer challenging tasks, and carry out innovative ideas.  He began his distinguished career, along with his business partner Terry W. Johnson, as an industry pioneer in cable television, cellular communication and home security in the 1980s and 1990s. At the time of his death, he was the chief executive officer of Birmingham-based Masada Resource Group. This most recent business venture developed, patented and applied new technologies to convert solid wastes to renewable biofuels.  Daryl was featured as the Door-to-Door Billionaire in Fortune Small Business magazine for his keen business sense and ability to transform a risky venture into success. His fearlessness in business was recognized by all who knew him.  While Daryl was focused on his business ventures, he was deeply committed to his community as well. He served at various times on the boards of the Alabama Republican Party, the American Cancer Society, Magic Moments, and Prescott House. He had a generous spirit and was determined to help others not only in his community but throughout the State of Alabama.  I should also say that Daryl distinguished himself in yet another way. He was a devoted family man who cherished his wife and children. He is survived by his wife Clarissa Busby Harms of Birmingham; his daughters Hannah Katherine Harms and Emily Elizabeth Harms of Birmingham; his father Walter Edward Harms of Quincy, IL; and his brothers, Don Harms of Ursa, IL and Ken Harms of Sutter, IL. He was preceded in death by his mother Pauline Eshom Harms of Quincy, IL.  I ask my colleagues to join me in paying special tribute to Mr. Daryl E. Harms. Daryl's entrepreneurial spirit and innovative mind distinguishes him as one of American's great businessmen. He will be greatly missed by all who knew him.                          ____________________[Page S9155]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                 TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF MR.
