  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, 18 months ago, the Republican leadership during the debate on the first $15 billion bailout for the airline industry promised that soon, promptly, we would consider employee relief, including financial assistance, health insurance and training for new careers. It is 18 months later, and those 150,000 airline employees are still waiting, 18 months of waiting.  The airlines project they will lay off another 70,000 because of the war with Iraq. Boeing has cut 30,000 workers. They are all still waiting for that financial assistance and extended unemployment package.  Finally, today, here on the United States House of Representatives floor for the first time, 18 months too late, we are going to take a vote on that issue; and we will see where people really stand, whether they are with the workers or they just want to bail out the corporations.                          ____________________
