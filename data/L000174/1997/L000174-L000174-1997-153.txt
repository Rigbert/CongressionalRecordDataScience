President, I would like to take a moment to highlight aprogram in my State which I believe is a model the Small Business Administration [SBA] should consider investing in. Small businesses are the driving force of Vermont's economy. An important reason for their success in the State has been the development of a healthy export market for the goods they produce. Forty percent of Vermont companies, employing some 70,000 Vermonters, are engaged in some degree of export trade. In 1995, Vermont created and funded the Vermont World Trade Office [WTO] to provide technical assistance to Vermont businesses and information on foreign trade opportunities. The office has been overwhelmed by requests from companies interested in exploring trade opportunities. To meet that demand and make the office more convenient to Vermont businesses, the WTO hopes to open satellite offices in other parts of the State, expand services and offer additional seminars for interested businesses. Funding from the SBA would make this expansion possible. I believe that a modest investment by SBA would yield a valuable demonstration of the importance of export assistance in building and expanding markets for small businesses. Does the Senator from New Hampshire agree that this would be an appropriate use of SBA funding?
