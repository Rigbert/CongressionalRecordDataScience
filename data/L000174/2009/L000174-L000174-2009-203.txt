President, I am pleased to inform the Senate about a Vermonter whose work has been a unique and meaningful contribution to the Burlington International Waterfront Festival, a celebration of the 400th anniversary of French explorer Samuel de Champlain's arrival at Lake Champlain. Vermont poet David Lusk is using his craft to recreate experiences that are inspired by the surrounding Vermont communities, the lake's natural history, the more than 300 documented shipwrecks, and the rare prehistoric artifacts that lie on the lake's floor. Mr. Lusk's poems also draw from maritime literature and his visits to the shipwrecks that he has taken with guides from the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum. He intends to create a collection of poems called ``Lake Studies: Meditations on Lake Champlain.'' Mr. Lusk says the poems strive to ``reflect our mutual associations with these mysteries and to suggest something of our own psychological complexity in the process.''  Below is a poem that Mr. Lusk shared with those attending the opening ceremony at the Burlington Waterfront on July 2, 2009, for the celebration of the 400th anniversary of Samuel de Champlain's explorations. I ask that the text of his poem be printed in the Record.                         Sunset on Mallet's Bay                            (By David Lusk)     For just an instant     as the sun reclines     between wooly clouds     and profound, lavender     pillows of the mountains     a flock of sheep     will appear to cross     the glimmering road     of iridescent silver     creasing the broad back     of the lake.     See--here they come,     the little sheep,     huddled together, afraid.--for L.J. and Beth                          ____________________
