 For 200 years, Centre College has been a premier setting for liberal arts education in Kentucky, earning nationwide acclaim and respect. So today I would like to commemorate the bicentennial of one of the Commonwealth's most treasured institutions.  In 1819, the Kentucky Legislature formally established the school in Danville, giving it a name inspired by its central geographic location. Overseeing the school was a board of trustees filled with notable Kentuckians, including our first Governor, Isaac Shelby, as its chairman and Ephraim McDowell, the famed frontier surgeon who performed the first successful ovariotomy. Construction began shortly after on the school's first building, which was completed the next year and stands to this day with the name ``Old Centre.'' Classes began that fall with two professors and five pupils. With a commitment to classical liberal arts education, the curriculum focused on topics such as Latin, Greek, rhetoric, and logic.  Encountering financial difficulties in subsequent years, Kentucky ceded administration of Centre to a Presbyterian denomination but the legislature ensured that the school would remain accessible to students and faculty of all faiths. In 1830, a new president took the reins of the school. Twenty-seven-year-old John C. Young, a minister, teacher, and administrator, expanded the college and helped advance it toward distinction. At the end of his 27 years of leadership, the school boasted a 200-plus student body, secured an endowment of more than $100,000, and employed a renowned faculty.  Through the following decades, the school continued to grow in excellence and impact. Although the Civil War caused a temporary drop in the number of graduates--and the successive occupations of Old Centre by Confederate and Union forces--Centre's commitment to its liberal arts mission never wavered. The school had gained such great national distinction that the president of Princeton University, also the future President of the United States Woodrow Wilson, is said to have remarked in 1903 that, ``There is a little college down in Kentucky which, in her sixty years, has graduated more men who have acquired prominence and fame than has Princeton in her 150 years.''  Centre's reputation for excellence has reached beyond the classroom. In what the New York Times would later call ``Football's Upset of the Century,'' the Praying Colonels scored an unlikely victory over the top-ranked Harvard University football team in 1921. Not long after, Centre officially became coeducational in 1926. The following decades saw the integration of the school, the expansion of the campus to include new buildings, and the establishment of a chapter of the prestigious Phi Beta Kappa honor society.  One of the greatest measures of a college are the alumni it has produced. Centre graduates can be found in a wide range of distinguished fields, including the highest levels of the U.S. Government. Vice Presidents John C. Breckinridge and Adlai Stevenson both held diplomas from the school, as did Supreme Court Chief Justice Fred Vinson and Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan. More than a dozen U.S. Senators, scores of Congressmen, and 11 Governors have also graduated from the school, as have leaders in business, medicine, law, and journalism. Perhaps it was the school's history of producing Vice Presidents and other prominent figures that led to its hosting of not one, but two Vice Presidential debates, in 2000 and 2012.  For such an impressive milestone, Centre has planned a year of celebratory events to mark its history and to herald its potential for the future. With President John Roush, the faculty, staff, students, and one of the most engaged alumni bases in the country, I am proud to mark Centre College's bicentennial. They all deserve the Senate's congratulations and best wishes for the future of liberal arts education in Kentucky.                            ____________________
