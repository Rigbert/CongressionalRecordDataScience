Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, our next speaker is a member of the Committee on House Administration who has served with great distinction, a leader in one of the great cities of the world in which we articulated so compelling our belief that all men were created equal. We did not live up to the reality of that statement, as compelling and profound as it was, because I think we did not realize the full ramifications of what we said. It took Martin Luther King and thousands of other courageous African Americans to call our attention to the shortcomings between our actions and our words.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fattah), who has been a great leader and a great supporter on the Committee on House Administration.
