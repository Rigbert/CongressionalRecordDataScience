President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the nomination of Tom Ridge occur at 12:10 today, with all the other parameters for debate remaining. Further, I ask unanimous consent that immediately following the vote, the Senate then stand in recess until 2:15 today. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate reconvenes at 2:15 today, there be 5 minutes for debate equally divided between Senators Nickles and Reed or their designees prior to the scheduled vote.
