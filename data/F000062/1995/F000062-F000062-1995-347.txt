 80, Department of the Treasury. This is a listing of those explosive materials that we are dealing with precisely. So that will be in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          Commerce in Explosives; List of Explosive Materials       Pursuant to the provisions of Section 841(d) of Title 18,      United States Code, and 27 CFR 55.23, the Director, Bureau of      Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, must publish and revise at      least annually in the Federal Register a list of explosives      determined to be within the coverage of 18 U.S.C. Chapter 40,      Importation, Manufacture, Distribution and Storage of      Explosive Materials. This chapter covers not only explosives,      but also blasting agents and detonators, all of which are      defined as explosive materials in section 841(c) of Title 18,      United States Code. Accordingly, the following is the 1995      List of Explosive Materials subject to regulation under 18      U.S.C. Chapter 40, which includes both the list of explosives      (including detonators) required to be published in the      Federal Register and blasting agents. The list is intended to      also include any and all mixtures containing any of the      materials in the list. Materials constituting blasting agents      are marked by an asterisk. While the list is comprehensive,      it is not all inclusive. The fact that an explosive material      may not be on the list does not mean that it is not within      the coverage of the law if it otherwise meets the statutory      definitions in section 841 of Title 18, United States Code.      Explosive materials are listed alphabetically by their common      names followed by chemical names and synonyms in brackets.      This revised list supersedes the List of Explosive Materials      dated January 7, 1994, (59 FR 1056) and will be effective as      of the date of publication in the Federal Register.
