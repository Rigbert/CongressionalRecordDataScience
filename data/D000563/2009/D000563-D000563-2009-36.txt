President, we met before 7 a.m. on this Saturday morning, and I am reminded of the famous quote:       Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays      these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed      rounds.  A snowstorm has struck Washington, DC. Yet 100 Members of the Senate will be called on in less than half an hour to be on the floor of the Senate to vote at this early morning hour. And for any who are hale and hearty and up watching or following this debate, the obvious question is, why? Why is the Senate in? What is it doing?  Well, we are in because the Republican Senators are filibustering the Department of Defense appropriations bill. This is the money for our troops, for our military, for their families, for their health care, for their equipment, for their paychecks. It is a bill which usually passes with a few patriotic speeches and little controversy. Yet the Republicans have held us now. This is the third day on the floor because they are filibustering the Department of Defense appropriations bill.  You might ask yourself: What is happening? Has the Republican Party turned on America's military? I do not think so. I think, in fact, they support America's military. But they are willing to use them and use their spending bill as part of their parliamentary procedure.  We know what this is all about. It is about delaying the business of the Senate and not just health care.
