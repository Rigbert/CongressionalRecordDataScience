 President, today, I address once more the subject of violence against women. It is still a problem.  According Justice Department statistics, violence against women by intimate partners is actually down, falling 21 percent from 1993 to 1998. Luckily, we can thank the programs created by the Violence Against Women Act, which I introduced almost a decade ago, and the efforts of advocates all across this country, from Dover to Denver, in educating us to confront domestic violence head-on.  Yet, unfortunately, we are far from eradicating this crime. It is a crime which harms women, leaving them battered and blue, sending them to the hospital, and causing them to miss work. We have also a crime that affects their children--children who cower while watching their mother get battered, children who too often then act out their own aggression.  I would love to say that, in my lifetime, we will break this cycle of family violence. But, we are not there yet.  One way of working towards this goal, however, is to preserve the Violence Against Women Office at the Justice Department. Today I, along with Senators DeWine, Levin, Specter,Carnahan, Hutchison, Miller, Collins, and Carper, have introduced a bill making the Office permanent.  This office is vital because it has been instrumental in our efforts to help women harmed by domestic violence. Since its inception, the Violence Against Women Office has distributed over one billion dollars in its first five years to states, localities, tribal governments, and private organizations. These governments and groups, in turn, have used these precious funds to improve the investigation and prosecution of crimes of domestic violence, stalking, and sexual assault; to train prosecutors, police officers, and judges on the special aspects of cases involving violence against women; and to offer the needed services to victims and their families.  In particular, this funding includes the incredibly successful STOP grants--grants which fund the Services for the Training of Officers and Prosecutors. These STOP grants--the largest grant program created by the Violence Against Women Act, are especially effective because each grant must be used to upgrade three vital areas: prosecution, law enforcement, and victim services.  Likewise, the Violence Against Women Office has awarded grants to encourage arrest policies, which seek to educate our police officers that, when they answer a call for help by a woman being battered, they should not turn away. This battery is not a private matter, to be left behind closed doors--where a man as king of his castle can do as he pleases. No, not anymore. That woman's abuser is committing a crime and he is subject to arrest and prosecution.  The Office has also distributed monies to our rural areas as part of the program for Rural Domestic Violence and Child Abuse Enforcement. I am sorry to say but this problem is in every part of this nation, and the Violence Against Women Office has sent funds to every corner of America, all the way from Orem, UT to Waterbury, VT. Yet, despite its pervasiveness, domestic violence itself is under attack.  And the Violence Against Women Office is leading the fight. Given the success of the many programs of the Violence Against Women Act as administered by the Office, I believe that the time has come to make the Violence Against Women Office permanent by statute. This Office is long overdue a strong foundation.  Moreover, the Office is due the prestige it deserves. My bill realizes this aim in a couple of ways. First, my bill provides that the Office be separate from any division or component of the Justice Department. In this regard, with the Office's Director reporting directly to the Associate Attorney General, as my bill requires, the Office will be shielded from any attempts to undo the great work it has historically accomplished. Why mess with success?  Second, my bill provides that the Director of the Office shall now be nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. This, too, raises the prestige of the work that the Violence Against Women Office seeks to accomplish day-in and day-out. It also subjects the selection of the Director, who performs the essential job of implementing the Violence Against Women Act, to the democratic process--thereby insuring that we attract the best candidates.  Yes, indeed, we are far from solving the crime of domestic violence. But let us take a step in the right direction. Join me in making the Violence Against Women Office permanent. The safety of women and their families depends on it.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 570       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
