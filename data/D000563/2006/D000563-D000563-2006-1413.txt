Res. 403       Whereas the Surgeon General and the American Academy of      Pediatrics recommend that most babies be exclusively fed with      breast milk for the first 6 months of life, and continue on      with breast milk through the first year of life;       Whereas studies have shown that children who were breastfed      had a 20 percent lower risk of dying in the first year of      life than children who were not breastfed;       Whereas promoting breastfeeding can potentially prevent up      to 720 postneonatal deaths in the United States each year;       Whereas breast milk provides the right balance of nutrients      to help an infant grow into a strong and healthy toddler,      improves the chances of infant survival, and helps protect      against common childhood illnesses and infections;       Whereas research also suggests that breastfeeding may be      protective against chronic diseases such as type I and type      II diabetes, leukemia, and obesity;       Whereas breast milk contains important amino acids, only      found in natural breast milk, that help an infant's brain      develop;       Whereas maternal benefits to breastfeeding include      decreased postpartum bleeding, decreased risk of breast and      ovarian cancer, and decreased risk of postmenopausal      osteoporosis;       Whereas the health advantages for mothers and children of      breastfeeding translate into economic benefits for the      family, health care system, and workplace;       Whereas breastfeeding more children would reduce medical      care costs, decrease spending for public health programs such      as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,      Infants, and Children (WIC), and decrease parental      absenteeism;       Whereas breastfeeding more children would have an      environmental benefit by reducing trash and plastic waste      from formula cans and bottle supplies;       Whereas 1 of the objectives for improving health in Focus      Area 16, Maternal, Infant, and Child Health, from Healthy      People 2010, is to increase the percentage of mothers who      breastfeed to 75 percent in the postpartum period, 50 percent      6 months after birth, and 25 percent 1 year after birth; and       Whereas throughout the United States, mothers have      encountered legal and systematic challenges while trying to      breastfeed in public and upon returning to work when seeking      out adequate places to express milk in the workplace: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) recognizes the unique health, economic, and social      benefits breastfeeding affords to children, mothers, and the      community at large; and       (2) calls upon States to take steps to protect a mother's      right to breastfeed and remove the barriers faced by women      who breastfeed.
