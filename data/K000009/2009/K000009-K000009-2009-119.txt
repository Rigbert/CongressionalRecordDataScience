Mosiniak, the founder of Toledo Seagate Food Bank, which over the years has helped countless people in need. Alice was Toledo office director in the 1970s of the National Association for Human Development, which trained senior citizens who were jobless and often alone. ``I took it for granted that everyone ate,'' Mrs. Mosiniak, who lived in South Toledo, told the Toledo Blade in 1993. She asked 50 seniors to bring a lunch to a meeting. ``Only two brought a lunch and one of those was a mashed potato sandwich, and the other person brought a bean sandwich. And that's how I found out they were all hungry.'' She scrounged and bought food for them. ``Her heart was compassion and caring for others,'' said her daughter, Deborah Vas, food bank executive director since 1998. ``She just truly believed and taught us you need to care about your neighbors''  The Toledo Seagate Food Bank began in 1980 after Alice saw what seniors ate--or didn't eat. Migrant farm workers in Lucas County were among the first fed, said Virginia Ortega, a member of the Ohio advisory committee to the U.S. Civil Rights Commission. ``Her life enhanced the quality of life of many northwest Ohioans in ways many people I don't think even realize,'' she said.  Mrs. Mosiniak enlisted local officials and business leaders in the project. ``She'd tell them exactly what she needed and wanted and say, `Either you're going to help or you're not.' And who's not going to help a neighbor or friend?'' Ms. Debbie Vas said. Added Harvey Savage, Jr.: ``When she set her mind on getting something, she was able to get it. We have people who are chronically underemployed, who are always going to need help.'' Mr. Savage is board president of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Kitchen for the Poor, founded by his father, the Rev. Harvey Savage. ``She saw it at a time when we were trying to sweep that under the rug.''  When I first encountered Alice more than 25 years ago, she was passionately piecing together the elements of what would become the Toledo Seagate Food Bank. Her enthusiasm and deep commitment to those who had fallen on hard times was unforgettable, and infectious. She was indefatigable. Enlisting the most unlikely coalition of supporters--from pugnacious property owners to willing donors to amazed farmers to selfless volunteers and grassroots supporters, from all walks of life--she built a vanguard institution from scratch, one that had never existed before. Year by year, its reputation earned respect and admiration across our region, Ohio, and the nation. Millions of meals, and other household necessities, have been made possible for three decades precisely because this incredible, inspired woman reached beyond herself to help others, at no cost to them. She sought no recognition. So let America acclaim her now and express its gratitude and acclaim for her noble efforts, truly a citizen of extraordinary proportion.  She grew up at Detroit Avenue and Vance Street in Toledo. She attended Libbey High School, the former Harriet Whitney Vocational High School, and the former Mary Manse College. She and her husband, Alphonse ``Bill'' Mosiniak, formed a company that built houses in South Toledo and Perrysburg. They married May 25, 1945. He died July 8, 1966. Surviving are her daughters, Debbie Vas and Mindy Rapp; son, Douglas; brother, Richard Williams, and six grandchildren.  It is with the deepest admiration that I pay tribute to the exemplary life of this pioneering woman. She dedicated her life in service to her family, friends, and the poor and hungry of our region. May her family be comforted by the loving memories they hold and may Alice Mosiniak be blessed with a loving peace.                          ____________________
