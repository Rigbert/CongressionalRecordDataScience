Mr. Speaker, I read with disbelief an article in the Washington Post this morning. It reported that the Speaker of this House has made baseless, unsubstantiated allegations about our late Secretary of Commerce, Ron Brown.  Ron Brown died in service to his country just 2 short months ago when his plane crashed during a trade mission to Bosnia. The Brown family is still in mourning, but for the Speaker of the House the death of this great man is something to be exploited for political gain.  Mr. Speaker, how low will you go? Is there a shred of decency left in your body? Is there anything you would not say for partisan political gain. You bring disrespect to yourself and to this institution by making such outrageous and baseless charges.  You owe us all an apology. You owe the Brown family an apology. You owe this Congress an apology and you owe this Nation an apology.  Mr. Speaker, you might not be the most unpopular public figure in historyif you started showing a little common decency and respect.                          ____________________
