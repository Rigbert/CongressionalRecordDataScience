It is technical in nature. I know of no opposition.  It clarifies that header information that is technically false, but in such a minor way as to be nonmaterial, will not be actionable under the legislation.  It clarifies that spammers who knowingly route messages through what are called open relays in order to erase the message's originating information--which is a technique used by these big-time spammers--will be treated as having used false or misleading header information.  It permits the Federal Trade Commission to modify the bill's deadline for how quickly ``opt-out requests'' must be processed. Currently, the bill says that 10 business days after receiving a consumer's opt-out request, any further e-mails from the sender become punishable.  The amendment permits the Federal Trade Commission to modify that time period if it finds that a different period would be appropriate. It permits the Federal Trade Commission, if it identifies new and particularly nefarious techniques used by spammers, to add those techniques to the list of what are called aggravated violations so that spammers who use those techniques would be subject to higher penalties.  Finally, this amendment, which has the support of Chairman McCain and Senator Hollings, would clarify that any lawsuits for violations of Federal spam rules should be brought in Federal court. It is noncontroversial in nature. I urge its passage.
