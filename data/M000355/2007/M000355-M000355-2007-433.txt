 President, I appreciate the remarks of the majority leader. It reflects the conversation he and I had earlier this afternoon, where I indicated there was a strong feeling on this side of the aisle that this was a 2-week bill.  Last year when we took up this matter, there were 35 amendments voted on. Twenty-three amendments were voted on before cloture, 12 were voted on after cloture. Clearly, this is an extraordinarily complex and challenging piece of legislation.  So I wish to thank my friend, the majority leader, for realizing this is not going to go anywhere unless we have a full and thorough debate of at least 2 weeks.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
