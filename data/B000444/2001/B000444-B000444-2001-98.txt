 President, I am pleased today to be able to join with Senators Thurmond and Hatch in introducing the Fugitive Apprehension Act of 2001. This bill authorizes the Attorney General to issue administrative subpoenas in cases involving fugitives. Its passage will provide law enforcement with the tools it needs to more effectively track and apprehend fugitives from justice, and I look forward to its prompt consideration.  Crime across the country continues to trend downwards, though we have seen some mixed statistical signals of late. As chairman of the newly-created Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, I am extremely concerned by the Nation's fugitive problem. According to estimates from the Department of Justice, there are approximately 54,000 fugitives from justice in Federal cases. A total of 565,611 fugitives, including state and local felony cases, have been entered into the database of the National Crime Information Center, up from 340,000 10 years ago. But this figure only begins to measure the problem, as the National Crime Information Center receives just 20 percent of all outstanding State and local felony warrants.  These fugitives from justice are a very real and dangerous concern. For example, last December, there was a shooting in Wilmington, DE. The shooter was charged with attempted murder and weapons violations and was jailed in Chester, PA, on a separate, earlier shooting charge. He then posted $500 bail on those charges, and promptly fled the jurisdiction. Members of Delaware's Violent Fugitive Task Force soon determined this violent criminal was hiding out in West Los Angeles. They alerted local FBI agents, who soon located the fugitive in a car and tried to stop him. He led the agents on a two-mile, high-speed chase, crashed into a pole, then tried to escape on foot. He was eventually captured, arrested, and he was recently returned to Delaware to face charges. This fugitive is particularly dangerous: he has a long record of drug and other offenses, including 52 arrests in Delaware dating all the way back to when he was 13.  Unfortunately, this incident from my home State is not an isolated one, and we should not hamstring law enforcement when they try to catch these criminals. To better equip our Federal law enforcement agents with the resources they need to track and apprehend dangerous fugitives from justice, we need to make some changes to our criminal laws. The Fugitive Apprehension Act of 2001 gives the Attorney General, principally through the United States Marshals Service, authority to issue administrative subpoenas in cases involving fugitives. Last year, the Director of the Marshals Service testified as to the need for these subpoenas in fugitive cases; he noted that seldom is a grand jury available to issue a subpoena in these instances. In fugitive cases, time is often of the essence and successful investigations depend on real-time information, such as telephone subscriber and credit records. The time required to get a court order can make the difference between whether a fugitive is apprehended or remains at large.  Given the privacy concerns that rightfully arise whenever Fourth Amendment protections are impacted, I want to take a moment to describe some of the safeguards in the bill we introduce today. First, and importantly, the bill's provisions apply only to those fugitives charged with or convicted of violent felonies or trafficking in drugs.  Second, the bill in no way authorizes searches by law enforcement agencies; the subpoenas envisioned by the bill may be used only to obtain documents. Witness testimony and searches still must meet the Constitution's warrant requirement.  Third, each administrative subpoena issued must be approved by the local United States Attorney for the district in which the subpoena will be served. I realize the Marshals Service and other law enforcement groups would rather this safeguard not be in the bill, but I insisted upon its inclusion at this point so as to ensure this new investigative power is not abused. I look forward to continuing my discussions with the Marshals Service and others concerning the effect this safeguard could have on their fugitive apprehensions.  Fourth, the bill allows the person on whom an administrative subpoena is served to request to a court that it be overturned--judicial review is mandated each time an administrative subpoena is challenged.  I am mindful of the fact that Federal law enforcement already has administrative subpoena power in other types of cases, including drug enforcement, child abuse and child pornography investigations. The need for administrative subpoena authority should be more clear in fugitive cases; there, the criminal being pursued has already proven his danger to society by committing a very serious crime. The bill we are introducing today is quite limited in scope, and its built in safeguards coupled with the opportunity for judicial review I believe balance well the rights of individuals with the clear need to catch those violent criminals on the lam, criminals whose very presence on our streets threatens us all. I thank Senator Thurmond for his leadership in this area, and I look forward to working with him and Senator Hatch to see this bill signed into law.                                 ______                                       By
