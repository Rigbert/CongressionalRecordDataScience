President, this year marks the 90th anniversary of the Hollywood Theatre in Portland, OR. Now a nonprofit organization, the Hollywood Theatre is an important Oregon landmark with a rich cultural history. Today I want to honor the Hollywood Theatre's 90 years of educating, entertaining, and bringing the community together through film.  The Hollywood Theatre was built in 1926, at the very end of the silent movie era. It was designed in an opulent Spanish Colonial Revival style, featuring extravagant interiors and a recognizable terra cotta exterior. Ninety years ago, it opened its doors to thousands of Oregonians who flocked to the luxurious theater to see its first show, ``More Pay-Less Work,'' for a quarter. It thrived during cinema's transition to ``talkies,'' hosting not only films but also community events such as bond drives during WWII and annual Rose Festival ceremonies. It was such a popular destination that the Northeast Portland neighborhood surrounding it became known as the Hollywood District.  In the 1960s, the popularity of television caused the Hollywood Theatre to fall on hard times. Although it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, it slipped into a period of disrepair and nearly burned down. Fortunately, it was purchased by Film Action Oregon, a local nonprofit, in 1997. Its new management returned the theatre to its historic appearance and renewed its status as a Portland jewel and community hub. The Hollywood Theatre now plays independent films and hosts film festivals, comedy shows, lectures, and continues the tradition of hosting community events. It is recognized by the national film community for its exceptional selection of films and support for local filmmakers through funding and consultation. Later this summer, travelers will be able to witness the theatre's newest project, a small theatre in the PDX airport, which will showcase short films by local artists. What better way to wait for a flight than to grab a local microbrew and enjoy a local short film? No other airport in the Nation can boast such a treat.  The Hollywood Theatre is a testament to the Oregonian values: supporting small businesses, building and engaging local communities, making art accessible, and respecting and reviving historic landmarks. It exposes patrons to a wider variety of films than those offered by larger cinemas, often offering thought-provoking alternatives to blockbusters. In an age of multiplex theaters and in-home streaming services, it has taken a lot of passion for the Hollywood Theatre to pursue its mission and a lot of local support to keep it viable and flourishing. I would like to congratulate everyone who has been a part of its success. Hollywood Theatre. Thank you for inspiring countless people through film and community.                          ____________________
