 It may not be surprising that gasoline now in this country is well over $3 a gallon, and imported oil over $70 a barrel, two-thirds of what we consume in making that gasoline coming from the most undemocratic places in the world, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Venezuela, Colombia, Nigeria.  It is interesting, if you look at the President and the Vice President, the President spent his life in Midland, Texas, really drilling that community dry, and then he and his family founded the Zapata Oil Company and made relationships with oil companies in Mexico.  The President that we have now had investments in Bahrain prior to his becoming President of the United States. And the Vice President, of course, was the CEO of Halliburton, which got all of those noncompetitively bid contracts in Iraq.  We watched the former President Bush become a major partner in the Carlisle Group, getting big money from all the oil-producing countries in the Middle East and huge investments and speaking fees from these very same places. Is that merely coincidence?  Yesterday, at long last then we see President Bush make a cameo appearance before the Renewable Fuels Association, and he gave a speech that many people had been waiting years to hear. He said in the speech we needed an investigation of why prices are going up the way they have over the last year. I would like to respectfully suggest to the President we need more than an investigation. We need new energy, new energy leadership by the President and Vice President. We don't need any more studies, and we don't need any more investigations.  The President said that every car can run on 10 percent ethanol. Well, where is his action plan to do it? That is what many of us have been arguing, not just this year, not just last year, going back to the beginning of his administration when we pushed for a renewable energy title as part of the farm bill, and his administration has barely funded it, and they fought it every step of the way inside this Chamber.  Now, the President said that with small changes some cars can run on E-85, a blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline. Mr. President, there are more than 5 million cars, trucks, vans on the road that will run on 85 percent ethanol right now. Every major manufacturer has announced major efforts to produce more E-85 vehicles. DaimlerChrysler announced two more just this week. Guess what, Mr. President? The drivers can't get the fuel for the cars they have bought. What are you doing to help America develop the infrastructure for these new fuels?  The President talks about increased research for new forms of energy, but what are we doing with the research we already have? Where are the Federal standards requiring Federal buildings to use more solar energy? How about the White House itself? How many Federal facilities are putting wind generators on their own property to develop energy? How many of our military bases are converting to biodiesel and to ethanol? When will the Chevy Suburbans that escort the Presidential motorcades actually use E-85 as an example of what can be done? I encourage the President to put a gas pump right over there at the White House.  The President can talk about not buying oil to place in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help hold the price of gasoline down by a penny or two, but why is he letting America continue her addiction to imported oil? Wouldn't a good way to break with the past be to rename the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as the Strategic Fuels Reserve and start filling it with stocks of ethanol and biodiesel that can be rotated through the fuel supply system to help make these new fuels a bigger part of our energy mix? I introduced H.R. 3345 last year to do just that. I invite the President's endorsement of that effort.  We need real action for today and tomorrow, not more of these false promises. We really don't need to build any more oil refineries when we are trying to move to new sources of energy. That would be like building more horseshoe factories when the automotive age was dawning.  We need to mandate that oil companies use their exorbitant properties to put E-85 and biodiesel pumps in the ground right now across this country and to use some of their profits to do that.  We need to help our country, not just let these companies enrich themselves and their top executives more. Then the millions of vehicles that are already on the road could help lead America to a new energy future.  We need a President that gives us some action, not just talk.  We need legislation like the Biofuels Energy Independence Act, H.R. 388, my bill to provide additional financing for the marketing, production, and distribution of biofuels, as well as the establishment of a biofuels feed stock reserve held by our farmers.  We need legislation like H.R. 1398, my bill to require that by 2010 gasoline be blended with at least 10 percent ethanol, and that diesel be blended with at least 5 percent biodiesel. We need standards that give us quantifiable goals against which we can measure progress, and to which we can hold ourselves accountable.  In short, Mr. President, while we appreciate your kind words and good wishes, we are begging for your active support in the form of realistic budget requests, speedy implementation action by agencies, and a commitment to making a difference not 10 years from now when your administration has its place in history but in the remaining days that you have to make a difference that can be felt in everyAmerican home, every American business, and every American community.                          ____________________
