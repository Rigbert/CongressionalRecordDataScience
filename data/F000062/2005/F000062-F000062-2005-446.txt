 President, I rise today to acknowledge and commemorate April 24, 2005, the 90th anniversary of the beginning of the Armenian Genocide and to urge all Americans to join together to ensure that these crimes never happen again.  On April 24, 1915, the Ottoman Empire began arresting hundreds of Armenian intellectuals, most of whom were subsequently executed. What soon followed can only be described as a tragedy that shocked the human conscience: by some estimates, over a million Armenians were killed, and another 500,000 were driven from their homes. These events marked the 20th century's first experience with such atrocities, and, sadly, they would not be the last.  Maya Angelou, the famous poet and civil rights activist once said:       History, despite its wrenching pain, cannot be unlived, but      if faced with courage, need not be lived again.  Indeed it is our duty to remember this horrific tragedy, and face the crimes of humanity with unflinching determination, courage, and moral fortitude so that they never happen again.  As a country founded on the principles of justice, equality, and liberty, the United States must take a leadership role in preventing genocide.  I am proud that the Armenian American community in my home State of California--over 500,000 strong--has taken such a leadership role in ensuring that the U.S. lives up to its values by acknowledging the crimes of the past and taking action against the crimes of the present and future. Their determination and perseverance is a testament to the human spirit and the ability to overcome injustice and build a better tomorrow.  Today, we stand with the Armenian American community in commemorating the start of the Armenian Genocide, and together we stand with those around the world who face persecution and even death simply because of who they are. They must know they are not alone and those who commit these crimes must know we are watching.  We will never forget the Armenian Genocide as we look to the future with courage and determination.                          ____________________
