Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his information.  Before asking him questions about the schedule for the week to come, I want to commend the gentleman. We had a meeting just a few minutes ago in which almost all the Members of the House rose in a moment of silence, Mr. Speaker, to remember those not only who lost their lives on 9/11 13 years ago, but also those who acted so heroically to save lives.  We certainly remember those brave individuals that knew what was going on and took that plane down in Pennsylvania that we believe was undoubtedly directed towards the dome of the Capitol to decapitate the symbol of the world's greatest democracy.  I want to thank the majority leader for leading us in that time of silence to remember that horrific event and to say, as he said just a few moments ago, we are still threatened by those who would use terror and barbarism to attack their own people and others around the world.  So I thank the gentleman for his leadership on that issue, and I also thank him for his comments about the fact that we came together on 9/11 not as Democrats and Republicans, but as Americans. We now are at a similar time where there is a great threat posed to us and to others.  The gentleman's suggestion that we would meet that with the same kind of bipartisanship is welcomed on this side of the aisle as well, so I thank the gentleman for that.  Now, with respect to the schedule, Mr. Speaker, I am wondering whether or not--and it may not have been decided yet--whether or not the President's request to which the gentleman referred in his announcement and the CR would be considered together or separately?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  There has been no decisions yet. As you know, the President requested this week, that is why we postponed, and we are continuing to work through. I will notify the gentleman as early as we get a decision.                              {time}  1330
