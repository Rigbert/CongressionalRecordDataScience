Borski) for the enormous assistance he provided our community during the consideration of the water resources bill last week.  When we were on the floor, I did not have an opportunity to place it formally in the Record, but I would say that without his help, Northwestern Ohio would not have received the consideration that was placed in that bill, and I wish to acknowledge and deeply thank him for the help that he gave us. Without his assistance, our watersheds would have been given no attention, and I thank him very much.                          ____________________
