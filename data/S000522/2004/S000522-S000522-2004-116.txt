Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. We do not have any further requests for time.  I, too, want to thank the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Michaud) and again the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans) and the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Brown). This is again a good, bipartisan piece of legislation. It is very significant and will significantly help our veterans and especially those who are service-connected disabled.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of our time.
