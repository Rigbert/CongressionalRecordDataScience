Speaker, it is my great pleasure to congratulate St. Joseph the Worker Croatian Catholic Church in Gary, IN, as it celebrates its 85th anniversary as a parish this Sunday, September 28, 1997. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Father Benedict J. Benakovic, parish pastor, on this special occasion. The 85th anniversary festivities will begin with a Mass of Thanksgiving at 11 a.m. at the church, celebrated by the Most Reverend Dale J. Melczek, Bishop of Gary. After the service, a banquet will be held at the Croatian Center in Merrillville, IN.  I would also like to commend the members of the St. Joseph the Worker Parish Council for the work they have put forth in the planning of this momentous event. Members of the 1997 parish council include: Fred Benich, John Benich, Frank Bestich, Peter Bianco, Francis X. Coman, Mary Coman, Charles Doherty, Antoinette Dorochoff, George Flores, Irene Flores, Charlene Gyurko, Mary Horan, Patricia Howorth, Sophia Kruzic, Jasmine Kuyachich, Mary Mandly, Richard Mandly, Ann C. Marlow, Marta McCobb, Karl Metz, Marie Michalak, Marian Nicksich, Peter Podnar, Ann Wozniak, Charles Yelusich, and Paul Yurkas.  The founding of St. Joseph the Worker Croatian Catholic Church began in 1906 with the arrival of Croatian immigrants to the growing city of Gary, IN. A mixture of small business owners and steel workers, the immigrants immediately experienced prejudices and a language barrier. To foster a sense of belonging and community, they colonized and sought a parish of their own, where the church services would be spoken in their native language. With a large donation from the Gary Land Co., a Croatian Catholic church, called Holy Trinity, was built in 1913.  Holy Trinity Church, which would later be named St. Joseph the Worker, prospered over the years with the hard work of its clergy and parishioners. Shortly after the church's founding, Rev. Charles Jesih of Croatia began St. Joseph's expansion when he founded a parochial school for the education of the parish's youth. In 1919, a three-room school opened in the church hall, and, in 1921, a convent was completed to accommodate the nuns who taught at the school. With the onset of the Depression, the parish encountered problems of debt and the relocation of parishioners to the Glen Park area of Gary. By the 1940's, it had become apparent that the church would need to relocate, and in spite of the debt incurred during the Depression, construction of a new church, school, and convent was completed in 1945. As the parish continued to grow, it was determined in 1950 that an even larger church would be needed to accommodate new parishioners of different nationalities. Under the leadership of Father Venceslav Ardas, funds were secured from individual parishioners and church organizations for the construction of what would become a beautiful Romanesque style church. The church was completed in 1956, and consecrated St. Joseph the Worker in May of that year.  Since its founding, St. Joseph the Worker has continued to celebrate its Croatian heritage as an integral part of parish religious and social life. Over the years, ties to Croatia were maintained with the dedicated service of Croatian-born pastors, the preservation of masses in the Croatian language, and a concern for events transpiring in the homeland. With the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia, St. Joseph the Worker parishioners eagerly joined Croatians throughout the world in providing humanitarian aid to victims of the war-torn region. In the early 1990's, the parish celebrated both the recognition of Croatia as an independent nation and the visit of Cardinal Franjo Kuharic, Archbishop of Zagreb. The founding of such social organizations as the Croatian Catholic Union and the American Croatians United also contributed to the preservation of the Croatian heritage in the Gary community. Through the dedication of St. Joseph parishioners, these organizations sponsored numerous festivals and projects, which have served to introduce traditional Croatian food, music, and customs to future generations.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating the St. Joseph the Worker parish on the 85th anniversary of its founding. As someone of Croatian descent, I commend the leadership that past and present parishioners and clergy have displayed in preserving their ethnicity while faithfully fulfilling the ideals of their Catholic religion. I wish St. Joseph the Worker parish continued prosperity and many blessings for a bright future.                          ____________________
