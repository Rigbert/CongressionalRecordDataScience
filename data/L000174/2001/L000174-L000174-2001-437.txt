President, I am pleased to be an original co-sponsor of the Post Office Community Partnership Act. Too often the Postal Service's designs for new offices fail to conform with local land use laws and these new cookie-cutter structures are replacing what were once the heart and soul of our towns. This legislation will ensure that the Postal Service does a better job of listening to local communities, respecting zoning regulations, and preserving Vermont's distinctive character.  In Vermont and across the country, Post Offices are community linchpins, serving more than just generic mailing stations. It is the Post Office where people go to meet their neighbors and talk about the latest news. The Postmaster is sometimes the only national representative in a community, and they often provide advice and guidance about important issues. The Post Office is inextricably linked with daily life. Remove it, and the special character of the place is lost.  As the Post Office has experienced financial difficulties in recent years, the prospect of Post Office closures has loomed larger. Unfortunately, inadequate processes are in place to ensure that the U.S. Postal Service will consult with local communities in the event of a closure, relocation, or consolidation. This legislation will ensure that the service notifies communities far in advance of any action, and ensure that concerned citizens have a role in decisions.  With such provisions in place and other much-need reforms, the U.S. Postal Service will work through its difficulties. The service will continue to grow, expanding access and making much-needed modernizations to its older facilities.  Too often, though, new post offices look like they do not belong in the heart of a traditional town center. Local zoning ordinances are ignored, and the Post Office contributes to unsightly sprawl. While there are many success stories, there are few detailed guidelines to avoid repetitions of the failures. That is why this legislation also includes provisions to ensure the U.S. Postal Service will follow local land use laws.  Successful mail service is a subtle balance between efficiency and contributing to the community. I think this important legislation will help the U.S. Postal Service find that balance well into the future. I commend Senator Jeffords for introducing this legislation, and I urge its swift consideration and passage, as it will help preserve the important role of our Post Offices in our way of life.                                 ______                                       By
