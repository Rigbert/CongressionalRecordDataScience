President, I am announcing that I would object to any request for unanimous consent to proceed to consider the conference report on H.R. 1296.  I would object to any unanimous request to proceed with this conference report because it contains a provision to that would allow the Secretary of the Interior to sell corporate sponsorships to America's National Parks System.  This provision has the potential to completely change the character of ournational parks and fosters conflicts of interest between the Department of the Interior and potential sponsors. Importantly, it would fail to contribute significantly to critical funding needs of the National Parks System.  I will object to consideration of the conference report because I don't believe we should consider such a controversial provision under procedures that do not provide for the debate and amendment of such objectionable provisions.                          ____________________
