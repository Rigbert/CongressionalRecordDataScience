Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support for H.R. 1758.  The language before us is designed first and foremost to preserve the effectiveness and the flexibility of NATO as a defensive alliance. For nearly five decades the North Atlantic Alliance has served and advanced the interests of the United States in Europe by preserving peace, promoting economic prosperity, and advancing our shared principles of democracy, individual liberty, and the rule of law.  Mr. Speaker, I would point out that the underlying legislation provides important assistance to Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Romania as they pursue membership in the alliance irrespective of the outcome of the NATO summit meeting scheduled to take place in Madrid in early July.  Recently the ambassadors from each of these countries, as well as Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Bulgaria, and Slovakia, appeared before the Helsinki Commission, which I co-chair along with Senator D'Amato, and presented their government's case for NATO membership. I believe, especially after hearing from each of the ambassadors, that it would be an injustice of historic proportions if we did not take advantage of the unique opportunity that we have today to embrace these countries of the region that have demonstrably committed themselves to democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.  During President Constantinescu's short tenure, Romania has made very impressive progress, and I believe deserves every ounce of encouragement, support, and consideration in the lead-up to the July NATO summit. Mr. Speaker, as one of those who has closely followed developments in Romania since 1981, I would hope that Romania is included among those invited to accession negotiations on full NATO membership.  With respect to the Baltic States, I have seen no justification in delaying similar negotiations with Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. Despite decades of Soviet domination and brutal repression, the commitment of the Baltic peoples to freedom and democracy ultimately triumphed over totalitarianism. Having persevered for 50 years and overcome the odds by regaining their independence, the Baltic countries deserve to be fully integrated into the West, including NATO, without further delay.  Mr. Speaker, the important legislation before us is aimed at giving further impetus to the enlargement of NATO. It is of critical importance, in my view, that a genuine process be put into place to ensure that emerging democracies not invited in Madrid join NATO but that wish to join the alliance will be given every consideration, and that there be a transparent and a real process for doing so. Platitudes cannot substitute for process. The bill calls for the NATO leaders assembled in Madrid to agree to such a process.  Frankly, Mr. Speaker, I remain very concerned over the recently concluded negotiations undertaken by NATO Secretary General Solana that resulted in the so-called Founding Act between NATO and the Russian Federation. Part of my concern stems from the fact that the talks were conducted against the backdrop of an artificial deadline suggested by the Russians. It is of critical importance that the Founding Act in no way undermine the effectiveness of NATO or reduce new members of the alliance to second-class citizens.  I am particularly concerned about the seemingly one-sided nature of the recently concluded negotiations, focusing as they have on Moscow's security preoccupation, real or imagined. The pending legislation identifies three specific security concerns that I urge the Clinton administration to raise with the Russians until they have been resolved.  The first concern stems from the fact that Russia has not agreed to the international borders with several of her neighbors. Moscow has purposefully dragged its feet on this important issue with the aim of intimidating a number of the countries involved.  The second issue concerns the deployment of Russian forces on the territory of other states. Today there are thousands of Russian troops deployed in and around the Ukrainian port of Sevastopol. Russian troops are likewise stationed in Moldova. The pending amendment calls for a commitment from the Russian Federation to station its armed forces on the territory of other states only with consent of such states and in strict accordance with international law.  Finally, the bill calls for a commitment by the Russians to take steps to reduce nuclear and conventional forces in Kaliningrad, where Moscow has amassed a huge arsenal that poses a potential threat to the Baltic States and to Poland.                              {time}  1730  Mr. Speaker, the progress in resolving these outstanding issues would go a long way to advance peace and stability throughout Europe, a region of critical importance to our own security and to our own economic and political interests.  I urge adoption of H.R. 1758 in the interests of maintaining the effectiveness and the flexibility of NATO as a defensive alliance. I urge strong support for the bill.
