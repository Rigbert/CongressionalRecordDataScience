 Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher) hit it right on the head and, that is, at a time when millions of Americans cannot afford the outrageously high costs of prescription drugs, they need to know that when their tax dollars went to develop these drugs, that the United States Government is saying to the private drug company they cannot charge anything they want; that they are going to go through the NIH, going to negotiate with you for reasonable prices.  This is nothing more than asking for a fair return for the taxpayers of this country on their investment.
