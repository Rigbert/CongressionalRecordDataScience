President, I am delighted that the Senate confirmed Judge Martin J. Jenkins to be a U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of California.  The American Bar Association unanimously found Judge Jenkins to be well-qualified, its highest rating, for this appointment. He has extensive trial experience as a deputy district attorney for Alameda County, trial attorney with the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division, and civil litigator with Pacific Bell. He also has extensive judicial experience as a former municipal court judge and in his current position as Alameda County Superior Court judge. His nomination enjoys the strong support of Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer.  The Judiciary Committee unanimously reported his nomination to the Senate on November 6, 1997. With the confirmation of Charles Breyer, the Northern District of California now has 2 vacancies out of 14 judgeships and desperately needs Judge Jenkins to help manage its growing backlog of cases.  I am delighted for Judge Jenkins and his distinguished family that he was confirmed. He will make a fine judge.                          ____________________
