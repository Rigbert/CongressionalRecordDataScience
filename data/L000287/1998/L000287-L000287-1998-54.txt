Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio, my friend, for yielding me this time, and I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Kim) as well as the gentleman from Ohio for their work to help us honor Senator Sam Nunn, a fellow Georgian.  Mr. Speaker, I believe we all recognize the tremendous accomplishments of Sam Nunn and his service in the United States Senate. Sam Nunn was one of the true statesmen of that body and is a source of pride to all Georgia.  Since winning election to Congress in 1986, I have had many opportunities to work with Senator Sam Nunn on several issues, and often benefited from his experience, his counsel, and his support as we worked together.  Since his election to the Senate in 1972, Senator Nunn has served the State of Georgia with honor and distinction. Senator Nunn worked to become the Senate's foremost expert on national security and international affairs. Senator Nunn served 8 years as the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and retired as the ranking Democrat on both the Armed Services Committee and the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.  Mr. Speaker, the naming of this building located in the heart of downtown Atlanta will be a fitting tribute to a great American and to a citizen of the world, Senator Sam Nunn. For these reasons, I hope that the Federal Center will soon bear the name of our former Senator and colleague, Senator Sam Nunn.
