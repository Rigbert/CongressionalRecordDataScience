855. A bill to clarify the applicable standards of professional conduct for attorneys for the Government, and other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.      PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS FOR GOVERNMENT ATTORNEYS ACT OF 1999       Mr. Leahy. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce      legislation that would clarify the professional standards      that apply to federal prosecutors and identify who has the      authority to set those standards. These are two questions      that have cried out for answers for years, and created      enormous tension between the Justice Department and virtually      everyone else.       The Citizen's Protection Act, which is also known as the      ``McDade law,'' was passed last year to address these      important questions. This new law was intended to make clear      that a State -- not the Attorney General--has the authority      to make rules of conduct for attorneys practicing before      courts of that State. Rather than resolve the long-standing      tensions over this issue, the new law has only exacerbated      them. At a hearing before a Judiciary Subcommittee last      month, a number of law enforcement officials lined up to      criticize the new law.       The Justice Department aggressively but unsuccessfully      opposed passage of the McDade law last year in favor of      continued reliance on controversial Justice Department      regulations issued in 1994--regulations which allow contacts      with represented persons and parties in certain      circumstances, even if such contacts are at odds with state      or local ethics rules.       Independent Counsel. The debate over the professional      standards that apply to federal prosecutors comes at a time      of heightened public concern over the high-profile      investigations and prosecutions conducted by independent      counsels. Special prosecutors Kenneth Starr and Donald Smaltz      are the ``poster boys'' for unaccountable federal      prosecutors. They even have their own Web sites to promote      their work. By law, these special prosecutors are subject to      the ethical guidelines and policies of the Department of      Justice, and all of them claim to have conducted their      investigations and prosecutions in conformity with      Departmental policies. Yet, in practice, even the Department      has conceded in its March 1999 responses to my written      questions in connection with a July 1998 oversight hearing      that ``in general, the Department avoids commenting in any      way on how an independent counsel conducts his or her      investigation.''       I am not alone in my concerns about the tactics of these      special prosecutors and, specifically, requiring a mother to      testify about her daughter's intimate relationships,      requiring a bookstore to disclose all the books a person may      have purchased, and breaching the longstanding understanding      of the relationship of trust between the Secret Service and      those it protects. I was appalled to hear a federal      prosecutor excuse a flimsy prosecution by announcing after      the defendant's acquittal that just getting the indictment      was a great deterrent. Trophy watches and television talk      show puffery should not be the trappings of prosecutors.       One of the core complaints the Justice Department has      against the McDade law is that federal prosecutors would be      subject to restrictive State ethics rules regarding contacts      with represented persons. Yet a letter to The Washington Post      from the former Chairman of the ABA ethics committee pointed      out:       ``[Anti-contact rules are] designed to protect individuals      like Monica Lewinsky, who have hired counsel and are entitled      to have all contacts with law enforcement officials go      through their counsel. As Ms. Lewinsky learned, dealing      directly with law enforcement officials can be intimidating      and scary, despite the fact that those inquisitors later      claimed it was okay for her to leave at any time.''       The McDade Law. This is not to say that the McDade law is      the answer. This new law is not a model of clarity. It      subjects federal prosecutors to the ``State laws and rules''      governing attorneys where the prosecutor engages in his or      her duties. A broad reading of this provision would seem to      turn the Supremacy Clause on its head. Does the reference to      ``State laws'' mean that federal prosecutors must comply with      state laws requiring the consent of all parties before a      conversation is recorded, or state laws restricting the use      of wiretaps? Furthermore, by referencing only the rules of      the state in which the prosecutor is practicing, does the new      law remove the traditional authority of a licensing state to      discipline a prosecutor in favor of the state in which the      prosecutor is     practicing? The new law subjects federal prosecutors not only      to the laws and rules of the state in which the attorney is      practicing, but also to ``local Federal court rules.'' What      is a federal prosecutor supposed to do if the state rules and      local federal court rules conflict? Finally, the new law does      not address the possibility of a uniform federal rule or set      of rules governing attorney conduct in and before the federal      courts. Would this oversight inadvertently interfere with the      Supreme Court's existing authority to prescribe such rules      under the Rules Enabling Act?       These are all significant questions and the lack of clear      answers is a significant source of the concern expressed by      law enforcement over implementation of the McDade law.       S.250. At least one bill, the ``Federal Prosecutor Ethics      Act,'' S.250, has been introduced to repeal the McDade law.      This bill is a ``cure'' that could produce a whole new set of      problems.       First, this bill would grant the Attorney General broad      authority to issue regulations that would supersede any state      ethics rules to the extent ``that [it] is inconsistent with      Federal law or interferes with the effectuation of Federal      law or policy, including the investigation of violations of      federal law.'' I am skeptical about granting such broad      rulemaking authority to the Attorney General for carte      blanche self-regulation.       Moreover, any regulation the Attorney General may issue      would generate substantial litigation over whether it is      actually ``authorized''. For example, is a state rule      requiring prosecutors to disclose exculpatory information to      the grand jury ``inconsistent with'' federal law,      which permits but does not require prosecutors to make      such disclosures? More generally, must there be an actual      conflict between the state rule and federal law or policy?      Can the Attorney General create conflicts through      declarations and clarifications of ``Federal policy''?      Does a state rule ``interfere with'' the ``investigation      of violations of Federal law'' merely by restricting what      federal prosecutors may say or do, or is more required?       In addition to challenges concerning whether a Justice      Department regulation was actually authorized, violations of      the regulations would invite litigation over whether the      remedy is dismissal of the indictment, exclusion of evidence      or some other remedy.       Second, S.250 provides nine categories of ``prohibited      conduct'' by Justice Department employees, violations of      which may be punished by penalties established by the      Attorney General. These prohibitions were initially proposed      last year as a substitute for McDade's ten commandments,      which were extremely problematic and, in the end, not      enacted. With that fight already won, there is no useful      purpose to be served by singling out a handful of      ``prohibitions'' for special treatment, and it may create      confusion. For example, one of the commandments prohibits      Department of Justice employees from ``offer[ing] or      provid[ing] sexual activities to any government witness or      potential witness in exchange for or on account of his      testimony.'' Does this mean that it is okay for government      employees to provide sex for other reasons, say, in exchange      for assistance on an investigation? Of course not, but that      is the implication by including this unnecessary language.       Although the bill states that the nine ``commandments'' do      not establish any substantive rights for defendants and may      not be the basis for dismissing any charge or excluding      evidence, they would invite defense referrals to the      Department's Office of Professional Responsibility to punish      discovery or other violations, no matter how minimal. In      other words, these ``prohibitions'' and any regulations      issued thereunder could provide a forum other than the court      for a defendant to assert violations, particularly should      defense arguments fail in court. This could be vexatious and      harassing for federal prosecutors. The workload could also be      overwhelming for OPR, since these sorts of issues arise in      virtually every criminal case.       Two of the nine prohibitions are particularly problematic      because they undermine the Tenth Circuit's recent en banc      decision in United States v. Singleton that the federal      bribery statute, 18 U.S.C Sec.  201(c), does not apply to a      federal prosecutor functioning within the official scope of      his office. The court based its decision on the proposition      that the word ``whoever'' in Sec. 201(c)--``Whoever . . .      gives, offers, or promises anything of value to any person,      for or because of [his] testimony'' shall be guilty of a      crime--does not include the government. But the bill would      expressly prohibit Department employees from altering      evidence or attempting corruptly to influence a witness's      testimony ``in violation of [18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  1503 or      1512]''--the obstruction of justice and witness tampering      statutes. These statutes use the same ``Whoever . . .''      formulation as Sec. 201(c). By providing that government      attorneys are subject to Sec. Sec.  1503 and 1512, the bill      casts doubt on the Tenth Circuit's reasoning and may lead      other courts to conclude that Sec. 201(c) does, indeed, apply      to federal prosecutors, thereby reopening another can of      worms.       Third, S.250 establishes a Commission composed of seven      judges appointed by the Chief Justice to study whether there      are specific federal prosecutorial duties that are      ``incompatible'' with state ethics rules and to report back      in one year. The new Commission's report is not due until      nine months after the Attorney General is required to issue      regulations. Thus, to the extent that the Commission is      intended to legitimize the Attorney General's regulations      exempting federal prosecutors from certain state ethics rules      (by providing the record and basis for the exemption), its      purpose is defeated by the timing of its report. In addition,      the Commission's report must be submitted only to the      Attorney General, who is under no obligation to adopt or even      consider its recommendations in formulating her regulations.       For these reasons and others, S.250 is not the answer to      resolving the disputes over who sets the professional      standards for federal prosecutors and what those standards      should be.       Professional Standards for Government Attorneys Act of      1999. The question of what professional standards govern      federal prosecutors is only a small part of the broader      question of what professional standards govern federal      practitioners. The Justice Department has complained loudly      about the difficulty in multi-district investigations of      complying with the professional standards of more than one      state. Yet, private practitioners must do so all the time. No      area of local rulemaking has been more fragmented than the      overlapping state, federal, and local court rules governing      attorney conduct in federal courts.       The Judicial Conference of the United States has been      studying this problem for some time. I sent a letter last      month to the Chief Justice requesting information on when the      Judicial Conference was likely to forward its final      recommendations to Congress concerning rules governing      attorney conduct in federal court. The Chief Justice      responded:       The Judicial Conference Committee on Rules of Practice and      Procedure has appointed an ad hoc subcommittee composed of      two members each from the Advisory Committees on Appellate,      Bankruptcy, Civil, Criminal, and Evidence Rules to make      specific recommendations to their respective committees. The      subcommittee meets on May 4, 1999, and will meet again later      this summer in Washington, D.C. Consideration of any proposed      amendments would proceed in accordance with the Rules      Enabling Act rulemaking process. 28 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  2071-     77. Under that process the subcommittee's recommendations are      expected to be considered by the respective advisory rules      committees at their fall 1999 meetings. The advisory      committees' recommendations will in turn be acted on by the      Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure at its January      2000 meeting. If amendments to the Federal Rules of Practice      and Procedure are approved, they would likely be published      for public comment in August 2000.       Any ethics legislation dealing with the particular problem      of federal prosecutors should be sensitive to the broader      issues and not foreclose reasonable solutions to these issues      on recommendation of the Judicial Conference.       Furthermore, while I respect this Attorney General and the      government attorneys at the Department of Justice, I am not      alone in my unease at granting the Department authority to      regulate the conduct of federal prosecutors in any area the      Attorney General may choose or whenever prosecutors confront      federal court or State ethics rules with which they disagree.       Therefore, the bill I introduce today would make clear      that, with respect to conduct in connection with any matter      in or before a federal court or grand jury, attorneys      employed by the federal Government are subject to the      professional standards established by the rules and decisions      of the relevant federal court. For other conduct, government      attorneys are subject to the professional standards      established by the States in which they are licensed to      practice. Beyond this, and consistent with the Rules Enabling      Act, this legislation would ask the Supreme Court to      prescribe a uniform national rule for government attorneys      relating to contacts with represented persons, taking into      consideration the special needs and interests of the United      States in investigating and prosecuting violations of Federal      criminal and civil law.       How would this bill work in practice? It would, for the      most part, simply codify existing practices and common-sense      choice-of-law principles patterned on Rule 8.5(b) of the      American Bar Association's (ABA) Model Rules of Professional      Conduct. Consider as an example the three stages of a federal      criminal prosecution. Under this legislation, a federal      prosecutor who is handling an indicted case before a federal      district court would be subject to the standards of attorney      conduct established by the rules and decisions of that      district court. A prosecutor who is conducting or preparing a      federal grand jury presentation would be subject to the      standards of the district court under whose authority the      grand jury was impanelled. In other circumstances, where no      court has clear supervisory authority over particular      conduct, a prosecutor would be subject to the standards of      the licensing State in which he or she principally practices.       Of course, every one of the 94 federal districts has its      own local rules and its own body of judicial decisions      interpreting those rules. Some districts have adopted their      state's ethics standards; some have adopted     model standards developed by the ABA; some have taken other      approaches. As I mentioned, the Judicial Conference has been      studying this balkanization among federal court ethics      standards, and it may soon recommend changes. Nothing in this      bill would interfere with this process; rather, the bill      simply makes clear that, in most circumstances, government      attorneys are subject to local court rules and decisions,      whatever they may be.       Nor would anything in this bill disturb the traditional      authority of the state courts to discipline attorneys,      including government attorneys, who are licensed to practice      in their jurisdictions. The issue here is what standards      apply, not who gets to enforce them.       The bill also makes clear that the Department of Justice      does not have the authority it has long claimed to write its      own ethics rules. This authority properly belongs with the      federal courts, and that is where it would stay under this      legislation. With one exception, where there is a      demonstrated need for a uniform federal rule, the courts      would retain their current authority to prescribe rules of      professional conduct for the attorneys who practice before      them.       It has become clear, in recent years, that effective      federal law enforcement is impeded by the proliferation of      local rules, and the resulting uncertainty, in the area of      contacts with represented persons and parties. Rule 4.2 of      the ABA's Model Rules and analogous rules adopted by state      courts and bar associations place strict limits on when a      lawyer may communicate with a person he knows to be      represented by another lawyer. These ``no contact'' rules      preserve fairness in the adversarial system and the integrity      of the attorney-client relationship by protecting parties,      potential parties and witnesses from lawyers who would      exploit the disparity in legal skill between attorneys and      lay people and damage the position of the represented person.      Courts have given a wide variety of interpretations to these      rules, however, creating uncertainty and confusion as to how      they apply in criminal cases and to government attorneys. For      example, courts have disagreed about whether these rules      apply to federal prosecutor contacts with represented persons      in non-custodial pre-indictment situations, in custodial pre-     indictment situations, and in post-indictment situations      involving the same or different matters underlying the      charges.       We need to ensure that government attorneys can participate      in traditionally accepted investigative techniques without      undue fear of ethical sanctions arising from perceived      violations of the ``no contact'' rule. Absent clear statutory      authority to engage in communications with represented      persons--when necessary and under limited circumstances      carefully circumscribed by law--the government will be      significantly hampered in its ability to detect and prosecute      federal offenses.       The ``no contact'' rule has been a focus of controversy,      study and debate for many years. Given the advanced stage of      dialogue among the interested parties--the federal and state      courts, the ABA, the Department of Justice, and others--I am      confident that a satisfactory uniform federal rule governing      contacts with represented persons by government attorneys can      be developed, through the Rules Enabling Act, within the time      frame established by this bill. Until then, government      attorneys would be well advised to seek court approval before      engaging in contacts with represented persons, at least in      jurisdictions where the relevant standards are uncertain.       The problems posed to federal law enforcement      investigations and prosecutions by the McDade law may be      real, but resolving those problems in a constructive and fair      manner will require thoughtfulness on all sides.  I ask unanimous consent that my full statement, the bill, and the sectional summary of the bill be included in the Record.  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 855       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION. 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Professional Standards for      Government Attorneys Act of 1999''.     SEC. 2. PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS FOR ATTORNEYS FOR THE                    GOVERNMENT.       (a) In General.--Section 530B of title 28, United States      Code, is amended to read as follows:     ``Sec. 530B. Professional standards for attorneys for the        Government       ``(a) Definitions.--In this section--       ``(1) the term `attorney for the Government' means any      attorney described in section 77.2 of part 77 of title 28 of      the Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on the date of      enactment of the Professional Standards for Government      Attorneys Act of 1999) and includes any independent counsel,      or employee of such a counsel, appointed under chapter 40;       ``(2) the term `court' means any Federal, State, or local      court or other adjudicatory body, including an administrative      board or tribunal; and       ``(3) the term `State' means a State of the United States,      the District of Columbia, and any commonwealth, territory, or      possession of the United States.       ``(b) Choice of Law.--Subject to any uniform national rule      prescribed by the Supreme Court under chapter 131, the      standards of professional conduct governing an attorney for      the Government shall be--       ``(1) with respect to conduct in connection with a      proceeding in or before a court, the standards established by      the rules and decisions of that court;       ``(2) with respect to conduct in connection with a pending      or contemplated grand jury proceeding, the standards      established by the rules and decisions of the court under      whose authority the grand jury was impanelled;       ``(3) with respect to all other conduct--       ``(A) the standards established by the rules and decisions      of the State in which the attorney is licensed to practice;      or       ``(B) if the attorney is licensed to practice in more than      1 State--       ``(i) the standards established by the rules and decisions      of the licensing State in which the attorney principally      practices; or       ``(ii) if the conduct has a predominant effect in another      State in which the attorney is licensed to practice, the      standards established by the rules and decisions of the      licensing State so affected.       ``(c) Uniform National Rule.--(1) In order to encourage the      Supreme Court to prescribe, under chapter 131, a uniform      national rule governing attorneys for the Government with      respect to communications with represented persons and      parties, not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of      the Professional Standards for Government Attorneys Act of      1999, the Judicial Conference of the United States shall      submit to the Chief Justice of the United States a report,      which shall include recommendations with respect to amending      the Federal Rules of Civil and Criminal Procedure to provide      for such a uniform national rule.       ``(2) In developing the recommendations included in the      report under paragraph (1), the Judicial Conference of the      United States shall take into consideration, as appropriate--       ``(A) the needs and circumstances of multiforum and      multijurisdictional litigation;       ``(B) the special needs and interests of the United States      in investigating and prosecuting violations of Federal      criminal and civil law; and       ``(C) practices that are approved under Federal statutory      or case law or that are otherwise consistent with traditional      Federal law enforcement techniques.       ``(d) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section may be      construed to abridge, enlarge, or modify the power of the      Supreme Court or of any court established by an Act of      Congress, under chapter 131 or any other provision of law, to      prescribe standards of professional conduct for attorneys      practicing in and before the Federal courts, including      attorneys for the Government.''.       (b) Technical and Conforming Amendment.--The analysis for      chapter 31 of title 28, United States Code, is amended, in      the item relating to section 530B, by striking ``Ethical''      and inserting ``Professional''.                                  ____Summary of the ``Professional Standards for Government Attorneys Act of                                  1999''       The Professional Standards for Federal Professional Ethics      Act of 1999 would clarify the professional standards that      apply to Government attorneys and identify who has the      authority to set those standards. Consistent with the Rules      Enabling Act, this legislation would further ask the Supreme      Court to prescribe a uniform national rule for Government      attorneys in an area that has created enormous tension      between the Justice Department and virtually everyone else--     contacts with represented persons and parties.       More specifically, this bill would substitute for the      ``McDade law''--enacted at the end of the last Congress as      part of the omnibus appropriations bill--a new 28 U.S.C.      Sec. 530B governing professional standards for Government      attorneys. The new section 530B consists of four subsections:       Subsection (a) defines the term ``attorney for the      Government'' in the same manner as it is defined in the      McDade law, by reference to existing Federal regulations. It      also provides simple definitions for the terms ``court'' and      ``State''.       Subsection (b) establishes a clear choice-of-law rule for      Government attorneys with respect to standards of      professional conduct. Modeled on Rule 8.5(b) of the ABA Model      Rules of Professional Conduct, this subsection simply      codifies existing practice: for conduct in connection with      any matter in or before a court or grand jury, Government      attorneys are subject to the professional standards      established by the rules and decisions of the relevant court;      for all other conduct, Government attorneys are subject to      the professional standards established by rules and decisions      of the States in which they are licensed to practice.       Because this subsection addresses what standards apply, not      who gets to enforce them, nothing in this subsection would      disturb the traditional authority of the State courts to      discipline attorneys, including Government attorneys, who are      licensed to practice in their jurisdictions.       Subsection (c) directs the Judicial Conference of the      United States to submit to the Supreme Court a proposed      uniform national rule governing the conduct of Government      attorneys with respect to communications with represented      persons and parties. The Judicial Conference is directed to      take various law enforcement concerns into consideration when      crafting a proposed rule, and to complete its work within one      year.       Subsection (d) provides that nothing in the bill would      interfere with the Federal courts' existing authority, under      the Rules Enabling Act or any other provision of law, to      prescribe standards of attorney conduct for Federal      practitioners.                                 ______                                       By
