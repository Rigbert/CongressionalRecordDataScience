 President, after much hard work, research, and deliberation from both sides of the aisle, we are closer to having an opportunity to pass the first funding bill of the appropriations season, the energy security and water infrastructure funding bill.  I know Members have some differences of opinion about an amendment authored by Senator Cotton, but this is how the legislative process is supposed to work. Senator Cotton's amendment, which would prevent future funds to purchase heavy water from Iran, is germane to this funding bill, and it deserves a vote.  We are going to have that vote today, allowing Senators from both sides to have their say on this issue and allowing us to move forward on this important measure.  The energy security and water infrastructure funding bill will positively impact every State in America. We know it includes important measures to support energy research and innovation to promote public safety, to maintain waterway infrastructure, and to promote nuclear security.  Let's work to advance this bill and keep the appropriations process moving forward in a responsible manner.                          ____________________
