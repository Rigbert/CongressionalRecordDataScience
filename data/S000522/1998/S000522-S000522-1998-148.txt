Mr. Chairman, let us get back to reality here and directness. The numbers used by these people who attempt to overnight the Market Access Program are 10 years old.  I have just returned from the European Union, Germany, France, Belgium; and let me tell you that if you do not think we are out-subsidized, you should have been with me. There was $45 billion by the European Union, by the way, for agriculture products, $8 billion for export subsidies to European farmers. We are asking here for a very small Market Access Program that helps us advertise our products in foreign countries where we are being outbid every day by the governments.  This idea that these are large corporations is ridiculous. That is in the past. These are small corporations. They are cooperatives such as Sunkist, but these are made up of small operators and small farmers.  Let us not reduce ourselves to the argument that this is a big government payoff. It is a 16-to-1 return of dollars. One dollar for every $16 we receive; $1 invested, we receive $16 back.
