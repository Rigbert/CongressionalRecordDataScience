 President, there has been a flurry of activity surrounding the bankruptcy of the Enron Corporation. Part of the attention has focused on the company's questionable accounting practices and tax havens. Another spotlight has been focused on the Enron retirement plans, particularly its 401(k) plan.  These are legitimate areas of inquiry. The same fact pattern in the case of Enron applies to Global Crossings, a company that was founded in 1997, went public in 1998, sold shares worth $734 million before the company collapsed just this year, pauperizing its workforce and investors. In both companies, executives were lining their pockets with gold while they were duping investors and pillaging workers' retirement plans. The difference between Enron and Global Crossing is merely one of scale. Enron was the seventh largest company on the Fortune 500. Global Crossings was smaller but there are eerie similarities, both between these two bankruptcies, and the effect they have had on the way we now view pension plan security.  Any company bankruptcy will inevitably harm workers, retirees and investors. Some Enron employees, and some of those at Global Crossing, invested large amounts of their own money in company stock. In addition, both plans matched contributions made by the workers with the, now worthless, company stock. Had the company's financial statements correctly reflected the value of its stock, neither the workers, nor the investors would have purchased the shares. Unfortunately, the financial statements of those two companies were at least, highly misleading and very possibly fraudulent.  The losses by retirement plan participants are of concern to the Senate Finance Committee because it is the Committee with jurisdiction over both the Internal Revenue Code, IRC, and parts of ERISA. The Code provides generous tax benefits to retirement plan sponsors. In return for those tax preferences, plans must be established and maintained in accordance with the rules set out in the Internal Revenue Code and in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, ERISA.  The losses in the plans sponsored by recently bankrupted companies have prompted us to reconsider some of the laws that govern retirement programs. In particular, many have questioned whether plan participants should be permitted to hold any company stock in their accounts, or only a limited amount of stock. Other questions have been raised about fiduciary obligations, so-called ``blackouts'' and about information provided to workers.  For those in the business community who are alarmed about the large number of proposals, including mine, making changes to this area of the law, I would urge caution. This bill is not written in stone. Further refinements will be made to it. I am introducing it today because the Finance Committee will be holding a hearing on this issue tomorrow. Barely three weeks thereafter, Congress will be entering another recess period. If the introduction of this bill is delayed, interested parties will not have the time they need to examine this proposal and give me their views.  This bill gives workers new diversification rights on holdings of company stock in their accounts. Some legislative proposals have called for caps on the amount of stock that can be dedicated by employers to workers' 401(k) accounts through matching contributions or through gains on the value of company stock. I believe such an approach will discourage employers from giving stock to workers through their plan and could not be administered except through the application of benefit wear-aways. During the cash balance pension plan debate, Congress found out just how unpopular benefit wear-aways are with plan participants.  Some have also suggested that employees should not be permitted to purchase employer stock in their plans. They argue the need for a paternalistic government to save employees from the ``temptation'' of investing in employer stock in their 401(k) plans. I do not believe the government should treat workers like children. American workers are intelligent, and when armed with the right information, they will exercise foresight and make decisions for the best interest of themselves and their families.  My approach does not discourage employer matching contributions in company stock. Nor would it restrict a worker choice to invest in company stock. However, once the worker has three years of service with the employer, he or she should be permitted to change investments out of the company stock and into any other investment offered by the plan. This change gives maximum flexibility to the worker and will prevent the long holding periods that some companies impose on matching contributions in their own stock.  An important exception to this rule will apply to closely held corporations. Because of the difficulty of valuing stock in closely held corporations, under my bill, these rules will not apply to closely-held companies. This bill also provides that a pure, ``stand-alone'' ESOP, one consisting solely of now-elective contributions is not subject to the new rule.  The current draft of the bill does not include a long phase-in of the effective date for company stock currently allocated to workers retirement accounts. Such a delayed effective date has been proposed in other legislation. However, I am open to such a recommendation, if necessary. I encourage plan sponsors and practitioners to give me their thoughts on that issue.  This legislation also provides new disclosure requirements. At the end of 2001, Enron stopped participants from trading their investments while they changed plan administrators. Its stock was declining in value at this time, and for a long period prior to the so-called ``blackout''. It is no surprise that while the plan was closed to trading, all indications are that the value of the stock continued to decline. It appears that Enron employees did receive a notice prior to the transaction suspension period. But concerns have been raised that a statutory requirement for a notice will help to protect participants in other plans from missing an opportunity to change investments prior to a transaction suspension period. I am inclined to agree.  Consequently, this bill will also impose a requirement that plans provide 30-days advance notice of transaction suspension periods, the so-called ``blackouts''. These are periods when participants are unable to change their investments. This change in law is needed so that employees have the opportunity to trade out of company stock, or for that matter, any other investment, before the beginning of a blackout period. The bill does not limit the duration of a transaction suspension period. Some companies to a remarkable job in shortening the time during which a plan is closed to transactions, however, practitioners have convinced me that it would be impractical to limit these transaction suspension periods given the number of variables involved in reconciling accounts.  New disclosure requirements for so-called blackouts will be supplemented by better information regarding the value of plan benefits. I have long been concerned that participants need better information regarding their retirement. In the 105th Congress, I introduced a bill with Senator Breaux that would impose a requirement for periodic pension benefit statements.  Language on periodic benefit statements was included again in a bill that Senator Baucus and I introduced early last year. While most of that bill was enacted as the Economic Growth and Revenue Reconciliation Act of 2001, EGTRRA, Public Law 107-16, the requirement for periodic benefit statements was ``Byrded out''. In other words, it was dropped from the bill because it was revenue neutral and as such did not meet the rules governing a reconciliation measure.  Because we did not enact that provision in EGTRRA, the benefit statements language has been replicated here. Under this bill, participants will be entitled to a quarterly statement from their defined contribution plan, such as a section 401(k) plan. If the workers also have a defined benefit plan, they would be entitled to an estimated benefit statement once every three years.  Included in the periodic benefit statements will be language designed to alert workers to how much employer stock they hold in their accounts. Also included will be information regarding the importance to long-term retirement security of participants of a well-balanced an diversified portfolio. This information will encourage workers to avoid over-concentration in employer securities and to periodically re-balance their portfolio.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a technical explanation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1971       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(c) Conforming Amendments.--       (1) Section 105 of the Employee Retirement Income Security      Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1025) is amended by striking      subsection (d).       (2) Section 105(b) of such Act (29 U.S.C. 1025(b)) is      amended to read as follows:       ``(b) In no case shall a participant or beneficiary of a      plan be entitled to more than 1 statement described in      subsection (a)(1) (A)(ii) or (B)(ii), whichever is      applicable, in any 12-month period.''       (d) Model Statements.--The Secretary of Labor shall develop      1 or more model benefit statements, written in a manner      calculated to be understood by the average plan participant,      that may be used by plan administrators in complying with the      requirements of section 4980H of the Internal Revenue Code of      1986 and section 105 of the Employee Retirement Income      Security Act of 1974.       (e) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section      shall apply to plan years beginning after December 31, 2003.                                  ____                    Technical Explanation of S. 1971                 Diversification of Pension Plan Assets       The bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to require a      qualified defined contribution plan invested in publicly-     traded employer securities to provide participants with the      right to diversify their investment in employer securities. A      participant must be provided with the immediate right to      reinvest elective deferrals that are invested in employer      securities. In addition, the participant must be provided      with the right to invest employer contributions that are      invested in employer securities once the participant has 3 or      more years of service.       The participant must be permitted to reinvest employer      securities allocated to the participant's account in any      other investment option currently available to employees, and      the plan must provide at least 3 alternative investment      options. These diversification rights are also extended to      any beneficiary of a participant.       A plan will fail to comply with this requirement if the      ability of participants to diversify their investment in      employer securities is restricted under the plan or in      practice. For example, a plan will not comply with this      requirement if it provides for diversification of investment      in employer securities, but also provides for a reduced      matching contribution for any participant who invests any      employer securities in another investment option. The bill      also amends ERISA by adding this diversification requirement      to section 204.       These diversification requirements do not apply to an ESOP      that provides only for nonelective employer contributions and      is separate from any other qualified plan maintained by the      same employer. These ESOPs continue to be subject to the      diversification requirements in effect under section      401(a)(28) of the Code.  protection of employees during pension plan transaction suspension                                 periods     Notice of transaction suspension periods       The bill requires that participants and beneficiaries who      are permitted to direct the investment of their accounts in a      qualified defined contribution plan must be notified by the      plan administrator of any ``transaction suspension period''      no later than 30 days before the transaction suspension      period begins.       A transaction suspension period is any temporary or      indefinite period of 2 or more business days during which      there is a substantial reduction in the rights of participant      or beneficiaries to direct investments (other than by reason      of the application of securities laws). The notice must      provide sufficient information to allow affected participants      and beneficiaries to understand the timing and effect of the      transaction suspension period and must be written in a manner      calculated to be understood by the average plan participant.       The notice may be provided in writing or through an      electronic or other form reasonably accessible to the      affected participants and beneficiaries. These requirements      are not violated if 30-days notice could not be provided      because of events outside of the control of the plan sponsor      or administrator, provided that notice is provided as soon as      is reasonably possible under the circumstances. This      exception to the 30-day requirement also applies, to the      extent permitted in guidance by the Secretary, in other      appropriate situations such as acquisitions or dispositions.       The bill also imposes an excise tax of $100 a day on the      failure of a qualified defined contribution plan to provide      notice to a participant or beneficiary. The excise tax is      imposed on the employer or, in the case of a multiemployer      plan, on the plan. No excise tax is imposed during any period      during which any person subject to liability for the tax did      not know that the failure existed and exercised reasonable      diligence to meet the notice requirement.       In addition, no excise tax is imposed to the extent that a      person subject to liability for the tax exercised reasonable      diligence and actually provided notice as soon as reasonably      practicable after the first date such person knew, or      exercising reasonable diligence should have known, that such      failure existed. For a person who exercised reasonable      diligence, the tax is limited to no more than $500,000 for      the failures during a taxable year. Finally, the Secretary      may waive all or part of any tax that would otherwise be      imposed to the extent that payment of the tax would be      excessive or otherwise inequitable.     Inapplicability of relief from fiduciary liability during          transaction suspension period       The provisions of ERISA that limit fiduciary liability      during periods when a participant or beneficiary exercises      control over assets in his account would be amended to      clarify that this limit does not apply during any transaction      suspension period.     Trading in company stock by corporate insiders subject to          excise tax       Under the bill, a corporate insider is subject to a 20%      excise tax on any acquisition, disposition, or similar      transaction involving any employer securities during any      transaction suspension period that affects investment in      employer securities with respect to which notice must be      provided to any plan participant or beneficiary.       The excise tax is calculated based on the amount realized      by the insider in any sale or other disposition or the fair      market value of securities acquired by the insider during the      transaction suspension period. For this purpose, ``corporate      insiders'' are individuals subject to the requirements of      section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with      respect to the corporation.            Providing of Information to Assist Participants     Periodic pension benefit statements       The bill amends ERISA to require the plan administrator of      a qualified defined contribution plan to provide participants      with benefit statements at least annually, except that      benefit statements must be provided at least quarterly to      participants who have the ability to direct the investment of      their account in the plan. These statements must provide      information on (i) the fair market value of assets in the      participant's account, (ii) the portion of the assets which      are nonforfeitable and the earliest date on which assets not      nonforfeitable become so, (iii) the percentage (if any) which      the fair market value of employer securities bears to the      fair market value of assets in the account, and (iv) a      reminder of the importance of having diversified investments      of assets in the plan and other plans of the employer in      which the individual is also a participant. In addition,      statements must be provided to plan beneficiaries at least      annually, if requested in writing.       The bill also amends ERISA to require that the      administrator of a qualified defined benefit plan provide a      benefit statement at least every 3 years to a participant      with a nonforfeitable accrued benefit who is employed by the      employer maintaining the plan at the time the statement is      furnished. A statement is also required to be provided to any      participant or beneficiary upon written request.       This benefit statement must provide information on the      total benefits accrued, the     nonforfeitable pension benefits, if any, which have accrued,      or the earliest date on which benefits will become      nonforfeitable. The statement must be written in a manner      calculated to be understood by the average plan participant      and may be provided in writing or in electronic or other form      reasonably accessible by the participant.       The information provided in a defined benefit plan      statement, other than a statement requested by a plan      participant, may be based on reasonable estimates. The      requirement to provide a defined benefit plan statement is      met if the plan notifies participants annually of the      availability of a statement and information on how the      participant can obtain a statement.       The bill also imposes an excise tax of $100 a day during a      period of noncompliance with the requirement that quarterly      benefit statements be provided to participants who have the      right to direct investment of their account. The excise tax      is imposed on the employer or, in the case of a multiemployer      plan, on the plan. No excise tax is imposed during any period      during which any person subject to liability for the tax did      not know that the failure existed and exercised reasonable      diligence to meet the notice requirement.       In addition, no excise tax is imposed to the extent that a      person subject to liability for the tax exercised reasonable      diligence and actually provided notice as soon as reasonably      practicable after the first date such person knew, or      exercising reasonable diligence should have known, that such      failure existed. For a person who exercised reasonable      diligence, the tax is limited to no more than $500,000 for      the failures during a taxable year. Finally, the Secretary      may waive all or part of any tax that would otherwise be      imposed to the extent that payment of the tax would be      excessive or otherwise inequitable.                             Effective Date       The provisions of the bill would be effective for plan      years beginning on or after January 1, 2003, except that the      provisions related to the provision of benefit statements      would be effective for plan years beginning after December      31, 2003. The bill provides a transition period for      compliance with the diversification requirements for plans      maintained pursuant to collective bargaining agreements.                                 ______                                       By
