Speaker, America's economic history is rooted in the exploitation of labor. It is a lesson worth remembering, but its history is not one of yesteryears alone.  Our existing trade deals impose an economic model built on cheap labor, where profits matter more than people. This system undermines the rule of law with a global race to the bottom.  Trade is not just about goods. It is about people. It is about communities. It is about workers.  In the agriculture sector alone, one can argue that our continent has gone from slavery to serfdom. That is why, today, I am introducing the Independent Labor Secretariat for Fair Trade Deals Act.  We need a trade model that respects workers and holds employers and workers accountable, with strong mechanisms for labor enforcement.  My bill would establish an independent labor secretariat to monitor and enforce transnational labor issues, with a wages and standards working group with expert wage panels to study the impacts on wages, benefits, labor rights, working conditions, and inequality.  The bill also requires that any trade agreement eligible for expedited consideration include enforceable labor standards and protections.  Mr. Speaker, let us dignify the workers who sustain us.                          ____________________
