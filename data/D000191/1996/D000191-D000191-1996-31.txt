Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I remember the debate last year when the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Edwards] stood on this side and a Member on the other side kept saying, ``I wish you would not say star wars.'' We are not talking about star wars. We are not going back to star wars. Star wars was a failure. We are talking about ballistic missile defense and things that are workable.  Mr. Chairman, here we are now a year later, and we want to open that door again. As we heard so ably discussed by the gentleman from South Carolina [Mr. Spratt] and the gentleman from Washington [Mr. Dicks], there is technology out there which exists, which can potentially defend the United States against these threats that we hear so much about, the rogue nations and the single or the few multiple missiles.  But what we are talking about here, if this amendment is defeated, is opening the door again to the star wars fantasy to spend another $30 billion to $60 million, which is estimated by the majority's own Congressional Budget Office. They came up with the $30 billion to $60 billion estimate for star wars.                              {time}  2015  That is why the bill was pulled about a week and a half ago from the floor of the House. So let us focus our scarce resources on something that might provide benefit for the United States of America in terms of defending our own Nation against rogue nations, which might, in fact already has defended our troops when they are deployed overseas hopefully defend some of our allies overseas in the co-development with Israel of the Nautilus program.  This amendment allows the TMD, the Nautilus, the Navy Upper Tier, the 3 plus 3 BMDO, the LEAP, the EKV; all those programs can go forward. They are all technologies that have a good chance of working.  What it does say is that we are not going to move ahead to deployment of a $30- to $60 billion boondoggle that will not do anything to defend our Nation.
