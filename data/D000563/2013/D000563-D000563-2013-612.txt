President, there will be two rollcall votes at noon tomorrow on confirmation of the Kelly and Burwell nominations.  Additional votes in relation to the Marketplace Fairness Act are possible on Wednesday. We have urged all Senators with amendments to bring them forward to the floor in an expedited fashion so we can consider them in a timely way.                          ____________________
