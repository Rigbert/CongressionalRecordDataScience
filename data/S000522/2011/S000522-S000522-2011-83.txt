Mr. Schilling, thank you very much for your great statement. And your comments about your child saying, who will defend the baby? I remember a woman by the name of Jean Garton who was with Lutherans for Life. She was preparing a slide show of actual abortions, which are hideous to behold, but it is a reality that has to be understood to know what abortion really is. And her young child walked in and said, Mommy, who broke the baby? looking up at the shattered bodies of unborn children. So from the mouths of children, truth is spoken.  I would like to welcome back to the House, as we all do, Steve Pearce, a Member from New Mexico. We are just so glad to have you back.                              {time}  2040
