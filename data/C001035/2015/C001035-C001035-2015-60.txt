 Mr. President, just a very brief explanation on both of these amendments. Senator Mikulski's amendment simply allows the Secretary of Transportation to select the Federal appointees for the Washington metro system. That is done by the head of GSA right now, and obviously GSA is an agency with no transportation policy expertise, so this simply makes sense. It is noncontroversial and has already been passed out of the Senate committee of jurisdiction.  Senator Mikulski has been very concerned, as have many of us, about the safety and operational issues with Metro, and I believe this amendment is an excellent one, and I am proud to lend my support.  Senator McCain's amendment ensures that the Federal Aviation Administration reviews its procedures when there are complaints from a community about the noise of airplanes that are landing in a particular area and that they do a report.  I think both of these amendments make a great deal of sense, and I am pleased that we were able to clear them and get them adopted.
