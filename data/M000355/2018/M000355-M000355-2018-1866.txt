 President, community banks, credit unions, and other small-scale lenders play a vital role in the U.S. economy.  Research from Harvard indicates that community banks provide more than half of all small business loans. Let me repeat that. A majority of small business loans is handled by community banks. This is even more pronounced in rural areas and farming communities, like those I represent in Kentucky. A whopping 77 percent of agricultural loans come from community banks--77 percent.  In this era of online banking and multinational corporations, smaller institutions remain uniquely able to build community connections. Community bankers get to know their residents and business owners on a personal level. That perspective lets them extend credit to small-scale entrepreneurs, farmers, ranchers, and other Americans who might not have access otherwise. So when small lenders close their doors, the effects on communities are very real.  In 2014, an economist at MIT found that, on average, the closing of a single bank cut the number of new small business loans in the immediate area by more than 10 percent for several years.
