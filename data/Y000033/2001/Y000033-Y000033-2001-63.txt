Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that debate on this amendment and any amendments thereto be limited to 55 minutes, to be divided and controlled as follows: 25 minutes controlled by the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey), who has already had 5, and 30 to be controlled by myself.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. Simpson). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida?
