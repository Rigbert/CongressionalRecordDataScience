President, today I am introducing a bill with Senator Harkin which is designed to help communities alleviate hunger at the local level. The Community Food Security Act of 1995 will provide one-time grants to local organizations which are working to both meet the immediate food needs of low-income people while seeking future-oriented solutions to local food, farm and nutrition problems.  This is a good bill. It enjoyed strong bipartisan support in the House.  The Community Food Security Act will provide Federal support to local projects such as farmers market nutrition programs, food policy councils, community gardens and urban farms all of which promote good nutrition while helping family farms. At a time when many people are advocating that we give more power to the States--this bill goes one step further. The Community Food Security Act will give money directly to the private organizations who know where it is most needed.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Community Food Security Act      of 1995''.     SEC. 2. ASSISTANCE FOR COMMUNITY FOOD SECURITY PROJECTS.
