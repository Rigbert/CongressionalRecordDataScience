This is an important post, and I am confident that he will serve honorably.  Skip is a native Vermonter whose family has lived in the State for generations, and I know he will take his strong Vermont values with him to Slovakia. While we may not always agree on political matters, I have great respect for Skip's integrity, intelligence, and commitment.  During his hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Skip discussed a number of initiatives he will undertake in this position; from enhancing trade opportunities to promoting democracy. His business experience will be of immense value as the Slovak Republic seeks to build its economy and integrate itself more fully into the global economy.  While I will miss seeing Skip in Vermont, I know I am joined by Vermonters in saying how proud I am to have one of our own representing our country overseas. I would like to congratulate Skip and his family and wish them the best in this new endeavor.                          ____________________
