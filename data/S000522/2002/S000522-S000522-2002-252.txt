Mr. Chairman, as Chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, I rise to commend the Appropriations Committee, Chairman Bill Young, and particularly Subcommittee Chairman Jim Walsh, for including $417 million in urgently needed funding for veterans medical care.  As most of my colleagues know from listening to their constituents, the demand for VA health care services has risen significantly in the past several years. The Department of Veterans Affairs has had to make mid-year changes to their projections of VA health care usage because of the dramatic increase in veterans seeking to enroll. In fact, the VA's latest budget submission projects that almost 700,000 more veterans will receive VA care in 2003 than they had projected just one year ago.  The dramatic upsurge in demand facing the VA is real and substantial. With hundreds of new VA community outpatient clinics opened in recent years, veterans are now finding that VA health care is available much closer to home.  Prescription drug costs have risen dramatically in the past several years, while seniors' incomes levels have remained level. This has created a great demand for VA-provided prescription drugs.  Mr. Chairman, the response to increased demand for VA health care services should not be to curtail services or limit access for veterans in any way, but rather to provide sufficient resources to pay for veterans' health care. America has a special obligation to carefor former soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines who risked their lives to protect our freedoms and this legislation is another step towards meeting that sacred obligation.  The inclusion of $417 million for VA medical care is a responsible and absolutely necessary action that this Congress must take. Again, I want to commend Chairman Young, and Subcommittee Chairman Walsh, for once again demonstrating their commitment to America's veterans.                          ____________________
