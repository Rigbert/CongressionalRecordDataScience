President, today we are going to vote on two of the district court nominations pending before the Senate. I am glad we are getting to these important nominations, as we should have weeks ago. They should have been done in a routine fashion in the normal course of events, but there has been this concerted effort to slow down President Obama's judges--something we have never seen with other Presidents, but we do with him. I am glad that these are at least going through.  In the same vein, we see a needless government shutdown. I hope it comes to an end so the Senate can tend to the business of the country, including, as I said on the floor the other day, ensuring that the courts have the judges they need. In fact, speaking of judges, they are both from Illinois and have the support of Senator Durbin and Senator Kirk.  I ask that my full statement regarding the judges be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               Nominations of Colin Bruce and Sara Ellis
