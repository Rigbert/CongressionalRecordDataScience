 President, what my amendment does is speak to and support the President's present negotiation. It gives full support to the President of the United States, because if there was ever a time the President should have the world know the Nation stands behind him, it is now. It is now in this negotiation. I don't have time to read the amendment, but I promise you, it is a rendition of the administration's position on negotiations and compliments him for it and says we support him.  Although Senator Hagel is in a hearing and on his way, there will probably not be much time for him to speak. But he is a cosponsor, along with Senators Levin and Dodd. I am sure there are others, and I ask unanimous consent that they be able to be added later.
