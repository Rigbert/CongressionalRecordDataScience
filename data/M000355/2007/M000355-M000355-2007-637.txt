 We have had some discussions, but I had not seen Senator Warner's proposal until just tonight. I am not complaining about that, but the text of it is new to me as well as to the Democratic leader.  It is still my hope that we could, as we discussed over the last couple of weeks in anticipation of this debate, enter into a consent agreement under which we would have had several different proposals in their entirety, realizing the difficulty of amending a concurrent resolution--several different proposals in their entirety that the Senate could consider. Maybe this is a better way to go, but it occurred to me that was probably the best way to go forward with this important debate.  Given the lateness of the hour and the newness of all of this, I am going to be constrained to object and will consider--I know we will continue this conversation in the morning in hopes of reaching some agreement that is mutually acceptable.
