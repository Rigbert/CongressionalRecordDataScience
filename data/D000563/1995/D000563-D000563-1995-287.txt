I think all of America fell for this fellow, because he came out and it does us proud to have fellow who has come through such terrible ordeal and who says, ``Don't give me credit. Give the credit to the rescuers. I was acting like a bunny, hiding in the bushes.'' But when he tells his story, we know it took a lot of guts and bravery for him to make it through that.  There are many more like him in the service, and thank God there are. They deserve first-class treatment. And instead of building these weapons system that cost so much money like star wars, we have put $40 billion in star wars, this Ronald Reagan concept that is going to protect the United States. We have little or nothing to show for it. And now our friends on the Republican side say, let us spend another $30 billion and see what we can find.  I say put the money in defending this country and   making sure that the people who serve in the service are treated with respect and dignity.
