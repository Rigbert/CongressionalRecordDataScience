Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community are exceptional. Temecula has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent to make their communities a better place to live and work. Terry Gilmore is one of these individuals. On February 22, 2014, Terry was honored as the 2013 ``Citizen of the Year'' award recipient at the Temecula Chamber of Commerce Installation and Awards Gala.  Terry was born and raised in the thriving city of St. Louis, Missouri, as one of four children to parents with a blue collar background. Like them, Terry never went on to attend college, but instead gained his keen business sense from working at a bowling alley starting at a very young age. Terry developed his love for the sport of bowling while clearing out the pins at the back of the lanes and often earned free games as payment. As a youth, Terry became one of the top 10 amateur bowlers in the country.  The joy Terry found in bowling was put on hold when he received a draft card for Vietnam in 1966. He served his country proudly for over a year as an infantry radio operator. Immediately after returning from the war, Terry found that he was willing to move just about anywhere to follow his dreams. With $702 dollars in his pocket and a brand new Corvette, Terry moved from his hometown of St. Louis out west to the sunny city of Phoenix, Arizona for a new start.  Though Phoenix was still a very small town at the time of his move, Terry found his way in to a job at the local Dodge dealership, Scottsdale Dodge. Not only did he find passion in the job, but he also found love when he met a sales associate, named Cindy, who would eventually become his wife. Terry's commitment showed itself early in his career. He was the first to pick up extra shifts on weekends and holidays, all the while saving up to provide for his wife and family. He moved up within the dealership and soon decided to take a huge risk by moving out to Ventura, California in 1983 to get more experience in the automotive industry. Terry landed a job with Robert Gregory at Paradise Chevrolet, where his success eventually led him to take on the role as General Manager.  A mere eight years later, Robert Gregory was given the opportunity to open a new Chevrolet dealership in the then-small town of Temecula, California, and invited Terry to buy in as his partner. With hard work and dedication, Terry became the sole owner of Paradise Chevrolet after 20 years. Terry's attitude for success created a thriving business that earned him the ``Chevrolet Dealer of the Year Award'' for the entire United States in 2010.  It is hard to imagine that Terry would have any free time on his hands, yet he has always found time for his community. From Copy for Kids, serving in Chamber positions, and helping local Veterans, Terry truly has had a hand in developing organizations and groups that make our community great. He found his true calling, however, through the Boys & Girls Clubs of Southwest County. For over 20 years, Terry has helped the non-profit reach their fundraising goals, and currently serves on the Board of Directors, more specifically the Emeritus Board of Distinction. When asked why he remains so involved in these organizations, Terry stated, ``There is nothing more valuable than your time, so I decided to give mine.''  In his spare time, Terry enjoys spending time with his wife of over 30 years, their daughter who attends San Diego State University, and his daughter from a previous marriage, who still lives in St. Louis.  Considering all that Terry has done for the city of Temecula, the Temecula Chamber of Commerce named him their 2013 ``Citizen of the Year.'' Terry's tireless passion for service has contributed immensely to the betterment of our community. He has been the heart and soul of many organizations and events and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many individuals are grateful for his service and salute him as he receives this prestigious award.                          ____________________
