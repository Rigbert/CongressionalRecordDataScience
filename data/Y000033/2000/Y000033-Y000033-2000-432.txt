Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's comment. I just suggest respectfully that amendment should be rejected. It is a small, small part of this total budget, and I do go back to my senior citizens and I do think they frankly support this legislation.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
