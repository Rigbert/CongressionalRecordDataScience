Speaker, reclaiming my time under my reservation, I certainly join the chairman, the gentleman from California (Mr. Thomas), in his remarks.  It is entirely appropriate that the House join the Senate, expressing its regrets to the Senate, expressing its profound regret to the family of Scott Bates, who, as the chairman indicated, served with distinction for over three decades the United States Senate and this country. It is a loss not only for the Senate, not only for the Congress, but for our country as well.  Mr. Speaker, reserving my right to object, I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Moran).
