Senator Bob Dole,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Senator Dole: I endorse Merrick Garland for confirmation to      the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.      Merrick will be a solid addition to this esteemed court.       A Harvard Law School graduate in 1977, a former Assistant      United States Attorney and a former partner in Washington's      Arnold and Porter Law Firm, Merrick will bring an array of      skills and experience to this judgeship. Merrick is further      developing his talents and enhancing his reputation as the      Principle Associate Deputy Attorney General.       Last April, in Oklahoma City, Merrick was at the helm of      the Justice Department's investigation following the bombing      of the Oklahoma City Federal Building, the bloodiest and most      tragic act of terrorism on American soil. During the      investigation, Merrick distinguished himself in a situation      where he had to lead a highly complicated investigation and      make quick decisions during critical times.       Merrick Garland is an intelligent, experienced and      evenhanded individual. I hope you give him full consideration      for confirmation to the United States Court of Appeals for      the D.C. Circuit.           Sincerely,                                                    Frank Keating,     Governor.                                  ____                                           Office of the Governor,                                 Des Moines, IA, October 10, 1995.     Senator Charles E. Grassley,     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chuck: I am writing to ask your support and assistance      in the confirmation process for a second cousin, Merrick      Garland, who has been nominated to be a judge on the U.S.      Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.       Merrick Garland has had a distinguished legal career. He      was a partner for many years in the Washington law firm of      Arnold and Porter. During the Bush Administration, Merrick      was asked by Jay Stephens, the U.S. Attorney for the District      of Columbia, to take on a three year stint as an Assistant      U.S. Attorney. As I'm sure you know, Jay Stephens is the son      of Lyle Stephens, the Representative from Plymouth County      that we served with in the Iowa Legislature.       Recently, he has been overseeing the federal investigation      and prosecution efforts in the Oklahoma City bombing, having      been sent there the second day after the blast occurred. He      was serving in the position as principal Associate Deputy      Attorney General.       I am enclosing a number of news clippings about Merrick      Garland. I would especially encourage you to review the Legal      Times and article entitled: Garland, A Centrist Choice.       As always, I appreciate all of your efforts. Hope all is      going well for you.           Sincerely,                                                Terry E. Branstad,     Governor of Iowa.                                  ____                                            O'Melveny & Myers,                                 Washington, DC, October 11, 1995.     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Orrin: As you know, President Clinton has nominated      Merrick B. Garland, Esquire, to fill the judicial vacancy on      the United States Court of Appeals for the District of      Columbia Circuit caused by the retirement of Chief Judge      Mikva.       I write this letter to indicate my full support and      admiration of Mr. Garland and urge that you soon have a      hearing of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary and      thereafter support him to fill the vacancy.       Mr. Garland has a first-rate legal mind, took magna cum      laude and summa cum laude advantages of education at Harvard      College and Harvard Law School. In private practice, he      became and has the reputation of being an outstanding      courtroom lawyer. In addition, on several occasions, he      satisfied his urge to be a public servant by two law      clerkships, one for Mr. Justice William J. Brennan and the      other for the late Judge Henry J. Friendly. He has also      served in the Justice Department on several occasions. I have      known Merrick Garland as a lawyer and as a friend and greatly      admire his personal integrity, learning in the law and his      desire to be a great public servant. His legal, social and      political views are those most Americans admire and are well      within the fine hopes and principles of this country, which      you have often expressed in conversations with me as to the      type of person you would like to see on the federal      judiciary, particularly on the appellate courts.       I first got to know Mr. Garland when he was Special      Assistant to Deputy and then Attorney General Civiletti, as      my daughter, Lovida, Jr., was the other Special Assistant. I      still see him and his wife from time to time and they are the      type of Americans whom I greatly admire.       As is stated at the outset of this letter, I hope you will      see to it that Mr. Garland soon has his hearing and that you,      at and after the hearing, will actively support him for      confirmation. If you have any questions, please give me a      call and I will walk over to see you.       Take care.           Sincerely,     William T. Coleman, Jr.                                  ____                             Venable, Baetjer and Howard, llp,                                 Baltimore, MD, September 7, 1995.     Re Merrick B. Garland.     Hon. Barbara A. Mikulski,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Mikulski: I just wanted to call your attention      to the fact that Merrick B. Garland has been nominated by      President Clinton for appointment to the United States Court      of Appeals for the DC Circuit.       Merrick is an outstanding lawyer with a very distinguished      career both in private practice at Arnold & Porter and in      government service, first as a special assistant to me when I      was Attorney General and then later as an Assistant United      States Attorney for the District and, most recently, as Chief      Associate Deputy Attorney General to Jamie Gorelick.      Additionally, his academic background was outstanding,      culminating in his clerkship to Supreme Court Justice      Brennan. In every way, he is a superb candidate for that      bench, and I just wanted you to know of my personal      admiration for him.       Kindest regards.           Sincerely,     Benjamin R. Civiletti.                                  ____                          McGuire Woods, Battle & Boothe, III,                                 Washington, DC, October 16, 1995.     Re Nomination of Merrick B. Garland to the U.S. Court of          Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.     Hon. Orin G. Hatch,     Chairman, United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary,          Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Hatch: I have been asked to express my views      to you on Merrick Garland's nomination to sit on the Federal      Court of appeals in the District of Columbia. First, I      believe Mr. Garland is an accomplished and learned lawyer and      is most certainly qualified for a seat on this important      bench. Second, my experience with Mr. Garland leads me to the      conclusion that he would decide cases on the law based on an      objective and fair analysis of the positions of the parties      in any dispute. Third, I perceive Mr. Garland as a man who      believes and follows certain principles, but not one whose      philosophical beliefs would overpower his objective analysis      of legal issues.       I know of no reason to suggest that the President's choice      for his vacancy on the Court of Appeals should not be      confirmed. As you, of course, have demonstrated during your      tenure as Chairman, the President's nominees are his choices      and are entitled to be confirmed where it is clear that th4e      nominee would be a capable and fair jurist. I believe Mr.      Garland meets that criteria and support favorable      consideration of his nomination.           Sincerely yours,     George J. Terwilliger, III.                                  ____                                   Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue,     Washington, DC, October 10, 1995.     Re Merrick B. Garland.     Senator Orrin G. Hatch,     U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Hatch: I first met Merrick Garland in the mid-     1970's, when we overlapped as students at the Harvard Law      School. While I have not known him well, I have been well      aware that his academic background is impeccable, and that he      is reputed to be a very bright, highly effective and      understated lawyer.       During January of 1994, while he was serving in the      Department of Justice, I had occasion to deal with him      directly on a matter of some public moment and sensitivity. I      was struck by the thoroughness of his preparation, the depth      of his understanding of the matters in issue, both factural      and legal, and his ability to express himself simply and      convincingly. I was still more impressed with his comments,      from obvious personal conviction, on the essential role of      honesty, integrity, and forthrightness in government.       Our discussions at that time were followed by further      conversations on several later occasions. I have also had an      opportunity to     observe from a distance his performance in the Department and      to discuss that performance with people closer to the scene.      I am left with a distinct impression of him as a person of      great skill, diligence, and sound judgment, who is driven      more by a sense of public service than of personal      aggrandizement.       My own service in the Justice Department during the last      two Republican Administrations convinced me that government      suffers greatly from a shortage of people combining such      exceptional abilities with a primary drive to serve interests      beyond their own. Merrick Garland's nomination affords the      Senate chance to place one such person in a position where      such impulses can be harnessed to the maximum public good. I      hope that the Senate will seize that opportunity.           Very Truly Yours,     Donald B. Ayer.                                  ____                            Shaw, Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge,                                  Washington DC, November 9, 1995.     Hon. Orrin Hatch,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Hatch: I write to express my support for      President Clinton's nomination of Merrick Garland to the      position of circuit Judge of the United States Court of      Appeals for the District of Columbia. I've known Merrick      since 1978, when we served as law clerks to Supreme Court      Justices--he for Justice Brennan and I for Justice (now Chief      Justice) Rehnquist. Like our respective bosses, Merrick and I      disagreed on many legal issues. Still, I believe that Merrick      possesses the qualities of a fine judge.       You are no doubt well aware of the details of Merrick's      background as a practicing lawyer, a federal prosecutor, a      law teacher, and now a high-ranking official of the      Department of Justice. This varied background has given      Merrick a breadth and depth of legal experience that few      lawyers his age can rival, and he has distinguished himself      in all of his professional pursuits. He is a man of great      learning, not just in the law, but also in other disciplines.      Not only is Merrick enormously gifted intellectually, but he      is thoughtful as well, for he respects other points of view      and fairly and honestly assesses the merits of all sides of      an issue. And he has a stable, even-tempered, and courteous      manner. He would comport himself on the bench with dignity      and fairness. In short, I believe that Merrick Garland will      be among President Clinton's very best judicial appointments.           Sincerely,     Charles J. Cooper.                                  ____                                Washington, DC, November 25, 1995.     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Senate Dirksen          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write with regard to the nomination of      Merrick Garland to the Court of Appeals for the District of      Columbia.       I have known Mr. Garland since 1990 when he was an      Assistant United States Attorney and I was the Assistant      Attorney General for the Criminal Division in the Department      of Justice. Over the Years I have had occasion to see his      work in several cases.       Based both on my own observations and on his reputation in      the legal community, I believe him to be exceptionally      qualified for a Circuit Court appointment. Throughout my      association with him I have always been impressed by his      judgment. Most importantly, Mr. Garland exemplifies the      qualifies of fairness, integrity and scholarship which are so      important for those who sit on the bench.       If I can be of any further assistance, please do not      hesitate to call me.           Sincerely,     Robert S. Mueller, III.                                  ____                                    Pillsbury Madison & Sutro,                                Washington, DC, November 28, 1995.     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office          Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative          Oversight and the Courts, Hart Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Hatch and Grassley: I am writing with respect      to the nomination of Merrick Garland to serve as a judge on      the United States Court of Appeals for the District of      Columbia Circuit. I understand you have significant      reservations about filling the existing vacancy on the      District of Columbia Circuit at this time. In the event you      consider filling the vacancy at this time, I commend Merrick      Garland for your consideration.       I have known Mr. Garland for nearly ten years. We met      initially during my service as Deputy Counsel to the      President while Mr. Garland was assisting in an Independent      Counsel investigation. During the course of that contact, I      was impressed with Mr. Garland's professionalism and      judgment. After I was appointed United State Attorney for the      District of Columbia, Mr. Garland expressed to me an interest      in gaining additional prosecutorial experience, and applied      for a position as an Assistant United States Attorney. I      hired Mr. Garland for my staff, and initially assigned him to      a narcotics unit where he had an opportunity to assist in      investigating a number of significant cases and to gain      valuable trial experience. Mr. Garland quickly established      himself as a dedicated prosecutor who was willing to handle      the tough cases. He conducted thorough investigations, and      became a skilled trial attorney.       Subsequently, after gaining significant trial experience,      Mr. Garland was assigned to the Public Corruption section of      the U.S. Attorney's Office. There he had an opportunity to      investigate and try a number of complex, sensitive cases. In      the Public Corruption section, Mr. Garland demonstrated an      excellent capacity to investigate complex transactions, and      approached these important cases with maturity and balanced      judgment. He was thorough and thoughtful in exercising his      responsibility, and he always acted in accord with the      highest ethical and professional standards.       During his service as an Assistant United State Attorney,      Mr. Garland distinguished himself as one of the most capable      prosecutors in the Office. He brought to bear a number of      outstanding talents. He was bright. He had the intellectual      capacity to parse complex transactions. He built sound      working relationships with agents and staff based on mutual      respect. He was willing to work hard to get the job done. He      was dedicated to his job. He exercised sound judgment, and      approached his work with professionalism and thoughtfulness.      He exhibited excellent interpersonal skills, and was      delightful to work with. In sum, his service as an Assistant      United States Attorney was market by dedication, sound      judgment, excellent legal ability, a balanced temperament,      and the highest ethical and professional standards. These are      qualities which I believe he would bring to the bench as      well.       I appreciate the opportunity to provide these comments for      your consideration.           Sincerely,     Jay B. Stephens.                                  ____                                             Winston & Strawn,                                    Chicago, IL, October 10, 1995.     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,     Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Russell Senate Office          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Hatch: It is my understanding that Merrick      Garland's name has been submitted to the Senate Judiciary      Committee to fill a vacancy on the D.C. Circuit Court of      Appeals. Merrick is a very talented lawyer, who has had an      outstanding career in both the private and public sectors.       In particular, he has exhibited exceptional legal abilities      during his recent term of office in the U.S. Department of      Justice. Throughout the United States, Merrick has been      recognized as a person within the Clinton Department of      Justice who is fair, thoughtful and reasonable. He clearly      possesses the ability to address legal issues and resolve      them in a fair and equitable manner.       Accordingly, in my opinion, Merrick will be an outstanding      addition to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, and I strongly      recommend his confirmation by your committee. If you have any      further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.           Very truly yours,     Dan K. Webb.                                  ____         American Bar Association, Standing Committee on Federal            Judiciary,                               Washington, DC, September 21, 1995.
