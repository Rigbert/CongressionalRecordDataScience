 It is simply amazing for our Democratic colleagues to say that Justice Brown, for example, has embraced the Lochner decision, when she has taken the opposite position and written in a published opinion that Lochner was a ``usurpation of power'' and the Lochner court seemed to believe it could ``alter the meaning of the Constitution as written.'' Indeed, many times her position has been essentially misrepresented.  To get back to the basic point of our exchange, we ought not hold against nominees--particularly those who have written a good bit, published a good bit--their provocative statements. We clearly did not do that against JusticeRuth Bader Ginsburg, nor should we have. We ought not do that in this unfortunate attempt to demonize Justice Janice Rogers Brown, who has had by any standard not only an outstanding life story but an outstanding record on the California Supreme Court.  I thank my friend from Alabama for being here during this discussion. We hope this will help put the whole issue of provocative musings and writing into context as a relevant factor in considering how we are going to vote to confirm judicial nominees.
