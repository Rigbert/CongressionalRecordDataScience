President, this is the bill that is before the Senate. It is 2,074 pages. It has been on the Internet now for 3 weeks in its entirety. You cannot only read it on the Democratic Senate Web site, you can read it on the Republican Senate Web site. So one might ask: Well, where is the Republican comprehensive health care reform bill? It is not to be found--not on the floor of the Senate, not on the Web site--because it doesn't exist.  After 1 year of debate about America's health care system, the Republicans in the Senate have failed to produce any legislation that has gone through the scrutiny this legislation has faced in terms of its impact on America, its impact on our budget.
