President, my colleagues have spoken about Meg Greenfield. I also want to echo their sentiments.  I think what was most amazing about her was not just her great talent, her ability to write, her extraordinary breadth of knowledge and interest, but to watch her, especially in the last few months, when ravaged by disease, she continued that same interest. She continued her work.  When you spoke with her or saw her, she never spoke about her own illness; she spoke of her interest in others. I have never once during her long illness heard her complain about her illness, but rather she would talk of others.  This was an extraordinary woman who left much earlier than she should have left this Earth, but she left behind a legacy of the truest of professionalism and one that will be missed.
