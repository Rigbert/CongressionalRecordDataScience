 Speaker, even though this is the richest and most productive nation in the history of the world, hunger is still a major problem in the United States. In my State of Vermont alone, 55,000 households are living in poverty. In Vermont, many of these people find that the existence of food shelves provides the final protection to keep them from sinking into malnutrition and even starvation. Of those who go to food shelves, almost one out of four is elderly and over half are families with children. Most of these are working families. It is a terrible fact that 21,000 children under the age of 12 either go hungry or are at risk of hunger in Vermont. The situation is so severe that nationwide, over 29 percent of households that received emergency food last year literally had to choose between paying for food or paying for medical care.  Clearly our Nation's governmental policies are entirely wrong, placing as they do tax breaks for the wealthy and corporate welfare as high priorities, and ignoring the need to feed the hungry, guarantee health care to all, support the construction of affordable housing, and make college available to those who wish to attend. We need to change our skewed priorities which, rather than to making life better and more secure for the vast majority of Americans, lead to the increasing gap between rich and poor, and to ever-increasing economic pressures faced by the middle class.  But while we struggle to change the United States, to make it into a more just and equitable society, we also need to make sure that no American goes hungry.  I want to commend, today, the Vermont Foodbank for its years of exemplary service to fighting hunger. The Vermont Foodbank serves food shelves, community kitchens, homeless shelters, domestic abuse programs and programs which provide services for the elderly and children. Well over 100,000 people are served through Foodbank's network of 295 agencies each year. From its building in Barre, the Foodbank supplies agencies and NGOs all over Vermont with food for those who are hungry. It is greatly assisted in its work by hundreds of volunteers, who contributed over 23,000 hours--over 11 years of work weeks--in just the past year alone.  The Vermont Foodbank helps assure that none among us go hungry, that every community group and agency that seeks to combat hunger has a resource upon which it can call. It, together with our many community food banks, the Vermont Campaign to End Childhood Hunger, the work of shelters, the Salvation Army, churches, and countless other groups, is doing essential, life-sustaining work in throughout our State.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Pages E4-E5]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                     VERMONT FOODBANK FIGHTS HUNGER                                 ______                                                           HON.
