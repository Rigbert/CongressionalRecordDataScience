Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me and urge Members to vote no on the rule; among other reasons, because it has a self-executing procedure that denies us an opportunity to debate WIC.  It is not a bipartisan effort. It does not allow us to fully consider what is being done in the bill to tap NASA funds and shift those dollars to other places. I find it amusing but sad that there are some who are trying to hold this baby close to their breast but they were nowhere to be seen when the babies were dying in subcommittee and full committee.
