Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I was listening to the gentleman speak on the issue about the needs for a user fee, and he is absolutely right. Again, I hope the American public will speak out, because every day that it goes up higher, I believe last year it was $2.55 for the premium gas, it is now $2.25 for regular, none of that goes into the highway construction. It goes overseas. Unless people like supporting those countries who are not friendly to us, those countries that take our dollars and use them for terrorism purposes, maybe unknowingly, I hope the American public will wake up and say enough is enough. If we have to spend this on fuel, then let us spend it in America.  So I compliment the gentleman for his comments and the concept that we will continue to talk about, which are the needs. Again, I want to stress, not the ``wants,'' contrary to what you may read, but the ``needs.'' So I do compliment the gentleman.
