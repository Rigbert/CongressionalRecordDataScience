I am for IPAB. I will say it again. I know it is politically very controversial. It is a tough thing to do, but it helps pay for what we buy. And the problem in this House and the problem that we just did on the tax bill is we are not paying for what we buy. It is not spend-spend or tax-tax. We do not pay for what we buy. It is easy to buy and it is hard to pay. Here we are with another example.  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Let me repeat what happened on this floor in history.  Twice, this bill has come to the floor. Neither time--the repealing of IPAB--has it been offset. And do you know what? Forty-three Members on your side of the aisle joined with us. So it was the will of this House, a majority.  But if your argument is why we cannot fund children's health, why we cannot say that millionaires winning a lottery have to stay on Medicaid, if that is the defense from the other side of the aisle why they walk away from the table, I am ashamed. We are better than that, and this House is better than that.  I told you each time--and I tell the gentleman, I know it is not you, but there are other people on your side of the aisle who won't even release their Members from committee.                              {time}  1130  I know your members on the Energy and Commerce Committee did not want to vote ``no'' on that amendment. They don't want to defend those millionaires for being on Medicaid and taking away from the disabled and children. I know, in your heart, you don't want to sit back and make CHIP have problems for States, that maybeMinnesota and Colorado can't increase enrollment, that they have to freeze it today.  We are better than this. If twice it has come to the floor without an offset, and it is the majority of the House that voted on it and it is 43 of your members doing it, I think we should move on now. Let's get back to the table. Let's solve this problem.
