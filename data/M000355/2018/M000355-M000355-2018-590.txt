 President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by the majority leader in consultation with the Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 549, S. 2554, and that Senator Lee or his designee be recognized to call up amendment No. 4011; that there be 1 hour of debate equally divided; that upon the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate vote on adoption of the Lee amendment No. 4011 without intervening action or debate; and that upon disposition of the Lee amendment, S. 2554 be read a third time and the Senate vote on the bill as amended, if amended.
