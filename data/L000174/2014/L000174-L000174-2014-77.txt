President, a common reality that permeates the complex and colorful history of Latin America is large numbers of landless, impoverished people and small elites who control the majority of the land and the country's wealth, often exploiting its natural resources for personal gain.  While the significant growth of the middle class in some South American countries over the past decade is encouraging, nowhere is the disparity of land ownership more pronounced than in Paraguay, a landlocked country of 6.5 million people that rarely receives the attention of the U.S. Congress.  A few statistics tell the story. Some 80 percent of agricultural land in Paraguay is owned by just 1.6 percent of the landowners, and the 600 largest properties comprise 40 percent of the total productive land. Meanwhile, a third of a million small farmers have no land at all. It should surprise no one that 40percent of the country's population lives in poverty and that land, wealth, and political power are concentrated in the hands of a few.  The conflict over land in Paraguay, which dates back hundreds of years, has grown even worse due to the expansion of mechanized soy production, primarily for export. Government policies, including tax breaks, access to credit, and weak environmental and labor regulations, have favored large corporate farms which are often foreign owned, over local family farms that receive little if any government support.  As we have seen in many other Latin countries, the Paraguayan Government has used the army, police, and judicial inaction or bias to protect the interests of the large landowners.  The 35 year dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner ended in 1989. He ruled under a state of siege, imprisoned and tortured political opponents, and reportedly gave away or sold for a pittance 20 percent of the country's land to friends of his regime. Paraguay is slowly moving beyond the Stroessner years, but since 1989 more than 130 small farmers who have tried to defend their rights under the agrarian reform law have reportedly been killed.  I mention this bit of history to put into context what happened on June 15, 2012. According to information I have received, on that day several hundred police officers forcibly evicted a group of about 60 landless farmers who were occupying an area known as Marina Kue in eastern Paraguay. In the ensuing violence, eleven farmers and six police officers were killed and others injured from the gunfire. There has apparently been no investigation of the conduct of the police, despite the existence of published reports about human rights abuses, but all the farmers were charged with crimes.  This case offers the Paraguayan Government an important opportunity to conduct a thorough, independent investigation of the events of June 15, prosecute and punish those responsible for the killings and injuries of the farmers and police officers, and enable poor farmers in that community to acquire legal rights to land and put it to productive use to feed their families.  I understand that the Paraguayan Government recently began working to reach an agreement with the affected communities regarding the land dispute prior to the beginning of the trial of the farmers later this month. This is encouraging news, and it could be a turning point if it results in a thorough, independent investigation and prosecution of those responsible and a just resolution of the dispute.  Paraguay and the United States, while separated by more than 4,000 miles, share many interests. As chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on the Department of State and Foreign Operations that funds U.S. foreign assistance programs, I have supported programs to help Paraguay strengthen its democratic institutions, promote efficiency and transparency, and promote equitable economic development. I also supported the funding for the Millennium Challenge Corporation's Threshold Program in Paraguay.  There will be other ways the United States can help Paraguay build the capacity and accountability of its public sector, expand its economy, and sustainably manage its natural resources. Few things would do more to advance these goals, and improve social stability, than addressing what happened at Marina Kue and providing access to land for Paraguay's small farmers. I am aware that several other Members of Congress are sending a letter to President Horacio Cartes urging these steps, and I look forward to his response.                          ____________________
