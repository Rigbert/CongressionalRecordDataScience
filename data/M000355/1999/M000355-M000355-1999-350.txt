 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Male High School's Championship Football team in Louisville, Kentucky on the occasion of their annual awards banquet.  The Male High School Bulldogs have long held a reputation for excellence in Kentucky and throughout the nation. With the leadership of The Bluegrass State's finest high school football coach, Bobby Redman, it's no wonder the team has gone so far. It is clear to players, parents, coaches and students alike when they see Bobby on the field with his team that his heart and soul are rooted in Bulldogs football. Bobby's marked dedication to his team and his school are admirable, and I'm certain my feelings are shared by the entire Male family.  Tonight I congratulate you, the Male High School football team, on your commitment to excellence both on the field and in the classroom, and thank you for working so hard to continue giving high school football in Louisville an honorable name. Players become great because of their hard work and commitment to themselves and their team. You have each spent countless hours before and after school lifting weights, memorizing plays, and practicing and preparing for games. You have each spent Friday afternoons at pep rallys getting ready for evening games, felt the stress of wanting to play your best and win, and experienced the emotional high as you finally rush the field. You have dedicated your high school careers to Male and to its football team, and my colleagues and I commend you.  Not only is Male High School known for their powerhouse of a football team, most recently leading the Bulldogs to victory as 1998-99 4-A State Champions, but they also are known for their commitment to academic success. Male has been recognized as a National Exemplary School twice in recent years by the United States Department of Education, and has received the Flag of Excellence by the State of Kentucky for consistently high academic achievement. Ninety percent of Male graduates continue their education at colleges and universities, and many of them receive partial or full scholarships to attend. It is commendable that students so profoundly talented on the football field are also concerned about their academic achievements.  I am certain that the legacy of excellence that Male High School football players and coaches have left will continue on, and will encourage and inspire others toward that same goal. On behalf of myself and my colleagues, thank you for your contribution to the Louisville community, the State of Kentucky, and to our great nation.                          ____________________
