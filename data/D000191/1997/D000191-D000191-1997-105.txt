  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the fix is in. The American people are not yet aware of it. If we look on the front page of the Washington Post we see it: ``Greenspan Backs Panel to Rule on Inflation Levels.''  The dirty little back room deal that is about to be cut here between the White House and the Republican leadership is to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy, capital gains, business as usual at the Pentagon, and still balance the budget.  How do we do that? We do that through the magic of the CPI. We define away inflation and tell those seniors whose cost of health care is doubling at twice the rate of inflation every year, oh, it is better. It might cost more, you might not be able to afford it, but we are going to reduce your cost of living because it is better health care; that does not count as inflation.  We are going to say to the middle class whose taxes are going to go up if they lose indexation, oh well, yes, your taxes went up, but you know, that is because inflation does not really exist.  If inflation does not really exist, why are Alan Greenspan and the other members of the Federal Reserve Board paying themselves and their staff healthy 5 and 6 percent salary increases every year? That must not have anything to do with inflation.  It is time to play straight with the American people. Let us not politicize the CPI and stick it to seniors, the middle class, and children once again.                          ____________________
