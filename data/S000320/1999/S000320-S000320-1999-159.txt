 President, today the Senate will immediately begin 1 hour of debate on the Wyden amendments Nos. 1625 and 1626, both regarding airline reporting. Votes on those amendments have been scheduled to occur at 11 a.m. Further amendments to the Transportation appropriations bill are anticipated. Therefore, Senators may expect votes throughout the day. It is hoped, however, that Senators who have amendments will work with the chairman and the ranking member to schedule the offering of their amendments in a timely manner so we can expedite this bill. Today the Senate may also resume consideration of the Interior appropriations bill in an attempt to complete action on the bill.                          ____________________
