Mr. Speaker, during the Korean War, a war often forgotten by U.S. history books, many brave soldiers fought and sacrificed their lives in battles waged in brutal fighting conditions. In one such battle, American forces were surprised by an overwhelming Chinese military force at Jangjin Lake, also known as the Chosin Reservoir. From November 27 to December 13, 1950, these courageous American soldiers, including the 1st Marine Division, fought bravely to free themselves from Chinese encirclement and certain capture or death. Following this great battle, seventeen allied soldiers received the Congressional Medal of Honor, the highest honor this Nation can bestow upon a soldier, and more than seventy soldiers were awarded the Navy Cross.  In honor of these brave soldiers, and at the request of two of my constituents, Richard Lilly of Wasilla, Alaska, and John Beasley of Palmer, Alaska, I recently introduced a bill to name one of the mountains in the Alaska Chugach National Forest after this monumental battle. This bill, H.R. 5928, the Mount Chosin Few Act, was intended to show support for the naming of this mountain, a mountain which would forever commemorate the 3,000 killed and 13,000 wounded American service members in the Battle of Chosin Reservoir.  On June 15, 2012, the Board of Geographic Names (BGN), independent of my legislation, acted on an existing request from Mr. Lilly and Mr. Beasley, to name Mount Chosin Few. This action was entirely within the Board's existing legal authority to address new name proposals. I am pleased that the BGN voted unanimously to name this mountain and, in doing so, honor those who fought and died, not just in this one battle, but during the entire Korean War.  Recently however, I have learned of some concerns regarding the origin of the name, Chosin Reservoir and its American colloquial roots. In 1950s, the United Nations provided U.S. soldiers with Japanese maps of the Korean Peninsula, as Korean maps were not available. Due to the use of Japanese maps, U.S. forces and U.S. news sources used the Japanese name ``Chosin,'' instead of the Korean name ``Jangjin,'' to describe the body of water around which this great battle was waged. Consequently, given the great heroics of this battle and the play on words between ``chosen'' and ``Chosin,'' the Battle at Jangjin Lake has been known, by most Americans, as the Battle of Chosin Reservoir. Additionally, the media-friendly nicknames stemming from this battle, such as ``Frozen Chosin'' and ``The Chosin Few,'' have also been adopted into American history.  Please know that I understand and appreciate the concerns of the Korean people and government about the difference in the names ``Jangin Lake'' and ``Chosin Reservoir.'' Such cultural sensitivities are significant and remind us of the amazingly complex differences that exist not only within ethnicities and countries, but also within individual people as well. In themelting pot of the United States, it can be easy to overlook these differences, as cultures blend and become more homogenized.  While cultural sensitivity is important, I also recognize the significance that my constituents, and all those who fought in this battle, attach to the name ``Chosin.'' This is the name that evokes images in their minds of relentless cold and even more relentless fighting. I believe their sacrifice has earned them the gratitude of both of our nations and the right to name a mountain in Alaska whatever name they believe will most appropriately honor their fallen comrades. I hope the Korean government, and the people they serve, understand that the sacrifices made by those who have fought and died in the name of freedom are far more meaningful than the origin of the name of a mountain in Alaska.                          ____________________
