 President, I rise today to recognize the impressive accomplishments of a remarkable woman and native of the Commonwealth, Lieutenant Anna Dixon of the U.S. Coast Guard. Lieutenant Dixon has always possessed an adventurous spirit and harbored a desire to expand her horizons and explore the possibilities of the world outside of her hometown of Barbourville, KY. So it came as no surprise to those who know her that upon graduating from Barbourville High School and attending the University of Kentucky to study architecture for a year, Lieutenant Dixon decided to take advantage of an exchange program and follow her dream of becoming a marine biologist at Coastal Carolina College in Myrtle Beach, SC.  Upon graduating with her degree in marine science and working at an environmental testing lab, Lieutenant Dixon decided to take another adventurous and courageous leap and enlist in the U.S. Coast Guard. Lieutenant Dixon not only completed her basic training at Camp May, NJ, in August of 2004, but also graduated at the top of her class and was assigned to the Coast Guard Station in Long Beach, CA, where she remained for 2 years.  In the years that followed, this bright and determined woman worked tirelessly to qualify for numerous positions within the U.S. Coast Guard, including Officer Candidate School where she graduated third in her class, as a patroller on the Coast Guard Cutter Spencer, and as Chief of Contingency Preparedness at the Coast Guard Station in Key West, FL. Most recently, Lieutenant Dixon was assigned the duties of public information officer for the Florida Keys response to the Deepwater Horizon oilspill, and was hand-selected to be the lead advance officer and deputy press secretary for now-retired National Incident Commander Admiral Thad Allen of the U.S. Coast Guard.  During her time in the post from July to October of 2010, Lieutenant Dixon worked steadfastly to coordinate daily national press conferences for Admiral Allen and other high-ranking national leader, to make sure information on one of the Nation's most devastating offshore disasters was delivered in a timely and accurate manner. Because of her strong sense of leadership and her eye for detail, Lieutenant Dixon was selected by a board of Coast Guard officers to attend a fully funded graduate program to further her experience in communications and public relations, as well as to complete a follow-on tour as a public affairs officer for a multistate Coast Guard district.  It is unquestionable that Lieutenant Dixon's career successes, including her recent change in rank, have come with much sacrifice, but have been well-deserved. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the accomplishments of LT Anna Dixon, and in sending congratulations to her proud parents Katy Jones and Bill Matt Dixon, and stepparents Michael Jones and Kay Dixon. I wish Lieutenant Dixon continued success for the future.  The Mountain Advocate recently published a story about Lieutenant Dixon and her successful career. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From Mountain Advocate, Jan. 6, 2011]                           (By Eddie Arnold)                       Just Call Her `Lieutenant'       When Anna Dixon graduated from Barbourville High School in      1998, she had dreams of being a marine biologist. However,      with the nearest ocean hundreds of miles away, pursuing such      a career seemed even unlikely.       Little did she know that working in and around oceans is      something that she would eventually do--not as a marine      biologist but as a member of the United States Coast Guard.       Even more ironic is that she never even considered the      military as a young girl. ``I never even thought about it,''      she said.       After one year at the University of Kentucky as a student      of architecture. she chose to take advantage of an exchange      program and moved to South Carolina, where she graduated from      the Coastal Carolina College in Myrtle Beach with a B.S.      degree in marine science.       ``There are very few jobs for marine biologists that don't      have an advanced degree,'' she said. It was then that her      best friend's husband, who was in the Army, suggested that      she consider the Coast Guard. ``I didn't even know what that      was, I thought they were water cops.''       However, the suggestion planted a seed in Dixon's mind.      ``At first it was a joke. But the more I joked about it, the      more I thought maybe it's not that bad of an idea,'' she      said.       After graduation and while living in Savannah, Dixon worked      at an environmental testing lab. ``It was like real      chemistry, but I could tell that was what I would be doing      forever if I didn't make a change and go out on a limb. So I      went and talked with a recruiter,'' she said, adding that she      made the decision to enlist. ``It sounded like a really good      idea.''       Dixon graduated from basic training at Cape May, New Jersey      at the top of her class in August 2004. After going on to      Boatswain's Mate ``A'' School training, she was assigned to      the Coast Guard Station Los Angeles/Long Beach where she      remained from December 2004 to March 2006.       ``I worked really hard and got qualified as quickly as I      could and got recommended to go to Officer Candidate School,      where she graduated third in her class.       From there, she went to a ship--the Coast Guard Cutter      Spencer out of Boston, Massachusetts.       ``I never wanted to do ship life.'' she said. ``But I      thought if I didn't do it then. I would never get the chance      to do it.''       During her two years aboard ship, they patrolled from the      northeast coast off Canada all the way down to the Caribbean,      including doing migrant patrols.       Even though Dixon said she learned a lot on that      assignment, she longed to get her feet back on dry land. When      she applied for a new assignment, she noticed that Key West      was available. ``I thought to myself there's no way I'm going      to get that. There will be thirty other people in line for      that. When I learned that I had got it, I was off the coast      of Canada. It was like eight degrees,'' she said. ``At three      o'clock in the morning I got an email saying I was going to      Key West.''       Being a female presented it's own set of challenges for      Dixon. ``During my whole time in the Coast Guard it has been      a challenge no matter where I go. But within a month, they      find out that I am for real. But I've never had any real      problems,'' she said.       Since being assigned at Key West through the present,      Dixon's job as Chief of Contingency Preparedness has posed      challenges also.       In April of this year she was assigned the duties of public      information officer for the Florida Keys response to the      Deepwater Horizon oil spill.       ``Since I've been doing that it has been a full-time      thing,'' she said. ``But I am still the chief of planning.       Dixon was hand-selected to be the Lead Advance Officer and      Deputy Press Secretary for National Incident Commander      Admiral Thad Allen (USCG-Ret.), a job she held from July      through October of this year.       During her time in the post, she coordinated daily      national-level press conferences for Allen and other high-     ranking national leaders including Dr. Lane Lubchenco,      Director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric      Administration.       Although she has enjoyed her duty assignments so far, Dixon      said she is looking forward to the next level in her career.       ``I have been selected by a board of Coast Guard officers      to attend a fully-funded graduate program to study      communications and public relations, with a follow-on tour as      a Public Affairs Officer for an entire multi-state Coast      Guard district,'' she said.       Dixon, who was recently promoted to the rank of lieutenant,      said she has enjoyed her six plus years in the Coast Guard.      ``I didn't know what to expect when I went in but I      definitely didn't expect to live in eight states and have all      these different experiences. It has been unbelievable,'' she      said, adding that her family and friends are really proud of      me.       ``My friends laugh because they say `Anna is in charge of      things?' They don't see me as Lt. Dixon, they just see me as      Anna. But they are all super proud of me.''       Over the holidays, she came home to spend some time with      her family, including her parents Katy and Michael Jones of      Corbin, Bill and Kay Dixon of Barbourville, and brothers John      W. Dixon and Matthew Dixon.                          ____________________
