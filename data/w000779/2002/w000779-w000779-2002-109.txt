President, I commend the Senator from Nevada for the excellent statement on the importance of renewable energy. He and Senator Jeffords have really made the case.  I want it understood that I very much share Senator Reid's views with respect to renewable energy. He and Senator Jeffords have really been our leaders.  This amendment has been cleared on both sides of the aisle.  As I begin my remarks, I would especially like to express my appreciation to Senators Bingaman, Murkowski, Leahy, and Hatch. All of them have been very gracious in terms of working with me on this issue.  This amendment would establish within the Department of Justice the Office of Consumer Advocacy. This is especially important right now because our Nation's electric power system is undergoing dramatic changes. New sources of power are produced by State-regulated utility companies. Unregulated power marketers are providing an increasing share of new power generation in this country.  At the State level, many States--in fact, the majority of the States--have put in place consumer advocates whose job it is to stand up for the energy ratepayer. The fact is that across this country, in the last year, America's energy consumers--particularly senior citizens and small businesses--have many millions of dollars taken from their pockets. The fact is that the Federal Government really is not in a position to deal with many of the rate hikes, nor are the State governments, because much of this activity relates to energy trading and energy activity that is interstate in nature.  We have the States across the country trying to stand up for the ratepayer. Many of the legislatures have created these consumer advocates that monitor energy prices to make sure the State-regulated utilities are charging fair rates. But when power is being traded like pork bellies and so much of the energy business has moved interstate, the State advocates have no way to investigate or address the wholesale power prices that eventually raise retail consumer rates and that are spawned by interstate activity.  What I am proposing in this legislation--which is a part of what my colleagues, Senators Bingaman, Murkowski, Hatch, and Leahy, have already made clear--is that we will continue to refine this bill as we go through the legislative process, and we will create a Federal advocate for the energy consumer. That advocate at the Department of Justice will have the authority to address the interstate trading of wholesale power and to spotlight unfair wholesale price hikes before they get to the State-regulated utilities and their retail ratepayers.  My view is that consumer advocates provide an independent watchdog over a variety of important issues that come before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and a number of agencies that affect energy policy and the American consumer.  Power, of course, used to be produced and sold by State-regulated utilities. Those advocates were able to watchdog the entire process. But today, with State advocates being forced to rubberstamp a lot of these electric rate increases caused by spikes in interstate wholesale prices, consumers are more vulnerable than ever before. The purpose of this amendment is to close the gap which is leaving consumers unprotected from wholesale wheeling and dealing.  When prices spike in the wholesale energy market, the fact is that our States and public utility commissions really do not have the authority to challenge these rate increases due to increased wholesale prices. But the Federal consumer advocate could ask for protection of consumer interests. If the increases weren't just and reasonable, the advocates could represent the consumer in a complaint before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, challenging those prices.  Some may say as they consider this issue that there really isn't a need for a Federal advocate, that utilities and other buyers of energy can bring cases on their own at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission if someone is manipulating the market. But that approach won't work when the buyer of energy is the utility owned by an energy marketer. The utility isn't going to bring a case at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission against its parent company.  In cases where a utility engages in transactions with the parent company, the consumer advocate can independently investigate to make sure the utility ratepayers are not harmed by deals which enrich the parent company at the expense of the utility and its ratepayers.  A number of organizations support this legislation. I want to take a minute to particularly commend the American Association of Retired Persons. I have worked with them on these issues, going back to my days when I was codirector of the Oregon Gray Panthers and ran a voluntary legal aid program for the elderly. They have pulled together a grassroots juggernaut on behalf of this effort involving the public interest--research organizations, State associations of advocates for ratepayers, and the ones that I think do a very good job given the limited tools they have today.  I ask unanimous consent that a set of letters endorsing this amendment be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                Washington DC,                                                February 28, 2002.       Dear Senator: As the Senate begins consideration of S. 517,      the comprehensive energy bill, we urge you to support several      amendments that would protect consumers, especially as      electricity markets continue to be deregulated.       First, Senator Wyden will likely be introducing an      amendment to create an Office of Consumer Advocacy to handle      energy issues within the Department of Justice (DOJ). This      new office will represent the interests of consumers within      the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), before the      courts and in front of Congress. Having an independent energy      ombudsman within DOJ will provide important protections for      consumers as FERC continues to deregulate the electricity      market. Nothing demonstrates the need for this office more      than the price spikes and blackouts in the western      electricity market in 2000-2001. Moreover, the office will      serve to protect consumers as FERC performs its general day-     to-day energy sector oversight functions, which will become      ever more crucial as the growing Enron scandal unfolds and      efforts are made to provide greater oversight of energy      trading markets.       With regard to the energy trading markets, Senator      Feinstein is planning to address regulatory shortcomings made      evident by Enron's collapse through an amendment that would      provide for regulatory oversight by the Commodity Futures      Trading Commission (CFTC) of derivative transactions on      energy commodities. This would ensure that energy traders      cannot operate without appropriate federal oversight that      makes market transactions transparent. Given that it was the      CFTC that initially allowed these types of transactions to      escape scrutiny, it is important that Congress be explicitly      clear in this legislation regarding what it expects of the      CFTC in closing this loophole. In addition, we believe that      it would be appropriate for FERC to have a greater role in      this area as its primary concern should be the stability of      the nation's energy markets, while the CFTC is set up to      protect investors.       To further address the market problems that have become      clear in the wake of the western electricity crisis, Senator      Cantwell is planing to offer an amendment that would direct      FERC to define precisely what a competitive market is and      establish rules for when market-based rates will be      permitted. In addition, the amendment would put in place      market monitoring procedures so that FERC can better detect      problems, before they lead to a complete breakdown in the      market, and give FERC more authority to take action to      protect consumers when the market is failing. This change is      necessary to ensure that electricity suppliers do not      continue to manipulate the market to the detriment of      consumers, as was seen in the western market in 2000-2001.       S. 517 would simply repeal the Public Utility Holding      Company Act (PUHCA) in its entirety, including consumer      protections that have been in place for decades. Now, more      than ever, it is clear that these protections are absolutely      necessary. We believe that regulators could have used their      authority under PUHCA to prevent some of the abuses that have      come to light in the Enron debacle. If there are going to be      amendments to PUHCA to make it more relevant to today's      situation, then Congress must take affirmative steps to      ensure that PUHCA's consumer     protection provisions remain in force, and where necessary      are strengthened. For example, Senator Wyden will likely      offer an amendment, which we support, to require that      transactions between utilities and their affiliates be      transparent, and to shield consumers from the costs and      risks of interaffiliate transactions. The amendment would      provide for: Streamlined FERC review of utility      diversification efforts to ensure that there is      appropriate regulatory oversight so that consumers are not      the victims of abusive affiliate transactions; and      structural limits on affiliate transactions to protect not      only consumers, but unaffiliated competitors as well.       Finally, Senators Dayton and Conrad are planning to offer      an amendment that would ensure that mergers in the energy      sector ``promote the public interest,'' based on objective      criteria that would be evaluated by FERC. Under current law,      all that is necessary for merger approval is a determination      that the merger is ``consistent with the public interest.''      Given the wave of mergers sweeping through the electric      industry, and the collapse of meaningful competition in      California and other states, we believe that a more      protective standard than the current one is necessary to      adequately protect consumers from abuse. FERC must hold the      public interest paramount in evaluating any potential energy      company mergers. The Dayton/Conrad amendment would: Establish      criteria for FERC to consider in order to determine that a      merger would ``promote the public interest,'' including      efficiency gains, impact on competition, and its ability to      effectively regulate the industry; clarify that these      provisions would apply to all potential financial      arrangements (not just stock acquisitions) which could lead      to exertion of control over the entity, including      partnerships; and clarify that FERC review applies to all      electric and gas combinations.       We would also like to reiterate our organizations' support      for Senator Jeffords' efforts to include a national renewable      portfolio standard in the legislation, which would help      diversify our energy mix and avoid future energy shortages      and price spikes. We also support the Kerry/Hollings      provision in the legislation to raise the national corporate      average fuel economy (CAFE) standards, which will likewise      help to provide energy security and protect the environment.      In addition, we urge you to oppose efforts that will damage a      pristine Alaskan ecosystem, supposedly in the name of energy      security--the supply is too limited, the environment too      fragile, and the costs too high.       Thank you for considering the needs and concerns of      consumers while moving forward with this legislation. Please      do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or      need any information regarding how this comprehensive energy      package will affect consumers.           Sincerely,     Adam J. Goldberg,       Policy Analyst, Consumers Union.     Mark N. Cooper,       Director of Research, Consumer Federation of America.     Anna Aurelio,       Legislative Director, U.S. PIRG.                                  ____                                           National Association of                             State Utility Consumer Advocates,                                 Silver Spring, MD, March 5, 2002.     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S.          Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Bingaman: I am writing to express the      National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates      strong support for an amendment we expect to be offered by      Senator Wyden establishing an Office of Consumer Advocacy in      the Department of Justice.       Restructuring experiences in the states have consistently      shown that the road to competition is a rocky one. In many      instances, consumers have faced higher prices and limited, if      any, choices. State consumer advocate offices have worked      diligently to protect consumers during this difficult      transition.       However, they have found their limited resources (half of      our members' budgets are $1 million or less with less than 10      employees) stretched to the limit, particularly as wholesale      prices set by FERC in Washington increasingly determine what      consumers ultimately pay back home. Most consumer advocate      offices simply do not have the resources to fight in both      venues.       An Office of Consumer Advocacy would give residential      consumers much needed representation in Washington and a      fighting chance to benefit from legislation passed by      Congress. We urge you to support this critical amendment.       Thank you for your leadership to enact comprehensive energy      legislation.           Sincerely,                                               Charles A. Acquard,                                               Executive Director.
