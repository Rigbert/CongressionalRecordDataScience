President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Baucus, who I know has a unanimous consent request to make at this time--and then I could follow him for my remarks--I would like to let Senator Baucus make his unanimous consent request at this time, and then per my unanimous consent request, when Senator Baucus has completed, I would then make my remarks.
