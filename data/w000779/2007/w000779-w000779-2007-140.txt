To see so many young people taken from us with their lives ahead of them is an unspeakable horror, one that words simply cannot capture.  Oregonians saw a horrible school shooting in 1998, and I know that across my State, Oregonians this afternoon are sending their prayers to the Virginia Tech community. I join with those Oregonians in sending our prayers to the Virginia Tech family, and on behalf of the people of my State, I want those at Virginia Tech to know they are in our hearts and minds at this critical hour and during this time of unspeakable tragedy.
