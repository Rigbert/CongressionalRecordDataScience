Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I would begin by saying that I support passage of H.R. 4060, the appropriation measure funding the energy and water projects for the United States of America for the next fiscal year.  I particularly want to point out at this moment my particular regard for three of the members of the subcommittee who will not be with us next year because of retirements. First of all, the yeoman's service the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Parker) has provided to the subcommittee over years. I appreciate all of his efforts and the contributions that he has made.  Secondly, I want to also thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Fazio) for all that he has done for his country, for this institution, for the committee on which we serve. The reason I am here today is the gentleman from California (Mr. Fazio) is about the business of this government doing the agriculture appropriation conference for the committee.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, I think it is a tremendous coincidence for me personally that the first bill that I will manage for the Democratic side will, as I would understand it, be the last bill that the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. McDade) will be managing on the Republican side.  Having met the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. McDade) in 1977 as a member of a congressional staff, I must say that I am honored by the pure coincidence and great privilege that this is the gentleman's last bill and my first. It is a moment that I will remember forever, and also the gentleman's friendship.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr. McDADE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Knollenberg), a valued member of our subcommittee.
