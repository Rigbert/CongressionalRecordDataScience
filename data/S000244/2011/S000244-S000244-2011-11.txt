 Madam Chair, section 3 of this bill creates a first-to-file patent system. The sponsors believe that the United States should harmonize with other countries' first-to-file systems. There's no reason to do that.  Our patent system is the strongest in the world, and it's based upon the first recognition of the Constitution in any country that inventors should be protected. I think that the Constitution empowers Congress to give patents only to inventors. We had a significant constitutional argument on this issue yesterday. If the amendment is not adopted, the issue will be litigated all the way up to the Supreme Court.  The current first-to-invent system has been key in encouraging entrepreneurial innovation and evens the playing field for individual inventors who are not represented by a major industry. The first-inventor-to-file system violates the Constitution because it would award a patent to the winner of the race to the PTO and not the actual inventor who makes the first discovery.  If we change to a first-to-file system, inventors who believe they do not have sufficient resources to win the race to the PTO will not have any motivation at all to continue developing the new invention. This will stifle innovation, and given the current state of our economy, that's the last thing we need.  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.
