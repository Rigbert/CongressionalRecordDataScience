 President, I oppose this amendment. And what troubles me most about the amendment is that it unnecessarily carves out privatization of particular service sectors from negotiations. These service categories include national security, Social Security, public health and safety, and education, as well as other significant public services.  This language is so broad that it could be used by our trading partners to close off market access to U.S. service exports. This situation could be especially troublesome in the telecommunications sector where many of our trading partners maintain government-owned telecom companies.  Including this language, which is very sweeping, in the trade promotion authority bill could severely undermine our ability to open these markets. That is why I ask my colleagues to reject the amendment.  Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.
