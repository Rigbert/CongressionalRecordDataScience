President, I compliment the Senator from Tennessee for what he said. He is a very thoughtful Senator with great respect for what the Senate's role is in our whole Federal system. We miss him on the Senate Judiciary Committee. I think that can be fairly said by Senators on both sides of the aisle because of his thoughtful involvement and debate. I note that when he was there, he raised similar issues. His voice was one that helped shape the debate. I thank him for it. I compliment him for it.
