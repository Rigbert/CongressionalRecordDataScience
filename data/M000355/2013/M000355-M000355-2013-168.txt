 President, I wish to send my sympathies to the many families in Kentucky affected by a terrible bus accident that occurred yesterday afternoon. A group of Waggener High School students were returning to Louisville after a visit to Eastern Kentucky University when their bus crashed on Interstate 64. Of the 42 people onboard, 34 were taken to area hospitals. Thankfully, news sources report no loss of life. I am going to continue to closely follow the details of this accident.  The people of Kentucky, always generous of spirit, have already responded to this accident with an outpouring of support for the crash victims. I am grateful for that and I am grateful also that this situation was not much worse.                          ____________________
