Mr. Chairman, I thank my good friend for yielding me the time.  Let me just say, Mr. Chairman, that I spoke earlier about some of the other merits of the bill. There will be a very important amendment for Members later on as we consider this bill.  I urge Members to vote ``no'' on the Campbell amendment. The Campbell amendment would provide a $20 million grant to the United Population Fund.  Let me remind everyone that last year the Congress passed and the President signed, albeit reluctantly, legislation that cut off funding to the U.N. Population Fund because of its ongoing complicity with the one-child-per-couple policy in the People's Republic of China, where forced abortion and forced sterilization are commonplace.  The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Barcia) and I are offering an amendment that says that $25 million can proceed if, and only if, the UNFPA has terminated all activities in the PRC or during the 12 months the President can certify that no abortions have been the result of coercion. The issue is coercion.  I would hope that Members would stand with the oppressed women who suffer unspeakable cruelty as a result of the one-child-per-couple policy. Vote ``no'' on the Campbell amendment when we get to it later on.
