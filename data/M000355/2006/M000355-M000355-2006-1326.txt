 President, I rise today in support of the nomination of Samuel A. Alito, Jr., to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. We are familiar with Judge Alito's academic and professional qualifications. He graduated from Princeton and Yale Law School, where he served as editor of its prestigious Law Journal. He spent his life serving his country as a captain in the Army Reserve, as an assistant, and then as U.S. attorney in New Jersey, and for the past 15 years as a distinguished judge on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, to name a few of his qualifications with which we are all quite familiar at this point in the process.  Equally important is his deserved reputation for fairness and for integrity and his measured approach to thelaw.
