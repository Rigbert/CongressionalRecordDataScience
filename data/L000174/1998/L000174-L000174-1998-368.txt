President, on April 30th the people of Israel celebrated their nation's fiftieth anniversary and people around the world commemorated the realization of a dream of a Jewish state first envisioned by Theodor Herzl in 1897. Today, with characteristic courage, intelligence and determination, Israelis face the many challenges that lie ahead.  With the collapse of the former Soviet Union and the ethnic violence that has rocked parts of Europe and Africa,the term ``nation building'' has taken on new significance as we near the end of the millennium. National borders that were static during the Cold War have changed and in some countries the institutions necessary for a functioning government have crumbled. We need only look as far as Israel to realize what can be accomplished with a vision and the will to fulfill it.  In 1948, 600,000 Jews emerged from the Holocaust to forge a nation committed to the ideals of democracy and the prosperity of its people. Having survived the genocide that has since been burned into the world's collective memory, the founders of the Jewish state embarked on a mission to unite a people speaking over 100 languages and dispersed for 2,000 years in 140 countries. At the time it seemed like an impossible challenge, yet today it is a reality that represents one of the greatest, most breathtaking accomplishments of this century.  The founders of Israel did not recognize the obstacles before them as limitations but as opportunities. Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion used to say that a man who does not believe in miracles is not a realistic person. Yet, not even he imagined what could be accomplished in just 50 years.  Despite the toll taken by six wars and innumerable terrorist attacks, despite the difficulties inherent in resurrecting an ancient language and absorbing 2.6 million immigrants, the people of Israel have created a nation at the forefront of technology, industry, art and academics. They have created a nation that embodies democratic principles and practices. They have served as a staunch ally of the United States in the most dangerous region of the world.  On May 15, 1948, when President Truman first declared our nation's support for the free state of Israel, I was eight years old. On that day my father sat me down and, with great emotion, told me what a historic event it was, how important it was to Jews around the world who were struggling to rebuild their lives, reaffirm their identity and heal their communities after years of suffering. His words rang true and they left a lasting impression.  Since then I have traveled to Israel many times. I have had the privilege to know as friends former Prime Ministers Rabin and Perez, two extraordinary courageous leaders. I have seen how the Jewish people have never shied away from adversity, but have faced it fearlessly and with a commitment to overcome. But despite all they have accomplished, much work remains. Many of us will not be here to mark Israel's 100th anniversary. I fervently hope, however, that those who are here to celebrate will be able to recount to their own children and their grandchildren the events that led to a lasting peace for all the citizens of this small but powerful nation.  Mr. President, I offer my congratulations to the people of Israel and reaffirm the bond that President Truman first established in 1948.                          ____________________
