Both sides of the aisle have joined in legislation that we have introduced called the Medicare Home Health Equity Act.  This solves the problem. For one thing, it eliminates another 15-percent cut that is scheduled to go into effect in October of next year. I am sure my friend, the Senator from Kansas, agrees with me if that goes into effect, it will sound the death knell for the remaining home health agencies. That means the ones that have been struggling to hang on will be forced to close their doors or refuse even more services to our senior citizens. This is totally unnecessary because we have already achieved the savings, the targets set by the Balanced Budget Act.  The legislation includes a number of other provisions that affect a lot of the regulatory issues we have discussed today. I think it is absolutely critical we pass this legislation or similar provisions before we go home. I have visited senior citizens in my State who, if they lose their home health services, are going to be forced into nursing homes or hospitals. The irony is that is going to be at far greater cost.
