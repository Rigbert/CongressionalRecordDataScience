 President, today I wish to pay tribute to SGT James Skalberg, Jr., who made the ultimate sacrifice on June 27, in Wardak Province, Afghanistan. James was driving his vehicle when an improvised explosive device detonated, injuring him fatally. My thoughts and prayers go out to his wife, Jessica, his son, Carter, his parents, James and Kelli, and all his other family and friends who are grieving his loss.  Sergeant Skalberg grew up an athlete. He graduated from Nishna Valley High School in Hastings, IA in 2005, and enlisted in the Army in 2007. James deployed to Iraq with his unit in 2008 through 2009 and deployed again to Afghanistan in 2011. His awards and decorations include the Bronze Star Medal, Purple Heart, Army Commendation Medal, Army Achievement Medal, Army Service Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon, Driver's Badge, Air Assault Badge, and Combat Action Badge.  James is remembered by his family as having been loved by everyone for being a gentleman in every respect. He was remembered by teachers and coaches as a star player and caring student. He was carefree, easy going, reliable, levelheaded, and loving. He was a family man who loved his wife since they met as teenagers in high school, and his son, Carter, whom he hoped to one day teach to play basketball.  James was the kind of man we can be proud to call a native son of Iowa. He stood as an example to others in his actions and his character. We owe SGT James Skalberg, and others like him, our most sincere gratitude and appreciation for their willingness to make the ultimate sacrifice for our great country. I call on my colleagues in the Senate and every American to pay tribute to this brave American.                          ____________________
