 President, I will say at the outset I will cease if anyone comes to the floor. I am acting in a bit of a dual capacity here. I am comanaging the bill that is before us. We are waiting for some of our colleagues to come over with amendments. But in the meantime let me before the Senator from Alabama leaves the floor acknowledge and thank him for his acknowledgement of my efforts in this area and thank him for the knowledge he has brought to this body as a former prosecutor, an attorney general in his State, and as a former U.S. attorney running a Federal operation in his State as well, and for the vigor with which he has attacked the obvious problem. It is only of late that most people are acknowledging we should be focusing on juvenile crime. He in his capacity within his State both as a Federal official and a State official has been focused on it for some time. He and I have some outstanding disagreement on how to approach this, but we are substantially in agreement.                          ____________________
