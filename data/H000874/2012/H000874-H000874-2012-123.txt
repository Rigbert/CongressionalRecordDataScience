 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friends in the Congressional Black Caucus for organizing today's Special Order, but as my colleague Mr. Engel and as my colleague on the Republican side and as Dr. Christensen have pointed out, our hearts and thoughts go out to and with those people who by happenstance of going to a movie have lost their lives, have been injured badly, have lost family members, have had the confidence of going out and about in this country put at risk. How we lament that loss of life, that loss of confidence, that loss of a sense of safety in their community.  We need to address that issue--to instill confidence, to restore safety, to ensure that America continues to be a land in which people feel safe.  Mr. Speaker, today, I want to talk about an issue that is central to America, and that is the right to vote. This is an issue that affects millions of Americans from every walk of life, but it will certainly have a disproportional effect on African Americans, Hispanic Americans, seniors, and youth.  In 2008, we saw a record turnout from minority communities and younger voters as more Americans were energized to take part in our democracy. That democracy is our greatest strength, and the principle of ``one person, one vote'' has always been a vehicle for Americans to hold their government accountable and ensure it is responsive to the challenges we face as a Nation. We ought to be building on that progress we made in 2008 by encouraging more Americans to register to vote and cast their ballots. Indeed, in my view, the Nation--States, counties, communities, municipalities--need to be reaching out to people to make sure they know how to vote and to facilitate their votes, not to put stumbling blocks in the way.  It continues to be deeply disturbing to witness a campaign of raising barriers to voting and voter registration by Republican-controlled legislatures in States across this country. My dear friend and colleague, a hero in American history, John Lewis, is a veteran of the fight for voting rights in the fifties and sixties. He carries the scars, both physical and in his memory, of the great effort to secure not just the right to vote but the freedom to exercise that right. That's why he is helping to lead this effort in 2012 to prevent voter suppression and to make certain our elections are open to all who are eligible to participate.  He can attest that today's effort is a continuation of the work he began as a young man. Since the beginning of last year, 22 laws and two executive actions in 17 States have restricted our citizens' right to vote. Civil rights heroes like John Lewis refused to accept barriers to voting in the middle of the 20th century, and all of us--each and every one of us--is here today because we refuse to accept these new restrictions in the 21st century.  That's why many of us introduced the Voter Empowerment Act in May. Our bill strengthens America's democracy by improving our voting system in three key areas: access, integrity, and accountability. It will reauthorize the Election Assistance Commission, create a national voter hotline for reporting problems, allow same-day and online registration, remove obstacles to voting for military personnel, and prohibit deceptive practices that discourage Americans from casting their votes.  Each one of us in this House is opposed to voter fraud. Each one of us is opposed to any voter voting who is noteligible to vote. But very frankly, the good news in America is that is a very, very, very small problem. In fact, when proponents of restrictions are asked to cite examples, they are hard put to do so.  Democrats, Mr. Speaker, are making the issue of voter access a major priority this year, because we believe that all Americans deserve to participate in this year's election and to have their votes counted accurately. We will continue to monitor our voting system and call attention to those who seek to undermine it.                              {time}  1930  Again, I want to thank the Congressional Black Caucus for its work on this critical issue, as well as the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Conyers, who has been such a hero on voting rights throughout his congressional career; the ranking member of the House Administration Committee, Mr. Brady; and the assistant Democratic leader, Mr. Clyburn.  I'm proud that the fight for voter access has attracted a broad coalition of civil rights organizations, as well as the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, and that senior citizen organizations and, yes, representatives of young people are very concerned about the fact that eligible voters are being discouraged and, in some cases, suppressed from exercising their precious American right to vote. Let us never forget that generations have held it to be a moral duty to preserve the most powerful guarantor of our liberty: the right of every American to vote. We continue to stand up for it today, and hopefully each day as we proceed.  Mr. Speaker, I mentioned a couple of times about what Democrats are doing. Let me refer now to an article that appeared in The Washington Post today, written by Charlie Crist, the former Republican Governor of Florida. He says:       As a result of insidious political maneuvers and a lack of      respect for voters, we in Florida have been entangled in      litigation. The courts and the Justice Department have been      required to step in this summer to protect the integrity of      the voting process against a sweeping voter purge that the      Florida Department of State undertook under the guise of      removing non-U.S. citizens from voter rolls.  He goes on to observe:       Among those caught up in this shameless purging and      notified that he was not a U.S. citizen eligible to vote: a      91-year-old World War II veteran, Bill Internicola, who      fought in the Battle of the Bulge, and has proudly exercised      his right to vote for many years.  Governor Crist, the former Republican Governor of Florida, concludes:       The right to choose our leaders is at the heart of what it      means to be an American. Our history books are full of      examples to the contrary. When we send independent observers      to monitor for voter fraud in banana republics, we derive      authority from our self-regard as the ideal. When we hear of      corrupt voting practices in foreign countries, where the      ideal of democracy is nothing more than lip service, we feel      good about ourselves.  He then went on to say, Mr. Speaker:       It's time to look right under our noses. It's happening      here at home. And it's our responsibility to honestly assess      the root of the problem, which requires doing so with as      little partisan bias as we believe belongs in the      administration of our elections.  He concluded with this statement:       We can't be surprised every time it turns out that politics      are involved in politics, but neither can we be silent when      our democracy is threatened in its name.       There are lines that should not be crossed; meddling with      voting rights is one of them. It is un-American, and it is      beneath us.  I thank my friends in the Congressional Black Caucus for their leadership on this issue to make sure that the most precious right that every American has as a birthright is the right to vote. Let us not allow any steps to be taken by the Federal Government, by the State government, by county governments, or, yes, by municipal and local governments from impeding the rights of citizens to speak out in the most powerful way they can: voting.               [From the Washington Post, July 20, 2012]           The Voter ID Mess Subverts an American Birthright                           (By Charlie Crist)       For better or worse, the central principle behind the      unlimited contributions to super PACs that will dominate this      election cycle is simple: Money is speech, and we cannot      limit speech. Yet many who hold this freedom as an article of      faith are all too willing to limit an equally precious form      of speech: voting.       If we don't speak out against these abuses, we may soon      learn the hard way the danger of that double standard. And a      dozen years after the 2000 recount that went all the way to      the U.S. Supreme Court, my state of Florida threatens to be      ground zero one more time.       As Florida's attorney general from 2003 to 2007, I strongly      enforced the laws against illegal voting. When swift action      was necessary, I took it without hesitation. I did so out of      respect for our democracy--voting is a precious right      reserved only for U.S. citizens--but I'm concerned that      zealots overreacting to contrived threats of voter fraud by      significantly narrowing the voting pool are doing so with      brazen disrespect and disregard for our greatest traditions.       As a result of insidious political maneuvers and a lack of      respect for voters, we in Florida have been entangled in      litigation. The courts and the Justice Department have been      required to step in this summer to protect the integrity of      the voting process against a sweeping voter purge that the      Florida Department of State undertook under the guise of      removing non-U.S. citizens from the voter rolls. Among those      caught up in this shameless purging and notified that he was      not a U.S. citizen eligible to vote: a 91-year-old World War      II veteran, Bill Internicola, who fought in the Battle of the      Bulge and has proudly exercised his right to vote for many      years.       This is just the most recent example of a mean-spirited and      all-too-partisan attempt to restrict access to the rolls and      to the polls. A federal court also recently struck down      provisions of a law Florida's legislature passed in 2011,      which put heavy burdens on organizations seeking to help      voters: burdens that the court described as ``harsh and      impractical,'' serving no purpose other than to make it      harder for Americans to participate in the electoral process.       These machinations make a mockery of the democracy we put      on display every Election Day. The right to vote is the key      to that democracy, giving value to the freedom of speech and      making the freedom of religion and the right to assemble      possible. When one takes away another's right to vote, he is      taking dead aim at democracy and undermining the very virtue      that makes us the envy of the world.       Including as many Americans as possible in our electoral      process is the spirit of our country. It is why we have      expanded rights to women and minorities but never legislated      them away, and why we have lowered the voting age but never      raised it. Cynical efforts at voter suppression are driven by      an un-American desire to exclude as many people and silence      as many voices as possible.       Our country has never solved anything with less democracy,      and we're far better off when more citizens can access the      polls--no matter which party mobilizes the most voters to      them. As governor of Florida, I extended voting hours and      increased the number of days people could vote. I also      restored registration rights for felons, years after starting      that effort in the state Senate with a member of the opposite      party.       I was a Republican at the time of those decisions, which      didn't make me many friends on my side. But when you do the      right thing for the people, a political party's concerns roll      off your back quite easily.       The right to choose our leaders is at the heart of what it      means to be an American. Our history books are full of      examples to the contrary. When we send independent observers      to monitor for voter fraud in banana republics, we derive      authority from our self-regard as the ideal. When we hear of      corrupt voting practices in foreign countries, where the      ideal of democracy is nothing more than lip service, we feel      good about ourselves.       It's time to look right under our noses. It's happening      here at home. And it's our responsibility to honestly assess      the root of the problem--which requires doing so with as      little partisan bias as we believe belongs in the      administration of our elections.       We can't be surprised every time it turns out that politics      are involved in our politics. But neither can we be silent      when our democracy is threatened in its name.       There are lines that should not be crossed; meddling with      voting rights is one of them. It is un-American and it is      beneath us.
