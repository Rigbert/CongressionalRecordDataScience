 President, tomorrow we are going to be voting on a very important bill. We will have the opportunity to vote to proceed to a bill that deals with sanctuary cities and immigration policies that are a serious threat to the public safety. We will move to take up the Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect Americans Act--a bill that should put an end to sanctuary jurisdictions, give law enforcement important tools they need to detain criminals, and increase penalties for dangerous and repeat offenders of our immigration laws.  Some of these sanctuary policies are created when a local government unit, such as a city or county executive body, passes an ordinance prohibiting their officers from communicating with Federal immigration and law enforcement officials. Now, there is another way: Some sanctuary policies come about simply because local law enforcement initiates its own policies of providing safe harbor for undocumented immigrants. And then another way: Some sanctuary policies develop because law enforcement officers are afraid they will be sued if they enforce immigration laws and detain an individual for their unlawful immigration status.  In summation, these policies and practices have allowed thousands of dangerous criminals to be released back into the community, and the effects have been disastrous. I am going to speak about those effects. America saw these policies play out in July when Kate Steinle was innocently killed while walking along a San Francisco pier with her father. The murderer, who was illegally in the country and actually deported five times priorto that day, was released into the community by a sanctuary jurisdiction that did not honor the detainer issued by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The suspect in Kate's death admitted he was in San Francisco because of its sanctuary policies. That sums up the problem our bill addresses.  Here is Kate--no longer with us--as one example. I have several other examples because people tried to tell us you should not change policy based upon one murder. Maybe so, maybe not, but 5 years of statistics shows about 121 people killed by people that have been deported for criminal activities in this country and then come back in. I want to tell you what our bill does about that, but I want to first tell you about some examples.  In July, our Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing called ``Oversight of the Administration's Misdirected Immigration Enforcement Policies: Examining the Impact on Public Safety and Honoring the Victims.'' That is the committee's hearing title. This hearing was an opportunity to hear the voices of Americans who have been impacted by these very indefensible policies while also conducting oversight of the administration's policies and tolerance toward sanctuary jurisdictions.  Jim Steinle, Kate's father, expressed his family's desire to see legislation enacted to take undocumented felons off our streets. The committee was very moved by his presence and testimony--obviously something that wasn't very easy for him. He talked about how Kate ``had a special soul, a kind and giving heart, the most contagious laugh, and a smile that would light up a room.'' He told us how she died in his arms that day, despite her plea in her dying words of ``Help me, Dad.'' The suspect in Kate Steinle's murder had seven prior felony convictions and had been deported five times. Yet he was shielded--protected, in other words--by San Francisco's sanctuary policy.  The Kate Steinle story is not a singular case. Too many Americans have lost their lives, and too many families have had to feel the real and devastating impact caused by sanctuary cities and lax enforcement policies.  Our committee heard powerful testimony from families other than Kate Steinle's father. We heard from Mrs. Susan Oliver. She is the widow of Deputy Danny Oliver. This is the family. He was a police officer in Sacramento, CA. Danny was killed while on duty by an illegal immigrant who was previously arrested on two separate occasions for drug-related charges and twice deported. Mrs. Oliver spoke of the daily loss she experiences without her husband in everything from raising her children to the milestones he will miss, including their daughter's upcoming wedding.  We also heard from Michael Ronnebeck, the uncle of Grant Ronnebeck. You are seeing Grant's picture here. Grant was a 21-year-old convenience store clerk who was gunned down earlier this year by an undocumented immigrant. The Obama administration released Grant's alleged murderer, who was in removal proceedings. Grant was born in my State of Iowa but resided in Arizona. He had two brothers and a sister. Mr. Ronnebeck expressed his family's desire to see Grant's legacy be a force for change, imploring us as lawmakers to ``rise above political differences, to set aside personal interests, and to use your resources to make sensible immigration reform a reality in the coming months, with the safety and security of American citizens first and foremost in mind.'' Think of that tomorrow and think of the Ronnebeck family losing their son. They are asking us to keep the safety and security of American citizens first and foremost in our minds.  We also heard from Brian McCann. Mr. McCann's brother, Dennis McCann, was killed in 2011 by a drunk driver who was in the country illegally and driving without a license. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had placed a detainer on the drunk driver, but he was released under Cook County, IL, sanctuary city policies. Mr. McCann expressed his anger at the sanctuary city policies of Cook County, which allowed his brother's killer to be free, and at a system that failed to communicate with him and his family when the suspect was released by the locals.  We also heard from Laura Wilkerson of Pearland, TX, the mother of Josh Wilkerson. Josh was 18 years old when he was murdered by his high school classmate, an undocumented immigrant, after Josh offered him a ride home from school. Josh's murderer was sentenced to life in prison and will be eligible for parole in 30 years. Mrs. Wilkerson spoke of the gentle soul of her son, the brutal torture that he endured, and actually watching an unapologetic 19-year-old brag about his killing skills during trial and talking about how things were done in his country.  These stories are heartbreaking, but nothing has changed. I want to talk about what has happened since Kate's murder. We have seen more fall victim to sanctuary jurisdiction policies.  Shortly after Kate's death, Marilyn Pharis was brutally raped, tortured, and murdered in her home in Santa Maria, CA, by an undocumented immigrant who was released from custody because the county sheriff does not honor Federal enforcement detainers.  A 2-year-old girl was brutally beaten by an undocumented immigrant in San Luis Obispo County, CA. He was released from local custody despite a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainer and an extensive criminal history, and he is still at large.  Margaret Kostelnik was killed by an undocumented immigrant who allegedly attempted to rape a 14-year-old girl and shoot a woman in a nearby park. He was released because Immigration and Customs Enforcement refused to issue a detainer and take custody of that suspect.  These are a very few of the stories that could be told on this Senate floor. There are many more families who are hurting today because of lax immigration policies and the lack of willingness by President Obama's administration to do something about sanctuary cities.  But don't take it from just me. Even the Secretary of Homeland Security acknowledges that sanctuary cities are ``counterproductive to public safety.'' He said these policies were ``unacceptable.'' Yet this administration has not taken demonstrable action to address the unwillingness of sanctuary jurisdictions to work with Federal immigration authorities. More than 12,000 Federal detainer requests were ignored by State and local jurisdictions in 2014.  Moreover, in June of this year, the administration rolled out a new program that reduces the enforcement priorities and announced it would not seek the custody of many criminals who are in the country illegally. This is called the Priority Enforcement Program, PEP for short. That program actually gives sanctuary jurisdictions permission to continue ignoring Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainers. PEP even discourages compliant jurisdictions from further cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement because it now only issues detainers for individuals who are already convicted of certain crimes deemed priorities by the Department of Homeland Security.  Many local jurisdictions want to work with the Federal Government and protect their communities but are frustrated when the administration refuses to work with them. Think of Arizona trying to protect its own citizens from the crimes committed by undocumented immigrants in that State. The State legislature passes laws. The administration goes to court and gets those laws declared contrary to the Constitution or our only immigration laws. Why? Because under the Constitution, one of the 18 powers of Congress happens to be the enforcement or the writing of the immigration laws so they are uniform. So when this administration will not enforce immigration laws in Arizona, and Arizona decides under the Tenth Amendment, under the police powers of the State, to do it for the Federal Government, then it is wrong for that State to do it. But this administration will not take action against the sanctuary cities that are violating the same immigration laws.  I want to continue with some examples where the administration refuses to work with local officials. Sheriff Cummings in Cape Cod, MA, recently explained his frustration with Immigration and Customs Enforcement when an immigrant who had overstayed his visa was arrested for batterywith a dangerous weapon and child pornography. Sheriff Cummings said that when he learned that this individual who had a long criminal history was in the country illegally, he asked Immigration and Customs Enforcement for a Federal immigration detainer ``so that if someone came up with a bail we could then turn him over to ICE and we wouldn't release him back into the community.'' So then what happened? ICE--Immigration and Customs Enforcement--never issued the detainer.  Sheriff Cummings noted that before PEP, immigration authorities would issue a detainer pretty quickly but not anymore. He commented:       It just shows how they've relaxed their policy so there are      more criminal illegal aliens in our communities right now.      Those are the ones I'm concerned with. I'm concerned with the      individuals that have committed crimes. They are here      illegally to begin with and they've committed crimes while      they're here. To me it makes no sense to allow these people      to stay in our communities.  I very much agree. It makes no sense that people who do not belong here and commit crimes are allowed to return to our communities and cause further harm.  Getting back to the bill we will be voting on tomorrow, the Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect America Act addresses the problem of sanctuary jurisdictions in a very commonsense and balanced way. There seems to be consensus that sanctuary jurisdictions should be held accountable, and we do that with the power of the purse. And now I am beginning to explain our bill.  This bill limits the availability of certain Federal grants to cities and States that have sanctuary policies. We limit funding through the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program. This is a grant program run by the Department of Justice that is designed to reimburse part of the cost incurred by local jurisdictions that detain undocumented criminal aliens. Sanctuary cities receive these funds despite their refusal to detain suspects who are wanted by immigration authorities.  In this year alone, California received a total of $44 million in these State Criminal Alien Assistance Program funds even though the State has a sanctuary law. New York City, a sanctuary city, received $11.6 million in taxpayer funding. To fund sanctuary cities with State Criminal Alien Assistance Program money essentially subsidizes these jurisdictions for their lack of cooperation.  As Former Assistant Secretary Morton stated in a letter to Cook County, a well-known sanctuary city, ``It is fundamentally inconsistent for Cook County to request federal reimbursement for the cost of detaining aliens who commit or are charged with crimes while at the same time thwarting ICE's efforts to remove those very same aliens from the United States.''  The bill that will be before us tomorrow morning when we vote responds to this hypocrisy by making sanctuary jurisdictions ineligible for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program. Another grant program limited to sanctuary jurisdictions is the community-oriented policing services or, as it is known around this town and locally, the COPS Program. These grant dollars help fund community-oriented policing programs for local law enforcement agencies. Our bill makes sanctuary jurisdictions ineligible for these taxpayer dollars if they have a policy or practice in place despite the lack of any statute, ordinance, or policy directive from their unit of local government. Finally, the bill limits taxpayer dollars through the community development block grant for sanctuary jurisdictions when a county, city, or State has in effect a statute that clearly defies information sharing as required by Federal law or has a statute that prohibits any government official from complying with a detainer request issued by the Department of Homeland Security. Those are the funding parts of our bill.  In acknowledgement of the bill's fairness in targeting certain grants, the National Sheriffs' Association writes:       The grant penalties you would impose also acknowledge that      our public safety entities should not be punished for the      actions of a state or local subdivision over which they may      not have control. I appreciate the careful consideration you      clearly gave that issue.  The second part of the bill deals with lawsuits that local law enforcement people might be faced with, so the second thing our bill does is provide protection for law enforcement officers who do want to cooperate and comply with detainer requests from the Federal Government. It would address the liability issue created by recent court decisions by providing liability protection to local law enforcement who honor Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainers.  The Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association explains in a letter of support for the bill:       Unfortunately, at least four courts have ruled that local      law enforcement officers may be sued for violating the Fourth      Amendment if they comply with an immigration detainer, even      if the detainer was lawfully issued and the detention would      have been legal if carried out by DHS. This means that our      local counterparts are exposed to potential civil liability      and it disables their ability to detain dangerous criminals      scheduled for release. The Stop Sanctuary Policies and      Protect Americans Act solves this problem by explicitly      stating that local law enforcement officers have legal      authority to comply with immigration detainers.  While preventing restrictive liability to law enforcement, the bill also ensures the protection of civil liberties and the rights of individuals. The Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association noted that ``the bill protects civil liberties, ensuring that someone who has had their constitutional rights violated may sue.''  Finally, the bill addresses criminals attempting to reenter the United States and habitual offenders of our immigration laws. The bill creates a mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years for any alien who is an aggravated felon or has been twice convicted of illegal reentry. Thanks to many people, including TV's Bill O'Reilly, for keeping this issue constantly before the people of this country. This part of the bill--named by Bill O'Reilly and commonly referred to as Kate's law--has become so important to many Americans. You can only imagine how important it is to the families of those who were killed by these murderers, the people whose pictures I had up here. This bill is very important to those families. Kate's Law is necessary in order to take those who are dangerous to our communities and have no respect for our law off our streets.  This bill has broad support from law enforcement groups. It also has the support of groups who want enforcement of our immigration laws. It has the support of the Remembrance Project, a group devoted to honoring and remembering Americans who have been killed by undocumented immigrants.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                      The Remembrance Project,                                    Houston, TX, October 14, 2015.     Subject: Support of ``Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect          Americans Act''     Hon. David Vitter,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Chuck Grassley,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Ron Johnson,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Ted Cruz,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Pat Toomey,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators: On behalf of Americans killed by illegal      aliens, and their surviving families, I thank you for      introducing and advancing the Stop Sanctuary Policies and      Protect Americans Act. We support this legislation that will      address the reentry of illegal aliens, restrict federal      funding of cities that operate as ``sanctuary cities'', and      that also supports and protects our law enforcement officers.       It is now known that approximately 1,000 criminal illegal      aliens are released back into our communities from our      prisons each month, of which over 60% have ``significant      prior criminal histories . . .'', most of which include      serious felonies! Add this to the rampant crime perpetrated      by other illegal aliens in our country, and we have a matter      of national urgency.       Violent illegal alien crimes resulting in the deaths of      American citizens, are unlike other killings. In every case,      Americans were killed by those persons who should never have      been in our country. This legislation will send a powerful      message that the safety of Americans is the priority. Most      importantly, this legislation will save American lives!       I ask that each of you do all humanly possible to end these      deliberate and unsafe community law enforcement practices      wherein     the killings of Americans is not only enabled but is also      well-known and documented.           Sincerely,                                                   Maria Espinoza,     Co-founder and National Director.                                  ____                                          AmericaFirstLatinos,                                    Houston, TX, October 16, 2015.     Subject: Support of ``Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect          Americans Act''     Hon. David Vitter,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Chuck Grassley,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Ron Johnson,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Ted Cruz,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Pat Toomey,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators: On behalf of Latino voices in America, I      write this letter in support of legislation that will address      the reentry of illegal aliens, restrict federal finds to      cities that refuse to enforce laws that creates ``sanctuary      city policies'', and that also supports and protects law      enforcement officers.       America First Latinos are proud to be Americans and proud      to live in this great country. We are activating nationwide      to remind public servants that the safety and well-being of      Americans must be the priority in America. Enforcing laws is      not racist, in fact, it is offensive for anyone to think that      Latinos approve of illegal immigration. Illegal immigration      is wrong. Sanctuary city policies condone lawless behaviors      and encourages more of the same behaviors, which reaches      deeper into our communities.       Each day Americans are being killed and harmed by      individuals who should not be in our country. It is up to you      to stop this epidemic of killings and crimes against the      citizenry. I ask that each of you do all humanly possible to      end these dangerous sanctuary practices. Americans must be      the priority in America!           Sincerely,                                                     Pedro Rivera,     Texas State Coordinator.                                  ____                               National Sheriffs' Association,                                  Alexandria, VA, October 6, 2015.     Hon. David Vitter,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Chuck Grassley,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Ron Johnson,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Patrick Toomey,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Ted Cruz,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Vitter, Senator Toomey, Senator Grassley,      Senator Cruz, and Senator Johnson: On behalf of the National      Sheriffs' Association and the more than 3,000 sheriffs      nationwide, I write today in support of legislation you      intend to introduce, the ``Stop Sanctuary Policies and      Protect American Act.'' This bill takes an important step in      clarifying the definition of sanctuary jurisdictions while      also offering additional protections for state and local      officers.       As you all know, state and local law enforcement agencies      are critical partners in immigration and border security      efforts all across this country. For too long, however, those      officers had little to no liability protections when lawfully      enforcing Federal immigration detainers on behalf of the      Department of Homeland Security. Your bill takes the      important step of clarifying those protections so that      deputies acting within the bounds of the law will not be held      personally liability in future court actions. The grant      penalties you would impose also acknowledge that our public      safety entities should not be punished for the actions of a      state or local subdivision over which they may not have      control. I appreciate the careful consideration you clearly      gave that issue.       On behalf of the National Sheriffs' Association, I applaud      your efforts on this important issue and look forward to      working with you on passage. If the National Sheriffs'      Association can be of assistance this or any other issue,      please don't hesitate to contact me.           Sincerely,     Jonathan F. Thompson.                                  ____                                           Federal Law Enforcement                                         Officers Association,                                  Washington, DC, October 6, 2015.     Hon. David Vitter,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Chuck Grassley,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Ron Johnson,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Pat Toomey,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Ted Cruz,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Vitter, Toomey, Grassley, Cruz, and Johnson:      On behalf of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association      (FLEOA), I thank you for introducing the Stop Sanctuary      Policies and Protect Americans Act, which will empower      federal and local law enforcement officers' cooperative      efforts to better protect our communities and our citizenry.      Your proposal will ensure we do not dishonor the memory of      Kate Steinle and the immeasurable grief her family is      enduring. It is critically important that all our law      enforcement assets are synchronized in pursuing our shared      responsibility of policing violent illegal aliens.       Federal law enforcement officers rely on their state and      local counterparts to assist in keeping America's borders      secure and keeping criminal illegal immigrants off of the      streets. It's one team, one fight, as we all took the same      sacred oath to protect and defend the Constitution and the      American citizenry. We've been relying upon immigration      detainers--requests from the Department of Homeland Security      (DHS) for local law enforcement to hold an illegal immigrant      temporarily, to give federal law enforcement an opportunity      to take the individual into custody.       Unfortunately, at least four courts have ruled that local      law enforcement officers may be sued for violating the Fourth      Amendment if they comply with an immigration detainer, even      if the detainer was lawfully issued and the detention would      have been legal if carried out by DHS. This means that our      local counterparts are exposed to potential civil liability      and it disables their ability to detain dangerous criminals      scheduled for release. The Stop Sanctuary Policies and      Protect Americans Act solves this problem by explicitly      stating that local law enforcement officers have legal      authority to comply with immigration detainers. The bill      protects civil liberties, ensuring that someone who has had      their constitutional rights violated may sue.       The Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect Americans Act takes      crucial steps to eliminating sanctuary jurisdictions, which      serve to shelter illegal aliens while posing real threats to      the American people. We must reassess our priorities and      remain committed to the unwavering premise of the safety of      the American citizenry is our top priority. The proper      response to Kate's tragic death is not to point fingers at      each other. Ms. Steinle was killed in San Francisco by an      illegal immigrant who had previously been deported from the      United States five times, and had been convicted of seven      felonies. The shooter chose to live in San Francisco because      he knew it was a sanctuary city that would shield him from      federal immigration law. Tragically, his ``sanctuary'' gambit      proved fatal for the Steinle family. Federal officials      requested that San Francisco detain the shooter until      immigration authorities could pick him up, but San Francisco      officials refused to cooperate and released Sanchez three      months before Kate's murder. We owe it to Kate and the      American citizenry to fix this critical community safety      issue now.       We commend you for preserving flexibility for law      enforcement, so that victims of crime and witnesses to crime      who are in the U.S. illegally may come forward and cooperate      with police. FLEOA especially recognizes and appreciates      Senator Toomey's leadership and unwavering support for all      law enforcement officers. Both Senator Toomey and Vitter      understand that in America, the safety of Americans comes      first!       FLEOA strongly supports the Stop Sanctuary Policies and      Protect Americans Act, and we look forward to working with      your offices to have this important legislation enacted into      law.           Respectfully yours,                                                        Jon Adler,     FLEOA National President.                                  ____                                     International Union of Police                                         Associations AFL-CIO,                                                  October 8, 2015.     Hon. Patrick Toomey,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Toomey: The International Union of Police      Associations is proud to add our name to the list of      supporters of the bill addressing ``Sanctuary Cities'' titled      Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect Americans Act. As it now      stands, our officers can be held liable for sharing relevant      information and honoring immigration detainers, even when      they are from federal immigration officials. This legislation      remedies that.       Additionally, the bill provides a financial disincentive      for cities to become or remain ``sanctuary cities'' by      removing State Criminal Alien Assistance Program Funds which      were originally designated to provide financial assistance to      those counties and cities housing unlawful entrants. It also      restricts Community Block Grants. COPS grants are restricted      only if the law enforcement agency is the source of, and has      the power to change sanctuary city policy. It makes sense to      us that a political entity cannot expect finding from the      federal government when that city or county has made a      decision to ignore federal laws involving the very issues for      which these funds were prescribed.       Finally, this legislation will provide a five year      mandatory minimum sentence for those illegal aliens who have      aggravated felony convictions and at least two prior      convictions for unlawful reentry. It is long past time to end      the revolving door of criminal aliens, who, even though      convicted of felony criminal activity and deported,      unlawfully return to prey upon our citizens.       We both thank and applaud you for this thoughtful and      timely piece of legislation     and we look forward to working with you and your staff to see      it signed into law.           Very Respectfully,                                                    Sam A. Cabral,     International President.                                  ____                                           National Association of                                   Police Organizations, Inc.,                            Alexandria, Virginia, October 7, 2015.

Dear Senators Vitter, Toomey, Grassley, Cruz, and Johnson:      On behalf of the National Association of Police Organizations      (NAPO), I am writing to you to express our support for the      Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect Americans Act, which will      enable federal and local law enforcement officers to work      together to protect our communities.       NAPO is a coalition of police unions and associations from      across the United States that serves to advance the interests      of America's law enforcement through legislative and legal      advocacy, political action, and education. Founded in 1978,      NAPO now represents more than 1,000 police units and      associations, 241,000 sworn law enforcement officers, and      more than 100,000 citizens who share a common dedication to      fair and effective crime control and law enforcement.       The system relies on local law enforcement complying with      immigration detainers--requests from the Department of      Homeland Security (DHS) for local law enforcement to hold an      illegal immigrant temporarily, to give federal law      enforcement an opportunity to take the individual into      custody.       Unfortunately, several courts have ruled that local law      enforcement officers may be sued for violating the Fourth      Amendment if they comply with an immigration detainer, even      if the detainer was lawfully issued and the detention would      have been legal if carried out by DHS. This means that      dangerous criminals cannot be held and must be released. The      Stop Sanctuary Policies ad Protect Americans Act solves this      problem by explicitly stating that local law enforcement      officers have legal authority to comply with immigration      detainers. The bill also protects civil liberties, ensuring      that someone who has had their constitutional rights violated      may sue.       Furthermore, the Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect      Americans Act takes crucial steps to eliminating sanctuary      jurisdictions, which pose real threats to the American      people, and increases penalties for criminals who re-enter      the United States illegally, providing federal, state and      local law enforcement vital tools to help keep our      communities safe.       NAPO also commends you for preserving flexibility for law      enforcement, so that victims of crime and witnesses to crime      who are in the U.S. illegally may come forward and cooperate      with police.       We look forward to working with your offices to pass this      important legislation. If we can provide any assistance,      please feel free to contact me.           Sincerely,                                               William J. Johnson,                                               Executive Director.
