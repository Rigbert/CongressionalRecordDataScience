Speaker, the question before the House is not whether these leases will be developed. They will be. It is now economical to go down to several thousand feet. They are predicting they will go to 10,000 feet in the future.  An article from Forbes, ``Deep and Deeper,'' interviewing a gentleman who has developed a new company for deep-water exploration. ``We think we can make serious money out of 20-million-barrel fields in 15,000 feet of water.'' An article from Business Day, the New York Times, ``Oil Companies Drawn to the Deep,'' and on and on.  The fact is, these leases will be developed. The sole question before the House of Representatives and for the Members to think about before they vote is whether or not the free market will prevail and taxpayers will get a fair return for the depletion of these Federal resources.  That is the sole question before the House. Do we need to give the oil companies an incredible break for something they are already prepared to do; something for which the technology already exists; something that is already profitable? Do we want to give them a break to keep doing it? That is the question.  Are we going to run this Government like a business? Are we serious about balancing the budget? Or do we have $15 billion to give away to an industry that is beginning to again enjoy record profits?  Mr. Speaker, I think the average American parked at the gas pump filling up their tank would say, We do not think these companies need a tax break. They are already gouging us at the pump. I do not want them to gouge me in Washington, DC, too.  These leases will be developed without a tax break; without a break in the royalties.
