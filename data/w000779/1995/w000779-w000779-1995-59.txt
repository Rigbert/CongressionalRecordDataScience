Speaker, every Member of this body knows that Medicare needs reform. But Medicare reform is a heat-seeking missile, and the purpose of this bill is to have Republicans avoid taking any heat. It is a last-minute idea to get someone else to make massive cuts in Medicare that are going to hurt seniors.  It cannot be done in 30 days in a reasonable fashion. It stops the trustees from looking at health care reform as it should be, in a systematic way. It is a mistake. It is going to be bad for the Nation's older people.  I urge my colleagues to vote against it.
