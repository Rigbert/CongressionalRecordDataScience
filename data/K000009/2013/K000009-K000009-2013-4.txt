Speaker, the political turmoil in Ukraine demands the world's attention.  It is now 5 p.m. in Kiev where protesters in Independence Square are regrouping after a night of violent crashes with Ukrainian security forces. As of now, the security forces have begun to pull back from the crackdown; and despite intimidation and threats of violence, the opposition has retained control of Euromaiden, the name given to Independence Square in a clear sign of solidarity with Europe.  The United States has sided unequivocally with those Ukrainians who are demonstrating for an independent Ukraine, for their rights to free assembly and free speech under provisions ofinternational law, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Our Secretary of State has called upon the Government of Ukraine to respect the rights of all people and expressed the disgust of the United States with the use of force against peaceful protesters as unbefitting a democracy.  As Secretary Kerry noted, the right to free assembly is ``a universal value, not just an American one.''  The House Ukrainian Caucus, which I cochair with Mr. Levin and Mr. Gerlach, has expressed its support for the rights of the Ukrainian people to exercise their rights to political speech and free assembly.  Yes, these are difficult, yet hopeful, times for Ukraine, which is trying to find its rightful place among the community of nations despite daunting domestic challenges. The country is gripped by uncertainty, which is exacerbating an already difficult economic situation.  The current crisis was triggered by the decision of the current political leadership to pursue free trade with Ukraine's eastern neighbor, Russia, rather than neighbors to the west, the European Union.  Regardless of the political discord in Ukraine, this Congress should urge all parties to settle their internal disagreements peacefully and without violence.  Ukraine's soils historically have been showered with the precious blood of their country men and women at a higher rate than most human beings could even imagine. The brilliantly recounted ``Bloodlands,'' written by Yale scholar Dr. Timothy Snyder, tells their story. Yes, though Ukraine's very name means borderland, she too often has been a bloodland. May this not happen now.  Ukraine must adapt to embrace a world in which her own independence from interference surpasses any other priority. She should be free to engage all directions, east, west, south, and north, without fear of retaliation. She is a bridge to all nations, and therein will lie her prosperity.  As Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security adviser to President Carter writes in today's Financial Times:       Two decades of independence, of growing pride in      rediscovering Ukrainian history, and of observing the      country's western neighbors economically benefiting from      their European connections is creating a new mindset. That      mindset is not embracing anti-Russianism, but it is asserting      Ukraine's own historic identity as culturally an authentic      part of a larger Europe.  Mr. Brzezinski believes the current political change in Ukraine is part of an historically significant, yet inevitable, political transformation. He believes Ukraine and Russia, too, will eventually orient to the west. I have ultimate respect in his opinion and pray he is correct.  Those of us who love Ukraine have longed for the day when it is no longer a prisoner of geography, hemmed in between Germany and Russia, but a free and willing member of the community of democratic nations.  Perhaps one day Ukraine will break free of the shackles of domination of the past. Perhaps one day Ukraine's geographic location will be an asset, not a liability, a day when Ukraine looks both east and west and, in fact, in all four directions.  But as we can see from the images coming to us from Kiev, the road will not be smooth. We know the future lies with freedom and with democracy and with opportunity, not repression in isolation; but that is cold comfort in the streets of Ukraine today.  The United States Congress must stand forthrightly with the liberty-loving people of Ukraine during this difficult hour. At this time of testing, the people of Ukraine and the people of the United States should be inspired by the words of Ukraine's most famous poet, Taras Shevchenko:       Then in your own house you will see true justice, strength      and liberty. There is no other such Ukraine.''               [From the Financial Times, Dec. 10, 2013]           Russia, like Ukraine, Will Become a Real Democracy                        (By Zbigniew Brzezinski)       Come what may, the events in Ukraine are historically      irreversible and geopolitically transformatory. Sooner rather      than later, Ukraine will be truly a part of democratic      Europe; later rather than sooner, Russia will follow unless      it isolates itself and becomes a semi-stagnant imperialistic      relic.       The spontaneous outburst of distinctive Ukrainian      patriotism--sparked by the mendacity of a corrupt and self-     enriching leadership ready to seek Moscow's protection--     signals that commitment to national independence is becoming      the dominant political reality. This is especially the case      among the younger Ukrainians who no longer feel that they are      linguistically or historically just a slightly deviant part      of ``Mother Russia''.       Yes, linguistic divisions persist and some parts of Ukraine      still feel closer to Russia. But it is striking that even      some of the most outspoken espousers of a European vocation      have only recently embraced the Ukrainian language as their      own. Two decades of independence, of growing pride in      rediscovering Ukrainian history, and of observing the      country's western neighbours economically benefiting from      their European connections is creating a new mindset. That      mindset is not embracing anti-Russianism but it is asserting      Ukraine's own historic identity as culturally an authentic      part of a larger Europe.       That is why, one way or another, Ukraine will unavoidably      come closer to Europe. It is striking that even in      neighbouring Belarus, ruled by the authoritarian Lukashenko      regime, a similar western orientation is beginning to      surface. Neither country is motivated by hostility towards      Russia, but each senses that its independence as well as its      cultural identity points increasingly in a westward      direction.       In the next months some sort of a deal between the EU and      Ukraine can still be contrived. To facilitate it, the EU must      be more receptive to Kiev's need for economic and financial      support. Ukrainians have to realise that European taxpayers      are not enchanted by the prospect of paying for the misdeeds      and corruption of the current Kiev elite. Belt-tightening      will be the necessary precondition for an agreement as well      as a test of Ukraine's resolve in asserting its European      aspirations. Kiev will also need to show that the outcome of      elections is not determined by the imprisonment of political      rivals.       The impact of this on Russia will be felt over the longer      run. Moscow's current geopolitical goal, shaped by President      Vladimir Putin's nostalgic obsession with the country's      imperial past, is to recreate in a new guise something akin      to the old Russian empire or the more recent Soviet      ``union''.       Mr. Putin seems to harbour the naive notion that the      leaders of the post-Soviet states will genuinely accept a      subordinate role in a Kremlin-led entity. Some of the leaders      do pay occasional lip service to that formula--but out of      necessity, not conviction. All prefer independence: it is      more pleasant to be presidents, prime ministers, generals,      ambassadors and economic moneymakers at home rather than to      be the provincial equivalents thereof in a larger Russian      empire. The historically proven fact is that national      statehood, once attained, is infectious and almost impossible      to undo except through massive external force.       Today's Russia is in no position to assert a violent      restoration of its old empire. It is too weak, too backward      and too poor. Its demographic crisis makes matters worse. The      fact that the newly independent Central Asian states favour      increasingly comprehensive arrangements with China is another      concern for Russia, reawakening long lingering territorial      nightmares.       It is only a question of time before it becomes evident to      Russia's social elites that Mr. Putin's heavy-handed efforts      have very limited prospects of success. Sooner or later, he      will no longer be president. And not long thereafter Russia--     and especially its emerging new middle class--will conclude      that the only path that makes sense is to become also a truly      modern, democratic, and maybe even a leading European state.                          ____________________
