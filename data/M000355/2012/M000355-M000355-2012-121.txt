 He confirms that this is not about the nominee, who apparently is well qualified. This is about an approach that has developed over several decades called the Leahy-Thurmond rule, under which it has been the practice to kind of call a timeout within rather close proximity to an election. In 2008, the timeout was called in June. We are going to enter August at the end of this week.  I would say also to my friend from Oklahoma, we have confirmed for the President in this election year five circuit court nominees. President Bush in 2008 got four; President Bush in 2004 got five. We have not been unfair to the administration. And it is certainly no reflection on what is apparently an outstanding nominee from your State.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
