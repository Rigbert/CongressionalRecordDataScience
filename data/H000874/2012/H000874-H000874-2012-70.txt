 I know that, Mr. Speaker, you've heard us speak and the Members have heard us speak, and one might say, well, these are Democrats speaking about the non-productivity and non-attention to the people's business of this Congress.  But some years ago, just a few years ago, 4 years ago, the Republican Party, our friends on that side of the aisle, nominated John McCain to be their President. What does John McCain say of this Congress? ``The worst since 1947 statistically, the worst ever as far as I'm concerned,'' Senator John McCain told reporters Wednesday when asked to assess this Congress. That was September 19, 2012, just a few days ago. Bipartisan observation.  This walkaway Congress is the least effective in which I've served, and I've been here for 31 years.  I want to yield to my friend who came to Congress the same year I did, who unfortunately is leaving, one of the great leaders of this Congress and responsible for putting the referee back on the field so that we will not have another financial meltdown that plunged this country almost into depression, the distinguished Member from Massachusetts, Barney Frank.
