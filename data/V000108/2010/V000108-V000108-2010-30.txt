Kijanowski and to congratulate him on his upcoming installation as the State Commander of the Indiana Department of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Northwest Indiana is certainly indebted to Mr. Kijanowski for his tireless commitment to those who have crossed seas to fight for our country. In honor of Mr. Kijanowski, a celebratory reception will be held on June 20, 2010, at Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) Post 717 in Saint John, Indiana.  Eugene Kijanowski hails from a family with a great military tradition. All three of his brothers served in the armed forces--Thomas and Jerome in the Army, and Wayne in the Air Force. Eugene began his military career in Whidbey Island, Washington, as a member of the United States Navy, where he worked as a parachute rigger and specialized in aircraft hydraulics. He was then transferred to Miramar Naval Air Station to Light Photographic Squadron 63, where he became Aviation Hydraulics Mechanic Third Class as well as a plane captain for the squadron. On the morning of October 26, 1966, aboard the USS Oriskany off the coast of North Vietnam, Mr. Kijanowski was forced to show his true character as a disastrous fire broke out on the flight deck. Crewmen, including Eugene, valiantly fought the fire, jettisoning heavy bombs which lay within reach of the flames. Other men wheeled planes out of danger, rescued pilots, and helped to halt the fire. In the end, 44 sailors perished and 156 were injured. The USS Oriskany returned to Subic Bay on October 28, 1966; and Eugene was discharged on November 16, 1966. His courage and performance on the USS Oriskany earned him the Vietnam Service Medal.  Commander Kijanowski joined the VFW in 1976 and has since held every office in his post. He has gamered many accolades and is a perennial state award winner. During his service with the VFW, Eugene was awarded the prestigious Eisenhower Award for outstanding leadership. Eugene will continue his lifelong commitment to the VFW and will become State Commander of the Indiana Veterans of Foreign Wars on June 20, 2010. For his truly heroic service to our nation and his outstanding dedication to the VFW, Mr. Kijanowski is worthy of the highest praise.  Eugene's devotion to the VFW is exceeded only by his devotion to his wonderful family. He has been married to his loving wife, Mary, for 42 years. They have two beloved children: Mary and Kevin.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending Eugene Kijanowski for his service and dedication in the United States Navy andcongratulate him on his new position of leadership as State Commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Department of Indiana.                          ____________________
