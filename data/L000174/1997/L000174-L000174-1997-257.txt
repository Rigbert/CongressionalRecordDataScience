President, for the past several months I have spoken about the crisis being created by the almost 100 vacancies that are being perpetuated on the Federal courts around the country and the failure of the Senate to carry out its constitutional responsibilities to advise and consent to judicial confirmations.  Today, the Washington Post, in an excellent article written by Sue Anne Pressley, focused on the consequences of this judicial crisis in one district court in Texas, the southern district of Texas. The article reports on the growing drug and immigration cases that are inundating this district court and the lack of Federal judges needed to administer justice in these cases.  This district has two vacancies, one open since December 1, 1990, and the President has nominated Hilda Tagle to fill this judicial emergency vacancy. Ms. Tagle's nomination was first received by the Senate Judiciary Committee on August 10, 1995, but she has yet to have a hearing before the committee.  This district in Texas is only one example of crisis that affects the entire country. We could find similar backlog problems in district courts in California, Florida, and other States that are swamped with rising cases and unfilled judicial vacancies. Yesterday, I met with members of the Federal Judges Association who are very concerned about the growing backlogs and rising caseloads in Federal courts across the Nation.  I want to commend Senators Boxer, Sarbanes, and Kennedy for joining me yesterday on the Senate floor to speak out against the Senate's current stall on confirming Federal judges. I also want to commend Senator Kohl for his similar remarks today.  Mr. President, confirming Federal judges should not be a partisan issue. The administration of justice is not a political issue. Working together, the Senate should do our constitutionally mandated job and proceed to confirm the judges we need for the Federal system.  I ask unanimous consent that today's Washington Post article titled ``Cases Pile Up As Judgeships Remain Vacant'' be printed in the Record immediately after my remarks.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, May 15, 1997]               Cases Pile Up As Judgeships Remain Vacant                         (By Sue Anne Pressley)       Laredo, Tex.--The drug and illegal immigrant cases keep      coming. No sooner does Chief U.S. District Judge George Kazen      clear one case than a stack of new cases piles up. He takes      work home at night, on weekends.       ``It's like a tidal wave,'' Kazen said recently. ``As soon      as I finish 25 cases per month, the next 25 are on top of me      and then you've got the sentence reports you did 2 months      before. There is no stop, no break at all, year in and year      out, here they come.       ``We've already got more than we can say grace over down      here,'' he said.       This is what happens to a federal judge on the southern      border of the United States when Washington cracks down on      illegal immigration and drug smuggling. It is a situation      much aggravated by the fact that the Senate in Washington has      left another federal judgeship in this district vacant for 2      years, one of 72 vacancies on federal district courts around      the country.       As Border Patrol officers and other federal agents swarm,      this southernmost region of Texas along the Mexican border in      ever-increasing numbers, Judge Kazen's docket has grown and      grown. He has suggested, so far unsuccessfully, that a      judgeship in Houston be re-assigned to the Rio Grande Valley      to help cope.       In Washington, where the laws and policies were adopted      that has made Kazen's life so difficult, the Senate has made      confirmation of federal judges a tedious process, often      fraught with partisan politics. In addition to the 72 federal      district court vacancies (the trial level), there are 25      circuit court vacancies (the appellate level) and two vacant      international trade court judgeships across the country,      leaving unfilled 99 positions, or 11 percent of the federal      judiciary. Twenty-six nominations from President Clinton are      pending, according to Jeanne Lopatto, spokeswoman for the      Senate Judiciary Committee, which considers nominations for      recommendation to the full Senate for confirmation. on texas border, cases won't wait for wrangling on judicial vacancies       Of those 99 vacancies, 24 qualify as judicial emergencies,      meaning the positions have been vacant more than 18 months,      according to David Sellers of the administrative Office of      the U.S. Courts. Two of the emergencies exist in Texas,      including the one in Kazen's southern district.       Lopatto said the thorough investigation of each nominee is      a time-consuming process. But political observers say      Republicans, who run the Senate, are in no hurry to approve      candidates submitted by a Democratic president. The pinch is      particularly painful here in border towns. The nominee for      Brownsville, in Kazan's district, has been awaiting approval      since 1995. Here in Laredo, Kazen's criminal docket has      increased more than 20 percent over last year.       ``We have a docket,'' he said, ``that can be tripled      probably at the drop of a hat. . . . The Border Patrol      people, the Customs people at the [international] bridges      will tell you, they don't catch a tenth of who is going      through. The more checkpoints you man, the more troops you      have at the bridges, will necessarily mean more stops and      more busts.''       And many more arrests are expected, the result of an      unprecedented focus on policing the U.S.-Mexican border.      Earlier this year, Clinton unveiled a $367 million program      for the Southwest for fiscal 1998, beginning Oct. 1, that      includes hiring 500 new Border Patrol agents, 277 inspectors      for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, 96 Drug      Enforcement Administration agents and 70 FBI agents.       In Kazen's territory, the number of Border Patrol agents      already has swollen dramatically, from 347 officers assigned      to the Laredo area in fiscal 1993 to 411 officers in      fiscal 1996. More tellingly, in 1993, agents in the Laredo      sector arrested more than 82,000 people on cocaine,      marijuana and illegal immigration charges. By 1996,      arrests had soared to nearly 132,000, according to data      supplied by the INS.       All of which is keeping Kazen and the other judges here      hopping. ``I don't know what the answer is,'' said U.S.      District Judge John Rainey, who has been acting as ``a      circuit rider'' as he tries to help Kazen out in Laredo from      his post in Victoria, Tex. ``I certainly don't see it easing      up anytime soon. There still seems to be such a demand for      drugs in this country, and that's what causes people to bring      them in. Until society changes, we won't see any changes down      here.''       In a letter to Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) in February,      Kazen outlined the need for a new judge in the Laredo or      McAllen division, rather than in Houston, where a vacancy was      recently created when then-Chief Judge Norman Black assumed      senior status. ``The `border' divisions of our court--     Brownsville, McAllen and Laredo--have long borne the burden      of one of the heaviest criminal dockets in the country, and      the processing of criminal cases involves special pressures,      including those generated by the Speedy Trial Act,'' he      wrote.       On a recent typical day, Kazen said, he sentenced six      people on drug charges and listened to an immigration case.      His cases tend to involve marijuana more often than cocaine,      he said.       ``The border is a transshipment area,'' he said. ``The fact      is, a huge amount of contraband somehow crosses the Texas-     Mexican border, people walking through where the river is      low, and there are hundreds and hundreds of miles of      unpatrolled ranchland.       ``In some cases,'' Kazen continued, ``we're seeing a      difference in the kind of defendant. We're almost never      seeing the big shots--we're seeing the soldiers. Once in a      while, we'll see a little bigger fish, but we're dealing with      very, very smart people. We see some mom-and-pop stuff, too.      There was a guy who came before me who had been in the Army      umpteen years, and he needed the money, he was going      bankrupt, so he did this 600-pound marijuana deal. he said he      stood to pick up $50,000, and now he's facing five to 40      years.       ``We see kids 18 and 19 years old,'' Kazen said. ``We see      pregnant women. We see disabled people in wheelchairs. This      is very, very tempting stuff.''       In Washington, the argument over court vacancies continues.      On April 30, Attorney General Janet Reno told the Judiciary      Committee, ``Chief judges are calling my staff to report the      prospect of canceling court sittings and suspending civil      calendars for lack of judges, and to ask when they can expect      help. This committee must act now to send this desperately      needed help.''       In remarks yesterday to the Federal Judges Association      meeting in Washington, Reno warned that ``the number [of      vacancies] is growing.''       ``As you are no doubt aware,'' Reno told the judges, ``the      level of contentiousness on the issue of filling judicial      vacancies has unfortunately increased in recent times.''                          ____________________
