I will be more specific so the leader understands what I am talking about.  In October of last year, as the gentleman recalls, we were hopeful that we would extend unemployment insurance in our last day in session in October and take up a Senate bill which was passed in a bipartisan, overwhelming fashion. We did not do that, as the gentleman recalls, notwithstanding the fact we gave our unanimous consent to that action. As a result of not doing that, 800,000 Americans went off unemployment insurance on December 28 of last year.  The President, of course, observed that he thought that was unfortunate, and he was for us extending it. However, that was not done, as the gentleman recalls, either until the last week in January or to the first week in February, I think it was probably the last week in January, which meant from December 28 through late January people who were unable to find jobs were not included in an extended unemployment insurance position. Therefore, they had no income coming in to their families, at least from their perspective. That is what we are concerned about.  I would reiterate, Mr. Leader, it is our view that there are some 3 million people at risk. It was 800,000 last October. We believe it is 3 million people under State programs and Federal programs that are at risk if we do not extend unemployment insurance, as we did in the 1990 recession, as we did in 1982. In fact, we extended it in both those instances beyond that which we had already. It was those programs which I was referring to, Mr. Leader.  I yield for any comments the gentleman may wish to make.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is correct in reciting the history of extending benefits. What I seemto remember was that the House passed a bill, and the Senate refused to pick it up back in October or November, I forget the time frame.
