S. mail for the shipment of day-old poultry * * * For decades, America's hatcheries and family farmers have relied on the United States Postal Service to safely and efficiently deliver live, day-old poultry. However, Northwest Airlines, the last contractor to provide the service to the Postal Service in the Midwest recently decided to discontinue the shipment of live poultry as of September 1.  the decision by the air carriers to stop working with the Postal Service has placed the economic vitality of many rural communities and the livelihoods of many of my constituents in serious jeopardy. In fact, hundreds of Iowans are employed in Iowa hatcheries which supply day-old birds to family farmers and hobbyists.  For example, the McMurray Hatchery in Webster City, IA, has shipped day-old chicks and other poultry to customers in all parts of the United States for over eighty years. The hatchery employs up to seventy people in sseason and is a major contributor to the region's economy. Ninety-five percent of the hatchery's orders are shipped through the mail, and carried by Northwest Airlines. Without the ability to deliver their product to their customers, however, the McMurray Hatchery would likely be put out of business.  In the community of Rudd, the Hoover Hatchery employs thirty people. The Welp Hatchery in Bancroft employs fifty people. For these small, rural communities, each with fewer than a thousand people, loss of these hatcheries would be devastating.  The legislation I introduce today would protect these hatcheries and the economies of Webster City, Rudd, Bancroft, and communities like them across the country. My legislation would authorize the U.S. Postal Service to require an air carrier to accept shipments of any day-old poultry and other live animals that are also allowed by the carriers's cargo service. In addition, my legislation would permit the Postal Service to assess a reasonable postage surcharge on shipments of live poultry to compensate carriers for any necessary additional expenses associated with the handling of live animals.  Most importantly, my legislation would ensure that the commitment of the United States Postal Service to deliver all of the mail, without discrimination, would not be broken. Therefore, I urge my Senate colleagues to support this legislation and to uphold our obligation to America's hatcheries and family farmers.                                 ______                                       By
