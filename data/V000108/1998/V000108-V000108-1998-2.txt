Speaker, we have a crisis in steel that my colleague from Ohio (Mr. Traficant) just alluded to. I want to thank the leadership of this House for promising the gentleman from Ohio that we would have a vote on his resolution today, a real steel resolution with real language, real teeth, and I ask every one of my colleagues to support this bipartisan resolution introduced by the gentleman from Ohio, House Resolution 598. It is the resolution I am personally going to support.  We need this, because H. Res. 598 calls for a 10-day review period for all steel imports and a 1-year ban on steel imports from countries found to be violating our law, not 3 months of consultation.  We need this, because the American Institute for International Steel has written to every one of its members and said that because of cases filed on September 30, the earliest date for withholding of liquidations would be December 9.  Translation: Dump your steel before December 9 or it will be too late. Vote for Traficant.                          ____________________
