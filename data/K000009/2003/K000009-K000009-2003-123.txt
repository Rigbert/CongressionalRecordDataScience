Speaker, before this war starts, we should recognize that the Bush administration foreign policy toward the Middle East and central Asia is leading America down a dangerous, dark alley globally. It is isolating America in the world even further.  Even before the Bush administration took office, America had a growing problem there related to the unresolved Arab-Palestinian conflict as well as our addiction to the import of Middle East oil from which the profits prop up repressive regimes.  This chart shows the dramatic increase in deaths among U.S. diplomats in service to our country overseas. Most of them are in the Middle East and central Asia and most in the Middle East. It is very interesting. Here were the Beirut bombings in 1983 at our embassy, the Kenya bombings. This chart does not include now the millions of people that have been affected and the thousands of Americans here at home who lost their lives on 9-11, as well as diplomats like Lawrence Foley who recently was assassinated in Jordan or the soldiers who recently lost their lives in Kuwait.  In 2 years, Bush's programs have reduced America's standing in the world, plummeting even more than before. The conduct of the Bush administration foreign policy is costing America friends across the world. Even our oldest and staunchest allies in the cause of freedom are turning away from us.  Our neighbors, Canada and Mexico, are increasingly at odds with this administration's foreign policy goals. The Bush administration cannot buy the loyalty of the people of Turkey. We offered billions of dollars in grants and loans, and we sold out more textile workers in North and South Carolina by saying the Turkish textiles could be used in U.S. military uniforms to lure their support, but the Turkish parliament has refused to be a rubber stamp for the government and rejected the request to allow U.S. troops to use Turkey as a staging base.  Why? It is not Colin Powell's fault necessarily. We should look at the fact that about 95 percent of the people of Turkey oppose this administration's war with Iraq.  Henry Luce called the 20th century the American Century, but USA Today says the 21st century might be known as the anti-American century. USA Today this week had a huge article talking about how Americans traveling abroad are now being treated. One traveler told USA Today he carries a lighter emblazoned with an American flag. On recent overseas trips, he says he had been turned down when he offered someone a light and they see the flag on his lighter.  In Britain, 67 percent of the public opposes a war against Iraq without specific backing from the United Nations Security Council. Americans are being told by USA Today, do not patronize U.S. franchise restaurants abroad.  In Germany, 86 percent of the people are opposed to a military attack against Iraq; and in Russia, at least 91 percent of the people oppose a war against Iraq. It is widely recognized that support for the United States has never been lower in South Korea. Around the world, public opinion has shifted against this country.  A former national security adviser's brigadier general said in the New York Times yesterday, America's standing in the world has never been lower since 1945. We are losing the battles for the hearts and minds of the people of the world.  For a White House that follows polling results as closely as the Bush White House, these numbers are staggering. The problem is not President Chirac of France or Chancellor Schroeder of Germany. These have been America's most historic and dependable democratic allies. The problem is that the Bush administration has simply failed to convince the people of the world that a preemptive strike against Iraq is justified.  Meanwhile, here at home, energy prices are going up. Gasoline is over $2 a gallon in California and rising across America, and the last four recessions have been caused by rising oil prices. Just be smart enough to connect the dots.  It is time for the United States to put all that money that we are spending abroad right here at home to create energy independence, and it is time for us to get back to the bargaining table with Israel and the Palestinian authorities to put peace in that region and every single bit of energy that we have toward that end.  Today, we had a magnificent outpouring of support against the war from the poet laureates of America, and I choose to read one of the 13,000 poems that they presented to us by Mr. Stanley Kunitz, a 97-year-old poet from New York City, who said, ``When they shall paint our sockets gray and light us like a stinking fuse, remember that we once could say, yesterday we had a world to lose.''                          ____________________
