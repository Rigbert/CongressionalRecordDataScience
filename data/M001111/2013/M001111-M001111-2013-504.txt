 President, before we go to the rollcall vote on this, I want to turn to all my colleagues and remind all of us that what we are here trying to do is to pass a budget out of the Senate.  I have heard from so many people for so many months about how important it is that we get a budget out so we can move to the next process in this whole thing of getting our country back on track, and we are trying to do it in a responsible way.  We have had a really great debate in our committee, out here on the floor, and many Senators have participated in it. We have now had I believe 62 or 63 amendments, and I think we have a responsibility to work toward final passage.  I am aware that not every Senator had an opportunity to have an amendment, but I think many, many Senators have to say they were able to get their amendments. We have had amendments on virtually every topic here tonight, including the budget, but I would really ask all Senators to stop and think about what we are showing the American public.  What we would like the American public to think is that the Senate as a group of 100 people can have a process to move a budget forward and vote on it, whether we agree with it or we disagree with it. And I think we are pretty much there in showing the American public that we can have a good debate, have numerous amendments, have our voices heard. At the end of the day, it is a ``yes'' or ``no'' vote.  So while we have this next vote, I would really like everyone to take a second and think about how we look to the American people and how important it is that we move this process along so that we can come to a final conclusion and hopefully get bipartisan agreement to get our country back on track.
