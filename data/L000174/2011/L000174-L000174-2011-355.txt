President, I would like to take a moment to congratulate Hal David on his upcoming 90th birthday. Hal is a pioneer in the music industry and a world class lyricist, having composed some of the most enduring songs in American popular music. Marcelle and I spend many wonderful evenings with him and so enjoy hearing his stories of not only his song writing, but others.  Hal was born on May 25, 1921, in Brooklyn, NY, and was the son of two immigrants. He served in the U.S. Army Entertainment Section in the Central Pacific during World War II with Carl Reiner and Werner Klemperer. The dedication to his country and the entertainment he provided for the men serving will never be forgotten.  Hal's musical writing career took off with his first hit record ``The Four Winds and the Seven Seas.'' His legendary collaboration with composer Burt Bacharach began in 1957 with the Marty Robbins hit ``The Story of My Life'' and included other hits such as ``Magic Moments'' and ``What the World Needs Now is Love.'' Through this successful partnership, Hal and Burt Bacharach were nominated for four Academy Awards and won the Oscar for best song in the 1969 film ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' with ``Raindrops.''  Hal David also works on legislative efforts as a board member on the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers, ASCAP, and led the battle against source licensing. During Hal's time as chairman and CEO of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, he helped launch the Songwriters Hall of Fame Gallery at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles.  Hal's achievements have earned recognition on a local and international stage. He has been inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Songwriter Hall of Fame, which honors the most popular songs from around the world. He was also the first non-British award recipient to receive the Recording Academy and Ivor Novello Award bestowed by the British Performing Rights Society. I commend him on his impressive lyricist career that has entertained countless Americans and citizens around the world. Hal David is a dedicated and talented lyricist and friend, and I am pleased to join in wishing him a happy 90th birthday and all the best in his future endeavors.                          ____________________
