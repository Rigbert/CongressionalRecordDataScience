President, today I am pleased to introduce the Lake Champlain Zebra Mussel Control Act of 1995. A year ago, the Senate accepted my amendment to address the growing problem of zebra mussels and their threat to drinking water systems. Unfortunately, the House did not concur, and now the problem has reached epidemic proportions.  We enter a critical stage in our efforts to preserve Lake Champlain and other Vermont lakes from a zebra mussel explosion that could become an economic and ecological catastrophe. Vermonters have feared the arrival of this dreaded mollusk for a long time. We didn't ask for them, and were powerless to prevent them from arriving on our lakeshores. But now they are with us--and they are multiplying out of control.  In 1993 the mussel was discovered in the South Lake near Orwell, VT by a young boy who had learned how to identify the zebra mussel by a wallet-sized identification card distributed by the Lake Champlain Basin Program. During the summer of 1994, the zebra mussel larvae reached a density of about 1,500 to 3,000 per cubic meter. This year, less than 3 years from the mussels' introduction, the Rutland Herald reported that zebra mussel larvae densities have been found throughout the lake at about 60,000 to 109,000 per cubic meter with some concentrations as high as 134,000 per cubic meter--almost as high as the worst sites in the Great Lakes.  The zebra mussels in Lake Champlain deserve immediate and swift action. This pest poses a serious risk to the water resources throughout Vermont and the health and safety of the people of Vermont.  Twenty-five percent of Vermont's families rely on Lake Champlain for their drinking water. The onslaught of zebra mussels and their astonishing ability to establish dense colonies in a matter of weeks, jeopardizes the intake pipes for water systems up and down the shore. Municipal, residential, industrial, and even the water systems to motors on recreation boats are threatened. Furthermore, the mussels don't just clog the ends of the pipes. Zebra mussels have been known to establish colonies in the piping system causing multiple effects on the quality of drinking water. A recent Cornell University report points out that       Once in a water intake line, zebra mussels can colonize any      part of the system from the mouth of the intake in the lake      or river to the distribution pipes within the residence.      Impacts of this colonization include loss of pumping      efficiency, obstruction of foot valves, putrefactive decay of      mussel flesh, production of obnoxious-tasting and foul-     smelling methane gas, and increased corrosion of steel, iron,      and copper pipes.  Another potential threat to Vermont is the zebra mussel's impact on Vermont's fish stocking program. These mussels, reproducing at staggering rates, can close off hatchery piping and are threatening the State's multi-million-dollar sport fishing economy. In fact, Vermont's largest hatchery in Grand Isle, a $16 million facility, is risking total shut down if it loses its ongoing battle with the zebra mussel. When zebra mussels infest beaches, summer swimmers are forced to wear sneakers or sandals to avoid getting cut from the sharp shells. We can only speculate what the impact will be on submerged shipwrecks, real estate, summer cottages, and the tourism industry.  Finally, the zebra mussels have arrived without their natural competitors and are spreading through the lake ecosystem unchecked. As colonies develop throughout freshwater bodies, they could displace all seven native mussel species in the Lake Champlain Basin, including the endangered black sandshell mussel. Scientists say all species are at risk because zebra mussels are known to colonize right on the backs of native mussels and choke them off from food and fresh water. Zebra mussels could throw entire aquatic ecosystems out of balance by disrupting the food chain, changing water chemistry, and altering physical habitat.  Mr. President, 6 months ago I came to the Senate floor during the debate on the unfunded mandates bill to warn people of the real unfunded mandates that our States face--zebra mussels is one of them. While most of my colleagues supported S. 1 in an attempt to ease financial burdens by relaxing national standards and undermine Federal regulations, I pointed out that without national standards, States face the financial burdens of water pollution from upstream and out-of-State polluters, forest decay from acid rain, and flooding from wetland loss. Today, my State faces one of the financial burdens that could have been controlled with stricter national standards. I have already mentioned the $16 million hatchery and the water systems for one-quarter of my State. My State of Vermont faces a problem with no known cure and the costs could be astronomical. I hope that those who supported S. 1 to reduce State costs by limiting Federal standards recognize soon that their effort may have had the exact opposite effect.  My Lake Champlain Zebra Mussel Control Act would do five things to address the present threat and prevent further spreading of zebra mussels throughout the country.  The Lake Champlain Zebra Mussel Control Act specifically includes Lake Champlain in Federal programs designed to fight the zebra mussel. As America's ``sixth Great Lake'' with one of the greatest emerging zebra mussel problems and a destination for thousands of boaters, it is essential that Lake Champlain be included in any national effort to address the problem.  My bill also establishes national voluntary guidelines for recreational boaters who are the chief mechanism for the spread of these mussels within New England. These guidelines will help States inform boaters of the steps they can take personally to stop the spread of zebra mussels into new areas. With 70 million people living within 1 day's drive of Lake Champlian, the potential for the spread of these mussels to other lakes and waterways is great. All boaters will know that this is a national concern with clear protocols on how to stop the spread, and States can choose to enforce the guidelines as mandatory regulations if they believe the threat is justified.  The legislation also allows States to work cooperatively on watershed approaches to the prevention and treatment of zebra mussels. If my State of Vermont devoted millions of dollars in time and resources to fight the mussel and our neighbors on Lake Champlain did nothing, the effort would be futile. Section 4 of my bill emphasizes that sometimes the watershed-based efforts like those of the Lake Champlain Basin Program are the best approaches to complex environmental problems.  The bill designates the University of Vermont as a Sea Grant College eligible for zebra mussel funding. Ironically, the only State in New England with a confirmed zebra mussel problem is also the only State in New England without a Sea Grant College. My bill changes this. Also, recognizing that zebra mussels are not just a coastal problem or a Great Lakes problem any more, my bill authorizes land-grant colleges to compete for zebra mussel research funding.  Finally, my legislation reauthorizes the Aquatic Nuisance Species Control Act, Public Law 101-646, and extends the appropriations authority through the year 2000. To address the current need to find control solutions, my bill doubles the current appropriation of the Army Corps of Engineers to $4 million. It is crucial that the Army Corps has adequate funding to pursue zebra mussel control technology. Since the Army Corps has used its full authority in recent years, doubling the authorization will assure they have access to the proper resources to do a thorough job.  There is one further issue that my bill does not address, but represents an important piece of the fight to stop the introduction of new exotic and harmful species. The lamprey and the zebra mussels were both imported through the ballast tanks of international shippers. In recent years, the ruffe, a small fish, was introduced the same way and while it is not yet in Lake Champlain, its population is expanding in the Great Lakes. My colleagues Senator Glenn, the original author of the Aquatic Nuisance Species Act, and Senator Sarbanes will introduce a bill that addresses the loopholes in current ballast water controls that allow shippers to unleash these devastating and costly pests into our State waters. I hope to make America's fresh water resources completely off limits for expensive and damaging exotic pests. I look forward to working with Senators Glenn and Sarbanes to address all of these issues comprehensively.  Mr. President, I present this bill with the hope that the Senate will act on it in a timely manner. Every minute that we delay allows the zebra mussels to multiply exponentially and risks the physical and economic health of Vermont. To turn our backs on this problem of national significance only guarantees that it gets much worse. Just ask my colleagues who knew little or nothing about zebra mussels as recently as a few years ago, and are now plagued by their existence.                                 ______      By
