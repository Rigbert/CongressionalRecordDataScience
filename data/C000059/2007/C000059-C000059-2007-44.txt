The Naval Surface Warfare Center located in Corona, California has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated leaders and John Fishell is one of these individuals. I am sorry that I will not be able to attend his retirement ceremony which will be held on Tuesday, December 18, 2007.  John began his career at Corona in 1972 as a Missile Flight Analyst, soon after graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Texas, El Paso. His early career involved traveling the globe analyzing missile tests for the Navy. John was the on-board missile analyst for the first 22 missile tests on the USS Norton Sound (AVM-1), the development test ship for today's state-of-the-art Aegis combat system. Thirty-five years later, this missile system is America's mainstay defense system on the Fleet of Aegis Destroyers and Cruisers. In addition to being a missile flight analyst, various groups that John led early in his career developed several of the foundational databases and analysis software the Navy uses to assess its combat and weapon systems today.  As Associate Head of the Measurement Science Directorate in 1993, John was appointed to coordinate all 1995 Base Re-alignment and Closure (BRAC) efforts at Corona. From 1993-1995, he led the team that made the case for Corona's military value to the Navy. John and his team were successful in articulating Corona's military value and why its function needed to remain in Norco in order to maintain its value to the Navy. The Navy recognized John's leadership during the BRAC process and awarded him the Navy Award of Merit for Group Achievement.  Following several leadership roles at Corona, John was promoted to Head of the Measurement Science Directorate in August 1995. As director of the Navy's top metrology calibration directorate, he worked to significantly increase the metrology research and development program funding. He served as MS director until his promotion to Corona's top technical director position in January 2002.  During John's tenure as technical director, he has overseen significant facilities improvements at Corona. In 2002, the Measurement Science and Technology Laboratory (MSTL)--a 39,000 sq. ft. environmental laboratory--was completed. The MSTL is a top facility that supports Navy and Marine Corps weapons and interface gages, force and dimensional calibration standards, and electro-optics research and development. In 2008, Corona will complete the $11.5 million extension of the Joint Warfare Assessment Laboratory, one of the Navy's premiere analysis labs. This 39,000 square-foot expansion significantly increases the secure analysis workspace to 87,000 square feet and will aid the base's primary mission: Assessing the warfighting capability of ships, aircraft, missiles, and weapons systems for the Navy and other Armed Forces. John has also overseen planning for three additional labs in the future, as part of a long-term plan to enhance Corona's facilities.  In addition to Corona's facilities, John has led many institutional transformations that have helped Corona meet today's demand for its technical services, while positioning the organization to meet future requirements. In 2004, John guided Corona's growth from four departments to six, resulting in cost savings to the Navy and better alignment of technical capabilities for naval programs.  John has been instrumental in creating long-term professional development programs at Corona that will strengthen the organization for years to come. Under his direction, Corona embedded a systemic Employee Development Program to institutionalize professional development for future generations of Corona employees. These efforts were recognized by the University of the Notre Dame Mendoza College of Business' highest recognition, The Outstanding Leadership in Executive Education Award. The development program has also received international acclaim as a case study for its proactive and innovative approach to managing leadership development, career, and succession planning. During John's time as the senior civilian, Corona has also been recognized as one of the Top Companies to Work For in the Inland Empire.  In addition to strengthening Corona's workforce, John has been a strong proponent of being active in professional organizations. He served as Measurement Science Conference President and in various liaison positions for National Conference of Standards Laboratories International. He was also a founding member of the Inland Empire Chapter of the American Society of Naval Engineers and its Chairman from 1995-96. From 2001-2003, he served on the National Cooperation for Laboratory Accreditation Board of Directors and has served as the Science and Technology Education Partnership (STEP) Conference Co-chairman since 2001 and STEP's Vice President of Operations since 2003.  I've known John for many years and am sincerely grateful for all the work he has done for our Nation, our community, NSWC, Corona and for STEP. His absence will be deeply felt in our community. I also congratulate John for receiving the Navy Meritorious Civilian Service Award for exemplary service to the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Corona Division. I commend John for his many years of excellent service and wish him health and happiness in retirement.                          ____________________
