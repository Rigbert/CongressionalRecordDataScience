 It is apparent it will not be done in the first session of the 108th Congress. There are not many measures around here that have 54 cosponsors and probably with support well in excess of 60. I hope we can work together in the early part of the next session and advance this legislation to final passage, with relevant amendments, so it does not become a measure that attracts every single good cause some Senator may want to propose totally unrelated to the underlying question of whether gun manufacturers should be held responsible for acts perpetrated by individuals using their product--a fundamentally unfair trend developing in the country that should be stopped before it goes any further.  I yield the floor.
