 President, we will open the session with a period of morning business until 4 p.m. At 4 today the Senate will begin consideration of the 2005 deficit reduction bill. Under the order entered into last Friday, the time from 4 to 5 today will be under the control of the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Gregg.  As a reminder, the majority leader has announced that there will be no rollcall votes during today's session. We will remain on the deficit reduction bill for the remainder of this week. The agreement allows a specific division of debate time over the next few days with the statutory time limit to expire at 6 p.m. on Wednesday.  It will be a busy week with rollcall votes occurring until we complete action on the deficit reduction measure. We will alert Members later as to when the first votes can be expected.  I would also suggest to Senators that we may also consider any conference reports that may become available, including the Agriculture appropriations conference report.                          ____________________[Page S12059]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                SCHEDULE  Mr. McCONNELL.
