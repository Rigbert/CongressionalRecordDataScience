Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and just in closing:  We ought to remember approximately 90 percent of private sector employees in America make no contribution to their retirement systems, none. Federal employees are now making a 7-percent contribution. Now, the Federal employee pension system is a better system than most private sector pension systems. I mentioned that Ronald Reagan signed the bill in which we formed this working with a Republican Senate and a Democrat House.                              {time}  1845  In 1990, A Democratic Senate and a Democratic House, working with a Republic President, George Bush, tried to reform and did reform the pay system. And the reason President Bush and his administration agreed to that was because they believed, correctly, that pay was not comparable, and they further believed that you ought not to modify in any way the pension system until you got pay comparable.  President Bush then signed the locality bill, the Federal Comparability Pay Act, and said in signing that that he hoped to put the pay and retirement system on a solid base. That is our point. We ought to retain what we have. We ought not to change it and we ought not to do it in this way.  But, again, as I said, Mr. Speaker, I will not object because of the fact that my leadership has agreed to this process.
