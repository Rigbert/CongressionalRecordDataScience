 President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for yielding.  Even though I am not going to speak on the issue of taxes, I just heard the remarks by the Senator from Arkansas. Obviously, voting for that bill was difficult. I agree with the statements and plead with the President to sign the bill and give the people back some of the money or let them keep the money rather than running it through Washington. We are overtaxing the people at the highest level of taxation in the history of our country.                          ____________________
