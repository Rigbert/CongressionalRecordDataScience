 Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask the gentleman from Virginia his experience. Mine, In Illinois, was that 90 to 95 percent of all the civil cases filed settled before they went to trial. That suggests to me that if the goal is to find settlements, the system is currently doing that in most cases.  Is the gentleman's experience different?
