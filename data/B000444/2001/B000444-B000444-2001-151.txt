 President, I rise today to take strong issue with remarks by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld as summarized in the Washington Post on May 18 and subsequently reproduced in their entirety on the paper's website, that he is ``pushing'' to pull U.S. troops out of Bosnia. According to Secretary Rumsfeld, ``the military job [in Bosnia] was done three or four years ago.''  I firmly believe that Secretary Rumsfeld's analysis of the situation in Bosnia is incorrect, and that his policy prescription would be seriously detrimental to the national security interests of the United States.  First, let me turn to Mr. Rumsfeld's statement that the ``military job was done three or four years ago.'' It is true that IFOR, and then SFOR, successfully separated the largely exhausted warring parties without much difficulty. But to assert that this separation spelled the end of our troops' mission is to define ``military'' in such a narrow way so as to make it nearly meaningless in the Balkan context.  Putting it in other terms, Secretary Rumsfeld seems to belong to the school that begins talking about so-called ``exit strategies'' as soon as troops are committed. Of course we need an ``exit strategy,'' and we have had one. The Clinton Administration early on outlined ten detailed benchmarks for Dayton implementation that need to be met before we can say ``mission accomplished'' and honorably withdraw. These are not secrets. The U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo hands out a list of the benchmarks to all visitors. I must assume that Secretary Rumsfeld is familiar with them, so it seems that he either believes they no longer apply, or that our troops no longer have anything to do with most aspects of Dayton implementation.  From Secretary Rumsfeld's published remarks, I get the impression that he sees anything short of actual combat or the separating of warring parties as inappropriate tasks for our soldiers. If he does, I disagree with him. In fact, his view strikes me as the old syndrome of ``preparing to fight the last war.'' The last two so-called ``Strategic Concepts'' of NATO have made clear that the most likely security challenges of the twenty-first century will be ethnic and religious strife, trans-national crime, terrorism and the like--rather than a frontal attack on the territory of alliance members.  The details bear examination. Little more than two years ago in this city, NATO celebrated its fiftieth anniversary. At that Washington Summit, NATO issued the latest version of its Strategic Concept. I would like to quote several parts of the Strategic Concept in order to show that we and our allies have clearly understood that the military's function is not bound in a narrow straightjacket.  The document, agreed upon by all nineteen NATO members on April 23 and 24, 1999, declares in Article 20 that ``large-scale conventional aggression against the Alliance is highly unlikely.'' It goes on to say the following: ``Ethnic and religious rivalries, territorial disputes, inadequate or failed efforts at reform, the abuse of human rights, and the dissolution of states can lead to local and even regional instability.''  It then graphically outlines the possible ramifications of such developments: ``The resulting tensions could lead to crises affecting Euro-Atlantic stability. . . [and] could affect the security of the Alliance by spilling over into neighboring countries, including NATO countries, or in other ways, and could also affect the security of other states.''  Moreover, Article 25 of the 1999 Strategic Concept specifically states that ``The Alliance is committed to a broad approach to security, which recognizes the importance of political, economic, social and environmental factors in addition to the indispensable defense dimension.''  How can these factors be addressed? Article 29 mentions the ``Alliance's ability to contribute to conflict prevention and crisis managementthrough non-Article 5 crisis response operations.''  So, clearly NATO, including the United States, is on record as seeing the threats of this new century as being new, complex, and calling for a variety of responses. In that context the marvelous men and women of our armed forces serving in Bosnia and in Kosovo have taken on many tasks that military people of earlier generations, trained to stop the Red Army from pouring through Germany's Fulda Gap, either do not understand or believe are beneath the dignity of regular troops.  But our troops understand their mission and believe in it. I have spoken at length with our soldiers in SFOR in Bosnia and in KFOR in Kosovo, and the overwhelming majority of them think that their broadly defined pacification activities are making a contribution to lessening the very threats that NATO's Strategic Concept describes.  Skeptics may think that I have gained impressions that I wanted to get. Fair enough, I'm only human. But statistics don't lie. Every year the Pentagon issues re-enlistment targets for troops based abroad. When I stayed at Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo this past winter, I was told that the re-enlistment figures for our Army troops in KFOR were one hundred forty-two percent of target--the highest for any foreign-based units in the entire world. Re-enlistment rates in SFOR in Bosnia are also high. So obviously our troops in the field in the Balkans seem to grasp what Secretary Rumsfeld apparently does not: that what they are doing is important to the security of the United States and is not beneath the dignity of soldiers.  I might also add that the charge that our Balkan-based troops lose their fighting ability has been shown to be another canard used to dress up neo-isolationist ideology. In fact, the U.S. Army has a well thought out program to restore so-called ``HIC'' or high intensity conflict skills to troops rotating out of the Balkans in a short amount of time. Equally important is the universally accepted fact that the troops who have served in SFOR and KFOR have acquired leadership skills through the missions frowned upon by Secretary Rumsfeld, which they never could have gotten sitting in bases in Germany or elsewhere outside the Balkans.  I understand full well that non-military police forces also have a role to play. That is why several years ago I began calling for the creation of a ``gendarmerie'' force for crowd pacification and assistance to refugees returning to their homes. In fact, so-called ``MSUs'' or Multinational Specialized Units were created in Bosnia. Unfortunately, though, their strength has been allowed to decrease. U.S. General Mike Dodson, Commander of SFOR, told me that while he once had nineteen MSU units under his control, the number has shrunk to eleven. They should be beefed up to their former strength.  In addition, new local police forces have been created both in the Federation and in the Republika Srpska. Some of them are functioning well, others not so well.  But neither the MSUs, nor the local police forces, have the clout or inspire the fear in the ultra-nationalists that the regular SFOR troops do. We may not like this situation, but we have to face the facts: Bosnia is not yet fully pacified, and the recipe for curing the unrest is exactly the opposite from talking of withdrawing American troops.  A few months ago, I stood here and said that we are at a critical juncture in Bosnia. The moderate, non-nationalist forces embodied in the ``Alliance for Change'' political coalition had just made important, even extraordinary, gains by winning, in free and fair elections, control of both the national and the Federation parliaments.  The hardline ultra-nationalist HDZ Bosnian Croat party has violently refused to yield to its democratic defeat. Rather, it announced that it was creating its own ``self administration'' and withdrew its troops from the Muslim-Croat Federation Army and from cantonal police forces. An international operation that seized the bank through which the HDZ conducted its nefarious activities prompted a violent riot in Mostar in which serious bloodshed was only narrowly averted. After extreme pressure from the West the Bosnian Croat ultra-nationalists have indicated that they may resume participation in government institutions, but the situation remains precarious.  In the Republika Srpska the hardliners who owe their allegiance to indicted war criminal Radovan Karadzic and who are at least rhetorically supported by Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica have been up to their old caveman tactics.  Two weeks ago they broke up a ceremony in Banja Luka in which the cornerstone was to have been laid to rebuild the great Ferhadija Mosque, destroyed by Bosnian Serbs in the early 1990s. They trapped two hundred Bosnian and international officials for several hours before they were rescued. As a nice reminder of their lofty cultural level, the Bosnian Serb thugs burned Muslim prayer rugs and let a pig loose on the mosque grounds. Incidentally, although President Kostunica criticized this barbarity, he added that the reconstruction of such buildings was a provocation!  Ultra-nationalists have also rioted in Trebinje and elsewhere against returning refugees.  In short, the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is hardly pacified. It is a time of great opportunity, for the hardline Serbs and Croats are reacting to their dwindling power. But it is also a time fraught with danger.  For example, one strictly military task remaining to be accomplished is the amalgamation of the rival armies. If the U.S. forces, and SFOR, would withdraw before this occurs, renewed warfare would almost certainly break out. Instead of publicly musing about exit strategies, we need to be stressing our country's commitment to helping Bosnia and Herzegovina move once and for all beyond the domination of the corrupt ultra-nationalist parties.  Moreover, rather than setting artificially limited goals for our military and then congratulating ourselves on fulfilling them, we need to utilize SFOR to kill the serpent that continues to poison Bosnian life: by apprehending the more than three dozen individuals indicted by The International Criminal Tribunal at The Hague for war crimes who are currently living with impunity in the Republika Srpska. This rogues' gallery includes, above all, Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic--who, according to Carla Del Ponte, the Chief Prosecutor of The Hague War Crimes Tribunal, enjoys the protection of a security detail that is paid for by the Yugoslav army.  SFOR claims that it doesn't know where Karadzic and Mladic are. Well, Mrs. Del Ponte, with whom I met earlier this month, has offered to use her tribunal's capabilities to locate Karadzic and Mladic for SFOR. I think we should take her up on her offer. As long as these two mass murderers are on the loose, there will be no definitive peace in Bosnia. Our British allies have not been squeamish about undertaking risky operations to nab individuals indicted for war crimes. We must get Karadzic and Mladic, and, if necessary, the U.S. Army should be involved.  The linchpin to the strategy of pacifying and democratizing Bosnia and Herzegovina is a continued robust U.S. military presence in SFOR.  Secretary Rumsfeld's comments are bound to boost the spirits of the ultra-nationalist hardliners who, according to a recent report published by the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, ``are gambling . . . that [if] they can intimidate or just outlast the international community, they may still succeed in dividing Bosnia into ethnic states.''  Moreover, I am certain that the Secretary's comments have reignited concerns among our European allies that they will be left holding the bag in Bosnia.  In the Washington Post interview, Secretary Rumsfeld stressed that there was no friction between him and Secretary of State Colin Powell on this issue.  His comments, however, appear to directly undercut Secretary's Powell's repeated assurances to our European allies during the past several months that the United States ``will not cut and run'' from the Balkans, and that ``we went in together with our allies and we'll go out together.''  What on earth is going on here?  Just as Secretary Powell has spent the last six months trying to undo the damage done by similarly ill-considered unilateralist comments in a NewYork Times interview by Condoleeza Rice, now the President's National Security Advisor, so the Bush Administration spin-doctors were quick to try to explain away the Rumsfeld interview by asserting that his proposals were only part of a process by which we intend to use NATO's Six Month Reviews to reduce our combat troops in Bosnia.  Well, if that's the case, we have a case of ``choose your poison.'' One possibility is that the Bush Administration is, once again, internally out of control as President Bush showed by cutting off EPA Chief Christine Todd Whitman at the knees on carbon dioxide and Secretary Powell on his sensible support of South Korea's ``sunshine policy.''  The other possibility is that Secretaries Powell and Rumsfeld are, indeed, on the same page, and that ``in together, out together'' really means that the United States intends to use its unparalleled influence within NATO to force our allies to join us in a precipitous withdrawal before the mission in Bosnia is successfully completed.  Given the choice, I'd opt for poison number one, and wait for this Administration to finally get its act together. But I fear that poison number two is the more likely scenario.  If my fears prove correct, and we withdraw our troops, I predict that renewed fighting in Bosnia is just a matter of time. This next round would be bloody, and, inevitably, we would have to go back in again, at much greater cost in men and materiel. Because no matter how much my neo-isolationist friends salivate at the idea of sitting on the sidelines while the European Union's European Security and Defense Policy rapid-reaction force takes care of things--they will be sorely disappointed, because for the foreseeable future ESDP will need massive American support to function.  You know, I think this town has a great many very intelligent individuals, and Secretary Rumsfeld is one of the brightest of the bunch. It's difficult for me to understand how even the most Asia-centered, or missile defense-centered person, can believe that their new foreign policy emphases have a chance of succeeding if Europe is not stable. And with the Balkans still erupting, Europe will not be stable.  So let's all reread NATO's Strategic Concept and not view our military's tasks through a twentieth century prism. Let's listen to our men and women on the ground in the Balkans. Let's listen to our diplomats who know full well that a stepped up, resolute effort at Dayton implementation--backed up by a still robust SFOR--is what is called for. Let's stop talking about accelerated exit strategies before the mission is successfully accomplished.                          ____________________
