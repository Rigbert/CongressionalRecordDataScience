 But let me make an observation. I wish the gentleman would stay in the well because he might want to respond.  I did not accuse the Republican Party of discriminating. I will not, at this point in time, hazard an opinion on that fact.  However, I want to recall to the gentleman that, in the Armed Services Committee, after due consideration, the Armed Services Committee voted not to discriminate, not to discriminate against women, not to say to women: Yes, you can serve, but you don't have to sign up for the draft.  Many of us felt that if you are going to ask young men to sign up for the draft, young women ought to be treated equally. We felt not to do so was discrimination.  That amendment passed in the committee and came to the Rules Committee--my understanding is--without a vote, without discussion. The rule that was issued from the Rules Committee said that, upon adoption of that rule, the adopted amendment in the Armed Services Committee, without a singular vote on this floor of the House, would be defeated.  That, I say to the gentleman, was neither regular order, nor was it giving us an ability to make a decision on that issue. And I believe, I personally believe, that it results in continuing discrimination against young men and young women, one of which has to sign up, the other whom does not; but they both have to serve, or can serve voluntarily in the Armed Forces of the United States.  So we may have a difference of opinion on whether or not that was, in fact, discrimination. But I will tell the gentleman that I was not happy, and I am still not happy that we did not have a vote on the floor about what we perceive to be discrimination.  And I regret that the Rules Committee chose to hide in its rule the repeal of what the Armed Services Committee adopted.  If the gentleman wants to respond, I will yield to him.
