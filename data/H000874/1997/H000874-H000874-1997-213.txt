That is why I suggest to my friends, as I said at the outset, that I think the gentleman's comments really lead us to remove ourselves from either horn of this dilemma.  The reason I say that, it seems to me self-evident that we have a program here which almost everybody who has risen to talk has said has a worthy, important critical objective, to give economic development in those areas where all of us want to see economic development, job creation, and better lives for people.                              {time}  1715  If that is our objective, then the budget agreement which contemplated the full funding of CDFI ought to be pursued at the same time that other horn ought not to be abandoned, that is to say, this investigation; this investigation into whether or not the administration of this program is being pursued properly, which I do not know, but if it is not, it ought to be. I agree with the gentleman from Alabama.  I also appreciate the gentleman's remark, the President has been a very strong proponent of this program, long before there was any question of impropriety. The President does not want impropriety any more than the gentleman from Alabama. But what the President does want and what he asked for in the course of the budget agreement was that this program be pursued vigorously because the objective was critical. If we are going to energize and grow communities, we need to have healthy economic engines for not only central cities but also other areas.  So that is why it is so important that we fully fund this program today, and I might say to my friend, there will be time obviously between now and the adoption of the conference report. And as the gentleman well knows, this money is October 1 forward money, so that if we do not give the lead time now, once you resolve the problem and we do not have the resources, we will not be able to pursue the program as vigorously as I think most wanted.
