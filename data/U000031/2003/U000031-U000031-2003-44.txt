Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation that fixes Judge Lee R. West's decision of earlier this week. I have the phone number for Judge Lee R. West. I thought maybe the 50 million folks that have decided to call the FTC and say enough is enough, maybe we ought to pass on this phone number to his office in Oklahoma. I do not know that they would get anything done for the next couple of weeks.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support. And I do not know of a family out there that has not received these awful phone calls, usually at some important moment. I can remember earlier this summer, I was finally home from a long day, and my wife and kids are ready to go with their friends down to Lake Michigan, my dog is wagging his tail. That is one of the words that he knows, ``beach.'' He is so excited. The phone rings. It is a solicitation call from a good group, I am sure. My wife has it down pat. Do you know what she does? ``It is for you.'' I get to the phone, and I have got to make sure they are not from our district, and then with that, that phone call is gone.  Mr. Speaker, 50 million folks like our house have called the FTC. When you look at it, that is 50 percent of America. We have about 100 million households, so 50 million households have said hang up. We do not want this. And, yet, Judge Lee R. West, I cannot say a good guy, a guy out in Oklahoma, has said no.  This legislation changes it. We are going to get it done. Let us all vote for this bill.                              {time}  1145
