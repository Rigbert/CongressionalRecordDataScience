 President, I ask unanimous consent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following treaty transmitted to the Senate on August 28, 2018, by the President of the United States: amendments to the Treaty on Fisheries between the Governments of Certain Pacific Island States and the Government of the United States of America, Treaty Document No. 115-3. I further ask that the treaty be considered as having been read the first time; that it be referred, with accompanying papers, to the Committee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the President's message be printed in the Record.
