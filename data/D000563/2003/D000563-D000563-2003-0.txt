President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.  America's parents and grandparents are the losers today, and special interest groups are the winners. America's senior citizens deserve better. This bill does nothing to reduce drug prices, and it starts our Nation down the road toward privatizing Medicare and endangering America's lifeline program that has been a bright beacon for seniors across our country for more than four decades.
