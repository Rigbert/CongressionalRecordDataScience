He risked his life in the struggle for civil rights for all Americans, he stood with Dr. King as one of that movement's most eloquent and inspirational leaders, and he has held steadfast to the principle of equal justice in every part of his public life, from the Freedom Rides to his service in the House. I am proud to call him a dear friend--and I am proud that his leadership has recently been honored with two prestigious awards.  On November 17, President Obama announced Congressman Lewis as one of the next recipients of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America's highest civilian honor. The award citation noted his courage on ``Bloody Sunday'' in Selma, Alabama, and his contributions to the passage of the landmark Voting Rights Act; it observed that ``John Lewis is an American hero and a giant of the Civil Rights Movement.'' The medal will be presented early next year.  On the same day, Congressman Lewis was also honored by the Lyndon Baines Johnson Foundation as the inaugural recipient of the LBJ Liberty and Justice for All Award. The award marks Congressman Lewis's lifelong commitment to the founding principles that were the watchword of the Civil Rights Movement. It also recognizes the determined legislative leadership that enabled President Johnson to turn the movement's moral vision into political action. The LBJ Foundation honored Congressman Lewis for ``his dedication to the highest ethical standards and moral principles [which] has won him the admiration of many of his colleagues on both sides of the aisle in the United States Congress.''  I am among those colleagues who have taken regular inspiration from the force of John Lewis's example. He has my sincere congratulations on these recent honors.                          ____________________
