Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today to pay tribute to a truly remarkable man, Mr. Tony Zale. Tony passed away on March 20, 1997, in Portage, IN, at the age of 83. He was a man well known for his accomplishments as a champion boxer, contributions to his community, and devotion to his friends and family.  Tony was a champion boxer, fittingly remembered as ``the Man of Steel'' for both his steel-like ability to withstand and deliver powerful blows in the boxing ring, and his association with a city priding itself on its massive steel production. A native of Gary, IN, Tony began his successful boxing career in 1934 upon leaving his job as a steelworker at age 21. After experiencing a string of losses early in his career, Tony Zale first displayed his extraordinary desire to achieve when he returned to steel work at U.S. Steel in 1935. Willingly accepting the most physically challenging jobs in the mill, Tony returned to boxing in 1937 with a renewed confidence and a physique so muscular it was renowned to be ``metallic.'' Shortly thereafter, Mr. Zale's ambition of becoming a champion boxer was fulfilled when he defeated the National Boxing Association champion in July 1940. In 1941, Tony earned universal recognition as a world titleholder as he defeated World Middleweight Champion, Georgie Abrams. When returning from his service with the U.S. Navy in 1945, Tony faced his most dangerous challenger, Rocky Graziano, for what would be the first of three brutal matches. Winning the first match, losing the second, and then regaining his title in the third, Tony Zale forever marked his place in history as a champion boxer during the epic Zale-Graziano fights. When Tony retired from boxing in 1948, he left the profession with the accomplishment of fighting and beating every contender in the middleweight division during his championship reign from 1941 through 1948. During the 1950's Tony Zale was inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame.  Tony put forth the same effort and dedication bettering the community in which he lived as he did during his boxing career. After retiring from boxing, Tony coached at the Chicago Park District youth boxing program, where he taught children the fundamentals of boxing, aswell as the fundamentals of living a good, clean life. Tony was a man devoted to teaching children the importance of education, and a coach remembered for his willingness to offer guidance both inside and outside of the ring. Other community service initiatives in which he participated include serving as a Catholic Youth Organization boxing coach, promoting youth boxing tournaments, and visiting with polio patients. Tony Zale was honored for his efforts in October 1990, when President George Bush presented him with the Presidential Citizen's Medal.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Mr. Tony Zale. His children, Mary Medeiros and Theresa Gassis, grandchildren, and nieces and nephews, can all be proud of his professional accomplishments, as well as his commitment to improving the quality of life for the residents of Indiana's First Congressional District. Tony Zale will always be remembered as a true leader and will remain a role model for generations to come.                          ____________________
