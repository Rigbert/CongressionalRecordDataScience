Speaker, I would ask the gentleman from California [Mr. Rohrabacher] if he would be kind enough to take a microphone. I would like to enter into a colloquy with him, and perhaps the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Stockman].  I think it is maybe perhaps important for us to explain to the membership and to the listening public that the only way we could get any vote on this matter was to enter a privileged resolution 2 weeks ago asking the Committee on Banking and Financial Services to discharge this bill to the floor. They had 14 days in which to do that, and we thank the chairman, the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Leach], and the ranking member, the gentleman from New York [Mr. Flake], for doing that.  Our wish would be to have a straight vote on disallowing the use of the Exchange Stabilization Fund for this purpose and to stop appropriated moneys and those funds from outflowing without a vote of Congress. We want a vote.  The fact is our own leadership on both sides of the aisle have not agreed to give us that vote. So I think it is important for the membership to understand this is a base hit. It is not a home run, but at least we are at first base.
