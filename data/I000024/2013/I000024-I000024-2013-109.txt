President, I think there is a little confusion on the floor. I have an amendment. I have talked to virtually everyone. In fact, I can't find one person opposed to it. It is very simple.  What I would ask is that I be able to set aside the pending amendment for the purpose of considering my amendment No. 1851. Let me make that and see if there is objection to that.
