President, I wish to thank the Senator from Minnesota. I certainly concur with his conclusion. We serve on the Judiciary Committee together. We both heard the testimony of Elena Kagan as well as had a chance to ask her questions and listen to her responses to other Senators. She is an extraordinarily talented woman who could bring to the Supreme Court a wealth of experience. I couldn't agree with the Senator from Minnesota more that the fact that she has not worn a judicial robe before does not in any way disqualify her. She has an exemplary resume.  I thank the Senator for noting the most important element here is that many of the arguments that have been used against judicial nominees in the past have evaporated on the other side of the aisle because the Roberts Court is in the midst of an activist phase--something they promised would never happen, and it has happened, but it has happened to the satisfaction of one part of the political spectrum, where there are fewer critics as a result.  I thank the Senator from Minnesota for his eloquent remarks in relation to Elena Kagan.                           Credit Card Reform  Mr. President, this morning I took a look at the Wall Street Journal Web site, and there was an article entitled ``The New Credit Card Tricks.'' I thought to myself, I hope my wife doesn't get a chance to see this because ever since last year when we reformed credit cards in America, I come home on the weekends to Springfield, IL, and my wife hands me a new envelope she has opened.  Guess what they are doing, Mr. Senator.  In that envelope will be the latest changes in our credit cards from these companies. I have to say we pay off our credit cards. We do our best and almost always pay them off on a monthly basis. We have a pretty good credit rating--maybe not the best but a pretty good one. Yet we have been receiving notices for the last year from these credit card companies about changes and to read the contract. I wear these glasses, but I need a magnifying glass to read the contract, and I am a lawyer. Trying to understand what they are doing to me is very hard. But then in bold print you will see an interest rate number that has just gone up or a charge that has just gone up.  My wife said to me: What is this all about? I thought you reformed credit cards.  This morning's Wall Street Journal, in an article entitled ``The New Credit Card Tricks,'' tells the story about what has been happening since 2009 when we decided to reform credit cards. Well, as one man said, whose name is Victor Stango and who is an associate economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago--he has been analyzing the Credit Card Reform Act, and he said it is a race between regulators writing ever more complex laws and credit card companies setting up evermore complex fees.  Just to give an idea of what we are talking about, the article says:       So the banks are getting aggressive. According to a July 22      report from Pew Charitable Trust, a nonpartisan research      group, the industry's median annual fee on bank credit cards      jumped 18 percent to $59 between July of 2009 and March of      this year, 2010.  Credit unions, which are often viewed as the hometown, smalltown mom-and-pop, closest to the people, your best friends when it comes to banking--listen to this:  At credit unions, annual fees soared 67 percent in that same period to $25. During the same period, the median cash-advance and balance-transfer fees jumped by 33 percent.  So it isn't just a matter of raising fees; it turns out they are raising them at a gallop, at a fast rate, trying to get ahead of the credit card reform bill.  They have also dreamed up a dozen different ways to beat the law. Give us a year, they said, so we can change our books and get everything ready for the new credit card reform. They spent their year with their lawyers and accountants dreaming up new ways to avoid the law. We should have known it. We shouldn't have given them all this time.  They have dreamed up something called professional cards. These are like corporate cards but carry the same terms as consumer cards and they aren't covered under the new law. They are reinventing the credit card with a new name and a higher fee and a higher interest rate, and they skirt around the laws we passed.  We said in the law--incidentally, we stipulate that late-payment fees shouldn't be triggered on a Sunday or a holiday because you couldn't put anything in the mail. Well, here is a man, whom they talk about in this article, by the name of Alan Condon of Woodstock, GA. He ended up facing one of these penalty fees, and he noticed that the day it was triggered was a Sunday. He has read the new Credit CARD Act. That is not supposed to happen. You can imagine what it took for Mr.Condon to challenge the Discover Card, which eventually, after all of his protests, waived the late fee they charged him. How many people have that kind of determination to stick with it, as he did?  They have new cards such as a rebate card which, if you don't read it carefully, sounds like a great deal on a credit card and ends up taking money away from you.  I could go on and on.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in its entirety in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    [From the WSJ.com, Aug. 3, 2010]                     (By Jessica Silver-Greenberg)       Whomever President Barack Obama taps to head the new Bureau      of Consumer Financial Protection could find it difficult to      keep ahead of the credit-card industry.       The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and      Disclosure Act of 2009, known as the Card Act, was intended      to reshape the contours of consumer finance. Among other      things, it forces card issuers to give customers more notice      about interest-rate increases and restricts certain      controversial billing practices such as inactivity fees.       Yet some of the biggest card issuers in the U.S., including      Citigroup Inc., J.P Morgan Chase & Co. and Discover Financial      Services, are already rolling out a slew of fees designed to      recapture some of their lost income, in part by skirting the      new rules. Some banks may even be violating the law outright,      say consumer advocates.       ``Card companies are figuring out how to replace old fees      with new ones,'' says Victor Stango, an associate economist      with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and a professor at      the University of California, Davis, who has been analyzing      how the Card Act will affect consumer banking. ``It's a race      between regulators writing ever-more-complex laws and credit-     card companies setting up ever-more-complex fees.''       The banks have a big gap to fill. The Card Act is expected      to wipe out about $390 million a year in fee revenue,      according to David Robertson, the publisher of industry      newsletter Nilson Report. On July 16, during its second-     quarter earnings call with analysts, Bank of America Corp.      Chief Financial Officer Charles Noski warned that the Card      Act and other regulatory changes would prompt the bank, the      nation's largest in assets, to write off up to $10 billion in      the third quarter.       ``If you have every major issuer saying that we are losing      our shirt, then that speaks volumes,'' Mr. Robertson says.      ``Proportionately, these fees should be understood as almost      inconsequential compared to the losses.''       So the banks are getting aggressive. According to a July 22      report from Pew Charitable Trusts, a nonpartisan research      group, the industry's median annual fee on bank credit cards      jumped 18% to $59 between July 2009 and March 2010. At credit      unions, annual fees soared 67% to $25. During the same      period, the median cash-advance and balance-transfer fees      jumped by 33%.       All of these increases are perfectly legal, of course.      Banks and other issuers would have a difficult time extending      credit to consumers, even at high interest rates, if they      couldn't augment those revenues with fee income. ``We're      coming out of a deep recession that issuers are still working      through,'' says Peter Garuccio, a spokesman for the American      Bankers Association.       But some banks may be going too far. In a July 7 letter to      the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which      regulates many of the biggest U.S. banks, a coalition of      consumer groups including the National Consumer Law Center,      the Consumer Federation of America and Consumer Action      flagged several ``potential violations of the Credit Card      Act.''       Other banks are ramping up their marketing of so-called      professional cards. These are like corporate cards but can      carry the same terms as consumer cards--and aren't covered      under the new law. In the first quarter of this year, issuers      sent out 47 million professional-card offers to U.S.      households, up from 13.2 million in the corresponding period      last year, according to research firm Synovate.       ``This can be a very easy way around the Card Act,'' says      Josh Frank, a senior researcher at the Center for Responsible      Lending, a consumer group.       The upshot: Borrowers must be more vigilant than ever--even      before they make their first charge on a new credit card.                         Saddled With Late Fees       Alan Condon of Woodstock, Ga., says he carefully reviews      his card statements each month, and even read the Card Act--     all 33 pages--after it was passed in May 2009.       Among other things, the Card Act stipulates that late-     payment fees shouldn't be triggered on a Sunday or holiday,      when there is no mail delivery.       The rule ``is clearly meant to offer cardholders some      semblance of relief so that they don't get saddled with late      fees for making a reasonable payment on the next business      day,'' says Chi Chi Wu, a consumer credit lawyer at the      National Consumer Law Center.       Mr. Condon says he was shocked when he opened his credit-     card statement dated June 18 and saw that Discover had      charged him $39 for a late payment--and had upped his      interest rate on future purchases from 17% to 24.99%. He says      the company considered him late because he paid on June 14,      instead of June 13, a Sunday.       ``I just got mad,'' says the 56-year-old computer-software      developer, who says he had never before been late on a      Discover payment.       ``We were in compliance with the Card Act,'' says Discover      spokesman Matthew Towson. ``The law states that if a creditor      does not receive or accept payments on weekends or holidays,      then the date is extended. But we accept payments seven days      a week.''       Nevertheless, Discover reviewed Mr. Condon's account at The      Wall Street Journal's request and decided to waive the late      fee and reduce Mr. Condon's interest rate to its earlier      level.       The Card Act also stipulates that issuers can't jack up      rates on existing balances unless a cardholder is at least 60      days late. But there is a creative maneuver around that: the      so-called rebate card.       Citibank rolled out rebate-card offers to some of its      customers last fall, offering to refund up to 70% of finance      charges when customers pay on time. The problem: Rebate      offers aren't governed by the Card Act, and an issuer can      revoke them suddenly and hit cardholders with high charges.       The net result is the same as raising rates--and because it      is perfectly legal, customers have little recourse. ``Rebates      on finance payments may seem like a good deal, but you could      end up with a very high interest rate suddenly,'' says Mr.      Frank, of the Center for Responsible Lending.       ``The rebate offer is clear, transparent, and we believe      fully within the spirit of the Card Act,'' says Citigroup      spokesman Samuel Wang.       Shortening the billing cycle is another new tactic some      banks may be using. The Card Act requires companies to      provide a window of at least 21 days from when a statement is      mailed and when payment is due.       Yet the National Consumer Law Center and Consumer Action      say they have received complaints from borrowers who allege      that their billing cycles have been shortened to fewer than      21 days.       ``Since the passage of the act, we've heard from numerous      borrowers alleging that they are shortchanged on billing      cycle time,'' says Joe Ridout, a consumer-services manager at      Consumer Action.                         Inactivity Fees Return       As expected, issuers also are raising basic fees in the      wake of the Card Act, in some cases significantly. Many      credit-card companies, for example, are increasing their      balance-transfer charges sharply. ``We are seeing an increase      across the board in fees because card companies are sensitive      about their ability to price for risk,'' says Mr. Robertson      of the Nilson Report.       Last June, for example, J.P. Morgan's Chase unit alerted      customers that its maximum balance-transfer fee was rising to      5% from 2% on a wide range of its cards.       ``In a higher-loss environment, it's important that we are      prudent with our balance-transfer offers,'' says Stephanie      Jacobson, a spokeswoman for the bank. She adds that ``We      often do have lower rates in a competitive marketplace.''       Companies are raising their minimum finance charges, too.      Before the Card Act, the average minimum monthly finance      charge was about 50 cents, according to Nick Bourke, director      of the Safe Credit Card Project at Pew. Now, he says, those      fees can reach $1.50.       That difference might not seem like a lot, but it adds up.      Borrowers pay $430 million a year in minimum-finance charges      alone, according to the Center for Responsible Lending.       The Card Act's provisions are being implemented in stages,      with the last phase taking effect on Aug. 22. After that,      issuers will no longer be able to charge ``inactivity fees,''      or extra charges for people who don't spend a certain amount      each year.       So companies are dressing them up in other ways.       Citigroup, for example, has started charging some of its      customers an annual fee, which can be waived if a customer's      card activity exceeds $2,400 a year.       Tristan Denyer of San Francisco says he was surprised when      he got a notice that Citigroup was instituting a $60 annual      fee on his card. Mr. Denyer, 37, a senior Web designer, says      he rarely carried a balance on his card, and refused to rack      up the $2,400 in charges necessary to erase the fee.       ``I figured this was just a tactic to get me to spend more      and give them more money,'' Mr. Denyer says. He says he      decided to close his account.       Citigroup's Mr. Wang acknowledges that Card Act rules      forbid the waiving of annual fees based on ``a customer's      annual spending on the card.'' He adds, however, that ``the      rules will not prohibit cash-back rewards or similar      incentives that encourage account usage.''       Another potential trap: low-credit-limit cards, which are      popular among college students.       The Card Act says a card's total annual fees can't exceed      25% of a borrower's credit line. But some issuers may be      evading the fee restrictions by charging an      upfront processing fee that doesn't fall under the 25%      cap.       First Premier Bank, headquartered in Sioux Falls, S.D.,      offers several low-credit-     limit cards. Its Centennial card comes with a $300 limit and      a $95 upfront processing fee.       Melinda Robinson of Lorena, Texas, learned firsthand how      rapidly fees could eat into her credit limit. After receiving      a card with a $250 credit limit from First Premier, she says,      she was immediately charged $170 in combined fees. When she      tried to use the card for the first time, she exceeded her      credit limit, triggering more fees.       ``When they first send you the card, they automatically      charge you fees that eat up half of it,'' says Ms. Robinson.       First Premier Bank's president and chief executive, Miles      Beacom, says the $95 processing fee doesn't violate the Card      Act because it is assessed before the account is opened. He      adds that the fee offsets the risk associated with offering      these cards to ``high-risk individuals.''       Foreign-transaction fees are on the march as well. The      average fee for foreign transactions has jumped to 3% of the      transaction from roughly 2% in 2008, according to Ben      Woolsey, director of marketing and consumer research at      Creditcards.com.       Some card holders are finding they don't even need to leave      their living room to get hit with a foreign-transaction fee.      Ruth Ann Sando, a small-business owner in Washington, says      she has been burned repeatedly on her Visa card issued by      Pentagon Federal Credit Union, the third-largest credit union      in the U.S.       Ms. Sando used to do a lot of business with AbeBooks, an      online retailer. But she found that she was getting hit with      foreign-transaction fees even though her purchases were in      dollars. That is because while the seller and shipper were      based in the U.S., Abe, headquartered in Canada, provides the      forum for book sellers and collects a portion of the proceeds      from all sales.       So late last year, Ms. Sando says, she decided to stop      buying from the site altogether. ``Not buying books is the      only way I can protest the fee,'' she says.       ``The fee is legal, but all these fees circumvent the [Card      Act's] goal of clear and straightforward pricing,'' Mr.      Woolsey says.       Pentagon Federal Credit Union says some of its cards carry      a foreign-transaction fee of 2% of the U.S. dollar amount of      the transaction.                             Fighting Back       While the credit-card landscape may seem littered with      landmines, there are ways to guard against some of the worst      pitfalls. The first and simplest: Make your card payments on      time.       Second, say consumer advocates, people should dispute fees      directly with the issuer when they believe something is      amiss.       ``Cardholders would be surprised at how much they can raise      hell and get a change,'' says Mr. Condon, who says he      immediately contacted Discover after the late charge appeared      on his statement.       They might have to make repeated calls, however.       ``While the Credit Card Act did make great strides in      protecting consumers, it in no way closed all avenues for      cardholders to get hit with fees,'' says Ms. Wu, from the      National Consumer Law Center. ``It's a first step.''
