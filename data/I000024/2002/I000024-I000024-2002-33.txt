Editor:     Chicago Tribune       Your editorial of 8 May, ``Killing the Crusader'' provided      your readers with a very one-sided view of the ongoing debate      over the wisdom of killing the Crusader. There is another      side to the argument based upon my experience as a commander      of infantry, armor and airborne units in peace and in war in      many parts of the world.       You posed the question of Crusader as a battle of a      visionary Secretary of Defense against backward Cold War      thinking generals, entrenched bureaucrats and members of      Congress interested only in jobs in their districts.      Secretary Rumsfeld did assert that he wanted to kill the      program so the money could be invested in new technologies      for a more modern force. He has not yet identified his vision      of the conflicts of the future nor of the technologies that      would lead us there quickly.       The Crusader is not a Cold War leftover. It was designed      and initiated after the Gulf War to address a long-standing      shortfall in the range and rate of fire over our known and      potential adversaries (Yes, Russian artillery has had a      longer range and a higher rate of fire than US artillery      since World War II and provided it to Iraq). Division      commanders from the Gulf War rated an improved howitzer as      the most important deficiency to be addressed. The 1960's      howitzer, upgraded several times, slowed the advance of our      forces since it couldn't keep up. You were right in saying      the old Paladin needed to be replaced but wrong in saying the      Crusader would be obsolete by the time it's fielded. There is      nothing identified nor started to replace the Crusader and      there probably won't be anything for years to come.       Eventually all this comes down to taking a risk. Trading      Crusader for some hopeful technology of the future puts the      risk on the ground soldier. If Secretary Rumsfeld is      fortunate and we have no unexpected conflicts before his      revolutionary force is fielded then it will be a risk worth      taking. If the next conflict (and we have a hard time      predicting them) involves some serious ground combat (Iraq?)      then the soldiers and not the bureaucrats nor generals will      feel the effects of the risk.       We can have a new revolutionary force in the future but we      need to retain a trained, ready and equipped force in the      interim. Both the Secretary of Defense and the Congress play      a role in this process. It should not be a battle between      them. Soldiers could suffer.           Sincerely,     John W. Foss,       Gen, US Army (Retired), Former Commander of the 82nd      Airborne Division and the XVII Airborne Corps.                                  ____     Editor:     Los Angeles Times       The op-ed article by Michael O'Hanlon on May 9, ``Killing      the Crusader,'' suffers many of the same ailments found in      many such writings; he is only half right. He is exactly     correct when he notes that the Crusader advanced artillery      system could help in a situation like Korea. I would quickly      add Iraq. In fact, potential hostilities in Korea or Iraq      only highlight the value of a versatile system such as the      Crusader.       His error comes in saying Crusader is designed just to slug      it out with the Soviet Union in Central Europe. Quite the      contrary is true; the lethality, versatility and 21st century      technology of this weapon makes it an imperative for      supporting our forces on any future battlefield.       As a nation we do not have the luxury of picking our      adversaries. Rather, recent history shows that America must      expect the unexpected. A case in point is Operation Anaconda      in Afghanistan, which would have benefited greatly from the      Crusader--which is highly mobile, can fire faster and farther      with extreme accuracy, and outdistances current artillery.       Likewise, all conflicts in the future will not involve neat      and clean battlefields where air power or other systems like      long-range rockets will be constantly available or useful. We      must have the firepower to take out air defenses,      communications, drive out entrenched enemies, provide lethal      cover for our ground troops, and operate in all types of      weather with either volume or precision fires.       Speaking from the perspective of a Marine and from our      nation's experience in Desert Storm, I know first-hand that      we must support troops on the ground with overwhelming      firepower under all conditions--including the times when air      power is not available. That, in precise terms, captures the      unpredictable threats of the new century that make Crusader      so absolutely essential.     Gen. Richard Neal,       Former Assistant Commandant, U.S. Marine Corps, Deputy      Director of Operations, Desert Storm.                                  ____                                                 November 5, 1997.     Mr. Philip Odeen,     Chairman, National Defense Panel, Crystal Mall 3, Suite 532,          Arlington, VA.       Dear Sir: We have followed with interest your recent      comments about the need for a ``transformation strategy'' for      the Department of Defense and the nation's armed forces. We      understand your focus on trend lines and their impact on      force structure, personnel savings, readiness, and training.      It is with these points in mind that we write, to clarify      what we believe are some critical misconceptions about the      Army's advanced field artillery system and its contribution      to the future Army.       As you know, the Army is a leader in taking charge of its      future through near-term evolution to Army XXI and then      possible semi-revolution in Army After Next. The Army sees      Army XXI digitized, mechanized forces as it ``cord'' force,      while a more revolutionary light, super-mobile, elite      ``battle force'' might served a halting and fixing capability      in Army After Next. None of us knows how this concept will      finally play out, but we do see Crusader as an essential part      of any Army XXI and and AAN decisive fighting force.       The Crusader system is a technological leap-ahead,      achieving the first U.S. Army artillery overmatch since the      end of World War II. Its mobility unleashes the combined arms      team . . . a role that its predecessor, Paladin, cannot fill      . . . just as the Bradley fighting vehicle enabled the      maneuver force to exploit the mobility of the Abrams tank.      Crusader is an essential component of Information Dominance.      Fielding it allows us to fight with rapid, long-range fires      and to take maximum advantage of the digitization of the      maneuver force. This ``smart'' system knows where it is at      all times, computes its own fire missions, point the gun, and      fires the mission, under soldier supervision. No other system      approaches its ability to deal with the plethora of targets      generated in an information dominance environment.       Years of analysis, using varying threats and scenarios,      attest to the need for Crusader. Crusader is more than three      times as effective as the Paladin. With its technology      investment, the advanced field artillery system will provide      three times as much lethal fire support to the maneuver force      and survive three times as long as the system it replaces.      Its accuracy enhancements make it possible to achieve      effectiveness on a target-by-target basis by firing 32 to 50%      fewer rounds, depending on the nature of the target. In      comparison to other unique fire support means, like rockets,      Crusader is more economical by weight and cost. For example,      to achieve equal effects against a mechanized infantry      company, Crusader fires 30 rounds while MLRS fires seven      rockets. In terms of weight and cost of ammunition, Crusader      projectiles and propellant weigh 37% and cost 71% less than      the seven rockets. Analyses have shown that Crusader enhances      the contribution of both the cannon and rocket components of      the field artillery system.       Because Crusader exploits the capabilities of information      dominance and situation awareness, it enables the force to      engage more targets. In study after study, Crusader increases      overall force effectiveness by over 50%. This is an      unprecedented impact for a single weapon system. The awesome      contribution of Crusader, especially using precision      munitions, provides revolutionary gains in combat power that      challenge current maneuver-fire support assumptions.       You raised the potential for savings in force structure and      personnel through technology. The technology advances in      Crusader have enabled the Army, in anticipation of its      fielding, to already reduce the number of cannons per      battalion by 25% and the number of soldiers by 16%. When      Crusader is fielded, the Army will realize additional      manpower savings as every crew will be reduced in size to      three men who sit at cockpit-style workstations, are      supported by decision aids, and drive by wire. Automation has      removed the requirement for the crew to handle rounds and      propellant in firing and resupply.       These attributes have obvious strategic deployability and      logistical footprint implications. The force needs fewer      Crusaders, and those Crusaders kill many more targets using a      given amount of ammunition. Hence, the Army can deploy a      Crusader capability equal to Paladin's with 50% less      strategic and 38% less intratheater lift.       We see Crusader as vital to Army XXI and the mechanized      portion of Army After Next. Fielding Crusader clearly      addresses the issues you have raised, significantly      increasing force effectiveness while providing manpower,      sustainment, readiness and training cost savings over its      life cycle because of reduced personnel requirements,      automated systems, embedded training, and improving      reliability.

Senator John Warner,     Russell Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Warner, A too long personal letter and my      ``up-front'' apology for same . . . but an issue I feel      passionately about. I write to you as a warfighter with      almost 40 years in uniform that includes battery level combat      command in Vietnam, command of the 101st Airborne Division in      the Gulf War, and 3 years at CENTCOM and numerous operations      to include Iraq, Somalia, and Ethiopian wars; as a former      Vice Chief of Staff, U.S. Army with responsibilities for      managing the development of future Army systems and operating      under constrained budgets; as a Chairman of the Board and CEO      of a defense company headquartered in northern Virginia with      clear insights on the posture of our nation's industrial base      and finally, I write to you as native Virginian and you as my      Senator . . . a leader with a long career of public service      as Secretary of the Navy and leader in the SASC and Senate.       Failure to go forward with the CRUSADER howitzer program is      a national strategic mistake of proportions that principally      only Army and Marine leaders truly understand. Regretfully,      the issue in Washington today has become embroiled in      civilian control emotions and service in-fighting as each      postures for their future (roles and missions) while      recovering from years of budget downsliding. At the end of      the day, Congress is responsible for raising Armies and thus      my letter to you. I believe the following points are relevant      to the final CRUSADER decision:                               1. Balance       (A) There must be balance in our air and ground arm today      and tomorrow. Today, that means understanding the fog and      friction of war in ensuring that fires are always available      regardless of communication and intelligence failures, bad      weather or simply unavailability. Tomorrow, that means      understanding that our enemies will develop counteracting      strategies. We have a grand Air Force and my record shows I'm      a great supporter. But history is replete with examples of      enemy responses, whether it be enemy actions at Guadalcanal      impacting naval positioning and the continuous support of      committed marines (thus the dedicated Marine air arm today)      or the future, where the introduction of lasers on the      battlefield will undoubtedly impact the air delivery of      ordnance and other air platforms performing intelligence,      command and control, and air defense missions. Are we no      longer to have howitzers as a major contributor to the fight?      Balance . . . a requirement today and tomorrow.       (B) There must be balance between precision missiles and      high explosive (HE) precision and non-precision munitions in      support of soldiers and marines requesting ``close support      fires''. The battlefield today requires precision and massed      area fires delivered simultaneously over vast distances to      suppress enemy air defenses, prepare landing zones for      airborne and air assault forces, and defeat massed forces.      And at times our forces require diversified munitions and      continuous close fires to ``disengage'' from the enemy and      often this is a mix of smoke, HE, white phosphorus,      illumination and other munitions. And somewhere in all of      this is the need to understand costs. Bombs, missiles, and      howitzer delivered munitions each provide balance and are      needed. But when it comes to truly close continuous fires, it      is cannon field artillery delivered munitions that a soldier      or marine principally uses due to safety, the angle of fall      of the projectile, and their organic control.       (C) Currently allies and adversaries are rapidly developing      a mixture of missile and gun solutions that ensure balance.      European, Chinese, and middle eastern and Gulf armies are      increasingly procuring advanced self-propelled artillery.      Today the U.S. Army is comparatively far down (9th) on the      list of cannon artillery and our most advanced system (the      Paladin) is 40 years old. It is interesting to note, that our      Navy (which has been thru numerous examinations of guns      versus missiles) has the very essence of CRUSADER embedded in      its approach to the advanced gun system for the DD(X), and      our Marine Corps is vigorously enhancing its regiments with      advanced howitzers and HIMARS, and it has its own organic air      support. Balance!     2. Transformation, Modernization and Readiness, and deterrence       (A) CRUSADER is a transformation system and its fits      perfectly in the Army's Objective Force. It is a ``far      different'' system than that described only two years ago.      Its weight has been cut by a third; its crews save manpower,      its technology is unmatched. As such, the Army has already      changed its future manning and equipment documents to      realized these breakthroughs and capabilities by eliminating      tanks, personnel careers, howitzer sections and personnel      from its requirements. This CRUSADER howitzer is on time and      target in terms of its production milestones and is      performing magnificently in tests. Its cost as a major weapon      system is a modest $9-11 billion well below the cost of other      service systems.       (B) Many call for skipping a decade of systems. We have      already done that many times over. We will never field      systems if we continue to kill them just as they are ready to      go into full-scale production after years of work by our      industrial base. Some say, ``move the technologies to the      tech base or to a new FCS system'' ..., yet nothing really      exists except draft concepts on paper and vu-graphs. It will      be years before the next prototype system is available. Thus,      once again we delay modernizing the force introducing cost      readiness problems and, importantly, weakening our industrial      base. The wealth of engineering excellence assembled around      the CRUSADER program will be lost, rapidly impacting armored      vehicle industrial base capabilities which today principally      resides in only two companies. Deterrence has many      components. The presence of modernized heavy land forces and      a solid industrial base are not lost on our adversaries.       (C) Today, we all understand the advent of asymmetric      warfare. We predicted years ago that it was coming.      Nevertheless, we should not lose perspective that the future      will involve combinations of asymmetric, conventional, and      WMD actions. We should note the pictures of armored vehicles,      tanks, and artillery in the latest city fighting in the      Middle East. Skipping decades to meet threats of the future      briefs well. World events have never allowed us to do that      and there is not nearly enough money in the world to      transform entire Armies in short duration. Thus, we've always      modernized systems and parts of systems and then fought them      in high-low mixes of heavy and light forces and mixtures of      modernized and un-modernized systems based on the spectrum of      conflict. Today, it is Iraq, Korea and Afghanistan. Tomorrow      it could be Colombia, Iran, Taiwan, China, a different      emerging Russia or the entire set of Middle East nations.      Whoever would have even been close to predicting our      deployments from Desert Storm to Enduring Freedom during the      past 10 years? Deterrence is a major price of our national      strategy and CRUSADER'S role in support of Army forces is a      key visible ingredient to that strategy.       Finally, this decision has become a very personal at the      highest levels. Regretfully, it started with a Presidential      campaign debate with uniformed aides beating the agenda for      change, long before discussions with seasoned warfighters      would or could take place. Courage to admit that the CRUSADER      system has radically changed since that time, and that there      is a clear need for the system in an uncertain world (by our      leadership) would only raise one's respect for their wisdom.      The Army has always been transforming. Transformation in form      of revolutionary or evolutionary approaches will only survive      when wisdom dominates national security decision-making. This      is a dangerous, complex business. Wisdom is ``Balance''      learned from history. Wisdom is understanding the      complexities of modernization and its impact on readiness and      deterrence. Wisdom is listening to warfighters and      professionals who have spend their lifetime fighting and      studying the art of war. CRUSADER cuts across all of these      issues today.       Thursday, you will speak at the graduation of the Class of      2002, at the Virginia Military Institute...many of these      graduates will very shortly be leading soldiers and marines      in ground combat. I hope they will be provided the      ``balanced'' fire support to do their job. I also hope they      will never have to lead our nation's youth in combat because      deterrence worked. The wise decision resoundingly supports      fielding CRUSADER as soon as possible.           Sincerely,     J. Binford Peay.                                  ____                                                     May 16, 2002.       To the Members of the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of      Representatives:       The misinformation filling newspapers concerning the      Crusader program is troubling. Decisions to support military      transformation are key and must be reached through fact and      analysis.       Crusader is a smart gun. Its development began in 1995,      after the Cold War ended and Iraq was defeated. Crusader was      a key part of then Army Chief General Gordon Sullivan's      vision to digitize land forces around the power of the      microprocessor. Furthermore, Crusader has been specifically      redesigned for C17 deployability, refuting the popular myth      that it is too heavy for 21st Century operations. For      example, Crusaders could have been on the ground in      Afghanistan in less than 24 hours.       As we have heard repeatedly from the U.S. Army's      leadership, land forces need cannon artillery to provide      dedicated responsive fires in support of soldiers on the      ground around the clock, and in all weather. Precision      strikes from bombers, missile systems, and unmanned aerial      vehicles will complement, not substitute for Crusader's      capability. The decision to terminate Crusader should be      based on an analysis of alternatives using defined strategy      and scenarios, which includes a thorough assessment of cost      effectiveness and technology risk.       The Crusader program is on cost, on schedule, and exceeding      performance objectives. This system has already fired over      6,000 rounds and demonstrates ranges exceeding 40 kilometers,      rates of fire beyond 10 rounds per minute, and three times      the lethality of currently fielded systems. Crusader also      brings proven technologies in leading-edge robotics, sensor-     to-shooter architecture, crew cockpits, and advanced      materials.       The taxpayers of this nation have invested nearly $2      Billion in the development of Crusader. At a minimum, this      model program deserves a thorough assessment before it is      canceled and America's investment is thrown away. More      importantly, the soldiers of today and tomorrow should be      assured that the decision to terminate Crusader is based on      compelling evidence that proposed alternatives will be there      to provide the same needed responsive precision fires on      future battlefields--we know not where, when, or under what      circumstances.           Sincerely,                                            Frank C. Carlucci,                                            John M. Shalikashvili,                                              General, USA (Ret.).
