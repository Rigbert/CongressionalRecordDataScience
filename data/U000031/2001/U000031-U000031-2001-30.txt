Speaker, I rise today to honor the 50th Anniversary of one of the finest radio stations in my state of Michigan, and indeed the entire Midwest, WMUK, of Kalamazoo, Michigan.  Like many of our country's greatest institutions, WMUK had modest beginnings. In 1951, based on the campus of what was then Western Michigan College, WMUK was founded under the call letters WMCR. WMCR was only on the air for a few hours each day and early programming consisted of music and instructional programs. At the time, WMCR was a pioneer in radio. As such, it was the first FM station in Kalamazoo.  Over the years, WMCR's development mirrored the growth of Kalamazoo. For example, in 1961, WMCR changed their call letters to WMUK to reflect Western Michigan College's name change to Western Michigan University. A few years later, in 1965 WMUK was the first radio station in Kalamazoo to begin broadcasting in stereo. Over the years, as the station's popularity has grown so has their signal strength. From a meager 400 watts in 1951, today, WMUK broadcasts at 50,000 watts.  Today, after 50 years, WMUK is a cornerstone of the Kalamazoo community. I am pleased to say that WMUK is now on the air 21 hours a day offering a wide variety of programming to suit the diverse tastes of our community.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that these remarks be made part of the permanent record of theCongress so that other public broadcasters can emulate the quality example that WMUK has set across our country.                          ____________________
