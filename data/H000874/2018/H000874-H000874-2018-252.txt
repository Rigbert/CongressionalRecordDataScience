Speaker, I rise to mark the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Patuxent River Naval Air Station in Maryland's Fifth District. On April 1, 1943, the Navy formally commissioned the installation, marking the start of Pax River's long and storied contribution to the defense of our nation in times of both war and peace.  Over the past three quarters of a century, history has been made at Pax River again and again. The XP59-A, America's first all-jet aircraft, was first tested at Pax River in 1944. The flight test program launched in the late 1940's and expanded in the 1950's trained many of our nation's top military flight test pilots, including the members of NASA's Mercury 7 program. In the 1960's, several key developments in helicopter technology, surface-to-air missile systems, navigational equipment, and ordinance came out of Pax River and its innovative workforce specialized in development and testing. In 1983, Lt. Colleen Nevius became the first woman to graduate from the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School, making history at Pax River once again. The Naval Air Systems Command moved to Pax River in 1998,making the installation the center of naval aviation.  Today, Pax River continues to play an outsized role in our defense and in the development and testing of new naval air systems. With the advent of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology and the emergence of Southern Maryland as a UAV development hub, Pax River will surely continue to lead the way into the future of naval aviation. I've been proud to support these efforts in Congress in recent years.  Pax River has been so successful throughout its history not only because of the men and women who have served there but because of the strong support for the installation in the local community. All of Southern Maryland is proud of the work being done at Pax River, and St. Mary's County residents tell me all the time how honored they are to host it. The local alliances that have sprung up over the years to bring military, business, and local community leaders together have enriched life both on and off the base.  I hope my colleagues in this House will join me in paying tribute to all who have made the Patuxent River Naval Air Station a success for seventy-five years, and I join in celebrating this milestone anniversary.                          ____________________
