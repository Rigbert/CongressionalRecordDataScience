 I think we work very well together.  I want to directly address something that he has said about the fairness of this split, particularly with respect to the size. I say to him, that isn't the issue. The issue is how the judges are split. I say to the Senator, this legislation splits the judges. The way in which it splits the judges is 15 judges for the ninth circuit, and 13 judges for the newly formed twelfth circuit. Now, the caseload means that the ninth circuit court judges have a 50 percent greater caseload per judge than do the twelfth circuit court judges.  The Senator and I discussed these kinds of issues a year or so ago. I hope you will recall when we were discussing this in the Judiciary Committee.  There is a letter dated July 18 of this year to Senator Reid from Chief Judge Procter Hug. What Judge Hug points out is:       Under the bill, the Ninth Circuit is to have 15 judges and      the Twelfth Circuit is to have 13 judges. The Ninth Circuit      would have a 50% greater caseload per judge than the Twelfth.  He goes on and shows the total for California, Nevada, Guam, Northern Marianas, with a total caseload of 5,448.       With 15 judges, the caseload per judge--363 cases, then the      caseload for Alaska, 204; Arizona, 891; Hawaii, 204; Idaho,      141; Montana, 175; Oregon, 626; Washington, 871, with a total      of 3,112.       With 13 judges, the caseload per judge--239 cases. That is      one of my big objections. One thing I would just bet my life      on is, as a product of a study, there will be a fairer      distribution of judges.
