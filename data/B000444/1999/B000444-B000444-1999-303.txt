 President, as our nation gratefully remembers the deceased men and women of our military, I have a special commemoration for this Memorial Day, 1999. This year, as brave American patriots willingly put themselves in ``harm's way'' to defend the values and national interests of all Americans in places like the Balkans and the Persian Gulf, I rise to remind my colleagues here in the United States Senate and the American people of one distinguished group of patriots who gave so unselfishly at a time when their rights of citizenship were restricted--the Navajo Code Talkers of World War II. I want to let everyone know how honored we Delawareans are to welcome to my state one of these Native American patriots and World War II veterans this Memorial Day weekend.  The Clarence Vinson-John Chason Post #3238 of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, in Camden, Delaware will have the distinct privilege of hosting Mr. Samuel Billison. Mr. Billison was one of the Navajo Code Talkers who helped the United States of America defeat the Axis Powers in the Pacific during World War II. Mr. Billison is traveling from Window Rock, Arizona to be the featured speaker at the May 31st Memorial Day observances being conducted by VFW Post #3238 at the Ceasar Rodney High School auditorium.  My state--the First State, the State that started our nation--has a long and proud history of celebrating the culture and accomplishments of Native Americans. It is only fitting, therefore, that Post Commander Mark Newman and Memorial Day Program Director Thomas E. Weyant sought out Mr. Samuel Billison, once one of the select Navajo Code Talkers.  Each Navajo Code Talker made an invaluable personal contribution to the success of our nation's effort in World War II to preserve freedom and democracy. What is most astonishing about this is that they were willing to take on the responsibilities of democracy at a time when they were not allowed to enjoy the full blessings and rights of democracy here at home.  Their communications contribution to World War II began in 1942 with a small group of 29 Navajos who shared their unique and unwritten language with the United States Marine Corps. Together they developed an unbreakable verbal code. By 1943, nearly 200 Navajo Code Talkers were dispersed to three combat divisions of the U.S. Marine Corps. As part of Marine Corps signal units, they participated through 1944 in the Pacific battles whose names bear witness to the honor and bravery of America's Marines--Bouganville, Tarawa, Cape Gloucester, the Marshall Islands, Saipan, Guam, and Peleiu.  As 1945 unfolded, all six divisions of the Marine Corps in the Pacific theater were using the distinctive skills and loyal services of approximately 400 Navajo Code Talkers. These brave Native Americans joined other courageous Marines to recapture Iwo Jima and Okinawa. In the first two days of the battle for Iwo Jima, Navajo CodeTalkers flawlessly translated over 800 messages. At the end of that month-long blood bath, it was Navajo Code Talkers who spelled out ``Mt. Suribachi'' as the flag was raised. By late 1945, the Navajo Code Talkers were serving with the occupation forces in Japan and China.  The historical accomplishments and story of the Navajo Code Talkers must be preserved and retold for future generations. These Native American communications experts used their native tongue to thwart the enemy; to expedite military operations for critical territory; and to save countless lives in combat. Learning their story and repeating it is more than a matter of historical accuracy and completeness, or even a matter of just recognition and gratitude. As my friend Tom Weyant pointed out--speaking, I believe, for all Delawareans--it is also critical that Americans enter the New Millennium understanding the community ethos and deep patriotism of the Navajos who fought in World War II. The Navajos saw that ``pulling together'' was a matter of national survival. They gave unselfishly to defend ideals that even today, all we Americans still have not fully realized here in the United States, because the Navajos had faith that America would always continue to move toward the realization and fulfillment of those ideals.  Mr. President, we in Delaware salute the Navajo Code Talkers of World War II. They are unsung heroes who played a vital role in our ultimate success in the Pacific by providing a code which the Japanese never could decipher. While many knew that Native Americans faithfully served in the war, including Navajos, it was not until 1968 that the existence of this top-secret code was finally declassified and made public. Our entire country is indebted to Mr. Billison, to all the Navajo Code Talkers, and to the thousands of Native Americans from various tribes who served so loyally and selflessly in both the Pacific and European theaters of World War II. We must never forget the ultimate sacrifice these Native Americans were willing to make at a time when they and their families were not even allowed to vote or participate in the full fruits of American citizenship in several states.  Mr. Samuel Billison, the Navajo legacy of patriotism, the Navajo contribution of their unique skills, the Navajo heritage of heroism, and the Navajo example of love for America must be carried forward by us all. Your story embodies all that we Americans look for in our heroes today and that we revere in the rich tradition of our United States Marine Corps. To you and to all who served, I thank you.                          ____________________
