 President, I come here because I have spoken on this floor five times about methamphetamine. There is good news. I think it is stellar news. It is how this body can work together to solve what is a very real problem in America. I mentioned before that methamphetamine has been a major problem in the State of California. As a matter of fact, the DEA has determined that California is the ``source country'' for methamphetamine, much like Colombia is for cocaine. In Operation Pipeline, conducted by the DEA, 92.8 percent of all methamphetamine seized in a national drug operation actually originated in California. Hospital admissions are up, way above that for cocaine. Deaths are up. Medical costs are up. Methamphetamine has become a real problem and a national emergency.  Last June and July--that is 1995--I wrote to the Attorney General laying out the vast extent of the methamphetamine problem in California and asking her for proposals to crack down on this trade, especially on the precursor chemicals used to make methamphetamine.  Over the ensuing months, my staff and I worked with prosecutors, narcotics officers, and the California Department of Justice, in a bipartisan way, to try to develop solutions. In February of this year, Senator Grassley and I, along with Senator Reid, introduced the Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996. We had a bipartisan group of Senators which also included Senator Kyl. Representatives Fazio and Riggs in the House introduced the same bill.  In April, President Clinton announced his national methamphetamine strategy adding additional measures to attack meth. In July of this year, Senators Hatch, Biden, Grassley, and I and others introduced the bill which was passed last night, incorporating our earlier proposals. Frankly, thanks to Chairman Hatch and Senator Biden, I think this is a much better bill than the original bill we introduced.  I note with some interest that yesterday was Senator Grassley's birthday. How nice to have a birthday and at the same time to have a bill that you worked on which passed the Senate of the United States unanimously, and which will solve a major problem out there.  This would not have happened had it not been bipartisan. It would not have happened had it not been for the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the ranking member of that committee coming together to work on a problem. A lot of staffs were involved across the aisle. I think they worked in the best bipartisan way this body can muster to solve a real problem. That is practical.  You know, I often hear a lot about ideology around here. I have never been in a place that is more partisan than around here. Yet, the fact of the matter is, some problems take very conservative solutions, some take more innovative solutions, and most take just plain sitting down at a table and working out a solution. And that is methamphetamine.  So last night the Hatch-Biden-Feinstein-Grassley bill, known as the Methamphetamine Control Act, was passed.  Among some of the things it does is it adds seizure and forfeiture authority for precursor chemical violations.  It provides for stiff escalating civil penalties for the reckless sale of chemicals used to manufacturer methamphetamine.  It gives the Attorney General the authority to shut down chemical supply houses which provide chemicals to clandestine methamphetamine manufacturers.  It provides for restitution for the cost of cleaning up clandestine methamphetamine labs, which runs about $7,000, $8,000 a lab.  It allows the Attorney General to require, by regulation, reporting the sales of ordinary, over-the-counter, pseudoephedrine-containing products in quantities above 24 grams. This is really important because as there are controls on ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, which goes into over-the-counter cold medication, developed as a major source for methamphetamine makers to buy. So they would go into something like a Long's drugstore that has maybe 30 feet of display space of over-the-counter cold medication and they would buy maybe 5,000 packages, everything they could get their hands on, ring it up, not have to give a name, address, a driver's license, anything, and walk out, open the packages or bottles, get children to open the blister packs, and go into their clandestine labs and make methamphetamine.  This bill cracks down on that. I have heard that Long's, for example, is interested in being part of a major education program, which is provided for in this bill, to educate people and their own retail outlets about what is happening in methamphetamine.  I am very proud to say that pharmaceutical houses, like Warner-Lambert, became solidly in support of this legislation once they understood what was actually happening with their products.  So I think this bill is a Republican win; it is a Democratic win. It is a good, strong, tough bill. Amazingly enough, 2 months before a Presidential election, on a bipartisan basis, it passed the Senate of the United States. We hope it will be marked up either today or tomorrow in the House of Representatives and we will get something done.  Mr. President, you are a Republican. I am a Democrat. I happen to think this is what the people of America sent us both here to do. So I would like to send my warm congratulations to Chairman Hatch, to Senators Grassley, Kyl, Reid, most particularly to ranking member Senator Biden, whose staff worked very, very hard, and Senator Harkin, who came aboard and was supportive early on. This is important legislation. Oh, and, Mr. President, my staff just told me, you are part of this effort as well. Let me salute you and say thank you. Californians are grateful, and I think all of America will be as well. Thank you very much.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996                                findings       A. Methamphetamine is a very dangerous and harmful drug. It      is highly addictive and is associated with permanent brain      damage in long-term users.       B. The abuse of methamphetamine has increased dramatically      since 1990. This increased use has led to devastating effects      on individuals and the community, including:       1. A dramatic increase in deaths associated with      methamphetamine ingestion.       2. An increase in the number of violent crimes associated      with methamphetamine ingestion.       3. An increase in criminal activity associated with the      illegal importation of methamphetamine and precursor      compounds to support the growing appetite for this drug in      the United States.       C. Congress finds that illegal methamphetamine manufacturer      and abuse presents an imminent public health threat that      warrants aggressive law enforcement action, increased      research on methamphetamine and other substance abuse,      increased coordinated efforts to prevent methamphetamine      abuse, and increased monitoring of the public health threat      methamphetamine presents to the communities of the United      States.    title i.--importation of methamphetamine and precursor chemicals                  Sec. 101. International coordination       The Attorney General shall coordinate international drug      enforcement efforts to decrease the movement of      methamphetamine and methamphetamine precursors into the      United States.                      Sec. 102. Long arm provision       Imposes a maximum ten-year penalty on the manufacture      outside the United States of a list I chemical with intent to      import it into this country, by adding list I Chemicals to 21      U.S.C. Sec. 959(a).       This provision also makes it a crime to manufacture or      distribute a List I chemical aboard an aircraft or to possess      a List I chemical aboard an aircraft with the intention to      distribute it by adding List I chemicals to 21 U.S.C.      Sec. 959(b) (1) and (2).  title ii.--provisions to control the manufacture of methamphetamineSec. 201. Trafficking in precursor chemicals: seizure and forfeiture of                  precursor chemicals (List I chemicals)       Will amend various provisions of the Controlled Substances      Act and the Tariff Act of 1930 to permit seizure and      forfeiture of List I chemicals, even if the individual or      firm involved is a non-registrant, or by a registrant whose      registration has expired or been revoked or suspended.Sec. 202. Study and report on measures to prevent sales of other agents                    used in methamphetamine production       The Attorney General is required to conduct a study and      report to Congress on possible measures to effectively      prevent the diversion of red phosphorous, iodine,      hydrochloric gas and other agents for use in the production      of methamphetamine.    Sec. 203. Increased penalties for manufacture and possession of               equipment used to make controlled substances       Increases the penalties for the possession of equipment      used to make controlled substances to 10 years and a $30,000      fine for the first offense and 20 years and a $60,000 fine      for the second offense. Requires the Sentencing Commission to      ensure that the manufacture of methamphetamine in violation      of this section is treated as a significant violation.      Sec. 204. Addition of iodine and hydrochloric gas to List II       Adds iodine and hydrochloric gas to List II. Exempts iodine      from the importation provisions for listed chemicals, but      allows the Attorney General to impose these limitations, if      warranted, under the provisions of current law.  Sec. 205. Civil penalties for firms that supply precursor chemicals       Imposes civil penalties for the distribution of a      laboratory supply to a person who uses, or attempts to use      that laboratory supply to manufacture a controlled substance      or a listed chemical, if the distribution is done with      reckless disregard for the illegal uses to which a laboratory      supply will be put.       The civil penalties provided for in this provision are:       A. Up to $250,000 for the first violation, and       B. $250,000 or up to double the last previously imposed      penalty, whichever is greater, for any succeeding violation.                      Sec. 206. Injunctive relief       The Attorney General may commence a civil action under 21      U.S.C. Sec. 843 for appropriate relief, including a temporary      or permanent injunction to shut down the production and sale      of listed chemicals by individuals or companies that      knowingly sell precursor agents for the purpose of      methamphetamine production.       Any person convicted of a felony violation of Sec. 402. of      the Controlled Substance Act related to the receipt,      distribution, manufacture, exportation or importation of a      listed chemical may be enjoined from engaging in any      transaction involving a listed chemical for not more than 10      years.   Sec. 207. Restitution for clean up of clandestine laboratory sites       The court may order restitution for the costs associated      with the investigation and clean up of a clandestine      methamphetamine laboratory.       In addition, the court may order restitution for any person      injured as a result of the operation of a clandestine lab.                       Sec. 208. Record Retention       The record retention requirements for list I and II      chemicals are two years after the date of the transaction.                     Sec. 209. Technical Amendments       This section corrects misspellings of chemicals in the      Controlled Substances Act.  title iii.--increased penalties for trafficking and manufacture of                      methamphetamine and precursors                Sec. 301. Trafficking in methamphetamine       Sentencing scheme shall be comparable to crack cocaine: 5 g      pure methamphetamine=5 year mandatory minimum term (5-40      years); 50 g pure methamphetamine=10 year mandatory minimum      term (10-life).               Sec. 302. Illegal sale of listed chemicals       Increases the penalties for trafficking in listed chemicals      to the penalty corresponding to the quantity of controlled      substance that could reasonably have been manufactured      according to a table to be developed by the Sentencing      Commission.    Sec. 303. Enhanced penalty for dangerous handling of controlled              substances: Amendment of sentencing guidelines       Requires the Sentencing Commission to determine whether      current sentencing guidelines adequately punish violation of      environmental laws during the operation of clandestine labs.      If punishment is not adequate, the Sentencing Commission is      required to promulgate guidelines or amend existing      guidelines to provide an appropriate enhancement of the      punishment for a defendant convicted of such an offense.   title iv.--legal manufacture, distribution and sale of precursor                                chemicals                         Sec. 401. Retail Sales       Lawfully manufactured drug products are exempt from      regulation unless the Attorney General finds a need to      control them because of their diversion.       Reduces the single transaction reporting requirements for      all retail sales other than ordinary over-the-counter      pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine containing products      from 1,000 grams to 24 grams.       Defines ordinary over-the-counter pseudoephedrine or      phenylpropanolamine products as those sold in package sizes      of not more than 3.0 grams of pseudoephedrine base or 3.0      grams of phenylpropanolamine base, that is packaged in      blister packs when technically feasible, each blister      containing not more than two dosage units.       Except as defined below, the sale of ordinary over-the-     counter pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine products by a      retail distributor shall not be a regulated transaction.       The Attorney General may, following documentation that      ordinary over-the-counter pseudoephedrine and      phenylpropanolamine-containing products purchased via retail      sales constitute a significant source of precursor substance      used in the illegal manufacture of a controlled substance,      establish by a notice, comment and an informal hearing a      single-transaction limit of 24 grams of pseudoephedrine or      phenylpropanolamine base.       Any business or individual that violates the single      transaction limit, if established, will receive a warning      letter from the Attorney General for the first violation and,      if a business, shall be required to conduct mandatory      education of the sales employees of the firm with regard to      the legal sales of pseudoephedrine. For any second violation      occurring within 2 years of the first violation, the business      or individual shall be subject to civil penalty of not more      than $5,000. For any subsequent violation occurring within 2      years of the previous violation, the business or individual      shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed the amount      of the previous civil penalty plus $5,000.                   Sec. 402. Mail Order Restrictions       Each regulated person or entity who engages in a      transaction by mail with a non-regulated person involving      ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine shall, on      a monthly basis, submit to the Attorney General a record of      each such transaction conducted during the previous month.                    title v.--education and research            Sec. 501. Methamphetamine Interagency Task Force       Creates a Methamphetamine Interagency Task Force, headed by      the Attorney General with DoJ, HHS and non-governmental      experts in drug abuse prevention and treatment. This task      force will be responsible for designing, implementing, and      evaluating methamphetamine education, prevention and      treatment practices and strategies.                  Sec. 502. Public Health Monitoring.       Requires the Secretary, HHS to develop a public health      monitoring program to monitor methamphetamine abuse in the      United States. The program will include collection and      dissemination of data related to methamphetamine abuse, which      can be used by public health officials in policy development.               Sec. 503. Public-Private Education Program       Develop a Methamphetamine National Advisory Panel to      develop a program to educate wholesale and retail      distributors of precursor chemicals and supplies in the      identification of suspicious transactions and their      responsibility to report such transactions.                 Sec. 504. Suspicious Orders Task Force       Establishes a Suspicious Orders Task Force to develop a      proposal to define suspicious orders of listed chemicals and      to evaluate proposals for the development of an electronic      system for registrants to report suspicious orders.
