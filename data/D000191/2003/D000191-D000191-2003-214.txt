 billion for Iraq itself, and now $700 million of that is humanitarian assistance. But the rest is to help rebuild Iraq, and I will go into that in a moment.  But the thing is that the House is going to vote to borrow this money. We are not going to revisit the tax cuts. We are headed toward a record deficit this year; but we will not revisit the tax cuts, more than half of which in this House of Representatives are targeted toward the wealthiest in this country, those who earn over $273,000 a year, an average of $90,000 for every millionaire in those tax cuts. God forbid we should ask them to help contribute to this emergency, that we should reduce their tax cuts and not borrow this money but collect the funds from those who can afford to help contribute. But that is where this House of Representatives is headed.  The gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Emanuel) and I hope to offer an amendment. We will go to the Committee on Rules. I expect we will be denied, but our amendment in principle is very simple, and that is to say if the United States House of Representatives is going to borrow $1.7 billion to begin to implement contracts, which I have here, from the Federal Government of the United States to provide universal health care in Iraq, which of course 44 million Americans have no health insurance whatsoever, tens of thousands of Oregonians, to rebuild their highways and bridges, and we have a $4 billion bridge problem in Oregon, about a $270 billion bridge problem nationwide, we are going to borrow money to do that in Iraq. We are going to borrow to build 6,000 schools in Iraq when we do not have enough money to educate our kids here, and we are going to borrow money for a number of other things: airports, sewer, water, and a whole host of infrastructure. But guess what, there is not a penny in this bill for the economic recovery of the United States of America.  I lost another 800 jobs in my district today. Where is our assistance? Where is our economic stimulus? It is not in the tax cuts for the wealthy and trickle-down. It is not in borrowing more funds to fund this, driving us further in debt and ultimately driving up interest rates in this country. There is a more responsible way to approach this, and there is also a way to approach it so that we are responsible to the American people. Fund this by reducing the tax cuts or eliminating the tax cuts.  The United States of America is at war. This would be the first time in the history of our Nation that we have reduced taxes in a time of war, and we are reducing taxes at a time when we are headed already for a record deficit. We are looking at doubling the national debt probably in the next decade. We are going to have the economic profile of Argentina with a $500 billion trade deficit on top of this, but we are going to borrow the money.  And what are our kids going to come home to if we do not invest here in the United States of America? They are going to come home to the bill, not in the first couple of years they come home; but when they get a little bit older, they are going to come home to that bill. That bill is going to come home to them. And they may well not come home to good jobs because we are failing to stimulate the economy. We could act much more responsibly in this body in approaching this situation, but I fear we will not.  But I will go to the Committee on Rules. I will pretend that this is on the up and up and ask them to allow us a vote on the American Parity Act. That is to say, for every dollar we spend on health care, on schools, bridges, highways, water infrastructure, all needs well documented in our Nation and in Iraq, there should be a comparable dollar sent down to the States; and preferably this money should not come from borrowing. It should come from reducing tax cuts to the wealthiest among us who could at least do a little bit to help share this burden.                          ____________________
