 President, we may have 141 amendments, but they are not all equal. We are going to try to work our way through the major amendments in a serious way. This is a very important piece of legislation. The majority leader and I had a conversation earlier today on how to go forward. We will keep working on it in a systematic way and maximize a way for people to have votes on important amendments.
