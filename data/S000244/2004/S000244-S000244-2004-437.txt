Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, listening to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Inslee) I think shows the differences between those of us who support this legislation and those of us who oppose this legislation.  First, the example that he used relative to the professional baseball player who unfortunately passed away, this bill does not apply to. It is a complete unrelated argument and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Keller) has pointed that out. But the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Inslee) persists on using this as an example. And then the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Inslee) quotes the story of the press conference that was held yesterday relative to obesity catching up to tobacco as the number one killer of people in the United States of preventable conditions.  Now, the problem with that attitude is that those who espouse it expect the government to take over personal responsibility. The victim always finds someone else to blame for his or her own behavior. And what this bill does is that it says, do not run off and file a lawsuit if you are too fat and you end up getting the diseases associated with obesity. It says, look in the mirror, because you are the one who is to blame. And I have referred twice to a doctor in North Carolina and to the woman who is the president of the American Council on Fitness and Nutrition in saying that if you are obese, do not get a lawyer. See your doctor. See a nutritionist. See a personal trainer. And what this bill does is it will pin the responsibility of those whose job it is to correct the problem to begin with and that is the person who caused the condition which could have been preventable.  Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Keller).
