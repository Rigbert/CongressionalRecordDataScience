Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today and pay tribute to a celebrated community servant, Mr. Michael Stevens. On Friday, June 21, 1996, Michael, along with his friends and family, will celebrate his retirement from the Iron Workers Union Local No. 395 in Hammond, IN. This retirement dinner will be held at St. Elijah Serbian-American Hall in Merrillville, IN.  We are all fortunate to have dedicated people, like Michael, involved in the labor movement in Indiana's First Congressional District. Michael embarked on his distinguished career as an iron worker in local No. 392 in East St. Louis, IL, in June of 1966. He then moved to northwest Indiana and joined Iron Workers Local No. 395 in Hammond in September 1967.  In May, 1974, he suffered from a disabling fall on the job. During his convalescence, Michael earned a degree from Mineral Area College in Missouri. Following his graduation in June 1979, he returned to ironworking out of local No. 395 in September of that same year.  In 1981, Michael was elected to the local No. 395's examining board. In 1981, 1986, and 1991, Michael was elected to represent local No. 395 as a convention delegate. In 1984, Michael was elected as local No. 395's financial secretary-treasurer and he was reelected for three more terms in 1987, 1990, 1993. Michael retired this year after 30 years as a member of local No. 395, 15 years as an officer, and 4 terms as local No. 395's financial secretary-treasurer.  I offer my heartfelt congratulations to Michael, his wife, Bonnie, and his two children, Tina and Byron. They can all be proud, as Michael has worked arduously in the labor movement to make the American dream possible for others. Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to congratulate Michael, who has proven himself to be a distinguished advocate for the labor movement. I sincerely wish Michael a long, happy, and productive retirement.                          ____________________
