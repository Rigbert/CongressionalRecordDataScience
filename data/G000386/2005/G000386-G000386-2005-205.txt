  The Senator had an opportunity 2 weeks ago on the Deficit Reduction Act. All the things we had in there for the people who do not have health care the Senator had an opportunity to vote for and didn't.  Just to name a few of these: We had the Family Opportunity Act that would have helped 500,000 severely disabled children. The Senator voted against that. We had a vote against a bill in regard to the children's health insurance shortfall. The Senator voted against that. The Senator voted against an outreach and enrollment to get eligible children health care coverage for which they are entitled. If the Senator were serious about helping low-income people, the Senator would have voted for that because we took care of a lot of the children the Senator is talking about.
