 President, as we continue to discuss the farm bill, I would like to take a moment to congratulate a prominent member of the agricultural community in northeastern Kentucky. Hinton Mills in Fleming County is a family-owned and operated business celebrating 100 years of serving farm communities in our State.  Founded in 1918 by Frank L. Hinton in Goddard, KY, Hinton Mills began as a small general store for the rural community and was the first retailer in the area to recognize the need for a one-stop, full-service farm supply store. Since its doors opened, it has grown and transformed into a major feed supplier in the area. Under the family's constant care, Hinton Mills continued to expand and today has five locations in three counties. They also make deliveries to farm families in Kentucky and Ohio, providing important services to communities throughout the region.  Today, the family business is led by Bud Hinton of the third generation. As the president and CEO, Bud has reaffirmed Hinton Mills' commitment to the many small towns and rural communities it serves.  Continuing the tradition in the family, Bud's three sons joined the business and are currently vice presidents. Representing the fourth generation, Matt, Adam, and Nathan were all raised in Fleming County, and each of them brings unique skills and experiences to Hinton Mills. They are helping Frank Hinton's business and legacycontinue to thrive. For example, Matt brings a manufacturing background and has received his MBA. In 2015, Adam became Kentucky's first graduate of the American Farm Bureau Federation's Partners in Agricultural Leadership program, which is a national training program for advocates of agriculture. Nathan joined the family business directly out of college, earning a wealth of institutional knowledge. Their new perspectives help Hinton Mills embrace innovation as a way to better serve its customers, but they also maintain the bedrock traditions on which the company was built.  During its centennial celebration, Hinton Mills will showcase both its history and its potential for the future. Hosting 2 days of events, the family has invited members of the community to join them at their Plummers Landing location to visit exhibitions commemorating their company's history, while enjoying kids' games and even a cane pole fishing tournament. On the second day, they will host a tractor parade and a 1918-themed fair to reflect on how far they have come and to signal hope for their future. To top it off, the night will conclude with a fireworks spectacle. I think these festivities are a perfect way to mark 100 years of serving Kentucky farm communities.  I am honored to call the Hinton family my friends, and I admire their remarkable success in Kentucky. Our home State has a rich heritage of agriculture, and family-owned businesses like Hinton Mills are a great example of that tradition. It is my pleasure to congratulate the Hinton family on their many successes and to express my gratitude for all they do for Kentucky's farm communities. As they celebrate their centennial, I would like to wish them all the best, and I urge my Senate colleagues to join me.  (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered to be printed in the Record.)                          ____________________
