Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment today to praise Captain Michael Dougherty, presently the commanding officer at the Naval Air Engineering Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey.  Sadly, we will be losing the fine leadership of Capt. Dougherty at Lakehurst on June 24th. As he moves on to his next assignment as head of the Foreign Military Sales Office at the Naval Aviation Systems Command at Patuxent River, I wish him the very best of success.  Five years ago, Capt. Dougherty came to Lakehurst as the Project Coordinator for Support Equipment. He quickly rose to Head of the Aircraft Division Logistics Group, and in May 1997 after serving as Executive Officer, he assumed his current duties as Commanding Officer of the Naval Air Engineering Station at Lakehurst.  In addition to his duties as Commanding Officer, Captain Dougherty is also a family man, and is married to the former Alice Scherer, who works as a school nurse for Independent Child Study Teams of Jersey City. He is the proud father of four children: Maureen, Jill, Claire, and Kevin. Maureen is a graduate of Ithaca College, and Jill is a Midshipman in the Naval Reserves, and a junior at Holy Cross. Claire and Kevin are both students at Monsignor Donovan High School in Toms River.  Captain Dougherty took command of the base in 1997, in the wake of the Pentagon's unsuccessful attempt to close the Lakehurst Naval facility during the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) process. It fell to him to reassure Pentagon number crunchers, the BRAC commission and Congress that saving the base was indeed the best course for the Navy and American security interests. Captain Dougherty showed us the way.  Almost immediately, Capt. Dougherty organized the Community Partnership Program with State, County, and business leaders to broaden and deepen public/private awareness of Lakehurst's unique capabilities. Consequently, Captain Dougherty invited countless businesses and local governments to come visit the base to learn ways they can work more closely together on issues of common interest.  Lakehurst is a world-class facility with a priceless base of knowledge about engineering and advanced technologies relating to the successful operation of our aircraft carriers. Through his Community Partnering Program, Captain Dougherty has made available to the business community some of Lakehurst's technology, facilities, and personnel. For instance, under the program, if a business has a problem with a manufacturing process, they can come to Lakehurst for technical assistance in solving the problem. This has been a win/win situation for both the public and private sector. The local community now has increased access to advanced technological know-how and the base has expanded its solid reputation as a good neighbor. And in some instances the base has been able to reduce expenses as private contractors shared some of the operating costs. This is but a single example of Captain Dougherty's work to connect the local community to the base, and the base to the local community.  Captain Dougherty's partnering initiatives are epitomized by the success of the educational partnering agreement with Rowan University's School of Engineering. This agreement will give students at Rowan University invaluable hands-on experience on how to solve real world engineering problems. Through the interaction with Lakehurst's staff expertise, unique facilities, and equipment related to aircraft platform interface technology at Navy Lakehurst, the agreement will certainly strengthen the quality of engineering students at Rowan who participate in this program.  On the flip side, the Rowan-Lakehurst partnership helps Lakehurst to secure additional engineering talent from within the state to replace engineers at the base when they move on to other jobs or retire. The partnership also enables Lakehurst to tap into a huge network of expertise and knowledge at Rowan University, which will be vital if Lakehurst is to maintain its status in cutting-edge aircraft platform interace technology. This is yet another good neighbor, win-win situation adding to the list of successes Capt. Dougherty has brought to the base under his command.  These successful efforts have produced tangible results. The Lakehurst Naval Air Engineering Center is an important and integral part of the Ocean County economy and that of the surrounding region. Lakehurst is a $450 million dollar business, with about $10 million going directly to Ocean County. As the county's largest employer, the base provides jobs for 1,900 people. Captain Dougherty also has taken important steps to encourage the base to reexamine its purchases of many categories of goods and services, to see where it can expand its network of local contractors and service providers.  On issue after issue of importance to naval aviation, Captain Dougherty has demonstrated real leadership. He has been an advocate, as I have been, for the construction of a new, state-of-the-art Aircraft Platform Interface (API) laboratory at Navy Lakehurst. In fact, just last week my fellow members here in this chamber joined me in authorizing a new ``superlab'' for Lakehurst. The $15.7 million in funding authorization for the construction of a new API laboratory will solidify Lakehurst's status as ``the heart of naval aviation.'' But this giant leap for the base did not occur in a vacuum, I assure you. It happened because of the dedication and hard work of people interested in the base and the critical work performed there--people like Capt. Dougherty.  Mr. Speaker, throughout his command, Capt. Dougherty has had an impressive series of accomplishments for which he can be proud, in both his personal and professional life. It has been my privilege to work with him on the many initiatives that have put Lakehurst at the forefront of naval aviation, and will keep it there well into the twenty-first century. On behalf of the citizens of the fourth district who have benefited from the vital work he has performed while at Lakehurst, and on behalf of the country he has so diligently served, it is my pleasure to thank Capt. Dougherty for his fine leadership and wish him well in his future endeavors.                          ____________________
