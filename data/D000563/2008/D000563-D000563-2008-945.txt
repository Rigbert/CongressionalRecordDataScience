President, if there is no further business to come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand adjourned under the previous order.  There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:26 p.m., adjourned until Wednesday, February 13, 2008, at 9:30 a.m.                          ____________________
