Madam Speaker, I rise today in proud support of H. Res. 931, a resolution recognizing National Foster Care Month. I thank my friend and colleague on the Ways and Means Committee, Chairman McDermott, for sponsoring this important resolution.  During National Foster Care Month, we pay tribute to the half million children presently in the child welfare system and the many others in the network--mentors, volunteers, friends, extended families, and organizations who fill in the gaps in Federal and State coverage to help these young people find their way.  In Georgia, there are thousands of children living in foster care. These young people--of all race, ages, and backgrounds--were victims of neglect and abuse. Madam Speaker, as parents we know that children require stability and permanency to thrive. Love and security help the development of healthy and confident young adults. Sadly, due to circumstances beyond their control, foster children are uprooted from their homes and represent the one of largest constituencies of displaced people in the United States. In fact, numerous studies show the increased difficulties foster children must overcome, especially the lack of support for foster care youth as they transition to adulthood and independence.  Child welfare services have a shared goal to find safe, stable, and loving homes for these young people. Unfortunately, this dream is not always realized. Last year, Congress passed and the President signed the Fostering Connections to Success Act. This legislation was an important step in improving the nation's child welfare system, but more can be done. I look forward to continuing to work with my friends and colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support to improve the experiences of those young people living in and preparing to exit foster care.  Madam Speaker, each and every young person has a right to a childhood. During National Foster Care Month, I hope that communities around the country really come together and think of ways to improve the lives of young people in the child welfare system.                          ____________________
