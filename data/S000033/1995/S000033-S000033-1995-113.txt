 Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Chairman, there are two main aspects to this issue. No. 1, in my view it is not inevitable that we continue to see a decline in family farms who in Vermont and throughout this country are the backbone of America.  It is important that this Congress stand up and fight as hard as we can to protect those extraordinarily hard-working Americans who have given us so much.  No. 2 is, as the gentleman from New York [Mr. Hinchey] pointed out, this is also a consumer issue. Without getting into a great debate, the time is not now to do that, consumers do have a right to know whether the dairy products they are injecting come from cows that were injected with bST or whether they do not.  My friend from Illinois is not quite right, because tests, if made available, if developed, can tell us whether the milk comes from bST-injected cows or not. That is why we are providing funding to develop that test. My friend from New York also pointed out that in Europe they are concerned about the issue. They have placed a moratorium on the use of bST.  So, from the point of view of saving the family farm, from the point of view of giving the consumer the right to make a choice about the product he or she ingests, let us pass this amendment. It is terribly important.  I thank the gentleman from Illinois for yielding time to me.
