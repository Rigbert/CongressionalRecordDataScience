President, the budget resolution now provides less funding to our Nation's first responders in the next fiscal year than it does in the current one. My amendment, which is cosponsored by Senators Daschle, Reid, Biden, Schumer, Clinton, and Dayton, will increase the level of direct funding for fiscal year 2004 for first responders by $3 billion to support their efforts to protect homeland security and respond to acts of terrorism. This will bring the total funding for our State and local first responders to at least $6.5 billion for the first fiscal year.  When one calls 9-1-1, they get the State and local; they do not get Washington. They need the money.  We offset this by reducing tax reductions by $3 billion for taxpayers with annual incomes greater than $300,000, and we provide an additional $3 billion for deficit reduction. I hope we can support our Nation's police officers, firefighters, and emergency personnel by passing this amendment.
