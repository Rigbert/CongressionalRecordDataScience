President, we have some things that are going to happen this year that are very significant. In the committee I chaired when the Republicans were in the majority--it is now chaired by Senator Boxer--we have two major pieces of legislation coming up.  We have the Transportation reauthorization bill and we have the Water Resources Development Act reauthorization bill. In the case of the Transportation reauthorization bill, we had a good reauthorization in 2005. It is scheduled to be reauthorized again, and I would suggest we use that as somewhat of a pattern of what we are going to plan to go in this coming year, in 2009.  In spite of all of the things you are hearing about the inauguration and about the various confirmations, business is going to continue. The WRDA bill, the Water Resources Development Act, is something that should be done on an annual basis or every other year. Yet the last time we passed it was 7 whole years ago. We had a lot of making up to do. There is not one State represented on this floor that is not way behind in some of the programs that are dealt with in the Water Resources Development Act.  The reason I mention this at this time is we will be dealing with some type of a stimulus bill. When they talk about $800 or so billion, I already, in my previous remarks, talked about how big $700 or $800 billion is to individual families in America.  We will be dealing with this, and I regret that of the $800 billion, only $30 billion has to do with highway construction. We have a great need in this country for bridge construction, highway construction, and, hopefully--Senator Boxer and I both cosigned a letter to try to get a much larger percentage of whatever amount we end up authorizing in a stimulus bill.  So I would hope--and I would ask each Member to look at their own States, as I have done in my State of Oklahoma--Senators look at State projects that are out there that we call spade-ready: they have had their environmental impact statement, they have had their AS statements, and they are ready to go. They would employ people immediately. For those like me who are conservative, who do not believe the ingredients in this stimulus package, or at least do not believe what they are looking at in the House is going to really stimulate very much, one thing we do know is that there is nothing that puts people back to work faster than to get something that has already passed all of the environmental prerequisites and is ready for construction to start. Then, after it is over, you have something. You have bridges that are rebuilt. You have roads that are rebuilt.  So what I would encourage the Senate to try to do is get as much as we can out of the stimulus package that actually does provide jobs and provides things that otherwise we would have to do in the reauthorization bill.  There is no way in the world we are going to take care of the real need we have with infrastructure in America unless we get a very large amount in the front end of the stimulus bill.                          ____________________
