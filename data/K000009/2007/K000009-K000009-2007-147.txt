I rise today to recognize the annual celebration at the North Ward Center in Newark, New Jersey honoring the birthday of its inspiration, Monsignor Geno Baroni, on November 15, 2007. Msgr. Baroni--Geno to those of us who knew and loved him--was a most remarkable man, and though he passed from this life more than two decades ago, his memory and his mission remain strong.  Following riots at the end of the 1960s, Msgr. Baroni convinced Stephen Adubato, Sr. to leave the Newark public schools and organize the North Ward Educational and Cultural Center. In 1970, the center began providing information on services available to the residents of Newark's north ward, with a particular emphasis on higher education opportunities for students.  Built on the principles of community, opportunity, responsibility, and equity, the North Ward Center remains true to its mission ``to provide educational, cultural, and meaningful social services to low and moderate income families who reside in the greater Newark community. The center plays a major role in helping families overcome barriers to self-sufficiency, works to improve the health and well-being of those families, and helps revitalize their community, thereby improving the quality of life for all residents.''  Over the decades, the North Ward Center expanded to include the Newark Business Training Institute, the North Ward Child Development Center, the Robert Treat Academy, and Casa Israel, a state-of-the-art wellness and medical center. The initiatives and services of these five institutions are widely recognized as among the finest, and the center has received many accolades over the years. Yet, true to the standards of its heart--Geno Baroni--the center has never wavered from its mission and founding principles, and it continues to celebrate the diversity of its people. The North Ward Center hosts ``the society of Italians who celebrate St. Patrick's Day'' with prominent Italian-Americans honoring Irish-Americans, an annual Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. remembrance, and a Puerto Rican scholarship dinner recognizing four outstanding north ward students.  Geno Baroni was a many-faceted man, a gifted and passionate leader, a builder, a doer, and thoroughly committed to Christ's message of social justice. The North Ward Center reflects this charismatic man and his life's work. Msgr. Geno Baroni's impression on the lives of those of us privileged to know him and those whose lives he touched through his work is indeed profound. As the North Ward Center honors this extraordinary man by celebrating his birthday, the final words in the Shaker hymn Lord of the Dance seem most fitting: ``. . . they buried my body and they thought I'd gone, but I am the dance and the dance goes on.''                          ____________________
