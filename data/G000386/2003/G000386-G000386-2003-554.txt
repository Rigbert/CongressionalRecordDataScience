 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until 9:15 a.m., Thursday, May 15. I further ask that following the prayer and the pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time of the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and that the Senate then resume consideration of Calendar No. 97, S. 1054, the jobs and economic growth bill, as provided under the previous order; provided further that no second-degree amendments be in order to the amendments offered during Wednesday's session, prior to a vote in relationship to the amendment.  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that following the first vote, all succeeding votes in sequence be limited to 10 minutes each.
