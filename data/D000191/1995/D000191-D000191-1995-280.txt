  Mr. DeFAZIO. Crime and punishment, it is all the rage here in Washington. But if we are going to build a strong foundation to defeat crime in America and turn back this tide, it is going to take a little site prep like any other building of a foundation.  This grand new monument to the Republican crime control effort will be a tower of concrete on a foundation of sand if we pass this section of the crime bill. It is a single-minded rush. It ignores other needs.  Drugs in the schools? Build prisons. At-risk and abused kids? Build prisons. Slow response time? Not enough cops? Build prisons.  Let us not rush to build symbolic monuments. It will take more to turn back the tide of crime in America.                          ____________________
