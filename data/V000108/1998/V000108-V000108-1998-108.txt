Speaker, at a time when crime concerns are on every citizen's mind, those who have dedicated their lives to law enforcement are to be commended. It is my distinct pleasure to call to your attention an outstanding law enforcement official, Chief of the East Chicago Police Department, Frank Alcala, on his receipt of Twin City Community Services' 9th Annual ``East Chicagoan of the Year'' Award. The Twin City Community Services Board of Directors will bestow this award upon Chief Alcala at a benefit which will take place tomorrow, April 2, 1998, at the Knights of Columbus Hall in East Chicago, Indiana.  Frank Alcala began his distinguished law enforcement career in 1970, upon his graduation from the police academy at Indiana University in Bloomington. His initial position, as Patrolman, was the beginning of his 27-year career with the East Chicago Police Department. He served the department in this capacity until 1975, at which time he was promoted to Traffic Investigator. In 1981, he became Sergeant in the Patrol Division, where he served until he was promoted in 1990, to Traffic Sergeant. In 1991, he was promoted to Lieutenant in the Service Division, and, in 1994, he was appointed Chief of Police by East Chicago Mayor Robert Pastrick.  During his four years as Chief of Police, Frank has made numerous contributions to law enforcement in the City of East Chicago. In 1994, he hired 12 community police officers, one full-time Drug Awareness Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) officer, and provided police security to East Chicago Central High School. Also in 1994, he established a Special Operations Section Team, a unit comprised of volunteers from different areas of the police department, which trains in the handling of raids and hostage situations. In addition, Chief Alcala implemented the first ever K-9 unit in East Chicago in 1995, and provided an extra division of Gang and Narcotics Officers to the police department in 1997. Also under Frank's supervision, a Cadet Program, which will afford graduating high school seniors an opportunity to work for the East Chicago Police Department while enrolling in criminal justice courses at a local university, will be implemented this year. Chief Alcala's strong commitment to crime prevention is exemplified by his significant expansion of the police force. In 1994, there were 105 officers with the East Chicago Police Department; today there are 135.  In addition to his many law enforcement efforts within the City of East Chicago, Chief Alcala participates in numerous law enforcement and community service organizations throughout Northwest Indiana. He currently serves on the Executive Board of the Lake County Drug Task Force and the Executive Committee of the Lake County High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) and Estella Smith Memorial Crime Prevention Foundation. Some of the community service organizations he assists include: the East Chicago Exchange Club, an organization devoted to a variety of youth and community service programs; Christmas in April, a program that provides volunteers for the building of homes for low-income families; and the St. Catherine's Hospital Foundation Annual Support Committee.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Frank Alcala on his receipt of the East Chicagoan of the Year Award. His wife, Suzanne, and their children, Doug, Frank Jr., and Brian, can be proud of his devoted service to the citizens of East Chicago and Indiana's First Congressional District.                          ____________________
