On Sunday, November 17, 2019, the Huron United Methodist Church will honor Norma for 50 years of service to their congregation.  Norma began playing the organ at age 15 for the Huron United Methodist Church on September 14, 1969.  Norma tells the story of the night that her parents dropped her off at the church to practice music and forgot to pick her up. She recalled the darkness and the sounds of the heat registers, and, there being no telephone near the choir loft, Norma just waited at the back door until her apologetic father showed up around midnight. Despite that event, Norma continued to serve her church with a smile.  There have been many changes at the Huron United Methodist Church during the time that Norma has served, and she has improvised and changed alongside the church. One such change that marked the end of an era was in 1995, when the Hemry Organ Company increased the organ from 7 to 11 ranks, which made the organ four feet higher and moved to another location. Previously, the organist was in a sunken pit and could not see the activity of the sanctuary aisles. The organist relied on taking cues from the minister as to when music should commence or end, making it extremely difficult to play for a wedding as one could not see the bride walking down the aisle. Norma and Rev. Carothers formulated a communication strategy during his ministry by which the Reverend would crack open the parlor folding doors to bare the light. He would switch the light on and off as the cue for Norma to start the Wedding March. The wedding observers in the pew never suspected anything.  Over the decades, Norma has brought over 300 brides down the aisle for weddings and comforted more than 400 families with funeral music.  An active member of the Huron United Methodist Church congregation, Norma works with choirs of all ages and serves on multiple church committees. She always brings a sense of humor to choir rehearsals and helps make music fun for all who work with her or hear her play.  Norma has played ecumenical services at almost every church in Huron, serving as an asset to the entire Huron community.  Norma has been married to her husband Ron for over 35 years. Norma has three children and three grandchildren.  We congratulate Norma on all her accomplishments and dedication to her service to the Huron United Methodist Church and the entire Huron community.                          ____________________
