 Speaker, I submit the following for the Record.  Colonel James R. Prouty is recognized for exceptionally distinguished service to the United States Army and to the United States of America during the period July 6, 1972 to May 31, 1999. Throughout a distinguished twenty-seven year military career, Colonel Prouty served in a series of increasingly demanding positions that immeasurably contributed to the security of the nation, culminating as the Executive Officer to the Assistant Vice Chief of Staff of the Army.  A brief summary of his accomplishments over the last decade follows.  As Commander of the 2d Battalion, 5th Air Defense Artillery (Vulcan/Stinger), 2d Armored Division, he was responsible for leading, training, maintaining, and caring for approximately 600 soldiers and their associated equipment (45 track and 175 wheeled vehicles). MG Mallory, the Division Commander, remarked that ``his battalion set the training standard for the division because of Jim's leadership.'' When war came, that uncompromising investment in training returned valuable dividends for the 125 highly-motivated and professional soldiers he provided to Desert Shield/Desert Storm.  As Operations Officer, and later Chief of Staff, for the United States Army Space and Strategic Defense Command (USASSDC), COL Prouty was responsible for planning and resourcing all current, future, and contingency operations; determining, analyzing, and integrating requirements for Army Space Systems; and coordinating those requirements with the Army Staff, the Joint Staff, and US Space Command. Leveraging his broad warfighting talents, COL Prouty initially focused his directorate's efforts on incorporating space considerations into Army doctrine and training events. From these efforts, he developed and prioritized requirements for Army Space Systems, published in the first Army Space Modernization Plan, supporting commanders across all Battlefield Operating Systems. LTG Lionetti described him as ``smart, innovative, and visionary; he made improvements of enormous significance.'' Later, his directorate stood up USASSDC's Theater Missile Defense (TMD) cell, and COL Prouty became the Army's focal point for a wide variety of TMD initiatives. Once again, COL Jim Prouty was equal to the task, overseeing the integration of delivery of the TMD Force Projection Tactical Operations Center (TOC), a major new warfighting asset available to support Joint Land Force commanders worldwide. At the same time, COL Prouty was instrumental in directing the command's highly successful participation in support of the Commission on Roles and Missions.  As Commander, Test and Experimentation Command (TEXCOM) Experimentation Center, COL Prouty was responsible for conducting and supporting a wide range of independent operational tests and experiments using state-of-the-art, real time casualty assessment instrumentation, data reduction, and analysis. He was also responsible to lead, train, and care for an organic Armored/Mechanized Infantry Battalion Task Force of over 350 soldiers. As in previous assignments, his initial emphasis was on training and performing to standard. As a result, his soldiers achieved record success on the gunnery ranges, and the major weapons systems were maintained at unprecedented operational readiness rates. More importantly, every operational test and experiment was carefully planned, coordinated, and executed on time, under budget, yielding results which were both analytically sound and compelling. The highly successful operational test of the Battlefield Combat Identification System (BCIS) is a testament to COL Prouty's leadership, superb knowledge of training, and understanding of how to operationalize emerging technology. The latter months of COL Prouty's command were once again dedicated to the mission of inactivation--and taking care of troops. In recognizing the professional manner in which COL Prouty inactivated the command, MG Lehowicz remarked that ``he turned in equipment and facilities (valued at over $100M) in such an outstanding condition that it defied the imagination.''  Since July 1997, COL Prouty has served as the Executive Officer to Assistant Vice Chief of Staff of the Army (AVCSA). It is in this role that COL Prouty's unique talents and abilities have had their greatest impact on the Army. While his duties are broadly defined, as in his previous assignments, it is in the details where COL Prouty has left an indelible mark on the future of our Army.  His ability to energize a diverse body of senior executives and general officers, from across the Army Staff, with widely different interests, toward a common purpose, is truly remarkable. He succeeds because he invests the time, energy, and intellect necessary to understand the most complex issues from the perspectives of all stakeholders; he possesses the wisdom, experience, and judgment to find the common ground; and he employs the finely-honed leadership skills to motivate all to positive action. These skills were particularly evident in directing the AVCSA's efforts to transition two incoming VCSAs and develop a workable strategy to fully integrate the Army's active and reserve components--later detailed in the CSA White Paper, One Team, One Fight, One Future.  Immediately upon assuming his duties, he developed the trust and confidence of every senior leader on the Army Staff, and countless others in the department and on Capitol Hill. Through two full Planning, Programming, and Budgeting System (PPBS) cycles, and in defense of two Army budget submissions, the Chief of Staff, the Vice Chief of Staff, and/or the Assistant Vice Chief of Staff were invariably present at the decisive place and time, with the compelling argument for Army requirements and resources. These opportunities were more often than not developed behind the scenes, via a broad, but comprehensive staff effort with COL Prouty at the helm. Perhaps of even greater importance, COL Prouty's insight, instincts, and mastery of the subject matter allowed him to resolve innumerable requirements and resource issues, in a manner favorable to Army objectives, without requiring the dedicated attention of the senior leadership.  COL Jim Prouty's team-building and managerial skills have never been more fully validated. The office of the AVCSA is a model of efficiency--lean, professional, effective, and highly-credible. This success is singularly attributable to the leadership talent and managerial savvy of COL Jim Prouty. As the role of the AVCSA continued to evolve, COL Prouty ensured that the office staff remained one step ahead of the issues, and cultivated the professional working relationships necessary to ensure the role of the AVCSA on the Army Staff was well understood and fully integrated. He sets high standards in all aspects of staff performance, and inspires subordinates to achieve them. Even under the most difficult circumstances, morale was invariably high, and the staff never missed a beat.  COL Jim Prouty served with uncommon distinction in each of these critical positions during these last ten years. His outstanding performance in each position contributed extensively to the success, not just of his unit, but to the Army. The impact of COL Prouty's professionalism, selfless commitment, and accomplishments will endure well beyond his retirement. His level of responsibility, particularly in his final position, was far above that of his peers, and his performance was on a par with most of the general officers I routinely work with. Given these factors, it is most appropriate that COL Prouty's extraordinary service to the United States Army and the United States of America be recognized by the 106th Congress.                          ____________________
