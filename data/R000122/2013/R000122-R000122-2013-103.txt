President, July 1 is less than 3 weeks away, and unless Congress acts, the interest rate on need-based student loans will double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent, making college more expensive for more than 7 million students across the Nation. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by the majority leader, following consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 74, S. 953, the Student Loan Affordability Act; that the bill be read a third time, the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill, and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.
