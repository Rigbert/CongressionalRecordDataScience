 In many hot spots around the world, there is simply a shortage of water. Some analysts predict that a major war over water is possible sometime in the future. Experts often cite the Middle East as an area where many water disputes could derail peace efforts or lead to another war. But there are critical water disputes the world over, and, as population increases, and potable water becomes yet more scarce, violent disputes over water become increasingly likely.  It is estimated that water shortages plague 20 percent of the world's population in at least 30 countries, and, it is estimated by 2025, as much as 30 percent of the world's population in 50 countries will face water shortages.  Even in places where there is enough water, it often is not clean enough to drink. An estimated 1.2 billion around the world lack an adequate, safe water supply, and 2.3 billion lack adequate sanitation. It is estimated that as many as 5 to 7 million people die every year from water-related diseases, including 2.2 million children under the age of 5.  Former Senator--and my friend and mentor--Paul Simon, has been a leader in the Senate and beyond in highlighting the need for better, cheaper ways to desalinate salt water. This is an area where improved technology has the potential to benefit millions of people and to help defuse brewing conflicts.  Many nations have begun to depend on desalinated water. For example, a number of Middle Eastern nations have come to depend in part on desalination, and the city of Los Angeles obtains a significant percentage of its water from desalination plants. But the technology is still expensive and out of reach for many nations, States, and municipalities.  But there are many ``low tech'' approaches that could conserve water in to promote the sustainable use of underground water aquifers, including drip irrigation or other agricultural practices that conserve water, water distribution systems that reduce leakage and evaporation, sewage systems that reduce water use, and many other solutions. Some of these solutions are expensive, but others require more changes in thinking and habits and a commitment of political determination than money.  That is why I want to bring this critical problem to my colleagues attention today. It is not hopeless. Awareness of the issue is the first step to implementing solutions, small and large, to be sure our descendants inherit a peaceful world with an adequate and safe supply of our most basic necessity--water.                          ____________________
