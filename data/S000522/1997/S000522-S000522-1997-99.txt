Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, in evaluating all of the proposed legislation, any kind of diplomatic or administrative initiative vis-a-vis Cuba, it is important to keep these following principles in mind: First, such actions must be calculated to emphasize the status of the Castro government as a rogue regime with whom the civilized nations of the world should have no dealings.  Second, our actions must be calculated to hurt the dictatorship and not the Cuban people.  Finally, we should make it clear that Cuba will receive a warm welcome back into the family of free and democratic nations.                              {time}  1345  By this standard, we have made some terrible mistakes, such as the 1994 Clinton-Castro antirefugee agreement. We made this agreement just a few months after the Castro regime had brutally murdered 40 men, women, and children who were trying to escape from Cuba on the vessel the Thirteenth of March. The agreement gave the Castro government just what it wanted, an end to the longstanding United States policy of accepting people who escape from Cuba.  The agreement specified that Castro was to use mainly persuasive methods to keep people from fleeing from Cuba. The United States thereby accepted moral responsibility for whatever forms of persuasion he should choose to employ. And it enhanced the international prestige and the domestic power of the regime.  The Castro government returned the favor a year later by murdering four American citizens, members of the pro-freedom organization Brothers to the Rescue who were flying in international airspace. So we got tough again for a little while.  Mr. Chairman, the adoption of the Miller amendment, if it is not amended successfully by the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Diaz-Balart], would send a clear signal that the get-tough period is over again. It would send a signal, and it would signal an unwarranted unilateral departure from our policy of isolating Castro. Once again we would send a signal to the world that Castro is not so bad after all.  Mr. Chairman, it is important that we remember just what kind of regime we are dealing with. We must bear in mind that the Castro regime is the No. 1 violator of human rights in our hemisphere.  According to the State Department's country reports on human rights practices for 1996, Cuba is a totalitarian state controlled by Fidel Castro, who has exercised control over all aspects of Cuban life. According to the country reports, among the more serious human rights violations by the regime in recent years are, and I quote:       The authorities were responsible for the extrajudicial      killing of dozens of people.       The government continued to employ acts of repudiation,      which are attacks by mobs organized by the government but      portrayed as responsible public rebukes, against dissident      activity.       The government also metes out exceptionally harsh prison      sentences to democracy and human rights advocates whom it      considers a threat to its control.       Police and prison officials often use beatings, neglect,      isolation, and other abuse against detainees and prisoners      convicted of political crimes, including human rights      advocates, or those who persisted in expressing their views.       Citizens have no legal right to change their government or      to advocate change.       The government does not allow criticism of the revolution      or its leaders. The Communist Party controls all media as a      means to indoctrinate the public.       Religious persecution continues,  The country reports point out.       The government has ignored calls for democratic reform and      labeled activists who proposed them as worms and traitors.  The decision on whether to embrace or isolate the Castro regime raises the question of what role human rights and basic decency are to play in our foreign policy. I urge a strong ``yes'' vote for the Diaz-Balart amendment, and salute him for his longstanding support for democracy in Cuba. His amendment is a step in the right direction in that endeavor.
