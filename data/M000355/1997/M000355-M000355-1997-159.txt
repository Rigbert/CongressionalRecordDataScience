 And $5 million, Mr. President, is not a bad year's work, not a bad 2 years' work--for many Americans not a bad lifetime's work.  So the distinguished Senator from Alabama is not saying that these lawyers, if you have been hired by the State government, you have to do it for nothing. All he is saying in effect is you don't get to gouge us. So he has set here a reasonable limit, some would argue maybe even too generous, and saying any excess amounts that have been agreed to should be diverted to the children of America at the National Institutes of Health to fund research for children and children's diseases.  I think it is an outstanding amendment. I commend the distinguished Senator from Alabama for his amendment. I think it makes an awful lot of sense. It is clearly an amendment in the best interest of the children of America. So, Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama for his leadership on this issue.  I yield the floor.
