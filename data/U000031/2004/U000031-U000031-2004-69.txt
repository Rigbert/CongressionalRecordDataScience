Speaker, I rise today to honor the inspiring achievement of the German-American National Congress, Inc. (D.A.N.K. No. 13) in the Benton Harbor and St. Joseph community. This great nonprofit organization celebrates its 40th anniversary on March 27, 2004. Over the past four decades Americans of German descent, through the work of this organization, have been preserving the traditions and culture of their heritage throughout southwest Michigan.  The German American National Congress (Deutsch Amerikanischer National Kongress), seeks to bring together Americans of German descent in the pursuit of cultivating and presenting their heritage and interests on local, regional, and national levels. These were the primary reasons why this organization was founded in 1959, and they are still among the organization's primary objectives today. The German-American National Congress is the largest organization of Americans of German ancestry. It has some 30 chapters and over 100 associated member societies from coast to coast. I am very proud to have Chapter 13 in the Sixth District of Michigan, and I greatly appreciate all the benefits that the members have provided this community.  It truly pleases me to honor the achievement of Chapter 13, and I hold the members in the highest of esteem. I would like to wish this organization all the best for the future and thank its members for promoting goodwill through southwest Michigan. I'm a frequent visitor to the chapter and there's not been a time that I haven't felt welcome like so many others in southwest Michigan.                          ____________________
