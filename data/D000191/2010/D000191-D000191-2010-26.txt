 Now, this gentleman, hardworking construction worker, older guy, fifties, 30 years never been unemployed, 30 years. He lost his job. Kind of a tough market for an older construction worker. He was in the unemployment office, initially pretty hostile; and afterwards he came over and he apologized and he said, I know you're not responsible for this. I know it was the Bush administration, and their policies put us in this mess, but I'm desperate, I'm desperate because my wife is really sick. And I can get extended health care benefits under COBRA for 900 bucks a month because I had a pretty good plan, but my unemployment is only about 1,200 bucks a month--Easy Street, the Republicans talk about, these people are living on Easy Street with $1,200 a month. $900 a month for health insurance for a desperately ill wife. How does he pay the mortgage? How does he feed the kids?  Now, come on, let's get real here. You don't want to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy. You didn't pay for a $1 trillion war in Iraq that we didn't need, but now we've got to pay for the emergency unemployment benefits. Humbug.
