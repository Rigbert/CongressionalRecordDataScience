 President, here we are again. I think it is appropriate to say that campaign finance is a clinical term for ``constitutional freedom.''  Make no mistake, the essence of this debate is indeed freedom--fundamental first amendment freedom of speech and association guaranteed to every American, citizen group, candidate, and party. That is the view of the U.S. Supreme Court, the view of the American Civil Liberties Union, and the view of most Republicans. Soft money, issue advocacy, express advocacy, PACs, and all the rest are nothing more than euphemisms for first-amendment-protected political speech and association means of amplifying one's voice in this vast Nation of 270 million people.  It is important to remember that Dan Rather and Peter Jennings have a lot of speech, and the editorial page of the New York Times has a big audience. But the typical American citizen and the typical candidate, unless he or she can amass the resources to project their voices to a larger audience, just simply doesn't have as much speech as the press. So the means to amplify one's voice in this vast Nation of 270 million people is critical and constitutionally protected. It is no more complicated than that and no less vital to our democracy than the freedom of the press, which has taken a great interest in this issue.  Just thinking of the New York Times editorial page, for example, I think they have had 113 editorials on this subject since the beginning of 1997. That is an average of about one every nine days--issue advocacy, if you will, paid for by corporate soft money, expressing their view, which they have a right to do, on this important issue before us.  But as we look at this long odyssey of campaign finance reform, we have come a long way in the last decade, those of us who see through the reform patina--from the push 10 years ago for taxpayer financing of congressional campaigns and spending limits, and even such lunacy as taxpayer-financed entitlement programs for candidates to counteract independent expenditures, a truly bizarre scheme long gone from the congressional proposals but now echoed, interestingly enough, in the campaign reform platform of Presidential candidate Bill Bradley, who advocates a 100-percent tax--a 100-percent tax on issue advocacy. So if you were so audacious as to go out and want to express yourself on an issue, the Government would levy a 100-percent tax on your expression and give the money to whoever the Government thought was entitled to respond to it--a truly loony idea.  That was actually in the campaign finance bills we used to debate in the late 1980s and early 1990s and now is in the platform of one of the candidates for President of the United States, believe it or not.  So it was just 2 years ago that spending limits were thrown overboard from the McCain-Feingold bill and that the PAC and bundling bans were thrown overboard as well. Now the focus becomes solely directed at citizens groups and parties, which is the form McCain-Feingold took last year. Now, this month, the McCain-Feingold odyssey has arrived at the point that if it were whittled down any further, only the effective date would remain. As it is, McCain-Feingold now amounts to an effective date on an ineffectual provision.  Obviously, it is not surprising that that is my view. But it is also the view of the League of Women Voters, which opposes the current version of McCain-Feingold.  To achieve what proponents of this legislation profess to want to achieve--a reduction of special interest influence--if you want to do that, I think that is not a good idea at all, it is blatantly unconstitutional and the wrong thing to do. But if you wanted to do it, you would certainly have to deal with all the avenues of participation, not just political parties. Nonparty soft money as well as party soft money, independent expenditures, candidate spending--all of the gimmicks advanced through the years in the guise of reform--all would have to be treated, if you truly wanted to quiet the voices of all of these citizens, which is what the reformers initially sought to do.  The latest and leanest version of McCain-Feingold falls far short of that which would be needed if you were inclined to want to do this sort of thing to limit special interest influence. As the League of Women Voters contends--mind you, there is the first time I have ever agreed with them on anything--as they contend, you would have to treat all of the special interests if you were truly interested in quieting the voices of all of these Americans who belong to groups.  It could not be more clear that this sort of McCain-Feingold-light that is currently before us is designed only to penalize the parties and to shift the influence to other avenues. That is precisely what it would do. It could not be more clear. Prohibiting only party soft money accomplishes absolutely nothing. It is only fodder for press releases and would make the present system worse and not better.  That is quite aside from the matter of unconstitutionality and whether the parties have less first amendment rights to engage in soft money activities than other groups. If this were to be enacted, that issue would surely be settled by the Supreme Court, which is, of course, the Catch-22 of the reformers. The choice is between the ineffectual unconstitutional and the comprehensively unconstitutional. A younger generation would call that a choice between ``dumb and dumber.''  For reality ever to square with reformer rhetoric, the Constitution would have to be amended and political speech specifically carved out of the first amendment scope of protection.  There are those in this body who have actually proposed amending the Constitution. We had that debate in March of 1997. And, believe it or not, 38 Senators out of 100 voted to do just that--to amend the first amendment for the first time in 200 years to give the Government the power to restrict all spending, and in support of or in opposition to candidates. The ACLU calls that a ``recipe for repression.'' But that got 38 votes. You could at least give those people credit for honesty. They understand that in order to do what the reformers seek to do, you really would have to change the first amendment for the first time in 200 years.  So what the McCain-Feingold saga comes down to is an effort to have the Government control all spending by, in support of, or in opposition to candidates, with a little loophole carving out the media's own spending, of course.  That this effort is allowed to be advanced as reform is one of the tragedies of our time. Fortunately, enough Senators on this side of the aisle have had the courage to forestall this assault on freedom for the past decade and have proven by example that there is a constituency for protecting constitutional freedom.  Let me just say there is an excellent letter from the American Civil Liberties Union--a group that is an equal opportunity defender for an awful lot of Americans but is truly America's experts on the first amendment--to me, which I just got yesterday, which I ask unanimous consent to be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               American Civil Liberties Union,                                                   Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: The ACLU is writing to express its      opposition to the new, seemingly watered-down McCain-Feingold      bill. While it is true that the most obvious direct      legislative attacks on issue advocacy have been removed from      this bill, S. 1593 continues to abridge the First Amendment      rights of those who want to support party issue advocacy. The      soft money restrictions proposed in S. 1593 are just another,      less direct way to restrain issue advocacy and should      therefore be opposed.           Concerns About Soft Money Restrictions in S. 1593       Soft money is funding that does not support express      advocacy of the election or defeat of federal candidates,      even though it may exert an attenuated influence on the      outcome of a federal election. In other words, everything      that is not hard money (express advocacy dollars) is soft      money. Thus, soft money includes party funds and issue      advocacy dollars.       Party soft money sustains primary political activity such      as candidate recruitment,     get-out-the-vote drives and issue advertising. While      candidate-focused contributions and expenditures and      ``express advocacy'' can be subject to various restrictions      or regulations, the Supreme Court in Buckley v. Valeo, 424      U.S. 1 (1976) held that all speech which does not ``in      express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly      identified candidate'' shall remain free from the same      regulations that apply to hard money. ``So long as persons      and groups eschew expenditures that in express terms advocate      the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate,      they are free to spend as much as they want to promote the      candidate and his views.'' 424 U.S. at 45 (emphasis      supplied).       Indeed, the unrestricted use of soft money by political      parties and non-party organizations like labor unions has      been invited by Buckley and acknowledged by the Supreme      Court. In Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v.      Federal Election Commission, 116 S.Ct. 2309 (1996), the Court      upheld unlimited ``hard money'' independent expenditures by      political parties on behalf of their candidates.       In Colorado, the Brennan Center provided the Court      extensive charts and graphs detailing large individual and      corporate soft money contributions to the two major      parties that they asserted threatened the integrity of the      FECA's federal contribution restrictions. (Brief, p. 8)      Notwithstanding this `'evidence,'' the Court stated:       ``We recognize that FECA permits individuals to contribute      more money ($20,000) to a party than to a candidate ($1,000)      or to other political committees ($5,000). . . . We also      recognize that FECA permits unregulated ``soft money''      contributions to a party for certain activities, such as      electing candidates for state office . . . or for voter      registration and ``get out the vote'' drives. . . . But the      opportunity for corruption posed by these greater      opportunities for contributions is, at best, attenuated.''      Id. at 2316.       Restricting soft money contributions alone will only force      more dollars into other forms of speech beyond the reach of      campaign finance laws. Soft money restrictions also give even      more power to the media to influence voters' choices and to      characterize candidate records. If S. 1593 is adopted, less      money will be available to parties to assert the platform      embraced by candidates and non-candidate party members. A      soft money ban will not solve the problem that candidates now      have, which is the dearth of hard dollars available to run      competitive campaigns. Because contribution limits have      remained unchanged since the 1970's it is no wonder that      other avenues (party soft money and issue advocacy soft      money) have been exploited to influence the outcome of      elections.       Te goal of the Common Cause-type reform advocates is to      find all sources of money that may conceivably influence the      outcome of elections and place them under the control of the      Federal Election Commission. It is not possible within our      constitutional framework to limit and regulate all forms of      political speech. Further, it seems rather arrogant that some      members of Congress believe that the candidates and the press      alone should have unlimited power to characterize the      candidates and their records. The rest of us must be silent      bystanders denied our First Amendment rights to have our      voices amplified by funding issue and party speech.      Disclosure, rather than limitation, of large soft money      contributions of political parties, is the more appropriate      and less restrictive alternative.       Rather than assess how the limit driven approach caused our      current campaign finance woes, we are asked to believe the      fiction that the incremental limits approach in S. 1593 is      the solution. The ACLU is forced to agree with the League of      Women Voters who wisely withdrew their support for this      legislation (albeit for different reasons) and asserted, ``.      . . the overall system may actually be made worse by this      bill.''                  concerns about potential amendments                      Issue advocacy restrictions       Because issue ads generated from party and non-party      sources have provoked the consternation of many members of      Congress and so-called reform groups, it is likely that      Senators will have the opportunity to vote on amendments that      restrict issue advocacy. We urge the Senate to reject      restrictions on issue advocacy because they violate the      Constitution.       The Supreme Court in Buckley v. Valeo well understood the      risks that overly broad campaign finance regulations could      pose to electoral democracy. The Court said, ``[discussion of      public issues and debate on the qualifications of candidates      are integral to the operation of the system of government      established by our Constitution.'' 424 U.S. at 14. The Court      recognized that ``the distinction between discussion of      issues and candidates and advocacy of election or defeat of      candidates may often dissolve in practical application.      Candidates, especially incumbents, are intimately tied to      public issues involving legislative proposals and      governmental actions. Not only do candidates campaign on the      basis of their positions on various public issues, but      campaigns themselves generate issues of public interest.''      424 U.S. at 43. If any discussion of a candidate in the      context of discussion of an issue rendered the speaker      subject to campaign finance controls, the consequences for      free discussion would be intolerable and speakers would be      compelled ``to hedge and trim,'' Id., quoting Thomas v.      Collins, 323 U.S. 516, 535 (1945).       The Court fashioned the express advocacy doctrine to      safeguard issue advocacy from campaign finance controls, even      though such discussion might influence the outcome of an      election. The doctrine provides a hard, bright-line,      objective test that protects political speech and association      by focusing solely on the content of the speaker's words, not      the motive in the speaker's mind or the impact of the      speaker's opinions, or the proximity to an election, or the      phase of the moon. The doctrine marks the boundary of      permissible regulation and frees issue advocacy from any      permissible restraint.       The Buckley Court could not have been more clear about the      need for that bright line test which focuses solely on the      speaker's words and which is now an integral part of settled      First Amendment doctrine. It was designed to protect issue      discussion and advocacy by allowing independent groups of      citizens to comment on and criticize the performance of      elected officials without becoming ensnared in the federal      campaign finance laws. And it permits issue discussion to go      forward at the time that it is most vital in a democracy:      during an election season.       Although not as sweeping as other proposals, we believe      that the Snowe-Jeffords amendment restricting issue advocacy      should be opposed for the reasons stated above.           Specific Problems with the Shays-Meehan Substitute       It is our understanding the Sen. Tom Daschle (D, SD) and      Sen. Robert Torricelli (D, NJ) will offer the House passed      version of Shays-Meehan, H.R. 417. We urge Senators to vote      against this measure. Shays-Meehan has a chilling affect on      issue group speech that is essential in a democracy. H.R. 417      contains the harshest and most unconstitutional controls on      issue advocacy groups.       This bill contains a permanent year-round restriction on      issue advocacy achieved through redefining express advocacy      in an unconstitutionally vague and over-broad manner. The      Supreme Court has held that only express advocacy, narrowly      defined, can be subject to campaign finance controls. The key      to the existing definition of express advocacy is the      inclusion of an explicit directive to vote for or vote      against a candidate. Minus the explicit directive or so-     called ``bright-line'' test, what will constitute express      advocacy will be in the eye of the beholder, in this case the      Federal Election Commission (FEC). Few non-profit issue      groups will want to risk their tax status or incur legal      expenses to engage in speech that could be interpreted by the      FEC to have an influence on the outcome of an election.       It requires a two-month black-out on all television and      radio issue advertising before the primary and general      elections. The bill's statutory limitations on issue advocacy      would force groups that now engage in issue advocacy--     501(c)(3)s and 501(c)(4)s--to create new institutional      entities--PACs--in order to ``legally'' speak within 60 days      before an election. Groups would also be forced to disclose      or identify all contributors to the new PAC. For      organizations like the ACLU, this will mean individuals will      stop contributing rather than risk publicity about their      gift. The opportunities that donors now have to contribute      anonymously to our efforts to highlight issues during      elections would be eliminated. (This is a special concern for      groups that advocate unpopular or divisive causes. See NAACP      v. Alabama 357 U.S. 449(1958).) For many non-profits, being      forced to establish PACs entails a significant and costly      burden, one that can change the very character of the      organization. Separate accounting procedures, new legal      compliance costs and separate administrative processes would      be imposed on these groups--a high price to exercise their      First Amendment rights to comment on candidate records. It is      very likely that some groups will remain silent rather than      risk violating this new requirement or absorbing the      attendant cost of compliance. The only entities that will be      able to characterize a candidate's record on radio and      television during this 60-day period will be the candidates,      PACs and the media. Yet, the period when non-PAC issue groups      are locked out is the very time when everyone is paying      attention! Further, members of Congress need only wait until      the last 60 days before an election (as it often does now) to      vote for legislation or engage in controversial behavior, so      that their actions are beyond the reach of public comment      and, therefore, effectively immune from citizen criticism.       Shays-Meehan contains a misleading exception for candidate      voting records. The voting records that would be permitted      under this new statute would be stripped of any advocacy-like      commentary. For example, depending on its wording, the ACLU      might be banned from distributing a voting guide that      highlights members of Congress who have a 100 percent ACLU      voting records as members of an ``ACLU Honor Role.'' Unless      the ACLU chose to create a PAC to publish such guides, we      would be barred by this statute even though we do not      expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate.      Courts have clearly held that such a result is an      unacceptable or unconstitutional restraint on issue-oriented      speech.       It redefines ``expenditure,'' ``contribution'' and      ``coordination with a candidate'' so that heretofore legal      and constitutionally protected activities of issue advocacy      groups would become illegal. Let's say, for example, that the      ACLU decided to place an ad     lauding, by name, Representatives or Senators for the      effective advocacy of constitutional campaign finance reform.      That ad would be counted as express advocacy on behalf of the      named Congresspersons under H.R. 417 and would be effectively      prohibited. If the ACLU checked with key congressional      offices to determine when this reform measure was coming to      the floor so the placement of the ad would be timely--that      would be an ``expenditure'' counted as a ``contribution'' to      the named officials and it would be deemed ``coordinated with      the candidate.'' An expanded definition of coordination      chills legal and appropriate issue group-candidate      discussion.       If these very same restrictions outlined above were imposed      on the media, we would have a national First Amendment crisis      of huge proportions. Yet, newspapers such as the Washington      Post, the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times and other      media outlets relentlessly editorialize in favor of Shays-     Meehan--a proposal that blatantly chills free speech rights      of others, but not their own. Let's suppose Congress      constrained editorial boards in a similar fashion. Any time      news outlets ran an editorial--60 days before an election or      otherwise--mentioned the name of a candidate, the law now      required them to disclose the author of the editorial, the      amount of money spent to distribute the editorial and the      names of the owners of the newspaper of the FEC, or risk      prosecution. The media powerhouses would engage in a frenzy      of protest, and you could count on the ACLU challenging such      restraints on free speech. Yet, the press has as much if not      more influence on the outcome of elections as all issue      advocacy groups combined. Some voters are more likely go to      the polls with their newspaper's candidate endorsements      wrapped under their arm than carrying other issue group      literature into the voting booth.       The Shays-Meehan bill contains misguided and      unconstitutional restrictions on issue group speech and only      works to further empower the media to influence the outcome      of elections. None of the proposals seek to regulate the      ability of the media--print, electronic, broadcast or cable--     to exercise its enormous power to direct news coverage and      editorialize in favor or against candidates. This would be      clearly unconstitutional. It is equally unconstitutional to      effectively chill and eliminate citizen group advocacy. It is      scandalous that Congress would muzzle issue groups in such a      fashion.       Finally, the ACLU has to be especially watchful of the      Federal Elections Commission because it is a federal agency      whose primary purpose is to monitor political speech. If      Congress gives the FEC the authority to decide what      constitutes ``true'' issue advocacy versus ``sham'' issue      advocacy, the FEC is then empowered to become ``Big Brother''      of the worst Kind. Already, it has been, far too often, an      agency in the business of investigating and prosecuting      political speech. The FEC would have to develop a huge      apparatus that would be in the full-time business of      determining which communications are considered unlawful      ``electioneering'' by citizens and non-profit groups.      Further, Shays-Meehan contains harsh penalties for failure      to comply with the new laws.Restrictions on the First Amendment Rights of Legal Permanent Residents                                  (LPRs)       Lawful permanent residents are stakeholders in our society.      They send their children to our schools, pay taxes on their      worldwide income, and like citizens, must register for the      draft and serve if the draft is re-instituted. In fact,      nearly 20,000 lawful permanent residents now serve      voluntarily in the military. By no stretch of the imagination      is their money ``foreign money.'' Lawful permanent residents      must reside in the U.S. or they forfeit their green cards and      right to remain. Moreover, the courts have repeatedly held      that non-citizens in the United States have First Amendment      rights, and this should include the right to make campaign      contributions.       The Shays-Meehan campaign finance bill was amended to bar      campaign contributions and expenditures from lawful permanent      residents. It virtually guarantees that candidates and their      campaign organizations will discriminate against new      Americans because it threatens them with substantial      penalties if they accept a donation they ``should have      known'' came from a non-citizen. We urge you to reject any      amendment to the McCain-Feingold bill that would bar such      contributions.                 Internet Political Speech Restrictions       We urge the Senate to support an amendment by Senator      Robert Bennett (R, UT) that would prohibit the FEC from      imposing restrictions on Internet commentary on candidates      and their positions on issues. Attached is an ACLU press      release that illustrates the draconian nature of FEC      restrictions on free expression on the Internet.                         Our Proposed Solutions       The ACLU believes that there is a less drastic and      constitutionally offensive way to achieve reform: public      financing.       If you believe that the public policy process is distorted      by candidates' growing dependence on large contributions then      you should help qualified candidates mount competitive      campaigns--especially if they lack personal wealth or cannot      privately raise large sums of money. Difficult questions have      to be resolved about how to deal with soft money and      independent expenditures. Some of these outcomes are      constrained by constitutionally based court decisions.       But notwithstanding the nay-sayers who say public financing      is dead on arrival, we should remember that we once had a      system where private citizens and political parties printed      their own ballots. It later became clear that to protect the      integrity of the electoral process ballots had to be printed      and paid for by the government. For the same reason the      public treasury pays for voting machines, polling booths and      registrars and the salaries of elected officials. In      conclusion, we take it as a fundamental premise that      elections are a public not a private process--a process at      the very heart of democracy. If we are fed up with a system      that allows too much private influence and personal and      corporate wealth to prevail then we should complete the task      by making public elections publicly financed.           Sincerely     Laura W. Murphy,       Director, Washington Office.     Joel Gora,       Professor of Law, Brooklyn Law School and Counsel to the      ACLU.     Gregory Nojeim,       Legislative Counsel.  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me read some of the letter.       The AFL-CIO is writing to express its opposition to the new      seemingly watered down McCain-Feingold bill. While it is true      that the most obvious direct legislative attacks on issue      advocacy have been removed from the bill, S. 1593 continues      to abridge the first amendment rights of those who want to      support party issue advocacy. The soft money restrictions      proposed in S. 1593 are just another less direct way to      restrain issue advocacy and therefore should be opposed.  I think that, plus the balance of the letter, sums up the constitutional arguments against the latest version of McCain-Feingold.  Earlier it had been my hope there would be an amendment offered by the other side. Seeing that is not the case, I am prepared to move forward and lay down the first amendment of this debate in which we are engaged.                           Amendment No. 2293    (Purpose: To require Senators to report credible information of corruption to the Select Committee on Ethics and amend title 18, United   States Code, to provide for mandatory minimum bribery penalties for                            public officials)  Mr. McCONNELL. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.
