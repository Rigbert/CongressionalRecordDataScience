The percentage of companies affected by this rule is only 5 percent, 68 percent of the Federal production; 95 percent of the oil companies, particularly the small and independent companies, are not affected by this debate. We are talking about the big boys. We are talking about the big oil companies and whether they are going to use our Federal public lands to make a profit and pay the taxpayers a fair share of their profit back to our Treasury.  When I heard the debate on the floor that I heard earlier suggesting that if these big oil companies have to pay their fair share of royalties, the price of a gallon of gasoline is going to go up at the pump, it is almost laughable. We are talking about such a small amount of money in terms of these multimillion-dollar oil companies but a significant amount of money which would come back to Federal taxpayers and to the States that are affected for very important purposes.  The Senator from California is correct.
