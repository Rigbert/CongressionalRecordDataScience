. 1628, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  The Commonwealth of Kentucky has benefitted immensely from the Affordable Care Act.  Its uninsured rate has fallen 61 percent, one of the sharpest declines of any State.  Kentucky chose to expand Medicaid, allowing 150,000 people to gain coverage.  More than 1.4 million Kentuckians are no longer subjected to lifetime or annual caps on their benefits.  Kentucky, sadly, has been one of the States hardest hit by the opioid epidemic. Thanks to the ACA, substance abuse treatment has increased 740 percent among Kentucky residents on Medicaid.  Today, 881,000 Kentuckians--33 percent of adults--have a preexisting condition that, before Obamacare, could have left them uninsurable.  So to ensure the health cand well-being of the residents of my neighboring State, Kentucky, this amendment says you cannot increase costs; cut services, benefits, or eligibility; eliminate essential health benefits; or impose lifetime limits or discriminate against Kentuckians with preexisting conditions.  If the Senators representing the Commonwealth want to rip away health insurance from their constituents, undermine protections for Kentuckians with preexisting conditions, and raise costs on older Kentuckians, well, count this neighboring Senator in to fight on their behalf.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   Motion to Commit With Instructions       Mr. Durbin moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the      Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pension with      instructions to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days,      not counting any day on which the Senate is not in session,      with changes that--       (1) are within the jurisdiction of such Committee;       (2) prohibit increases in health insurance premiums or out-     of-pocket health care costs for residents of Kentucky;       (3) prohibit reductions in eligibility or services, or any      increases in cost-sharing (including premiums and co-     payments) related to the eligibility of residents of Kentucky      to participate in the Medicaid program;       (4) prohibit health insurance issuers from imposing annual      or lifetime limits on residents of Kentucky;       (5) prohibit health insurance issuers from charging      residents of Kentucky who have pre-existing conditions more      than the amount charged to healthy residents; or       (6) prohibit health insurance issuers from stopping      coverage of any essential health benefits provided under      section 1302 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care      Act (42 U.S.C. 18022).
