Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  First of all, I would like to thank the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Latham) and the majority, along with the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Skeen), chairman of the subcommittee, for accepting this very worthy amendment offered by the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. Clayton).  I cannot think of another Member who comes up to me as much as the gentlewoman from North Carolina does to carry the plight of those from North Carolina who have been suffering from this hurricane, from floods, from low prices. We need more Members like the gentlewoman in this Congress.  Mr. Chairman, I want to say to the people of North Carolina who sent her here, they have really gotten their money's worth. This woman works every day, 24 hours a day for her constituents and for this country. And this particular initiative to try to provide modular housing to people who have been very damaged by disasters in North Carolina is but another example of the kind of work that she does here.  So my compliments to the gentlewoman for her leadership and her absolute devotion to her State and to her people. And I think that this amendment offers an innovative way to help people who have lost their homes through no fault of their own. And without question, it is the responsibility of the people of the United States to help our fellow brothers and sisters around this country who are trying to live under the weight of natural disasters over which they have had no control.  Mr. Chairman, I commend the gentlewoman for her real leadership coming to this committee, both sides of the aisle, and crafting a very worthy amendment like this. She obviously has the support of both sides of the aisle. I extend to her my congratulations.
