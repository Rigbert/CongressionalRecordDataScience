 President. I rise along with Senator Fitzgerald to reintroduce the Infant Crib Safety Act. This legislation is designed to reduce injuries and deaths that come from infant crib accidents.  Earch year, about 11,500 children ages 2 and under are injured in cribs seriously enough to require hospital treatment. Approximately, 26 children die a year from such injuries, the highest number of deaths caused by nursery-related products.  In fact, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, cribs cause more deaths than all other nursery items combined.  While strict guidelines exist on the manufacture of and sale of new cribs, there are millions of cribs sold throughout the U.S. in ``secondary markets'' such as thrift stores and resale furniture stores.  As many as half of the 4 million infants born in this country each year are placed in second hand cribs. Many of these used cribs are unsafe and should be taken off the market and either repaired or destroyed.  These used cribs can have dangerous features such as protruding corner post extensions, missing or broken parts, excessive slat width, poor fitting crib sheets, inadequate mattress supports, latches that do not prevent unintentional collapse of the crib. Cribs built before 1978 have a higher lead content than current regulations allow.  Let me give you some of the real life examples of the tragedies caused by unsafe cribs.  At the age of 23 months, Danny Lineweaver was injured during an attempt to climb out of his crib. Danny caught his shirt on a decorative knob on the cornerpost of his crib and hanged himself. Though his mother was able to perform CPR the moment she found him, Danny lived in a semi-comatose state for 9 years and died in 1993.  In another case, Luke Torgerson, a 13-month-old infant, died due to an unsafe crib at this daycare facility in Minnesota.  Parents should have confidence that a crib is a safe place to leave an infant. The design and construction of a baby crib must ensure that it is safe to leave an infant while sleeping.  Since cribs are the only juvenile product manufactured expressly for leaving a child unattended, every necessary measure should be taken to ensure that the crib is the safest possible environment.  The Infant Crib Safety Act keeps unsafe secondhand or hand-me-down cribs out of the stream of commerce by prohibiting their sale, resale, lease, and use in lodging facilities or day care centers.  This bill does not apply to individuals who provide cribs to their friends, or to any type of individual sale of a crib such as at a garage sale. The bill focuses on commercial users. And currently, controls over cribs provided by transient public lodging establishments or sold at thrift stores are non-existent.  Studies have shown that hotels and motels continue to use unsafe cribs and thrift stores continue to sell them. In the year 2000, the National Safe Kids Campaign did an investigation of cribs used by hotels and motels. Spot checks by the Campaign identified unsafe cribs in 80 percent of the cribs visited.  A year earlier, the Consumer Product Safety Commission found that 12 percent of the cribs sold in a survey of thrift stores did not meet existing voluntary industry or Federal safety standards for new cribs.  Comparable legislation has already been adopted by a number of States. Eleven States including Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Washington have already passed legislation prohibiting the sale of cribs that do not meet current safety standards.  There is no good reason why cribs in all 50 States should not meet these reasonable safety standards.  The legislation is supported by the Consumer Federation of America and the Danny Foundation.  I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to turn this common-sense legislation into law.                                 ______                                       By
