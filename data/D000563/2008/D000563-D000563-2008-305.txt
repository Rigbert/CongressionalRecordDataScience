This bill authorizes a temporary health benefit during a public emergency for people in that area who don't have health insurance. The program makes it more likely that people who need healthcare services will get them and ensures that the doctors and nurses who treat them will be compensated.  Since 2000, the Secretary of Health and Human Services has had the authority to declare public health emergencies so that government can provide resources quickly to communities in need. That authority has been exercised very rarely--for 9-11; Hurricanes Wilma, Katrina, and Rita; and the recent flooding in the Midwest. These public health emergencies--both man-made and natural disasters--ruined neighborhoods, divided families, and weakened many spirits. But for every tragic emergency witnessed, we saw acts of remarkable selflessness and kindness.  One of the greatest examples of this generosity is in the efforts of local health care providers to meet the increased need for services. Whether it was the hurricanes that hit the Gulf Coast, the debris in downtown New York, or the waters in the Midwest, the need for medical services was immediate and in some cases dramatic. The demand for mental health services also rose in response to the psychological stress and trauma caused by the destruction of homes, the loss of jobs, the separation of families, and the death and devastation surrounding those in the areas hit by these tragic events.  Despite the trauma of a disaster or the pain from an injury incurred during a disaster, people who don't seek care not only leave themselves vulnerable to worsening health conditions, but they exacerbate the situation on the ground. For those uninsured people who do access medical care, the providers--typically those in areas immediately surrounding the disaster area--are often left without any compensation.  During Hurricane Katrina, the Harris County hospital district in Houston assumed responsibility for the health care of 23,000 evacuees living in the Reliant Astrodome. In Baton Rouge, hospitals struggled to meet the health care needs of a population that doubled in size after absorbing half a million evacuees. Health facilities and other public infrastructure were stretched beyond their capacity as they faced the multiple challenges of addressing the public health needs in the counties or parishes directly affected; delivering needed health care to the displaced; and ensuring the continued delivery of health care services to residents of the other areas.  Victims of public health emergencies should know that the government will assist them in their time of need. This is why I am introducing the Public Health Emergency Response Act.  The Public Health Emergency Response Act would make it easier for uninsured victims to seek treatment and would provide coverage to the health care professionals who are treating them. The bill would establish a temporary emergency health benefit for people who are uninsured. The benefit could be triggered only when the Secretary of Health and Human Services declared a public health emergency and chose to activate the benefit. The benefit would last for up to 90 days, and the Secretary could extend it once for another 90 days. Rather than put additional stress on our public health programs like Medicare, Medicaid or SCHIP, the funding mechanism for the benefit is the Public Health Emergency Fund, a no-year fund established in 1983. Funds for emergency victims' health coverage would be determined by Congressional appropriations. The bill will help save lives and ensure a functioning health care system for whatever lies ahead.  Most recently, we saw the entire Midwest reeling from weeks of flooding and tornadoes--from Minnesota to Kansas and everywhere in between--Wisconsin, Iowa, Missouri, and, of course, Illinois. The damage has been heartbreaking. We know from the great flood that devastated the Midwest in 1993 and from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita that the losses from this chain of weather-related disasters will be more than our states and citizens alone can bare. We also know that, in times of crisis, Americans have always come together to help those in need.  The Public Health Emergency Response Act carries on this tradition. The bill allows Federal government to prepare for the next emergency. We do not know what the next public health emergency will look like. It may be a bioterrorist attack, a hurricane, or pandemic flu. We should act now to create the framework for emergency health coverage and reimbursement.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a letter of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3312       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Public Health Emergency      Response Act of 2008''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:       (1) Since 2000, the Secretary of Health and Human Services      has declared that a public health emergency existed      nationwide in response to the attacks of September 11th and      in response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.       (2) In the event of a public health emergency, compliance      with recommendations to seek immediate care may be critical      to containing the spread of an infectious disease outbreak or      responding to a bioterror attack.       (3) Nearly sixteen percent of Americans lack health      insurance coverage.       (4) Fears of out-of-pocket expenses may cause individuals      to delay seeking medical attention during a public health      emergency.       (5) A public health emergency may disrupt health care      assistance programs for individuals with chronic conditions,      exacerbating the costs and risks to their health.       (6) The uninsured could place great financial strain on      healthcare providers during a public health emergency.       (7) The Department of Health and Human Services Pandemic      Influenza Plan projects that a pandemic influenza outbreak      could result in 45 million additional outpatient visits, with      865,000 to 9,900,000 individuals requiring hospitalization,      depending upon the severity of the pandemic.       (8) Hospitals in the United States could lose as much as      $3.9 billion in uncompensated care and cash flow losses in      the event of a severe pandemic.       (9) Under current statute, no dedicated mechanism exists to      reimburse providers for uncompensated care during a public      health emergency.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to provide temporary emergency healthcare coverage for      uninsured and certain otherwise qualified individuals in the      event of a public health emergency declared by the Secretary      of Health and Human Services;       (2) to ensure that healthcare providers remain fiscally      solvent and are not overburdened by the cost of uncompensated      care during a public health emergency;       (3) to eliminate a primary disincentive for uninsured and      certain otherwise qualified individuals to promptly seek      medical care during a public health emergency; and       (4) to minimize delays in the provision of emergency      healthcare coverage by clarifying eligibility requirements      and the scope of such coverage and identifying the funding      mechanisms for emergency healthcare services.     SEC. 3. EMERGENCY HEALTHCARE COVERAGE.       (a) In General.--Title III of the Public Health Service Act      is amended by inserting after section 319K the following new      section:     ``SEC. 319K-1. EMERGENCY HEALTHCARE COVERAGE.       ``(a) Activation and Termination of Emergency Healthcare      Coverage.--       ``(1) Based on public health emergency.--       ``(A) In general.--The Secretary may activate the coverage      of emergency healthcare services under this section only if      the Secretary determines that there is a public health      emergency.       ``(B) Determination of public health emergency.--For      purposes of this section, there is a `public health      emergency' only if a public health emergency exists under      section 319.       ``(2) Considerations.--In making a determination under      paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consider a range of      factors including the following:       ``(A) The degree to which the emergency is likely to      overwhelm healthcare providers in the region.       ``(B) The opportunity to minimize morbidity and mortality      through intervention under this section.       ``(C) The estimated number of direct casualties of the      emergency.       ``(D) The potential number of casualties in the absence of      intervention under this section (such as in the case of      infectious disease).       ``(E) The potential adverse financial impacts on local      healthcare providers in the absence of activation of this      section.       ``(F) The need for healthcare services is of sufficient      severity and magnitude to warrant major assistance under this      section above and beyond the emergency services otherwise      available from the Federal Government.       ``(G) Such other factors as the Secretary may deem      appropriate.       ``(3) Termination and extension.--       ``(A) In general.--Coverage of emergency healthcare      services under this section shall terminate, subject to      subsection (c)(2), upon the earlier of the following:       ``(i) The Secretary's determination that a public health      emergency no longer exists.       ``(ii) Subject to subparagraph (B), 90 days after the      initiation of coverage of emergency healthcare services.       ``(B) Extension authority.--The Secretary may extend a      public health emergency for a second 90-day period, but only      if a report to Congress is made under paragraph (4) in      conjunction with making such extension.       ``(4) Report.--       ``(A) In general.--Prior to making an extension under      paragraph (3)(B), the Secretary shall transmit a report to      Congress that includes information on the nature of the      public health emergency and the expected duration of the      emergency. The Secretary shall include in such report      recommendations, if deemed appropriate, regarding requesting      Congress to provide a further extension of the public health      emergency period beyond the second 90-day period.       ``(B) Report contents.--A report under subparagraph (A)      shall include a discussion of the healthcare needs of      emergency victims and affected individuals including the      likely need for follow-up care over a two-year period.       ``(5) Coordination.--The Secretary shall ensure that the      activation, implementation, and termination of emergency      healthcare services under this section in response to a      public health emergency is coordinated with all functions,      personnel, and assets of the Federal, State, local, and      tribal responses to the emergency.       ``(6) Medical monitoring program.--The Secretary shall      establish a medical monitoring program for monitoring and      reporting on healthcare needs of the affected population over      time. At least annually during the 5-year period following      the date of a public health emergency, the Secretary shall      report to Congress on any continuing healthcare needs of the      affected population related to the public health emergency.      Such reports shall include recommendations on how to ensure      that emergency victims and affected individuals have access      to needed healthcare services.       ``(b) Eligibility for Coverage of Emergency Healthcare      Services.--       ``(1) Limited eligibility.--       ``(A) In general.--Eligibility for coverage of emergency      healthcare services under this section for a public health      emergency is limited to individuals who--       ``(i) are emergency victims who are uninsured or otherwise      qualified; or       ``(ii) are affected individuals who are uninsured.       ``(B) Definitions.--For purposes of this section with      respect to a public health emergency:       ``(i) Insured.--An individual is `insured' if the      individual has group or individual health insurance coverage      or publicly financed health insurance (as defined by the      Secretary).       ``(ii) Otherwise qualified.--An individual is ``otherwise      qualified'' if the individual is insured but the Secretary      determines that the individual's healthcare insurance      coverage is not at least actuarially-equivalent to benchmark      coverage.

Hon. Richard Durbin,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Lois Capps,     House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Durbin and Representative Capps: The      undersigned organizations join in supporting your      introduction of the Public Health Emergency Response Act      (PHERA), legislation that would put a turn-key process into      place which would ensure that victims of a public health      emergency have immediate access to medically necessary      healthcare services and help ensure that we have a      functioning health care system.       A public health emergency, such as a natural disaster,      biologic attack or infectious disease outbreak, could strike      at any time. The September 11th attacks and Hurricanes      Katrina and Rita have underscored the need for rapid access      to healthcare services during and immediately following a      public health emergency. Following Hurricane Katrina,      Congress ultimately approved $2.1 billion for grants to      certain states to cover the Medicaid and SCHIP matching      requirements for individuals enrolled in these programs, and      the cost of uncompensated care for the uninsured. However, it      took six months for Congress to pass the Deficit Reduction      Act, which provided for these funds. This unnecessary delay      could have been prevented. PHERA would put into place ahead      of time a framework for providing reimbursement for      uncompensated care in the event of a major public health      emergency.       The temporary benefit established through this bill would      help remove a disincentive for uninsured individuals to      promptly seek medical care. Any delay in seeking care could      result in lives lost, particularly during an infectious      disease outbreak when immediate identification and isolation      are very important, and delay in seeking care could render      treatment ineffective. At a time when our health care system      could be overwhelmed with patients, it is vital that      reimbursement issues not dissuade providers from offering      care. A study by the Center for Biosecurity estimated that      U.S. hospitals could lose as much as $3.9 billion in      uncompensated care and cash flow losses in the event of a      severe pandemic. By helping to reduce the burden of      uncompensated care, PHERA would help ensure the solvency and      continuity and our health care system during a catastrophic      emergency.       Specifically, PHERA would provide a temporary emergency      health benefit for uninsured individuals and individuals      whose health insurance coverage is not actuarially equivalent      to benchmark coverage, in the event that the Secretary of      Health and Human Services (HHS) declares that a public health      emergency exists and chooses to activate the benefit. It      would clarify who is eligible for this benefit, including      individuals displaced by a public health emergency, limit the      amount of time for which the benefit would last, and      stipulate what providers would be covered under this Act. It      would not use Medicare, Medicaid or SCHIP funding. The      funding mechanism would be the Public Health Emergency Fund,      a no-year fund available to the Secretary. The bill      authorizes funding for the administration of the fund,      together with a public education campaign on the availability      of the benefit, but further funding would not be necessary      until Congress appropriated funds in the event of a declared      public health emergency.       Past experiences have shown that Congress will step in to      help defray the costs of uncompensated care resulting from a      catastrophic emergency. Determining the scope of such      coverage ahead of time will help ensure the solvency of our      health care system and help eliminate a disincentive for      individuals to promptly seek care. PHERA would help ensure      that when tragedy strikes, time and lives are not lost as      Congress debates a course of action. It would create the      turn-key process ahead of time, thereby allowing for timely      care to individuals affected by a crisis.       We appreciate your leadership in introducing this      legislation and look forward to working with you on this and      other public health initiatives in the future.
