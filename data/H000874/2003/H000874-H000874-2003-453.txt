Speaker, I thank the gentleman. We will discuss this with the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spratt), the ranking member. I am sure the gentleman will want to discuss it with the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Nussle) as well. Hopefully, we can reach an agreement so all Members can be accommodated to participate in that important debate.  Mr. Leader, the partial birth abortion bill, I understand that was marked up yesterday. Does the gentleman know when that will be coming to the floor? Is it going to be next week or the week after?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will yield, Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is correct, the Committee on the Judiciary reported this legislation out early this week. We would like to consider this bill in the very near future, but, as I mentioned earlier, over the next 2 weeks floor time is going to be at very much a premium. We would like to do it, but it looks like in trying to assess what the needs of the House are for the next 2 weeks we are not going to be able to get to this bill before the Easter break. It is more likely that we will consider the bill in May.
