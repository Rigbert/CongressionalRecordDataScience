President, I rise today to submit a Senate resolution that will reaffirm the fundamental constitutional and statutory protections accorded sealed domestic mail. I am very pleased to have the distinguished chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs and Homeland Security Committee, Senator Lieberman, as a cosponsor, Senator Carper, who was the author of the postal reform bill with me in the last Congress, Senator Coleman, and Senator Akaka, all of whom have been very active on postal issues.  On December 20, President Bush signed into law the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act that Senator Carper and I originally introduced in 2004. This new law represents the most sweeping reforms to the U.S. Postal Service in more than 30 years.  The Presiding Officer and new chairman of the committee knows well that of all the legislation our committee produced last year, in many ways this was the most difficult to bring to completion.  The act, which will help the 225-year-old Postal Service, meets the challenges of the 21st century, establishes a new rate-setting system, helps ensure a stronger financial future for the Postal Service, provides more stability and predictability in rates, and protects the basic feature of universal service. One of the act's many provisions provides continued authority for the Postal Service to establish a class of mail sealed against inspection.  The day President Bush signed the Postal Reform Act into law, he also issued a signing statement construing that particular provision to permit ``searches in exigent circumstances, such as to protect human life and safety.'' While I understand that the President's spokesman has explained that the signing statement did not intend to change the scope of this new law, it has resulted in considerable confusion and widespread concern about the President's commitment to abide by the basic privacy protections afforded sealed domestic mail. For some, it raised the specter of the Government unlawfully monitoring our mail in the name of national security.  Given this unfortunate perception, I wish to be very clear as the author of this legislation. Nothing in the Postal Reform Act, nor in the President's signing statement, alters in any waythe privacy and civil liberty protections provided to a person who sends or receives sealed mail. In fact, the President's signing statement appears to do nothing more than restate current law, but by the mere act of issuing the signing statement, unfortunately, the administration raised questions about what, in fact, is their intent.  Under current law, mail sealed against inspection is entitled to the strongest possible protections against physical searches, the protections afforded by our Constitution which guard against unreasonable searches. With only limited exceptions, the Government needs a warrant issued by a court before it can search sealed mail. This is true whether the search is conducted under our Criminal Code to obtain evidence of a crime or under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA, of 1978 to collect foreign intelligence information concerning a national security threat. Only when there is an immediate danger to life or limb or an immediate and substantial danger to property can the Government search a domestic sealed letter or package without a warrant. Let me give a couple of examples. That could occur when there are wires protruding from a package, for example, or odors escaping from an envelope or stains on the outside of a package indicating that the contents may constitute an immediate danger or threat.  Americans depend on the U.S. Postal Service to transact business and to communicate with friends and family, and if there is any doubt in the public's mind that the Government is not protecting the constitutional privacy accorded their mail, if there is suspicion that the Government is unlawfully opening mail, then our Nation's confidence in the sanctity of our mail system and, indeed, in our Government will be eroded. That is precisely why I am joining with my colleagues in submitting this resolution today. It makes clear to all law-abiding Americans that the Federal Government will not invade their privacy by reading their sealed mail absent a court order or emergency circumstances. Any contrary interpretation of the Postal Reform Act is just plain wrong.  I invite my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this resolution which reaffirms the constitutional and statutory protections accorded to domestic sealed mail. I say to the Presiding Officer, the chairman of the committee with jurisdiction over this matter, that I hope we can act very quickly and get this resolution approved by the full Senate. I believe it is important that we go on record without any delay to assure the American people that those protections which they value so much are still in place and have not been altered, given the doubt that the President's signing statement created.                          ____________________
