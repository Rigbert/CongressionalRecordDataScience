John Evans of Miller Beach. On Sunday, November 2, 2008, John was honored by the Indiana Division of the Polish American Congress for his many years of service as a dedicated member of his community, as well as a proud representative of the Polish American heritage in Northwest Indiana. This extraordinary event took place at The Patio restaurant in Merrillville, Indiana.  John Evans, a lifelong resident of Northwest Indiana and the son of Russell Glenn and Eleanor Evans of New Chicago, Indiana, has been recognized by the Polish American Congress, Indiana Division, as the recipient of the 2008 Distinguished Service Award. From his career in the insurance industry to his service with several of Northwest Indiana's churches to his commitment to preserving the Polish heritage, John is truly deserving of this prestigious accolade. Always one to try to improve the lives of his fellow citizens in any way possible, John has spent the last twenty-four years working with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois. After spending many years building relationships between hospitals and providers as a Provider Network Consultant, John moved into a management position in 2000 and was recently promoted to Director of Provider Network Relations. In his current position, John is responsible for overseeing relations with all hospitals, physicians, and ancillary providers for the State of Illinois. As a member of the Blue Cross Blue Shield team, John has been active with the company's Diversity Workforce Committee, serving as Master of Ceremonies for their 2007 Polish Heritage Day.  Mr. Evans, widely known as a truly gifted musician, has been a fixture in the Northwest Indiana for, in all sincerity, most of his life. As a child of only ten years of age, John began formally studying the organ with Mrs. Joanne Sparks of Gary, Indiana. Only a few short years later, John began playing dinner music at Wilson's Restaurant and Lounge in Miller Beach, entertaining diners every Friday and Saturday night. During this time, he also began playing at wedding receptions and other banquets, as well as serving as the organist at Sunday masses at Assumption B.V.M. Church in New Chicago. From there, at a mere fifteen years of age, John took over as the director of the church's choir in 1973. During the twenty-three years he spent at Assumption, John's leadership meant not only an increase in choir membership, but in popularity as well. During this time, the choir was asked to perform at many dances, ordinations, anniversaries, and other special occasions. In fact, they even recorded an album entitled ``Christmas in New Chicago'' which featured Polish and English Christmas carols.  Fully committed to his faith and his heritage, John also has organized and choreographed dance selections for Polish Women's Alliance Saint Anne's Group 778, directed the choir at events for the Polish Women's Alliance Group 132, and directed the choir for the Polish mass at Saint Stanislaus in Michigan City, Indiana. In 1996, Mr. Evans took over as the organist and choir director for the Saint Cecilia Choir at Saint Stanislaus Parish in East Chicago, Indiana. Since taking over at Saint Stan's, the membership of the choir has nearly doubled, and John has been successful in bringing young people into the choir. Not to be outdone, the choir at Saint Stanislaus has also produced a professional CD of Polish and English hymns and religious selections entitled ``Spirit,'' which has sold over 500 copies, profits from it contributing to various church renovations.  Madam Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending Mr. John Evans as he is honored for his lifetime of service and dedication to the Northwest Indiana community. His years of service have touched and improved the lives of all whom he has served. His unselfish and lifelong dedication is worthy of the highest commendation, and I am proud to represent him in Congress.                          ____________________
