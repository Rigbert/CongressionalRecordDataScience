Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), a champion of America's space program.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, 25 years ago, America and the world were introduced to a new generation of heroes and a new era of human imagination. The moment the Space Shuttle Columbia first launched into low-Earth orbit, every other mode of space transportation was rendered obsolete.  The shuttle was then, and remains today, the most dependable and most technologically advanced spacecraft in the world.  In the last quarter century, the shuttle has become a global icon of American ingenuity and American courage. Since Commander John Young and Pilot Robert Crippen took the shuttle's maiden voyage, dozens of men and women, scientists, soldiers and school teachers have followed them in NASA's mission to conquer the unknown. And in that time, 14 shuttle astronauts have been lost in the pursuit of that noble mission, men and women whose names we remember and whose valor we can never forget.  Where I come from, the space shuttle is more than a symbol. It is part of our community. The shuttle's managers, engineers, astronauts, contractors and designers have long called the Houston region their home. They are the people who have made our Johnson Space Center America's ``laboratory of the impossible,'' and for 25 years have stretched both the technological capacity and the collective imagination of the American people.  It is an honor to represent such heroes in this House and it is an honor to cast my vote in favor of this resolution congratulating NASA and America's space community for 25 years of making history and fulfilling dreams. I urge my colleagues to support NASA's heroes and support this resolution.
