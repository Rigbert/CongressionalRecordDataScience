 President, on behalf of the Republican leader, as in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:20 today the Senate proceed to executive session and there be 10 minutes of debate in the usual form on Executive Calendar No. 505, the nomination of Jeremy D. Fogel, of California, to be U.S. district judge.  I further ask unanimous consent that immediately following the debate, the Senate proceed to a vote on the confirmation of the nomination, and following the vote, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then return to legislative session.
