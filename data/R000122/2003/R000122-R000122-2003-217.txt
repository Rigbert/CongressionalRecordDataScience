I understand that once this legislation is passed by the Senate, it will be placed on the desk, and there are procedural opportunities there, I believe, to try to address this at least to somehow get an opportunity to look at this measure. Also with the opportunity to look at this over the course of the next few days, my apprehensions might be misplaced and we can proceed forward. But I think, again, the intention and the understanding we had have been met. I am just surprised about the inclusion of this particular position in something like a technical managers' amendment. Given the commitment the majority leader has made, certainly, about the overall status of this legislation, should it return from the other body,then I would not object to the consent at this time.  Hopefully, over the next few days we will learn a little bit more about this compassionate fund and perhaps even deal with it if it is a problem on Monday.
