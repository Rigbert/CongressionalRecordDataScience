  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, the proponents of fast track would have us believe today's legislative battle is about whether or not the United States will trade. This is not about a battle between protection as free traders, but rather a struggle over the conditions of that trade and who will benefit from that trade. On one side, the President, the entire administration, the Republican leadership, and a fleet of corporate CEO's who have actually been given office space right downstairs in the Capitol in violation of the House rules.  On our side, 80 percent of the Democrats and a small group of Republicans. We think it is time to overhaul our failing trade policy, a policy that has brought $160 billion trade deficits, exported jobs, driven down wages, weakened our environmental and food safety laws, all in the name of free trade. A policy that undermines our values to encourage a race to the bottom; enriching a few multinational corporations and their CEO's at the expense of the majority of American workers and communities.  ``No'' to the threats, ``no'' to the silent promises, ``no'' to the legal campaign bribery, ``no'' to fast track, and ``yes'' to the beginnings of a new trade policy that benefits all Americans.                          ____________________
