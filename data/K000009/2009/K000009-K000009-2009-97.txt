 Now, let us get this straight: Hank Paulson, the former Goldman Sachs boss, now Secretary of Treasury, wants $350 billion more to burn after the first $350 billion of our taxpayers' money was already wasted on the Wall Street bailout. Congress is being asked to do this a few days before a new President takes office. Hmmm, the timing of that even is suspicious just on the face of it. Why not wait until the new President takes office so he can really fix this right by using the FDIC and the SEC, as their past practices well demonstrate?  Why give all this power to Treasury? This would make sense to any reasoning person, unless of course you're one of the bankster beneficiaries who have been planning this heist for a long time. It's almost a perfect crime, too; complicated enough on the surface to intimidate the public and many in Congress by using fear of the future to mask what is being perpetrated.  The architects of this financial crime aim to cement the deal now--a perfect time--when the country is distracted, the Congress hoodwinked with no real oversight, at a moment of transition between two Presidents. The banksters aim to secure their last overdose from the U.S. Treasury with little oversight. The question is, will Congress be hoodwinked again, losing all reason?  We can't even account for what was done with the first $350 billion, so now we're supposed to double that and give more? What we do know is that the home foreclosure crisis wasn't helped by the first Wall Street bailout. Home foreclosures are escalating, getting worse. Why trust Treasury again? Meanwhile, Wall Street mega-banks have cleaned up as Main Streets across our country have lost 10 percent of their homes to foreclosure.  The first TARP was adopted without hearings, real debate or amendments, without proper justification, safeguards or oversight. And then the Secretary of Treasury didn't do anything to help the housing crisis, instead using the money for banks to buy other banks through capital infusions, which should have been done by the FDIC anyway.  Now it appears that Congress is gearing up to give the Secretary another $350 billion to spend on--well, it's not exactly clear on what. The legislation states that $40 to $100 billion is intended for some kind of foreclosure relief without specifying how it is to be accomplished. Is a $60 billion swing between these numbers the best we can do in estimating the cost of the program? That's more than we spend on several agencies of our government combined. What is the remaining $250 billion to $310 billion to be used for? Who decides? Just Treasury again? Is this lunacy or collusion?  If we are going to continue putting capital into financial institutions, shouldn't we at least order the SEC to stop destroying capital through outdated real estate accounting? Shouldn't we allow the President a bit of time to see if the Fed's very aggressive monetary policy activities, coupled with enormous deficit spending we've already done, are having any effect? Why this rush? It's overtime for justice to reign down. It's time for this Congress to assume its constitutional responsibilities and not cede our power to the executive branch.                              {time}  1600  May truth and justice will out. This bill won't get either.  I thank the gentleman very much for yielding.
