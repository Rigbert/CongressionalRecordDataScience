President, I rise today regarding remarks I made on October 5, 2018, on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh. In reference to Justices O'Connor, Souter, and Kennedy, I misspoke and should have said that pro-choice groups opposed two of the nominations, not each.  My remarks should have read, ``Furthermore, pro-choice groups vigorously opposed two of the Justices' nominations.''                          ____________________
