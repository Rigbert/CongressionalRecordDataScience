Mr. Speaker, we have not done our work. The Republican-controlled Congress has not finished its work.  Where is the Patients' Bill of Rights?  Where is the prescription drug benefit?  Where is the minimum wage legislation?  Where are the 100,000 new teachers?  Where is the new school construction?  Where is the juvenile justice bill?  The majority party has not done its work. We have not been fair to the American people. They deserve better. They need our help and Congress has done nothing. We are nearing the end of another do-nothing Congress that has not done anything for the American people.  We should be ashamed to leave this place, ashamed to end this Congress until we finish the people's agenda.                          ____________________
