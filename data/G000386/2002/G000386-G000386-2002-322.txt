  We have an opportunity to do what has been a part of farm programs for 70 years: try to target the safety net for farmers to medium and smaller family farmers. We have an opportunity to save the taxpayers some money that would go to big corporate farms. We have an opportunity to bring money into the Food Stamp Program, and we are adjusting the formulas to reflect higher payments for shelter and for utilities and for heating homes so that the Northeast of the United States will be able to help some of their low-income people to a greater extent than they have been through the present formula, the Food Stamp Program. That is the use of the money.  The most important thing is targeting assistance to the family farmers. The legislation before us disproportionately benefits the Nation's largest farmers and in most cases nonfamily farmers. In fact, this farm bill unnecessarily increases payment limitations established in the present farm program which already allows up to $460,000.  We have a chance to do a very good thing from the standpoint of bipartisanship that has traditionally been such a part of the farm program. We have had several bipartisan amendments--for concentration and arbitration, and now for the payment limitation. Let's see what we can do to develop a bipartisan farm bill. Voting for this amendment will be one more bipartisan amendment to be adopted.
