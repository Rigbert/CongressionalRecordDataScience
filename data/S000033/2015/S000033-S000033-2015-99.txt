 They say we have to cut Medicare and Medicaid and education because of the terrible deficit. Do you know why we have a deficit and large debt? Because we went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan and we forgot to pay for it.  Now Senator Rubio says, hey, let's continue spending more money on war but just put it on the credit card. We don't have to pay for it. Enough is enough. If you want to go to war, start paying for that war. Let the American people know what the cost of war is.  Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment violates section 312(b) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
