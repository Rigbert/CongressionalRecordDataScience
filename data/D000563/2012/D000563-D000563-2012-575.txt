 The chart Senator Coons has brought to the floor at this point indicates the dramatic growth that is occurring right now in Africa, and I think it would surprise a lot of people, as he said, who believe this is still a continent which is struggling with age-old problems.  In the past 10 years, 6 of the world's 10 fastest growing economies were located in Sub-Saharan Africa, and in the next 5 years it is expected that 7 of the world's 10 fastest growing economies will be in Sub-Saharan Africa.  The bill which we are bringing here is an effort to focus America's export market on this great continent and this great opportunity, creating jobs at home and a better working relationship with the countries and leaders of Africa.  I went to Ethiopia last year and met with the Prime Minister of Ethiopia. As I have done in the times when I have traveled to other countries, I asked: What has been the impact of China on your country? We stayed and spoke for another 30 minutes as he explained to me the dramatic changes taking place in Ethiopia because of China.  The numbers tell the story. When we look at what China offers to Ethiopia and the continent of Africa, they are offering concessional loans. What it means is, if it is a $100 million project that you need to start in Africa, the Chinese will give you $100 million and say ``but you only have to pay back $70 million.'' What a great deal that is, a 30-percent discount--with a few conditions: that you use Chinese engineers and Chinese construction companies and half the workers will be coming over to your country from China.  They are building a base of economic support within Africa. Between 2008 and 2010, China provided more to the developing world than the World Bank, loans totaling more than $110 billion. What we are suggesting is that as this is a growing opportunity for exports, we need to grow with it.  I would like to yield to my colleague from Arkansas who has been kind enough to join us in this effort.
