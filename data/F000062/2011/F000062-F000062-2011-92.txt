 The report--entitled ``Responding to Violence in Central America''--is endorsed by all seven Senators on the Caucus. In particular, I want to thank my cochairman Senator Grassley for his efforts on this report.  Violence in Central America has reached crisis levels. Throughout Central America, Mexican drug trafficking organizations, local drug traffickers, transnational youth gangs, and other illegal criminal networks are taking advantage of weak governance and underperforming justice systems.  Contrary to what many might think, the murder rates in Central America last year were significantly higher than those in Mexico. In 2010, there were 18 homicides per 100,000 people in Mexico. In comparison, there were 50 murders per 100,000 people in Guatemala, 66 in El Salvador and 77 in Honduras. GEN Douglas Fraser--the Commander of U.S. Southern Command--said that ``the northern triangle of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras is the deadliest zone in the world outside of war zones.''  Our report calls for security in Central America to become a greater priority across all U.S. Government agencies. The caucus calls for a two-track approach to U.S. assistance to Central America focusing in the short term on highly vetted law enforcement units while not losing sight of the long-term goal of strengthening institutions.  The report's key recommendations include:  Expand vetted units: The caucus calls for the expansion of vetted law enforcement units which work with the Drug Enforcement Administration--known as sensitive investigative units--to all seven countries in Central America. Vetted units provide a trusted partner to U.S. law enforcement in countries where corruption is often rampant. I supported language that was included in the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice and Science's Fiscal Year 2012 Appropriations bill that recommends the expansion of these units throughout Central America.  Speed up security assistance: Our report calls on the State Department to speed up the arrival of security assistance to Central America by changing it from being managed remotely by the U.S. Embassy in Mexico to allowing it to be managed directly by each of the U.S. embassies in Central America.  Increase drug traffickers' extraditions: Our report recommends that the Obama administration encourage our partners in Central America to increase the extradition to the United States of their nationals who are involved in international drug trafficking. Currently, Panama, Honduras, and Costa Rica will not extradite their nationals to the United States.  The caucus believes that extradition from Mexico to the United States has been a critical tool in combating Mexican drug trafficking organizations. Bringing these fugitives to the United States for prosecution ensures that they cannot evade justice through bribes or threats of violence in their home countries.  Support witness, judge and prosecutor protection programs: Next, our report calls for the State Department and USAID to use existing funds to provide support for witness, judge and prosecutor protection programs in Central America. Far too often, witnesses in Central America are afraid to testify at hearings because of corruption in the judicial system and fear of retaliation. Judges and prosecutors are equally afraid to pursue cases against high-profile criminals.  Map sources of violence: Our report recommends that the countries of Central America map the causes and sources of violence in the region. Without a clear understanding of the causes and sources of violence, it will be difficult to provide relevant solutions to the security situation in Central America.  Reduce the U.S. demand for drugs: Last, but certainly not least, the caucus's report emphasizes that drug consumption in the United States fuels violence in Central America. The United States continues to be the world's largest consumer of illegal drugs. The 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that 22.6 million Americans aged 12 or older were current illegal drug users.  Senator Grassley and I have asked the Government Accountability Office to conduct a study to evaluate the successes and shortcomings of drug prevention and treatment programs in the United States. I have also asked my staff to prepare a report on how to most effectively reduce the U.S. demand for drugs.  Central America is at a dangerous crossroads. A further deterioration of the security situation in Central America could severely damage already weak institutions and justice systems. I, therefore, urge the Obama administration and my colleagues in Congress to make security in Central America a priority.                          ____________________
