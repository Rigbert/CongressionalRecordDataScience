Speaker, I am pleased to announce that tomorrow, Wednesday, September 28, 2005, the Local Initiatives Support Corporation will celebrate its 25th anniversary here in Washington. LISC certainly has a lot to celebrate.  This national organization was born out of the foresight of Mike Svirdoff and the Ford Foundation, with just $10 million and the goal of identifying 50 to 100 local economic development organizations worthy of support. Even Mr. Svirdoff himself might not have envisioned that, within a quarter of a century, LISC would grow into an organization that has raised more than $6 billion dollars in grants, loans and equity for more than 1,700 community development corporations nationwide. These funds support projects in 38 cities and rural areas in 37 states.  LISC's mission is to help ``resident-led, community-based development organizations transform distressed communities and neighborhoods into healthy ones--good places to live, do business, work and raise families.'' It works toward these ends by providing comprehensive services to the CDCs it serves, from capital to technical expertise, training, and information. In addition, LISC supports the development of local leadership and the creation of affordable housing, commercial development, industrial and community facilities, and jobs. In short, it helps residents build and strengthen their own communities.  LISC is an intermediary for more than 900 corporations and foundations, providing technical and financial resources to help CDCs become fiscally sound institutions capable of carrying out a range of community revitalization activities. LISC's second focus is in improving local community development environments. The strength of the organization lies in its abilities to forge partnerships among local LISC programs, community organizations, foundations, commercial interests, and state and local governments. In addition, LISC branches beyond its local focus by advocating for neighborhood-based development and informing related public policy decisions at the federal level.  I have witnessed the value of LISC's work first hand, as our local branch has revitalized many of the most distressed communities in Toledo, OH. Toledo LISC currently funds one dozen of our community development corporations, and over its 15-year presence has funded nearly two dozen. As of December 31, 2004, contributions from corporations, individuals, small businesses and foundations totaling $3.6 million had leveraged nearly $60 million for Toledo CDCs.  As a result of these investments, redevelopment projects have replaced deteriorated homes and buildings with sought-after housing and commercial real estate. One such project was the creation of Toledo's newest sub-division of market-rate single-family homes. Of the ten new homes constructed thus far, nine have already been sold. This development was possible in part because of a pre-development loan from LISC to the Organized Neighbors Yielding eXcellence (ONYX) CDC. Another of LISC's successes is a result of its alliance with the Toledo Warehouse District Association. The Association developed a mixed-use property with 11 lofts and 10 commercial spaces within walking distance of a variety of entertainment venues. This project cost $2.9 million and included Historic Tax Credits, Lucas County Linked Deposit, a city of Toledo Economic Development Loan, a Congressional special purposes grant, and financing through Fifth Third and Sky Bank. Again, the project was possible because of start-up funds from LISC.  Since welcoming LISC into my neighborhood in 1989, it has been my honor to be associated with an organization so important to both our communities and the nation at large. I congratulate LISC on its past successes and encourage corporations, foundations, and individuals alike to continue to support LISC and its worthy mission of converting blighted neighborhoods into vibrant communities.                          ____________________
