 President, on July 12, the Committee on Foreign Relations reported S. 494, the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001. At the time the bill was reported, the cost estimate from the Congressional budget Office was not available.  I ask unanimous consent that the CBO estimate be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:        CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE, JULY 16, 2001      S. 494: Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001 [As ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on                              July 12, 2001]                                summary       S. 494 would support a transition to democracy and promote      economic recovery in Zimbabwe through a set of incentives and      sanctions. The bill would require the United States to oppose      lending by international financial institution to or debt      relief for Zimbabwe until the President certifies to the      Congress that certain conditions are satisfied. It would,      however, authorize additional funds for programs to reform      landholding and to promote democracy and good governance in      Zimbabwe. Assuming the appropriation of the authorized      amounts, CBO estimates that implementing the bill would cost      $23 million over the 2002-2006 period. Because S. 494 would      not affect direct spending or receipts, pay-as-you-go      procedures would not apply.       S. 494 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector      mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act      (UMRA) and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or      tribal governments.                estimated cost to the federal government       The estimated budgetary impact of S. 494 is shown in the      following table. The costs of this legislation fall within      budget function 150 (international affairs).                           basis of estimate       S. 494 would earmark $20 million for land reform and $6      million for programs to promote democracy and good governance      in Zimbabwe from funds otherwise authorized to be      appropriated in 2002 for development assistance and economic      support fund. No funds are currently authorized for 2002. CBO      assumes that the specified amounts would be appropriated by      October 1, 2001, and that outlays would follow historical      spending patterns.------------------------------------------------------------------------                                By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--                               -----------------------------------------                                 2001   2002   2003   2004   2005   2006------------------------------------------------------------------------Spending Under Current Law for Zimbabwe:    Budget Authority \1\......     16      0      0      0      0      0    Estimated Outlays.........     22     19     10      5      3      2Proposed Changes:    Authorization Level.......      0     26      0      0      0      0    Estimated Outlays.........      0      2      8      7      4      2Spending Under S. 494 for Zimbabwe:    Authorization Level \1\...     16     26      0      0      0      0    Estimated Outlays.........     22     21     18     12      7      4------------------------------------------------------------------------\1\ The 2001 level is the amount appropriated for that year.
