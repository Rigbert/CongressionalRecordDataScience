 Obviously, that could change as the floor debate unfolds, but I think there is certainly clear potential to finish up this bill either late tonight or tomorrow in accordance with what the Republican leader hopes which, of course, would give us a greater chance of being out of here for a week the week after next.  In 1964, Henry Kissinger commented:       To rely on the efficacy of diplomacy may lead to disaster      but to rely on power with insufficient means is suicide.  Madam President, today we take up consideration of the appropriations bill for foreign operations, export financing, and related programs, a bill that provides the means to maintain our role as the sole remaining superpower. Despite Dr. Kissinger's caution, it is also the bill everyone loves to hate.  Foreign operations, like every other subcommittee, has struggled to apportion the substantial reductions in discretionary spending imposed by the budget resolution process. Obviously, this is not an easy task, and foreign assistance should obviously not be spared the responsibility of making a contribution to balancing the budget.  However, unlike other appropriations bills, foreign assistance has steadily declined over the past decade, at a time when both new threats and opportunities have emerged. To address these needs has been a challenge for, unlike other accounts, the administration of foreign assistance is the exclusive responsibility of the Federal Government. This is not something that can be handed off to the States through a block grant. In fact, I think it could safely be said that this is the diplomacy account, the nonmilitary way to engage with other countries around the world, and that is uniquely a responsibility of the Federal Government.  The bill unanimously reported by the Appropriations Committee reflects a $2 billion reduction and is more than 16 percent below the President's request. The administration asked for $14.7 billion and the bill provides $12.3 billion. That is $2.3 billion out of roughly a $1.5 trillion budget. We have tried to balance the distribution of the reduction as fairly and evenly as we possibly could while protecting and promoting priorities I think most of us share.  It is clear foreign aid must be better connected to American interests or we will lose all public support and risk complete elimination of resources. Accordingly, we have emphasized those programs which directly serve our economic, security, political, and humanitarian interests. These range from continuing to support the peaceful transition to free market democracies in Central Europe and the NIS to expanding our international effort to combat crime and narcotics trafficking.  Madam President, let me briefly summarize each of the titles of the bill to give everyone a sense of how aid can serve our interests.  Title I funds export promotion activities. These programs have a direct--I repeat direct--impact on creating jobs and expanding export opportunities. They enjoy bipartisan support as well as the endorsement of a wide range of commercial and manufacturing interests including labor unions, Fortune 500 companies, and small businesses.  It is no wonder since estimates provided from the private sector as well as the administration suggest that 300,000 jobs and 40 percent of our economic growth are linked to export activities.  The committee has provided $795 million to the Export-Import Bank, slightly over the House and last year's level, but well below the needs as reflected in the request.  We have fully funded the OPIC request. Credit reforms laws require the bill to indicate the amount of basic subsidy which funds OPIC activities. However, it is worth pointing out that while we subsidize OPIC, the corporation is completely self-sufficient. While we provide $79 million in subsidy, OPIC is expected to generate over $200 million this year which is returned to the Treasury.  The third agency involved in export promotion is the Trade Development Agency which is funded at the House level of $40 million, a sizable cut from the request of $67 million. TDA's principal responsibility is conducting feasibility studies and while important, there is not as immediate and direct an impact on jobs and exports as with the sister agencies.  One of the most important initiatives the subcommittee included in the treatment of economic assistance is the construction of title II. We have consolidated a number of development and economic accounts into a $2.1 billion account with very few earmarks. Traditional earmarks for the following programs have been eliminated: the Economic Support Fund, development assistance, the Development Fund for Africa, child survival, basic education, the Africa Development Foundation, the Inter-American Foundation, and the Ireland Fund.  I am not suggesting that these activities will not be funded. All the necessary statutory authorities to conduct these programs are preserved. But, the bill gives the President the flexibility to make the decision on the levels and the administration of programs.  My preference would have been to simply provide a sum for the President to allocate in accordance with emerging priorities. However, the ranking member, along with other members, expressed the concern that one account might bear the entire burden of the overall reduction.  To accommodate this concern, we have included language that requires a proportional distribution of the reduction. This means that accounts such as development assistance and the Development Fund for Africa will be smaller than last year, but they will each have approximately the same share of overall resources available this year as they have in the past.  Since this is not an absolute mathematical formula, some flexibility is maintained. And, so far, we have avoided the detailed micromanagement of specific activities which must be carried out within the broader accounts. We have avoided the inclination of past years to direct funding levels for community colleges, museums and other special interest projects.  Obviously, the Senate can decide to divide up the economic assistance account affording no flexibility at all to the President. I am not opposed to considering earmarks or recommendations on spending priorities, but I would urge each Member to carefully consider the impact of beginning to further carve up this small pie.  In addition to this broad category of economic aid, we have funded programs in the Middle East, Central Europe, and the NIS--regions I think most view as central to our security interests. We have fully funded the Camp David countries and included, once again, an earmark for resettling refugees in Israel.  The bill provides $335 million to support programs in Central Europe and $705 million for the New Independent States. Within the NIS account I have earmarked the following: $17.1 million for the FBI for law enforcement training and investigations. With 5,000 organized criminal enterprises expanding their activities into nuclear smuggling and areas of operations to our shores, our security interests compel an active role for the FBI in the region.  Thirty million dollars is earmarked for Georgia, where democracy is truly under siege.  Eighty-five million dollars is earmarked for Armenia to mitigate the severity of the economic consequences of the war and the blockade. Armenia has carried out important political and economic reforms in the past year but continues to need assistance to complete the transition.  Another country that I have had a longstanding interest in, going back to the dissolution of the Soviet Union: $225 million is earmarked for Ukraine with subearmarks to address the urgent priorities of strengthening the private sector and developing energy self-sufficiency. Although the administration has come around to the view that Ukraine has a uniquely important role to play in regional stability, levels of aid and the kinds of activities AID have been willing to undertake lag far behind requirements.  The sum of $15 million is set aside for a Trans-caucasus Enterprise Fund, which will complete congressional plans to have each region benefit from this innovative aid approach.  The NIS section also preserves the option of transferring resources to the Peace Corps to sustain their very successful efforts. Overall, the Peace Corps is spared the 16 percent reduction imposed on other programs and is cut roughly 8.5 percent to $200 million.  I might say that the occupant of the chair is, of course, a former director of the Peace Corps and has been an aggressive advocate for the Peace Corps and its programs. He has certainly made his views known to me as I worked to put together the chairman's mark.  Although this is a popular program I cannot understand why we need 149 volunteers in the Dominican Republic. In Africa, we saw an 18 percent increase from 1994 to 1995, bringing the number of volunteers up to 2,442. Unfortunately, the days of expanding programs are over.  Title II also funds our international efforts to combat crime, terrorism and narcotics trafficking. As I mentioned earlier, I think these are issues which every American understands has a direct impact on our Nation's interests. In restoring public confidence that our aid serves our interests, the committee has increased support for these activities.  Finally title II provides $490 million in operating expenses for AID. Each committee which has reported legislation on AID has recommended different levels of support. My recommendation is based on a recent GAO study which indicated the House authorization and appropriations levels would not be adequate to cover the cost associated with RIF's, closing missions and other measures to streamline AID's programs.  According to the GAO, $490 million will require significant actions on AID's part to eliminate program duplication, close overseas missions, cut personnel and otherwise accelerate streamlining and consolidation. But, let me be clear. This level will not compel consolidation.  Although I have supported the two attempts to pass legislation to carry out consolidation of AID and the State Department, the Administration has indicated it will veto any legislation which forces the reorganization of the executive branch without its consent. Given this unresolved situation, it did not seem appropriate for the Foreign Operations Subcommittee to move ahead of the authorization committee and include in a spending bill reorganization or activities not directed by law in legislation.  The rest of the news about the bill is bleak. Title III, security assistance is below the House level and the request. I think this is unfortunate, but a direct function of the budget reality.  Title III does provide authority to transfer funds from the European and NIS accounts to support the Warsaw Initiative. I think there is strong bipartisan support for accelerating the integration of former Warsaw Pact members into NATO through joint exercises and training and improving military interoperability. The transfer authority provided should relieve some of the pressure on the security assistance account.  Finally, title IV, the multilateral programs, are the hardest hit of all accounts. With three exceptions, the World Bank, International Finance Corporation, and the Inter-American Development Bank, we have not been able to fund existing commitments. Just one example tells the story. The request for IDA is $1.3 billion of which we only funded $775 million.  International organizations and programs were also drastically reduced from the request of $425 million to $260 million. Frankly, this is an account which has as many strong supporters as it does vocal detractors. There are some clear examples of international agencies which have effectively served international interests, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency. But, there are just as many with sloppy management, guilty of waste, fraud, and abuses. The committee has not earmarked levels of support for programs within IO and P with the view that contributions will offer the administration the opportunity to leverage management reforms. No agency is exempt from the urgency of reform and I include one of our collective favorites, UNICEF, in that category.  Let me now turn to Senator Leahy for his comments. I would like to point out that the report takes note of the ranking member's dedicated service to victims of landmines by establishing the Patrick J. Leahy War Victims Fund. This was a program established several years ago to aid the recovery and rehabilitation of the thousands of people injured by antipersonnel mines. Senator Leahy deserves special recognition for his effort in this area which the committee acknowledged by renaming the program in his honor.  Let me also say it has been a pleasure to work with my colleague from Vermont. Before I turn to him, let me mention one other item.  I think, Mr. President, Members of the Senate would be interested that earlier today the Central and East European Coalition held a press conference urging quick passage of this legislation. This coalition, comprising 18 grassroots organizations representing 22 million Americans, strongly support this legislation.  I want to emphasize that because I think it is frequently thought by many that nobody in America gives a hoot about foreign assistance. In fact, there are many Americans who came from somewhere else, or their ancestors did, who care deeply about this part of the Federal budget.  The Central and Eastern European Coalition represents 18 of those groups. They are very active in promoting better relations, strengthened relations between the United States and the various countries from which they come.  Mr. President, before turning the floor over to Senator Leahy for his opening comments, I ask unanimous consent that the statements of the coalition be printed in the Record at this point and I yield the floor.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:     Coalition Urges Greater U.S. Focus on Central and East Europe  (Statement by Eugene Iwanciw, Washington Office Director; Ukrainian                            Association, Inc.)       The Central and East European Coalition (CEEC), comprising      18 national grassroots organizations representing 22 million      Americans who trace their heritage to that part of the world,      applauds Chairman Mitch McConnell (R-KY) for his leadership      in drafting a foreign assistance bill which provides much      needed support for the countries of Central and East Europe.      We are particularly pleased that the Senator and the      Committee have focused additional attention on the non-     Russian nations of the former Soviet Union, particularly      Ukraine and Armenia.       The Coalition strongly believes that the long-term national      security and budget interests of the United States require a      strong commitment to the transition of Central and East      European countries to fully democratic and free market      nations. That commitment requires an active U.S. engagement      in that part of the world.       The Central and East European Coalition believes that      peace, stability, and democracy throughout Europe serve the      national security interests of the United States. In this      century, the United States was called upon to fight two world      wars and a 45-year cold war--conflicts which emanated from      the heart of Europe--in the furtherance of those vital      geopolitical interests. The institutionalization of democracy      and market      economies in Central and East Europe is the best means of guaranteeing      that there will be no further European conflicts which will      entangle the United States. We believe that with the collapse      of communism and the Soviet Union, the objectives of peace,      stability, and democracy in Europe are achievable. For those      objectives to be achieved, however, requires the continued      engagement, support, and assistance of the United States and      the West.       Since the signing of the Camp David Accords, the United      States has wisely supported the peace process in the Middle      East. That long-term commitment is now paying dividends with      increased stability throughout that region of the world.      Similarly, the strengthening of democracy and market      economies in the countries of Central and East Europe will      require a long-term commitment by the United States. Forty-     five to seventy-five years of communist oppression and      tyranny cannot be eradicated overnight.       Continued United States engagement in Central and East      Europe must take various forms. The most visible is our      foreign assistance. While we had hoped that the      Administration's overall funding levels would be accepted by      the Congress, we were particularly distressed by the severe      cuts that      House of Representatives made in the programs for Central      and East Europe, particularly in the Freedom Support Act      (FSA). We commend the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign      Operations, under Chairman McConnell's leadership, for      restoring many of those cuts and we urge the Senate to      adopt the levels of funding for FSA and SEED contained in      the bill as reported from the Appropriations Committee. We      especially applaud the attention which Senator McConnell      and the Committee have given to the non-Russian nations      considered part of the New Independent States (NIS). For      the past three years, the bulk of assistance to the NIS      went to Russia. This bill provides U.S. policy with the      balance it should have in our dealings with the nations of      Central and East Europe.       Secondly, our engagement demands involvement in the      security issues of the region. We believe that the general      stability and security of the region can best be accomplished      through the expansion of NATO to include all the nations of      the region who desire to join the alliance and meet the      criteria for membership. For that reason, we strongly support      the funding for the Warsaw Initiative and the NATO      Participation amendment which Senator Hank Brown (R-CO) will      offer during floor consideration of the Foreign Assistance      Appropriations Act.       Thirdly, we believe that the U.S. assistance should focus      on those countries which have demonstrated progress in the      establishment of democratic institutions and market reforms      as well as respect for basic human rights. That criteria must      also include a commitment not to hinder international      humanitarian relief efforts. For that reason, we endorse the      Humanitarian Corridor Act which Senate Majority Leader Robert      Dole (R-KS) will offer as an amendment to the Appropriations      Act during Senate floor consideration. This amendment would      suspend assistance to any country which hinders U.S.      humanitarian relief efforts to a third country.       Fourthly, as U.S. assistance to this important part of the      world is unfortunately reduced, it is vital that the U.S.      Agency for International Development (USAID) maximize the      impact of every dollar of assistance. For far too long we      have heard about waste, inefficiencies, and fraud in these      programs. It is time to take the Beltway Bandits off the      public dole and to work through organizations with both an      understanding of the region and a demonstrated, long-term      commitment to the establishment of democratic and free market      institutions in the countries of Central and East Europe. In      the six years since the Berlin Wall came down, USAID has been      unable to institute these reforms so we call upon the      Congress to take the initiative in reforming the delivery of      U.S. foreign assistance.       Finally, an aspect of our engagement in Central and East      Europe involves the flow of information and ideas to the      peoples of Central and East Europe. For five decades, the      United States has provided the peoples of this region with      timely and accurate information through the Voice of America      (VOA) and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). These      programs are as vital today as they were during the communist      period. Democracy is still in its infancy in most, if not      all, of the nations of Central and East Europe. Few, if any,      of these countries have a firmly-established independent      media, particularly electronic media. Today, VOA and RFE/RL      are playing critical roles in the establishment of democracy      throughout the region. Last year the Congress enacted      legislation which brings better coordination to the work of      the two broadcasting services. This has resulted in      substantial savings in the FY 1996 budget. It would, however,      be a major mistake to reduce the budget of the broadcasting      services below the levels currently in the Commerce, Justice,      State, and Judiciary Appropriations Act and the Coalition      strongly opposes any such effort.       The United States spent hundreds of billions of dollars to      win the Cold War. It would be tragic were the United States      to lose the peace through short-sighted policies and      illusionary budgetary savings. An investment in democracy      building today will pay dividends through long-term security      and reduced military expenditures for the United States.       In conclusion, the Central and East European Coalition      urges the Senate to approve the Foreign Assistance      Appropriations Act with the Committee approved spending      levels for FSA and SEED, to adopt the NATO Participation and      Humanitarian Corridors amendments, to oppose any efforts to      reduce funding for VOA and RFE/RL in the Commerce-Justice      Appropriations Act, and to begin reforming USAID to insure      that our foreign assistance is used effectively and      efficiently. We especially urge the House conferees to accept      these provisions during the House-Senate conference on the      bills.                                                                    ____                Coalition Urges Rapid Expansion of NATO (Statement by Frank Koszorus, Jr., Member of the Executive Committee;                      Hungarian American Coalition)       The Central and East European Coalition applauds the      leadership of Senator Hank Brown (R-Col.) who, along with      strong bipartisan support, will offer the NATO Participation      amendment to the Foreign Assistance Appropriations Act.      Senator Brown's Amendment will establish a process to      facilitate the expansion of NATO in a manner that will      advance vital U.S. geopolitical interests in Europe and      preserve its leadership role in the world.       The Coalition is concerned with the glacial pace of NATO's      expansion. The collapse of the Soviet Union has left a      dangerous security vacuum in Central and Eastern Europe. That      region must be rapidly reintegrated with the West to provide      it with a sense of security and to shore up the new      democracies. Rapid expansion of NATO to include countries      which are committed to the concepts of democracy, market      economies, civilian control of the military and human and      minority rights would serve this objective as well as the      foreign policy interests of the United States by ensuring      Europe's overall stability.       The United States cannot afford to turn its attention away      from the Central and Eastern European countries. Success in      their transition to pluralism and democracy will validate the      many sacrifices we made to win the Cold War. Failure will      ensure a new world order far less congenial to our interests.       The adverse consequences of our withdrawal from Europe at      critical times in the past fill history books. Had we reacted      firmly to the turmoil threatening peace in Europe prior to      the First and Second World Wars, many American lives and      resources would have been spared. Similarly, the Cold War      would have been far less expensive and dangerous had we not      pulled back from the heart of Europe and had we resisted      domestic pressure to ``bring the boys home'' before the      European political order had been settled. As George F.      Kennan wrote in 1950, ``history does not forgive us our      national mistakes because they are explicable in terms of      domestic policies.''       Today, we must not permit Central and East Europe to      languish in a security vacuum. Russian interests are not      threatened by the expansion of a defensive alliance.      Moreover, stability and economic growth on the Western      borders of Russia can only benefit Moscow.       Russia should not be isolated and mechanisms, such as a      treaty between NATO and Russia, would dispel any lingering      concerns Moscow may entertain about an enlarged NATO. Russia,      however, should under no circumstances be permitted to veto      NATO's enlargement. Western appeasement and indecisiveness      will encourage Russian nationalists to assert expansionist      tendencies and cause the U.S. and the West to lose      credibility. Russia itself is in a fluid state with voices of      nascent imperialism being heard with greater frequency.      Yeltsin's harsh outburst in Budapest last year and his even      more disquieting threats following NATO's bombing missions in      Bosnia, vividly demonstrate the perils of procrastination.       Continued Western hesitation in expanding NATO would redraw      the lines imposed by Stalin and signal Russian imperialists      that they, in fact, enjoy a ``sphere of influence'' in      Central and Eastern Europe. This ill-advised policy would be      contrary to U.S. geopolitical interests in a stable, secure,      unified, and democratic Europe.       Having won the Cold War, the United States should not      prematurely retreat from the challenges posed by Central and      Eastern Europe, if only to avoid being drawn back into      exacerbated controversies. Expansion of NATO to include      countries which desire to join the alliance and meet the      criteria of NATO membership is an inexpensive yet vital      insurance policy for the United States.       Senator Brown's amendment is a welcome first step in this      direction. It must be followed by concrete steps, eligibility      lists, criteria, and unambiguous timetables in 1996. As we      approach the 21st Century, we simply cannot afford to      squander a historic opportunity to safeguard peace and      democracy.                                                                    ____  Coalition Urges Senate Passage of the Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act   (Statement by Timothy Jemal, Director of Congressional Relations,                      Armenian Assembly of America)       First, we want to compliment Chairman McConnell for his      leadership in drafting a bill that gives prominent support to      the states of Central and Eastern Europe. We are particularly      pleased that Senator McConnell and the committee are      strengthening U.S. support for the non-Russian New      Independent States (NIS), in spite of an overall reduction in      funding. This redirection in resources      will make a tangible and permanent contribution to the bold reforms      taking place in such countries as Armenia and Ukraine. In      spite of this overall shift, U.S. aid to the states of      Central and Eastern Europe continues to be reduced, requiring      maximum efficiency in the use of U.S. foreign assistance. It      is this objective that is embraced in legislation supported      by our Coalition and rapidly moving towards enactment.       Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-KS), Senator Paul Simon      (D-IL), along with a bipartisan group of Senators including      Chairman McConnell, will offer the humanitarian Aid Corridor      Act (S. 230) on the Senate floor as a amendment to the      Foreign Operations Appropriations bill (H.R. 1868). The 18      member organizations of the Central and East European      Coalition strongly urge the Senate to take quick, decisive      action--in support of the Dole/Simon amendment. This      legislation espouses the fundamental principle that the      United States should not provide assistance to any country      which deliberately prevents the transport of American      humanitarian assistance through its borders. The U.S. cannot      expect to meet the need for budget austerity and achieve      important foreign policy goals without the cooperation of our      allies.       The relevant committees in the Senate and the House have      fully debated the bill and expressed clear, bipartisan      support. On May 12, the House International Relations      Committee approved the Corridor Act by a 27-7 vote. On June      7, the same bill was again approved by the Senate Foreign      Relations Committee in a convincing 14-4 vote. To illustrate      the genuine bipartisan nature of the bill, it was California      Senator Dianne Feinstein who successfully offered Senator      Dole's bill as an amendment before the Foreign Relations      Committee. In addition, the Democrats on the Foreign      Relations Committee voted unanimously for the Corridor Act.      For the third time, the provision was approved by the House      Foreign Operations Subcommittee on June 8, and retained in      H.R. 1868 when it passed the House by a 333-89 vote.       Currently, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe are      undergoing radical political and economic reforms to      institutionalize democracy and free markets. The success of      these reform programs will bring peace, security and      stability to the region. The Coalition will continue to work      toward securing the integration of our ancestral homelands      into the western political, economic and defense structures.      We oppose any obstacle or impediment to furthering this      integration process and especially deplore the use of      inhumane methods to prevent any nation of Central and Eastern      Europe from having access to U.S. humanitarian aid. It simply      does not make sense that the United States should provide aid      to one nation which in turn denies U.S. humanitarian      assistance to another state. We are firmly united in our view      that U.S. assistance should be delivered in the most humane,      cost-effective, fiscally responsible manner. This cannot be      achieved when borders are closed to thwart U.S. assistance to      people in need.       Senator Dole's amendment does not single out or exempt any      country. All recipients of U.S. assistance will be held to      the same standard, including such countries as Turkey, which      has imposed an illegal and immoral blockade on Armenia since      April of 1993. This blockade has resulted in slowing delivery      of U.S. aid shipments while skyrocketing the transportation      costs. Most importantly, the blockade has often precluded the      safe delivery of vitally needed U.S. humanitarian assistance.       The Coalition believes that it is unconscionable for any      recipient of U.S. aid to use the denial of food, medicines      and other essential humanitarian needs as a political weapon.      The United States should demand that its allies maintain a      simple, humane policy that allows U.S. assistance to flow      through open corridors. As taxpayers, we are rightfully      indignant that the U.S. government would provide hundreds of      millions of dollars to a country denying aid to suffering      people. There is no more cruel and cynical policy than a      government directive to block humanitarian assistance to the      most vulnerable people for political or strategic ends. That      any recipient of U.S. aid would do so is unacceptable to this      Coalition.       We applaud Senators Dole and Simon for their leadership on      this issue. The amendment is truly bipartisan, and a      necessary element in strengthening American credibility      abroad.                                                                    ____                  Coalition Urges Reform of U.S.A.I.D. (Statement by Avo E. Ora, Director of Public Relations, Joint Baltic                       American National Committee)       Today, the Central and East European Coalition is united      not only in our support for increasing foreign aid funding,      we are also united in our demands for the effective use of      these resources. Increased funding will not advance our      national security interests nor Central and East European      development if the funds continue to be wasted on short-term,      less-than-efficient programs.       The end of the Cold War provided the US with the      opportunity to reshape Europe as the Marshall plan reshaped      war-ravaged Europe in 1947. America's present policy goals      are similar to the goals outlined under the plan--we seek to      facilitate and secure democratic and economic gains in post-     Soviet nations, resulting in a stable and secure Europe.       Unfortunately, the US Agency for International Development      did not seize this opportunity and conducted business as      usual. Grants have generally shifted from Central America to      Central Europe but continued to be implemented by generic      developmental, fee-for-service contractors who generally lack      interest, knowledge and long-term commitment to the region.      Although some long-term, goal-specific USAID programs were      successfully implemented, they were more an exception than      the norm. The result is a characterization of US assistance      as wasteful by Congress, the targeted states, and most      damaging of all, by the American people.       How can we increase the sustainable development and      effectiveness of foreign aid? The answer lies in our      recommendations for the use of Region Specific Organizations      in aid implementation and a more open and accountable grant      procedure. These suggestions evolved from our efforts to      guarantee the efficient and wise use of US taxypayer dollars.       Our first recommendation is the use of organizations that      have historic ties and long-term commitments to the countries      of Central Europe and the New Independent States. These      Region Specific Organizations, including many in our ethnic      communities, have high standards of professionalism, an      intimate knowledge of the political, economic and social      conditions in a given country, and language capabilities      which others lack.       Our second recommendation calls for the public disclosure      of specific tasks, goals, and funding levels of USAID      contracts, insuring an open and fair process for awarding      contracts and grants, and simplifying the contracting process      to facilitate smaller Region Specific organizations.      Recently, USAID's lack of planning and commitment became      apparent when USAID attempted to unilaterally reduce funding      for Armenia in fiscal year 1996. In addition, USAID failed to      submit a strategy paper for public comment. We strongly      recommend that USAID country strategy papers be subject to      comment by the NGO and PVO community.       The Coalition contrasts the wasteful, region-wide spending      practices of USAID, with the country specific contracting      processes of the National Endowment for Democracy and the US      Information Agency which result in much greater, quicker and      more effective assistance to these countries. Moreover, these      smaller agencies which have had and will continue to have a      long-term commitment to democracy and free market reform in      the region, have contracting processes which are ``user      friendly'' to RSO's, such as those represented by the      coalition.       Aid for Central Europe and the New Independent States were      designed to be temporary. This finite time frame for      assistance only increases our desire for effective programs.      Estonia is already slated for USAID ``graduation'' in 1996--     other nations are on the chopping bloc for 1997. While we      agree that US assistance should promote self-sufficiency and      not dependency, this goal is not being pursued by government      programs before or after ``graduation''. Estonia, for      example, called for ``trade, not aid'' but now finds itself      locked out of scientific and technical exchanges that would      facilitate economic development.       The United States has long-term strategic interests and      needs in the region of Central and East Europe. Thus, it is      vitally important that all US assistance programs be designed      and implemented in such a fashion as to further those      strategic interests and needs. We echo the calls to reform      foreign aid made by Chairman McConnell and his Committee.      After three years of the Administration's failure to address      these problems, the Coalition calls on Congress to take the      lead in a top-to-bottom reform of USAID.
