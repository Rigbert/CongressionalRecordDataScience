 President, I rise to introduce a resolution to honor the memory of Lawrence ``Larry'' King, a 15-year-old boy who was shot and killed at a California junior high school on this day last year.  Larry's story is a tragic and is a poignant reminder of why it is so important to stop bullying and violence in our schools.  Larry King was a spirited boy who grew up in Oxnard, California.  At the age of 10, he told the other kids at school that he was gay, and many of them teased and taunted him as a result. At his first school, the bullying became so harsh that his parents had to transfer him to a different school. But the transfer seemed like a good one, and although Larry still endured teasing, he made some very close friends.  Near the beginning of last year, Larry decided to change the way he dressed. He started wearing girls' accessories, makeup, and a pair of high heels that he bought for himself at Target.  In February, he asked one of his male classmates to be his Valentine. The boys exchanged heated words, and the next morning Larry came to school dressed plainly and looking nervous and out of sorts.  He had English as his first class and he sat with the other students, including the boy he had asked to be his Valentine. The class was in the school's computer lab and the students sat typing up their papers.  At 8:30 a.m., the other boy stood up and fatally shot Larry. He had hidden a handgun in his bag, which he took out, and simply stood up silently and shot Larry twice in the back of the head. Larry died in the hospital two days later.  This act of violence is shocking and devastated his parents, and the Oxnard community.  I strongly oppose hate crimes of all kinds. When victims are targeted because of who they are--because of their race, their religion, their sexual orientation, or national origin--the harm runs very deep.  Hate crimes can cause lengthy emotional trauma; they can make people afraid to express their identities; and they are deeply divisive and can tear our communities apart.  Hate crimes and bullying in schools can cause even deeper harm.  According to a School Climate Survey in 2007, over 85 percent of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender students were verbally harassed at school. And more than 20 percent of these students had been physically assaulted.  The survey also found that when children were bullied or harassed, they attended school less and their grades began to drop.  This bullying and violence has to stop. I am introducing this resolution today to commemorate the life of this young boy and to draw attention to the need for increased efforts to end bullying and violence in our schools. Schools should be safe places where children can learn and grow, free from harassment or any threat of physical attack.  I also want to take this opportunity to urge my colleagues to pass hate crimes legislation this year so that our federal law will be clear that crimes based on a person's sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability are crimes of hate and must be vigorously prosecuted because of the great harm that they cause to our communities.  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.                          ____________________
