President.  Before the Senator from West Virginia leaves the floor, let me say I thought he was extraordinarily eloquent. I got a chance to know Senator Randolph a bit as a Member of the House. And the Senator's statement here today really sums up the extraordinary qualities of this great man. I am very pleased to have been able to be here for a few minutes to hear the Senator's very fine speech.  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
