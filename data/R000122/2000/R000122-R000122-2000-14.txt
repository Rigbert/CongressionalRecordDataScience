President, I rise today to join my colleague, the junior Senator from Vermont, in introducing legislation that I hope will resolve an issue that has needlessly confined Medicare beneficiaries receiving home health benefits to their residences. Today, my colleague and I are introducing a revised version of a bill we introduced earlier this year. I am pleased that this new legislation, the Home Health Care Protection Act, has the support of several national aging organizations, including the Alzheimer's Association, the National Council on Aging and the National Association for Home Care.  The Home Health Care Protection Act seeks to clarify the conditions under which a beneficiary may leave his or her home while maintaining eligibility for Medicare home health services. The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) requires that a beneficiary be ``confined to the home'' in order to be eligible for services. The current homebound requirement is supposed to allow beneficiaries to leave the home to attend adult day care services, receive medical treatment, or make occasional trips for non-medical purposes, such as going to the barber. However, the definition has been inconsistently applied, resulting in great distress for beneficiaries who are fearful that they will lose their benefit if they leave their home to attend events such as church services. Clearly, the intent of the rule is not to make our frail elderly prisoners in their own homes. The legislation we are introducing today seeks to bring greater clarity to the homebound definition so that they no longer are.  I am proud to have worked with my colleague, Senator Jeffords, on this issue and hope that we can get this legislation passed before the end of the session. Mr. President, the Home Health Care Protection Act seeks to provide some reasonable parameters that will enable beneficiaries suffering from Alzheimer's, among other chronic and debilitating diseases, to leave their home without worry. This modest legislation would make a real difference to home health beneficiaries in my state of Rhode Island as well as Medicare beneficiaries across the country and I would urge my colleagues to support it.                          ____________________
