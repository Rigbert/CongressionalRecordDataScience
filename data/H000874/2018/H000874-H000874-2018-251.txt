Speaker, I rise today to honor the 155 inventors who will soon be inducted as the 2017 Fellows of the National Academy of Inventors (NAI). To be named as Fellows, these men and women were nominated by their peers and underwent the scrutiny of the NAI Selection Committee, having had their innovations deemed as making a significant impact on quality of life, economic development, and welfare of society. Their induction ceremony here in the nation's capital will feature a keynote address by U.S. Commissioner for Patents, Andrew Hirshfeld.  Collectively, this elite group holds nearly 6,000 patents. The individuals making up this year's class of Fellows include individuals from 124 research universities and non-prof it research institutes spanning the United States and the world. The group of Fellows, now 912 in total, is composed of more than 100 presidents and senior leaders of research universities and non-prof it research institutes, 439 members of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine; twenty-eight inductees of the National Inventors Hall of Fame, fifty-two recipients of the U.S. National Medal of Technology and Innovation and U.S. National Medal of Science; twenty-nine Nobel Laureates; 261 AAAS Fellows; 168 IEEE Fellows; and 142 Fellows of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences, among other awards and distinctions. The NAI was founded in 2010 to recognize and encourage inventors with patents issued from the U.S. Patent and Trademark of fice, enhance the visibility of academic technology and innovation, encourage the disclosure of intellectualproperty, educate and mentor innovative students, and translate the inventions of its members to benefit society.  All Americans are greatly indebted to innovators such as these for contributions to our country and the world through their work. I commend these individuals, as well as the organizations and taxpayers that make their work possible, for all they do to revolutionize the world in which we live. I hope attention brought to this round of inductions will encourage future generations to strive to meet this high honor and continue the spirit of discovery and innovation.
