President, I rise today to recognize Dr. Linda Erwin of Portland, Oregon, for her career as both a gifted medical professional and as a tireless and dedicated educator. As one of the first healthcare professionals in the Pacific Northwest to recognize that gun violence is a public health issue, Dr. Erwin has just been awarded the National Crime Prevention Council's Ameritech Award of Excellence in Crime Prevention. She is one of only seven people throughout the Nation to receive this honor.  Dr. Erwin is currently the Assistant Director of Trauma Services at Legacy Emanuel Hospital, and it was through her experiences as a trauma surgeon that she first became aware of the need for increased education about violence--especially gun violence. Dr. Erwin has taken advantage of her position, education, and talents to reach beyond the trauma room to educate young people throughout the Pacific Northwest.  While working in England for two years, Dr. Erwin treated a total of two patients for gunshot wounds. Upon returning to Portland, she was struck by the high numbers of gunshot wound patients being treated each year at Emanuel Hospital. After speaking with victims and their families and friends, she realized that most young people did not recognize or understand the consequences of their risky behavior. Since then, Dr. Erwin has worked as a leading advocate for gun violence prevention, intervention and education.  One of the keys to Dr. Erwin's success has been her ability to create partnerships. Many of the programs that she has initiated bring together and combine the efforts of the medical, legal, law enforcement, and education communities as well as non-profit organizations and committed volunteers.  Dr. Erwin has successfully spread her message throughout the Portland community with such programs as ``Save Our Youth,'' ``Safe Schools Safe Lives,'' ``Firearms as a Public Health Crisis'' and ``American Epidemic Programs.'' She has also lectured throughout the Pacific Northwest, taking her educational presentations to peer and youth groups throughout the states of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho.  Dr. Linda Erwin is an outstanding example of a professional who has given her time, resources, and knowledge to the community for the betterment of all. For these reasons, Dr. Erwin has received Ameritech's Award of Excellence in Crime Prevention. I would like to thank her on behalf of all those whose lives she lives she has touched.                          ____________________
