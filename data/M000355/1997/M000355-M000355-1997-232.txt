 President, let me say in response to the amendment of my colleague from Arkansas, I and a number of other Members of the Senate were in Hong Kong a couple of weeks ago. I raise Hong Kong--even though I know the sense-of-the-Senate amendment deals with China--I raise Hong Kong because I think Hong Kong is the best hope for China. Hong Kong is going to lead the way to a new China, and a new China is already developing, which is not to say that any of us are entirely happy about everything going on in the People's Republic of China, but a lot of good things are happening, particularly on the economic side. No one in Hong Kong, not even Martin Lee and all of the democratic reformers that many of us know, is in favor of terminating MFN for China. You cannot find anybody in Hong Kong who thinks terminating MFN for China is a way to promote a better, more democratic, more open China.  So with all due respect to my friend and colleague from Arkansas, I think we have worked our way through this MFN debate. The President of the United States, as we all know, in 1992, when he ran, thought that MFN for China ought to be linked to human rights and democracy evolving in China, and as soon as the election was over, he took a closer look at it and he changed his mind. I must say I give him credit for changing his mind because I don't think this will bring about the kind of positive reform in terms of human rights and democracy in China that we would all hope.  What is changing China--unquestionably what is changing China--is economic reform. So I hope we will not support the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas. I think it would be a step in the wrong direction. I know there are other colleagues who share my view.  I see Senator Feinstein on her feet now. I yield the floor.
