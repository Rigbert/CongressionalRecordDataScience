Speaker, It gives me great pleasure to rise today and pay tribute to an outstanding citizen of Indiana's First Congressional District, Mr. Ambrose Joseph (Joe) Manley. On Friday, June 2, 1995, Joe, along with his friends and family, will celebrate his retirement from the Northwest Indiana District Council of Carpenters, Merrillville Union Local No. 1005. This testimonial dinner will take place at the Radisson Hotel celebrity ballroom in Merrillvile, IN.  Joe has dedicated a substantial portion of his life to the betterment of union members and the community of northwest Indiana, as well as the entire State.  Joe's distinguished career in the labor movement has made his community and Nation a better place in which to live. For the past 20 years, Joe has aspired as an important figure in Local No. 1005. Joe has held several position throughout his tenure, but none as important as business manager, a position from which he retired on Dec. 31, 1994.  Moreover, Joe fought for union rights in several other capacities. Joe has been active as past president of the Indiana State Council of Carpenters and past vice-president of the State of Indiana AFL-CIO. These positions have allowed him to fully exercise his fight for labor rights.  As a result of Joe's caring and nurturing nature, he has been spreading his goodwill throughout northwest Indiana by serving on several boards over the past years. Joe is well known in the Indiana State Democratic Party where he was once the vice chairman. During his reign as vice chairman, he was chosen to be a delegate for the State of Indiana to the 1992 National Democratic Convention. Furthermore, Joe served as a past Admiral of the Pirates for Tradewinds Rehabilitation Center. Currently, Joe is a board member for the Arthritis Foundation, Hoosier Boys Town, and the Northwest Indiana Forum, Inc. Joe also is a member of the Hammond Times editorial board.  On this special day, I offer my heartfelt congratulations. Joe's large circle of family and friends can be proud of the contributions this prominent individual has made. His work in the labor movement has made America Work. Those in the movement will miss Joe's dedication and sincerity. Fortunately, the community as a whole will continue to profit from his unselfish involvement to make northwest Indiana a better place in which to live and work. I sincerely wish Joe a long, happy, and productive retirement.                          ____________________
