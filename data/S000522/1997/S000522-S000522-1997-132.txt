Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, let me just say that I rise in very strong support of the amendment of the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Scarborough]. I think my colleague does a really good and worthwhile service for the suffering Christians and the suffering people of faith in the Sudan.  My Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights last year held two hearings. One was on the use of chattel slavery in the Sudan and the terrible policy of forced Islamization, where young boys and girls, mostly boys, are kidnapped and then during the course of 6 months to 2 years, or whatever time period it seems to take, they are brainwashed, Sun Myung Moon-like, with sleep deprivation and other things, to separate themselves from their families, which they are already physically separated from, but also from their faith and all past cultural ties; and then they have this radical Islamic perspective forced upon them.  As we all know, in southern Sudan there has been horrific policy of what many of us consider to be genocide. Khartoum countenances this as part and parcel of it. So I think the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Scarborough] does a very worthwhile thing by raising this issue on the House floor.  We also had a hearing on the persecution of Christians worldwide, and it was the first hearing of its kind ever in the House, and heard from a large variety of panels and people and experts from Amnesty International to across the board. Nina Shay from Freedom House testified, and they bemoan the fact that there is a frightening rising tide of anti-Christianity and that this is a persecution that has to be addressed by anyone who believes in religious freedom and religious tolerance.  So I think the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Scarborough] does a great service with his amendment, and I fully support it.
