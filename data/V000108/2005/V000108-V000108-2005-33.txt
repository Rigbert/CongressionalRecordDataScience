 Mr. Chairman, I do want to thank the gentleman from Michigan for raising the issue. It is an important one. We have had other ratios for determination of Corps funding that had been brought before the subcommittee during the hearing process. They were also questioned.  I understand that the gentleman is concerned about ports of specific size, but I also think one of the things that we have to do a better job of, and the chairman has done his very best here, is to look at entire systems, as well, to make sure there is a fair allocation of these resources for the commerce and, potentially, for the environmental cleanup of these very systems and the individual ports; and I certainly want to join with the chairman and the rest of the subcommittee to do the best job possible looking forward to address this issue. It is an important one.  I appreciate its having been raised.
