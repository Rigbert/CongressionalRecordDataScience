 Congressman Stokes passed away on August 18, at the age of 90, with his loving wife of 55 years, Jeanette, by his side.  On behalf of the people of Ohio and the Ohio delegation, I would like to express our deep sadness and enduring gratitude for the life of Louis Stokes.  Growing up in Cleveland in public housing, with his brother, Carl, and their widowed mother, life was hard, but Lou triumphed over hardship to become a passionate voice for the less fortunate. He gave his life to public service, serving 3 years in the Army before using the benefits he earned under the GI Bill to attend college and law school; and, I might say, he served in a segregated Army. He worked closely with the NAACP and argued the landmark stop and frisk case, Terry v. Ohio, before the U.S. Supreme Court.  In his 15 terms in Congress, he served as an ever-present voice for people of color and vulnerable communities across this country, playing a role to help found the Congressional Black Caucus in 1971. He was a foundational figure. His leadership was also historic, as he was the first African American Member of Congress ever elected to represent Ohio. Lou's resume in the House included stints as chairman of the select committee that investigated the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., from 1976 to 1978; as chairman of the House Ethics Committee; as a member of the House select committee that investigated the Iran-Contra affair; and as the first Black person to chair the Intelligence Committee and serve on the influential House Appropriations Committee and chair its Subcommittee on Veterans, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies.  A month before his passing, Lou gave an interview to the Cleveland Plain Dealer. He said: ``I was a very blessed guy . . . I've been blessed with the opportunity to participate in history, to rise to opportunities I never envisioned . . . and to provide for people opportunities that, in many cases, they would have never had.''  We stand here today in the footsteps of this historic champion. It is we who are blessed to have worked alongside Congressman Stokes; and our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Jeanette; his beautiful daughters Angela, Shelley, and Lori; son, Chuck; and seven grandchildren. Our thoughts and prayers are with all of them during this difficult time of loss.  Madam Speaker, on behalf of the Ohio delegation, I ask that the House observe a moment of silence in memory of the legendary, transformative life of former Congressman Louis Stokes, and I thank you all.                          ____________________
