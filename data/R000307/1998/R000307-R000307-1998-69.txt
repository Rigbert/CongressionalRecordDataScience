President.  I am very pleased to join my colleague, Senator Dodd as a coauthor of this legislation, along with Senator Hagel and Senator Biden, and many other Senators. As has been stated, it does provide a broad exclusion for all food and medical products in regard to unilateral sanctions.  Now, I want to emphasize that right away--unilateral sanctions, not multilateral sanctions. You would hope that if you are going to put any sanction on a country that works, that is effective, or the pragmatic result results in some kind of policy change that is in the best interest of our national security, that would have the support of your allies. It is only when you have unilateral sanctions that this bill applies.
