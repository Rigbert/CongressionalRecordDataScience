Speaker, they claim to have fixed it, but the language is still a little bit ambiguous. Many people who have read it--experts say no, actually, it looks like we are preempting State department of agriculture on separation and buffer zones and other things to protect conventional farmers, organic farmers from the GMOs.  I had a very simple amendment that would just say this does not preempt any State department of agriculture which has adopted for the purposes of redacting conventional crops, non-GMO, and organic crops for reasonable buffer zones and other sorts of provisions to prevent that cross-contamination. That is wiped out by this bill, in my opinion and the opinion of many other experts. My amendment was not allowed.  I am thankful that I had one amendment allowed which will say, if you are already labeling it in countries all around the world, you have got to label it here. That is good, but preferably, we would have uniform labeling of everything in the 50 States and internationally by just requiring that you disclose that it contains GMOs.  There is another amendment that will be offered tomorrow which will do away with this new ``natural'' standard, ``natural'' meaning mandatorily under Federal law contains GMOs. ``Natural'' can contain GMOs. I think that is pretty disingenuous, and I am not sure who slipped that little beauty in there.  If you want to talk about confusing consumers, ``organic,'' ``natural.'' Whoa, what is the difference between ``natural'' and ``organic''? Well, I like ``natural.'' ``Organic,'' that sounds kind of complicated; I will go with ``natural.'' Oh, that contains GMOs. Well, it doesn't say that. No, it doesn't. It says ``natural.'' ``Natural'' contains GMOs.  If the gentleman is really concerned about consumer confusion, you should support that amendment tomorrow to do away with this new disingenuous label.
