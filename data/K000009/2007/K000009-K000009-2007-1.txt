 And on behalf of our entire Buckeye delegation, and with poignancy on this occasion, during this season of new light, please let me welcome Congressman Robert Latta of Wood County, Ohio, to the ranks of the 110th Congress of the United States.  I can share with our colleagues that Bob is a man who has lived the commandment, ``Honor thy father and thy mother.'' Delbert and Rosemary must be so elated today.  Bob also has honored his in-laws, Mr. and Mrs. Vern and Carol Sloan of Williams County, such very, very good citizens. Bob's father Delbert, as Ralph has said, served dutifully for three decades in this Chamber until 1989. What a Christmas gift this swearing-in must be for the Latta and Sloan families.  Bob has been a loving husband to his gifted wife, Marcia, and a real father to his daughters, Elizabeth and Maria. I know how proud they all are today.  His public service has been exemplary, with 15 years of service in the Ohio legislature. We welcome him warmly to the ranks of the Ohio delegation. Indeed, we need his help to pull our Buckeye State forward in more than football.  Let me wish you and your family Godspeed on behalf of our entire delegation with healthy and productive years of service to our blessed Nation. Onward, and congratulations.
