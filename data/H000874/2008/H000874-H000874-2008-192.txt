This motion is a little bit like voting ``present.'' On the one hand, you say, Yes, let's be for veterans; yes, let's be for energy independence. On the other hand you say, But let's not pass the bill. The American public must be very confused by that kind of action.  But I am convinced that this night we will stand with our troops, we will stand with our Armed Forces, we will stand with the national security of our country. Reject this motion which sends this bill back to committee; and once having done that, vote overwhelmingly for this bill and honor Mr. Hunter in the process; and honor a great leader of this House, as knowledgeable about national security as any Member of this House, the great Ike Skelton of Missouri.  Ladies and gentlemen of this House, reject this political ``promptly'' motion. Pass this bill and be proud to go home and tell America that you stood up for our national security and our troops.
