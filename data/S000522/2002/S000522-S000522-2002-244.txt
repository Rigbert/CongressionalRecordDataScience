Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Abe Rosenthal, the New York Times journalist who received the Presidential Medal of Freedom earlier this month for his consistently insightful comments on human rights, and his outspoken defense of persecuted Christians and Jews throughout the world.  Many observers of foreign affairs have difficulty believing that Christians in the modern era have been, and continue to be, persecuted on a wide-scale basis throughout the world. Rosenthal's articulate and passionate writings helped bring much-needed awareness to their plight. In 1997 alone, he wrote over 20 stories about persecuted Christians, detailing the plight of Christians in a wide variety of regions, including China, the Sudan, and Pakistan.  The awareness he raised about people of many different faiths who suffer religious persecution helped win passage of the historic ``International Religious Freedom Act of 1998'' which established the United States Commission on International Religious freedom, and laid out a framework for denying foreign assistance to egregious violators of religious freedom.  I was very proud to have had a direct hand in writing portions of that legislation. I personally chaired several hearings on religious persecution around the world, and my committee covered the persecution of every faith. We took testimony from Muslim Uighurs, who are persecuted by Communist China; the world-wide problem of Anti-Semitism; as well as persecution against Christians.  The creation of the Commission and the office of the Special Ambassador, as well as the institution of the annual Religious Freedom Reports, were among a number of measures provided by Congressman Frank Wolf s landmark legislation on international religious freedom, which my committee--the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights--marked up in 1997, and enacted by Congress in 1998. All these measures represented important steps toward helping millions of people around the world who are persecuted simply because they are people of faith. But the Reports themselves clearly demonstrate that we need to do more.  Some find it odd that a man who has become such a great champion for persecuted Christians is himself Jewish. But this is not really so unusual when you look beneath the surface. When Rosenthal learned that Christians suffered for their faith, while most in the world have turned a blind eye, he felt compelled to act. The Jewish community has a special sensitivity to religious persecution, because when it happens, it almost always hits their community first. ``Never again'' has a special meaning to a community that was almost exterminated while the rest of the world looked on and watched.  Rosenthal's passionate and steadfast desire to speak out for basic human dignity was formulated in a profound way because of a brutal murder that occurred in 1964 in Queens early in his career with the New York Times. In that year, a woman named Catherine Genovese was brutally murdered in her own neighborhood. Although approximately 38 of her neighbors heard her cries for help, not one person responded as she was stabbed over 30 times.  The incident caused Rosenthal to question our responsibility to speak out against injustice, not just for a neighbor suffering in our midst, but for all those who suffer injustice and persecution throughout the world. ``I am not going to be one of the 38,'' he said--one of those who failed to speak out or act.  I am proud to say that Mr. Rosenthal has remained true to his promise. He has consistently spoken out on behalf of those suffering for their faith. He has acted boldly not only through moving readers and inspiring persecuted Christians all over the globe, but also by challenging leaders of government who would rather not be bothered by the sufferings of the oppressed, and business leaders bent on a drive for profits above all else. He has moved many to show a concern for basic human rights and re-evaluate their priorities.  Mr. Rosenthal, you have acted, speaking out on behalf of so many, and you have called so many others, including us here in this Congress to do the same. For this, you deserve our thanks and praise.                          ____________________
