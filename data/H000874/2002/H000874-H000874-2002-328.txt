Speaker, today, on behalf of working men and women in the State of Maryland and throughout the entire country, I want to thank a stalwart trade unionist who has dedicated her life to improving the lives of others.  But before I recount the many accomplishments and long service of Margareta A. Crampton, the director of the Committee on Political Education (COPE) for the Maryland State and District of Columbia AFL-CIO for more than 20 years, I want to add a personal note.  Margareta is far more than a political ally. She is a trusted friend and staunch supporter who has been by my side since I first decided to run for Congress in 1981. In fact, when my predecessor in Congress, the late Gladys Noon Spellman, suffered a heart attack that left her unable to complete her term, Margareta was one of the first people to come to my law office to encourage me to run in a special election to fill that seat.  I can only hope that I've served my constituents in the Fifth Congressional District as well as Margareta has tended to the needs of working men and women in Maryland and the American labor movement over the last 40 years.  Margareta began her union career in 1960 with the Bakery, Confectionary and Tobacco International Union, serving as chief steward and shop representative. Recall that what today is rightly natural and commonplace--women working in positions in virtually every sector of our economy--was not the norm 40 years ago. Women faced many barriers in the workplace. Discrimination was often open and too often tolerated.  But Margareta, and the women of her generation, through force of character and the will to succeed, overcame the many hurdles placed in their paths. They proved that women could perform any job well. And it's because of their hard work that women in the labor movement, as well as other types of employment, have made such tremendous strides in our society--and continue the fight for the equality, justice and fairness that they deserve.  After 19 years at the Bakery, Confectionary and Tobacco Workers International Union,Margareta moved in 1979 to the Graphic Arts International Union, serving as the financial recording secretary and membership reviewer.  During the 1960s and 1970s, she was an active member of the Office of Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU), Local 2, and became the first woman to be elected First Vice-President of her local in 1974.  She served as chair or co-chair of numerous committees in her local, including the educational committee, the COPE committee, and the organizing committee. She also served as the chair of the Young Trade Unionists No. 2 from 1969 to 1984, and as the recording secretary of the Young Trade Unionists No. I from 1970 to 1973.  In 1980, Margareta was appointed as the Director of COPE for the Maryland State and District of Columbia AFL-CIO, and earned a well-deserved reputation through the years as a determined advocate for all workers and a gritty political organizer.  She has worked on numerous political campaigns at the local, state and national levels, and it's more than fair to say that her unrelenting work across the state on behalf of working families built enduring relationships between the labor community and elected officials at all levels of government.  Margareta's boundless energy helped her balance her dedication to improving the lives of working men and women, with her love and devotion to her children, Brenda and Philip, and her grandchildren.  And as she enjoys semi-retirement, she should do so with the knowledge that her efforts over the last 40 years have changed and improved people's lives, and that her labor continues the activism, stretching all the way back to notables as Susan B. Anthony, Sojourner Truth and Mary Harris ``Mother'' Jones--who understood that labor fairness was rooted in morality and inspired by the American quest for equality, justice and fairness.  As Mother Jones said many years ago: ``The cause of the worker continues onward. . . . The future is in labor's strong, rough hands.''  That future, today, is much brighter for working men and women, in large part due to the hard work of trade unionists like Margareta Crampton. To her, we owe a deep gratitude and offer our thanks and deep appreciation.                          ____________________
