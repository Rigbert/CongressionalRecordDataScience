Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I support the gentleman's amendment. The gentleman has been working very diligently and hard with me to try to resolve our differences. It was never my intention that the new individual quota system guidelines developed and incorporated in this bill cause a major disruption to already existing ITQ's. I mentioned that to the gentleman from California [Mr. Miller] and the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Studds] a moment ago.  The gentleman is well aware of my general opposition to ITQ's, but I also stated I do not want Congress to overturn any plans implemented already or taken advantage of by those people that follow the present law.  This amendment clarifies the authority of the Secretary of Commerce in regard to amending or limiting fishery management plans. It also clarifies that this legislation will not cause a reallocation of already issued quota shares. It does, however, allow the Councils to make revisions to existing ITQ plans, which is consistent with the Council's current authority.  Mr. Chairman, I urge the adoption of the amendment.
