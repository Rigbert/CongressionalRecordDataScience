. bill, but the supplemental was just reported out, I have not had, nor do I believe the Speaker has had an opportunity to discuss with Mr. Obey his recommendation on a rule, so I unfortunately don't have an answer for you on the supplemental.  On the D.C. bill, they are marking up right now, so I am in the same position, because they haven't finished their markup. They are marking up as we speak on that bill. So I have not had the opportunity to talk to Mr. Waxman about his advice or desire, or Mr. Conyers. It's a joint referral, they are considering it together, the D.C. bill. So I cannot give you an answer. I apologize at this point in time.
