We should listen as well to the rhetoric coming from the Republican candidate for President, George W. Bush, who is suggesting a massive tax cut of over $2 trillion over 9 years. He is also now suggesting a change in Social Security that will cost over $800 billion over 9 years--$2.8 trillion that he has suggested we spend over the next 9 years, when we are told by experts in Washington that the surplus we have to deal with is about $800 billion. What the Presidential candidate on the Republican side is suggesting is that he wants to return to the era of deficit spending, where we will, over 9 years, go $2 trillion more in debt.  We can all recall that when President Reagan was elected in 1980, we started on this course of action which led to increasing our national debt to over $6 trillion. We had more debt accumulated during the Reagan-George Herbert Walker Bush years than we had in the entire previous history of the United States. Now to carry on this fine tradition, Gov. George W. Bush is suggesting we go back to deficit spending, $2 trillion more in debt, to give tax breaks to wealthy people, to change Social Security in a risky way.  I think that is another fundamental issue. If we are going to deal with America's economy to keep it moving forward, if we are going to bring about the changes we need to make America a better place to live, we certainly don't need to return to deficit spending. I think that is a critical issue that affects everything we do on Capitol Hill.
