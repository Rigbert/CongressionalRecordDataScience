Virginia Guffey, who on August 12, 2007, will be honored at the U.S. Steel Yard by the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Old-Timers Club for her 58 years of service at U.S. Steel.  Virginia Guffey was born in the town of Seymour, Indiana. Until 1949, she worked at the National Veneer and Lumber Company in Seymour. At that time, she was told that her services were no longer needed. Not to be discouraged, Virginia traveled north to seek one of the many employment opportunities in Gary, IN. That same year she was hired at U.S. Steel, and as they say, the rest is history. In the beginning she lived with relatives in order to send her earnings back home to Seymour to support her parents and siblings. Virginia eventually settled in Merrillville, IN.  It is important to understand that Virginia was one of only 300 women working in a workplace dominated by males at U.S. Steel. The small group of 300 women is epitomized by Virginia, who demonstrated strength of character and devotion to her career, and over time she persevered to gain acceptance and make great strides to ensure women's equality in the workplace. Fifty-eight years later, her loyalty to U.S. Steel and passion for her job still burns strong. Virginia is now an inventory clerk in the tin division's coating-packaging warehouse. At 82 years old, she does not intend to retire any time soon.  Virginia has overcome a life of hardships and discrimination with courage and determination. She is a dedicated employee who loves her work and who greets each workday with enthusiasm. Her optimism and tenacity are an example to us all. Her strong work ethic and positive attitude have earned her the respect and admiration of not only her co-workers, but of every person who has the pleasure of knowing her.  One such person is Chester Lobodzinski, founder of the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Old-Timers Club, an organization for retired and current employees in the steel industry. Mr. Lobodzinski accurately painted a portrait of Virginia when he stated, ``Virginia's work ethic of pride, dedication, concern, and 150 percent effort takes a back seat to no one. She is not just an employee at U.S. Steel, but is a living legend whose survival in life can be credited to her very positive attitude, combined with her many true class of friendships.''  Madam Speaker, at this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Ms. Virginia Guffey as she is honored for her longevity and unmatched commitment to her job. Her unselfish and lifelong dedication to U.S. Steel is worthy of the highest commendation, and I am proud to represent her in Congress.                          ____________________
