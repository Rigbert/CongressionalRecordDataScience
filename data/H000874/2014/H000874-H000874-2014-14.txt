I know that we have a number of things yet to come, one of which, of course, is the funding of the government.  I know there have been a lot of discussions about what form that bill will take: whether it will be an omnibus; whether it will be a CR, a continuing resolution; whether it will be a combination of those two. There is concern on our side of the aisle.  Mr. Price, who is the ranking member on the Homeland Security Committee, is very concerned that some of the security needs of the country will be put, if not at risk, then in doubt if there is a short-term funding of that part of the one-twelfth of the appropriations bills.  Does the gentleman know whether or not we are going to have an omnibus, which will cover all 12 of the appropriations bills and departments, or whether or not it may be a combination of some shorter-term funding and longer-term funding?  I yield to my friend.                              {time}  1445  Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank my friend for yielding.  As my friend knows, negotiations are ongoing between the Appropriations of the House and the Senate; and as soon as the conclusion of the negotiations is done, we will notify everyone and post what comes out.
