President, I am submitting for the Record a notification of a proposal I intend to offer.  I ask that the proposal be printed in the Record.  The proposal follows:            (Purpose: To eliminate secret Senate ``holds'')       At the appropriate place, insert:     SEC.  . ELIMINATING SECRET SENATE ``HOLDS.''       (a) Standing Order.--It is a standing order of the Senate      that a Senator who provides notice to leadership of his or      her intention to object to proceeding to a motion or matter      shall disclose the objection (hold) in the Congressional      Record not later than 2 session days after the date of said      notice.       (b) Rulemaking.--This section is adopted--       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate      and as such it is deemed a part of the Rules of the Senate      and it supersedes other rules only to the extent that it is      inconsistent with such rules; and       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of      the Senate to change its rules at any time, in the same      manner, and to the same extent as in the case of any other      rule of the Senate.                          ____________________
