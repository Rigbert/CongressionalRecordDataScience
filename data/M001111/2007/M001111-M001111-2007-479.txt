 President, I wish to recognize Todd Beuke, a great contributor to the education community in the State of Washington. Mr. Beuke is an exceptional teacher who has been honored this year as a finalist for the Richard T. Farrell Teacher of Merit Award for his outstanding success in teaching history.  As a teacher at Sequim Middle School, Mr. Beuke has been able to create excitement in the classroom by using creative teaching methods that resonate with his students. Students and teachers alike have praised Mr. Beuke for his supportive teaching style and the comfortable environment he has created in which students can explore history.  Mr. Beuke is an innovator in Washington State education, an inspiration to his students, and a teacher capable of making history lessons relevant and accessible. Mr. Beuke's work extends beyond the classroom as well. He has helped expand the National History Day program throughout Washington State.  The National History Day program is a national education organization that encourages professional development and active student learning. The program provides publications and education programs that help guide teachers in methods to engage students and bring history to life. Washington State teachers and students have benefited from the effort Mr. Beuke has made to share information about the History Day program. The National History Day awards are a valuable way to highlight positive role models in our education system. I am proud Mr. Beuke has been nominated for this award.  I thank Todd Beuke for his work in the classroom and for his commitment to education in my home State. I am sure he will continue to be successful in inspiring students to enjoy the study of history.                          ____________________
