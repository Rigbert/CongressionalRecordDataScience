Speaker, on Wednesday the President's top political adviser stated, and I quote, ``Liberals saw the savagery of the 9/11 attacks and wanted to prepare indictments and offer therapy and understanding for our attackers.''  This statement is offensive, divisive, and patently false.  Three days after those barbaric attacks, this House voted 420 to 1 to use all necessary and appropriate force against those responsible.  The Senate passed the same measure 98 to 0.  I do not know whether Mr. Rove's statement was calculated to exploit collective national pain for partisan political gain, although his slash-and-burn track record speaks for itself.  But Mr. Rove should apologize and retract it. And the President of the United States, who represents not Republicans, not Democrats, but all Americans, should repudiate it today.  The President came to office stating he wanted to change the tone in Washington. Today, today he can demonstrate that he meant it.                          ____________________
