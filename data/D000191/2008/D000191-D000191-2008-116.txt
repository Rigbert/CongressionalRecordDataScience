Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 936) honoring the 200th anniversary of the Gallatin Report on Roads and Canals, celebrating the national unity the Gallatin Report engendered, and recognizing the vast contributions that national planning efforts have provided to the United States, as amended.  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.  The text of the resolution is as follows:                              H. Res. 936       Whereas President Thomas Jefferson commissioned his      Secretary of the Treasury, Albert Gallatin, to provide a new      vision for transportation that would unite the young      Republic;       Whereas 2008 marks the bicentennial of the national plan,      known as the Gallatin Report on Roads and Canals (Gallatin      Report), presented by Secretary Gallatin to President      Jefferson;       Whereas the Gallatin Report proposed transportation      improvements not as ends in themselves but as means to      further national unity;       Whereas transportation improvements were part of the      promise of the American Revolution, as James Madison, writing      in The Federalist No. 14, emphasized, ``Let it be remarked .      . . that the intercourse throughout the Union will be      facilitated by new improvements. Roads will everywhere be      shortened, and kept in better order; accommodations for      travelers will be multiplied and meliorated; an interior      navigation on our eastern side will be opened throughout, or      nearly throughout, the whole extent of the thirteen States'';       Whereas Madison's words have served as a worthy reminder of      the needs for transportation infrastructure since that time;       Whereas the Gallatin Report incorporated the improvements      to the Postal Service that Benjamin Franklin bequeathed to      the Nation, including Franklin's route surveys, his placement      of milestones on principal roads, and his development of      shorter transportation routes;       Whereas the Gallatin Report called for an inland waterway      navigation canal from Massachusetts to North Carolina, which      was the precursor to the modern day Intercostal Waterway      system;       Whereas the United States, as a result of Gallatin's      legacy, has a record of successful infrastructure      developments, including--       (1) the Erie Canal, which vastly reduced transportation      costs to the interior;       (2) the transcontinental railway, which united the Nation;       (3) transit projects across the Nation, which promote      freedom and opportunity;       (4) the National Highway System, including the Dwight D.      Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways, which      fostered interstate commerce, national unity, and broke down      barriers between the States; and       (5) the Tennessee Valley Authority, devised by President      Franklin Delano Roosevelt as a ``corporation clothed with the      power of government but possessed of the flexibility and      initiative of a private enterprise'', which brought      electricity, conservation planning, and opportunity for      thousands in the Tennessee Valley and across the Nation;       Whereas to be regarded as a success, any national planning      endeavor must address and reconcile the needs of different      regions of the Nation;       Whereas the genius of the Gallatin Report was its alignment      of the hopes of the Nation with the opportunities presented      by access to new markets, populations, and territories;       Whereas the United States currently faces new challenges in      financing the transportation infrastructure that is necessary      for the future economic needs of the Nation; and       Whereas if the United States is to succeed in a world of      increasing international competition, the United States must      have a new national plan for transportation improvements to      provide for the Nation's future: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--       (1) reaffirms the goals and ideals that formed the impetus      for Albert Gallatin's national plan for transportation      improvements 200 years ago;       (2) calls on the Federal Government, States, localities,      schools, nonprofit organizations, businesses, and the      citizens of the United States to mark this important      anniversary by recalling the important legacy of public      investment in infrastructure, which connects and enhances the      economies, communications, and communities of the several      States; and       (3) supports the creation of a new national plan for      transportation improvements to align the demands for economic      development with the resources of the Nation.
