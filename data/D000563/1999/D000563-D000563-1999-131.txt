 A further question to the Senator from Iowa, if he will yield. The Senator is from a neighboring State. There are many parts of Iowa that look similar to my State, particularly in downstate Illinois. On this controversial issue--there are those who have heartfelt strong feelings against abortion, Roe v. Wade; those who have heartfelt strong feelings on the other side in support of a woman's right to choose and Roe v. Wade--I have found the vast majority of people I meet somewhere in between. It is my impression most people in America have concluded abortion should be safe and legal, but it should have some restrictions. I ask the Senator from Iowa, has the Senator from Iowa had that same experience in his State of Iowa?
