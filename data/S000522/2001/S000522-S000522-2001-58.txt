Madam Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds to thank my good friend and colleague, the gentleman from New York (Mr. McNulty) for his powerful statement on behalf of Jerry Solomon and for introducing, as he pointed out, a resolution earlier that would have named this important asset, this cemetery, in honor of Jerry Solomon. And customary and just so characteristic of Jerry, he wanted to be self-effacing and did not want any fuss being made about him. It does not surprise me that he approached the gentleman and said, hey, do not push it. That is just so typical of Jerry Solomon.  I want to thank the gentleman for his leadership. I think that epitomizes the best of bipartisanship. That this is what it is all about. We care for each other. The gentleman cared for Jerry, and he showed it while he was alive in trying to get this cemetery named in his honor. I want to congratulate and thank the gentleman for that.  Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Buyer).
