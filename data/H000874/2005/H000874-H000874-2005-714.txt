Speaker, with respect to the budget resolution which we have passed, I know the Senate has appointed conferees, but we have not yet appointed conferees. Does the leader know when we might appoint conferees for the budget conference? I yield to the leader.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding.  I am not advised as to when we could go to conference on the budget, possibly next week. I know the House is yet to appoint the conferees, so we have a ways to go before a conference report is completed.
