 President, I come to the floor to talk about the IRS and tax issues and the tax bill last year, but following on what Senator Perdue said, I want to, first of all, compliment him for not only this speech but several times he has talked about how the Senate has stalled time after time on nominees.  I want to bring to my colleagues' attention that at one time, there was a lot of concern by President Obama that his nominees were not being confirmed fast enough. We started hearing that in January 2013. All of a sudden, there was a feeling that we ought to have a bipartisan solution to this issue to speed along President Obama's nominees. At one time, the Democratic leader then was talking about using a nuclear option to accomplish a change in rules. Both Republicans and Democrats thought that wasn't a very good idea, so Republicans and Democrats got together and agreed to reduce postcloture debate time for the rest of the 113th Congress, although, before that Congress ended, Senator Reid decided to use the nuclear option anyway, and he did that at a later time.  If Republicans and Democrats could get together in the 113th Congress to speed up the time and have less postcloture debate time, why can't we do it now? The problem, of course, is for the Trump nominees being held up in the Senate, the time is far worse than it was under President Obama or, for that matter, any other President before that.  It seems to me, as we are talking about changing the post-debate time again--because there is a resolution out of our Rules Committee--I think it is about time that we think that what is good for the goose is good for the gander, and we ought to reinstate that bipartisan agreement. I hope we can get the support of Democrats to do that like they had the support of Republicans to do that when we had a Democratic President.  I thank Senator Perdue for what he spoke about on a longer basis than I just did, but I want to back him up fully.                               Tax Reform  Mr. President, we are in the fifth week of the tax filing season. Based on all reports from the IRS, the filing season is running smoothly. All systems are operating as expected. Returns are being processed and refunds are being sent out without any major complications.  According to IRS Commissioner Rettig, his Agency has even set a couple of internal records for the speed at which returns are being processed. At one point, the IRS processed 1.9 million returns in an hour. That is 536 every single second.  Of course, you don't hear much about how the filing season is running smoothly from our mainstream press. There is a lot of positive news, but positive news doesn't seem to make good headlines. Instead, an obsession has developed around the size of the tax returns, not the exact tax that might actually be paid.  Let's set aside that the available Treasury data is merely in the first few weeks of a very unusual tax season due to the partial government shutdown. Never mind that the size of the average tax refund can vary greatly from week to week, making year-over-year comparisons early in the filing season essentially meaningless. Let's ignore the important fact that less than half as many child tax credits and earned-income tax credits have been issued as compared to the last year based almost entirely on calendar factors, and, most importantly, we ought to somehow forget about the fact that the size of one's tax refund tells you absolutely nothing about a taxpayers' overall tax return.  I have been amazed by how many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, who should know better, have sought to equate incomplete information about lower average refunds--telling us all that means people have not received a decrease in their taxes.  I want to quote Howard Gleckman, who should be well respected by people on the other side of the aisle because he is a senior fellow at the liberal Tax Policy Center. He characterized the current obsession with tax refunds as ``wrong-headed,'' noting that it is ``not how big a refund check filers get this year but how much total tax they paid for 2018.'' That is common sense. I thank Howard Gleckman for his common sense.  Yet my colleagues--again, on the other side--continue to try and push the false narrative that a smaller refund is synonymous with tax increase. That doesn't meet the commonsense test.  Just such a claim by a Senate Democrat running for President was observed by the Washington Post's Fact Checker as being ``nonsensical and misleading.'' The claim was awarded four Pinocchios. Four Pinocchios is a rating the Post reserves for the biggest whoppers.  Here are the straight facts. Anyone telling the American public that a smaller refund is the same as a tax increase is being intentionally misleading and doing a disservice to the public. I classify that as a big lie. The size of one's tax refund merely reflects what that taxpayer overpaid the IRS in your paychecks last year. For the vast majority of Americans, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of December 2017 delivered larger paychecks starting last February. The liberal Tax Policy Center confirms that 90 percent of middle-income taxpayers will receive a tax cut. That is right. Taxes went down, not up, for the vast majority of American families.  This tax relief stems from the combination of pro-middle-class and pro-family provisions, including a nearly doubled standard deduction, an increase in the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000, and overall lower tax rates. That is how you give the middle class a tax cut.  Some may believe that we would have been better off depriving taxpayers of their tax cuts until the IRS sent them a refund after the end of the year, but this thinking gets things exactly backward. The excess tax withheld from paychecks throughout the course of a year doesn't belong to the government; it belongs to the taxpayers who earned that money. It is the taxpayers who should be able to decide whether they want to put their weekly or monthly tax savings in a retirement account, pay down a credit card bill, enroll their children in some club, sport, music, or dance lessons, or maybe even make an extra car payment.  I encourage all taxpayers interested in how tax reform affects their bottom line to compare this year's tax return with last year's tax return. That is the commonsense way of figuring out whether your taxes went up or down as a result of the tax bill of 2017. When they do that, the vast majority will see less of their hard-earned money being sent to Washington, DC. Really, that is what ought to matter.  I encourage those in the media who are actually interested in how tax reform has affected taxpayers to takeinto account the positive signs we see all around. It is a positive sign when we write about how blue-collar employment has surged; positive signs about how low-income workers experienced the highest wage growth in a decade; positive signs when we report how new business startups are climbing and how U.S. manufacturers had their best year since 1997; and positive signs as you discuss how the economy grew almost 50 percent faster in 2018 than as President Obama's economists predicted when they predicted slow growth would be the new normal.  All of these subjects are far more important than what has thus far, in most all respects, been an uneventful filing season. Compare this year's tax bottom line with last year's tax bottom line to decide whether you got a tax decrease or a tax increase, not the size of your refund.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
