President, yesterday the Senate agreed to include an amendment which I submitted to the immigration bill. This amendment addresses the serious problem of adding to the administrative load of the already overburdened nutrition programs.  I met a couple of weeks ago with the Vermont School Food Service Association and they expressed tremendous concern over the additional workload this bill would add to their schools. Marlene Senecal, Connie Bellevance, and Sue Steinhurst of the American School Food Service Association urged me to take action as did Jo Busha, the State director of child nutrition programs.  For the school lunch and breakfast programs the ASFSA estimated that 14,881 new staff would have to be hired nationwide to handle the additional paperwork of verifying citizenship status for each child and working with the INS.  If the average salary of new staff is $25,000 to $30,000 a year we are talking about a huge burden for schools--at least $370 million per year.  The magnitude of this unfunded mandate imposed on schools could drive thousands of schools off the school lunch and breakfast program.  The National Conference of State Legislatures are also concerned that the bill, as written, places a huge unfunded mandate on local schools, local governments, and State agencies.  This bill also inflicts complex sponsor deeming procedures regarding legal immigrants in most Federal programs, including child nutrition programs, and WIC.  ``Deeming'', the practice of counting a sponsor's income as that of an immigrant's when calculating eligibility for Federal programs, would add unnecessary bureaucratic burdens on local and State administrators, schools, child care providers, and WIC clinics.  Those already burdened will be forced to spend more time filling out forms and less time providing for the poor and disadvantaged.  States like Vermont, with very few immigrants, will still be affected by the additional administrative burden.  Also, denying these benefits to pregnant immigrant women will lead to increased costs for taxpayers. It is estimated that for every dollar WIC spends on pregnant women $3 is saved in future Medicaid costs. We will end up paying far more through Medicaid to take care of children with low birth rates.  Regardless of the citizenship status of these mothers, their children will be U.S. citizens and eligible for means tested programs.  And, ironically, States with large native American populations who benefit from the food distribution program on Indian reservations would have been forced to verify the citizenship of their native American citizens.  The American School Food Service Association, the National Conference of State Legislatures, and others, are very concerned about the additional mandates and administrative duties that would have been imposed upon schools and States by the ``deeming'' requirements and the immigrant determination process as they affect child nutrition programs.  Most soup kitchen and food bank programs are run by volunteers. Requiring volunteers to do alien status checks and income verification with sponsoring families would be nearly impossible, but hiring staff for this purpose would use donated funds in ways not intended by those making the donations.  School lunch and breakfast programs are run by local schools who struggle with increasing administrative and overhead costs. Requiring them to closely monitor immigrant status and sponsor incomes would have burdened them greatly according to the American School Food Service Association. Fifty million children attend school each school day in the United States.  Similar arguments can be raised for other child nutrition programs such as the WIC Program.  My amendment also corrected what I believe are some drafting errors in the bill and makes additional improvements.  First, on page 180, ineligible aliens are disqualified from receiving public assistance except for certain programs such as those under the National School Lunch Act, the Child Nutrition Act, and other assistance such as soup kitchens if they are not means tested.  This language omits several programs such as the commodity supplemental food program which is an alternative to WIC in many areas of the country.  There is no reason I can think of for pregnant women getting WIC benefits to be treated differently from pregnant women getting the same benefits under the Commodity Supplemental Food Program which was the precursor to WIC, and is still operated in about 30 areas around the Nation.  Also, the soup kitchen program, the food bank program and the emergency food assistance program could be considered to be means tested so they would not be exempt either.  These programs provide emergency food assistance to families and I doubt if anyone intended to treat them differently from the nutrition programs already exempted.                     harkin-byrd-daschle amendment
