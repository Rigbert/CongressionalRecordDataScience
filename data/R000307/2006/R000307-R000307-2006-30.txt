President, this summer the U.S. Capitol added a new portrait to its collection of Senate leaders. It is a face that is familiar to all of us since he once led this institution and spent 27 years here as a Senator. I refer to Bob Dole, former Senator from Kansas, chairman of the Finance Committee, majority leader, and Presidential candidate. His portrait was unveiled in the Old Senate Chamber on July 25 and now hangs in the Senate Chamber lobby, along with a painting of Senator George Mitchell, his Democratic counterpart. He looks very much at home there.  Bob Dole's story is familiar to almost everyone in this Nation: Born and raised in Russell, KS, he went off to serve in the U.S. Army during the Second World War. He was seriously injured in combat in Italy and underwent arduous physical rehabilitation for more than 3 years. He returned to Kansas, got his law degree, ran for the State legislature, and served as county attorney. He first ran for Congress in 1960 and served in the House of Representatives for 8 years. Then, like many of us, he migrated from the House to the Senate.  The Senate suited Bob Dole. He is a man who speaks his mind, candidly and forthrightly. Right away he impressed Senator Barry Goldwater, who hailed the new Senator from Kansas as ``the first fellow we've had around here in a long time who can grab 'em by the hair and haul 'em down the aisle.'' While that captures the combative side of the man, there was also Bob Dole the legislative tactician, a statesman who sought common ground among 100 Senators to craft legislation that would best serve the Nation. When President Ronald Reagan sought to shore up the finances of Social Security, it was Bob Dole, as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, working with the ranking member of the minority, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who forged the bill that stabilized the system for another generation.  As floor leader of his party, in both the majority and the minority, Bob Dole stood front and center in the Chamber, shrewd, vigilant, and masterful. But you could also find him off the floor, sitting in the cloakroom, a legal pad on his lap, surrounded by a knot of Senators, drafting the language of an amendment to break a legislative impasse and get the Senate's business back on track.  He did this all with a ready quip and a limitless sense of humor that got him and the Senate through many difficult moments. Bob Dole possesses a sure sense of the ironies of government and the foibles of politicians. He has used this to great advantage in winning over his audiences, whether in small groups or vast arenas. He is smiling in his portrait, as if he had just delivered one of those lines that made his listeners laugh.  It is a handsome portrait of a man who well deserves the honor of being included among the artwork of the U.S. Capitol. Future Senators can gaze on it for inspiration, and it will remind visitors of his many contributions to our Nation's history. Bob Dole will most likely glance at it himself when he visits the Capitol and probably make a few wry remarks when he does. Today he is proudly a Senate spouse, married to the senior Senator from North Carolina, Elizabeth Hanford Dole, who carries on his legislative tradition.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the proceedings of the ceremony for unveiling the Bob Dole leadership portrait.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Remarks transcribed From the Bob Dole Leadership Portrait Unveiling--                July 25, 2006 in the Old Senate Chamber
