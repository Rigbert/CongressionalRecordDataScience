Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the conference report on the bill (H.R. 889) to authorize appropriations for the Coast Guard for fiscal year 2006, to make technical corrections to various laws administered by the Coast Guard, and for other purposes.  The Clerk read the title of the bill.  (For conference report and statement, see proceedings of the House of April 6, 2006 at page H1640.)
