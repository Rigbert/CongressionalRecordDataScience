Mr. Chairman, first of all, I would like to commend the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Nussle), the chairman of the Committee on the Budget, and the Committee on the Budget for bringing this resolution to the floor.  The intent of this resolution is to honor the funding guarantees in TEA21 and AIR21 and provides substantial increases for other important transportation programs, such as the Coast Guard. It is my understanding that due to errors in the functional totals that were provided by the Office of Management and Budget and perhaps other discrepancies between OMB and CBO, the Function 400 totals in this resolution were inadvertently understated.                              {time}  1745  I have been assured that a technical correction will be made in conference so that the final budget resolution accurately reflects the funding levels necessary to fully fund highways and transit under TEA21, and the Federal Aviation Administration's operating capital, and airport grant programs under AIR21, as well as provide increases for other transportation programs, such as the Coast Guard.  I would like to ask the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Nussle) if my understanding accurately reflects his intention.
