Speaker, This concurrent resolution authorizes the Clerk of the House to correct the enrollment of the bill, H.R. 5164, the TREAD Act. This legislation passed both the House and Senate without opposition yesterday.  Due to an inadvertent drafting error, a paragraph of the amendment offered by Mr. Luther in committee was deleted from the bill reported to the House, and left out of the bill subsequently passed by both the House and Senate. This provision, which addressed the reimbursement for repairs made prior to a recall, enjoyed broad bipartisan support and was always assumed to be part of the package passed by the House.  This concurrent resolution simply corrects this error, and I urge my colleagues to support it.  The concurrent resolution was agreed to.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                          ____________________
