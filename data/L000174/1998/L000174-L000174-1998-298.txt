President, I rise to offer an amendment with my colleague and friend from Vermont, Senator Jeffords. Recently, I was dismayed to learn that the Vermont Army National Guard is programmed to receive yet another cut in its full-time manning. nearly all of us take pride in supporting our state National Guard units. The Guard is a critical state asset when we experience natural disasters and other state emergencies. The Guard offers professional opportunities and education for our young constituents. Perhaps most importantly, the Guard is available in case our nation ever finds itself at war. Fully 58% of our Army's combat forces are located in the National Guard, and an Army Guard combat unit can do the same job as its active duty counterpart for less than half the cost. But all these benefits are wasted if we do not provide enough resources for our Guard to train, and enough full-time personnel so that our Guardsmen can take full advantage of the limited time they spend in uniform.  For many years now, the Army has been giving some Guard units more resources than others. The allocation model that the Army uses is based on which units would be called to fight first. That is fine in principle, but in practice the resources that have been given to lower priority units have been insufficient. For example, in recent years the Vermont Guard's 86th Brigade has been receiving about 55% of its full time manning requirements. These are the men and women who prepare for each month's drill weekend, maintain and fix equipment, recruit new soldiers from the community, and do all the other tasks that need to be done during the month. Higher priority Guard units have been receiving 70 to 75 percent of their full time manning requirements. Although 55 percent was not sufficient, it has been enough for the 86th brigade. They recently were noted for the fact that they qualified one of their tank battalions on the regular Army's tough Tank Table 12 live-fire test. The Vermonters were only the second unit in the country to achieve this honor, the first being an enhanced unit from Idaho.  That is why I was so disturbed that the Army was set to cut Vermont's full-time support down to between 30 and 34 percent, according to a letter I received from Acting Assistant Secretary of the Army Jayson Spiegal on March 3 of this year. At that level of funding, I have been told that Vermont would have to close some of its armories because it would not have enough funds to keep two soldiers in each armory. Of course, I am worried about my own state, which has one of the oldest militia traditions dating back to Benedict Arnold's Green Mountain Boys of Revolutionary War fame. But there are eight other National Guard combat divisions spread across the country, and I want to inform my colleagues that each of those units is in danger of suffering a death of a thousand cuts by a lack of resources.  The Chairman and Ranking Member of the Armed Services Committee have accepted this amendment from Senator Jeffords and myself which requires that the Head of the Guard Bureau provide a report to the four defense committees of Congress to ensure that states with a large number of lower-priority National Guard units are not being disproportionately impacted by full-time manning reductions.  Mr. President, I want to close by thanking Senator Thurmond and Senator Levin for accommodating me and my colleague from Vermont on this amendment. Their expertise and hard work for our nation's defenses are appreciated by all of us in this body.                           Amendment No. 3026 (Purpose: To provide health benefits for abused dependents of members                           of the armed forces)       At the appropriate place, add the following:       Paragraph (1) of section 1076(e) of Title 10, United States      Code, is amended to read as follows:       (1) The administering Secretary shall furnish an abused      dependent of a former member of a uniformed service described      in paragraph (4), during that period that the abused      dependent is in receipt of transitional compensation under      section 1059 of this title, with medical and dental care,      including mental health services, in facilities of the      uniformed services in accordance with the same eligibility      and benefits as were applicable for that abused dependent      during the period of active service of the former member.
