President, today, March 7, 2006, we celebrate the 16th annual National Sportsmanship Day. Begun in 1991 by the Institute for International Sport at the University of Rhode Island, this initiative promotes the highest ideals of sportsmanship and fair play among America's youth. In 13,000 schools, across all 50 States, and in countries around the world, students, teachers, administrators, coaches, and parents will engage in discussions on the issues of sportsmanship and fair play. The theme of this year's National Sportsmanship Day is ``Defeat Gamesmanship!'' and participants will talk about appropriate tactics and strategies when participating in games and sports.  This year, in addition to promoting the values of sportsmanship and fair play, the Institute for International Sport will recognize schools across the country that have exceptional sportsmanship programs with the new All-American Sportsmanship School Award. A minimum of 64 awards will be given out to elementary, middle, and high schools as well as colleges that participate in National Sportsmanship Day and honor its principles year round.  I am proud that Rhode Island is home to the Institute for International Sport and National Sportsmanship Day. For 16 years, this initiative has had a positive influence on our Nation's youth in promoting the best in athletics, and I know it will continue to do so this year and in the future.                          ____________________
