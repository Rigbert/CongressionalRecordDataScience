 President, yesterday we had votes on a handful of amendments which were aimed at reducing the overall size of the Omnibus appropriations bill. Many of us who are concerned about the spending binge we have been on thought it would be responsible to bring it back in line with the appropriations bills we passed last year. That was obviously before the economic crisis.  As the junior Senator from Indiana put it this morning in an insightful op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal, this bill was drafted last year.       Since then, economic and fiscal circumstances have changed      dramatically, which is why--  As he put it--     the Senate should go back to the drawing board. The economic      downturn requires new policies, not more of the same.  That is Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana.  I ask unanimous consent to have the article, in which Senator Bayh calls on his colleagues to vote against the omnibus or for the President to veto it, printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 3, 2009]                    Deficits and Fiscal Credibility      A Democratic senator says no to a huge federal spending bill                             (By Evan Bayh)       This week, the United States Senate will vote on a spending      package to fund the federal government for the remainder of      this     fiscal year. The Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009 is a      sprawling, $410 billion compilation of nine spending measures      that lacks the slightest hint of austerity from the federal      government or the recipients of its largess.       The Senate should reject this bill. If we do not, President      Barack Obama should veto it.       The omnibus increases discretionary spending by 8% over      last fiscal year's levels, dwarfing the rate of inflation      across a broad swath of issues including agriculture,      financial services, foreign relations, energy and water      programs, and legislative branch operations. Such increases      might be appropriate for a nation flush with cash or      unconcerned with fiscal prudence, but America is neither.       Drafted last year, the bill did not pass due to Congress's      long-standing budgetary dysfunction and the frustrating      delays it yields in our appropriations work. Since then,      economic and fiscal circumstances have changed dramatically,      which is why the Senate should go back to the drawing board.      The economic downturn requires new policies, not more of the      same.       Our nation's current fiscal imbalance is unprecedented,      unsustainable and, if unaddressed, a major threat to our      currency and our economic vitality. The national debt now      exceeds $10 trillion. This is almost double what it was just      eight years ago, and the debt is growing at a rate of about      $1 million a minute.       Washington borrows from foreign creditors to fund its      profligacy. The amount of U.S. debt held by countries such as      China and Japan is at a historic high, with foreign investors      holding half of America's publicly held debt. This dependence      raises the specter that other nations will be able to      influence our policies in ways antithetical to American      interests. The more of our debt that foreign governments      control, the more leverage they have on issues like trade,      currency and national security. Massive debts owed to foreign      creditors weaken our global influence, and threaten high      inflation and steep tax increases for our children and      grandchildren.       The solution going forward is to stop wasteful spending      before it starts. Families and businesses are tightening      their belts to make ends meet--and Washington should too.       The omnibus debate is not merely a battle over last year's      unfinished business, but the first indication of how we will      shape our fiscal future. Spending should be held in check      before taxes are raised, even on the wealthy. Most people are      willing to do their duty by paying taxes, but they want to      know that their money is going toward important priorities      and won't be wasted.       Last week I was pleased to attend the president's White      House Fiscal Responsibility Summit. It's about time we had a      leader committed to addressing the deficit, and Mr. Obama      deserves great credit for doing so. But what ultimately      matters are not meetings or words, but actions. Those who      vote for the omnibus this week--after standing with the      president and pledging to slice our deficit in half last      week--jeopardize their credibility.       As Indiana's governor, I balanced eight budgets, never      raised taxes, and left the largest surplus in state history.      It wasn't always easy. Cuts had to be made and some      initiatives deferred. Occasionally I had to say ``no.''       But the bloated omnibus requires sacrifice from no one,      least of all the government. It only exacerbates the problem      and hastens the day of reckoning. Voters rightly demanded      change in November's election, but this approach to spending      represents business as usual in Washington, not the voters'      mandate.       Now is the time to win back the confidence and trust of the      American people. Congress should vote ``no'' on this omnibus      and show working families across the country that we are as      committed to living within our means as they are.  Mr. McCONNELL. Today, Republicans are going to continue bringing up our amendments, amendments that we think are better and more responsible ways to use the taxpayers' money today.  Unfortunately, it has become increasingly clear that most of our Democrat colleagues here in Congress--Senator Bayh notwithstanding--are perfectly comfortable with the breathtaking rate of spending we have been on since the beginning of the year. They want it to continue, without restraint and without any end in sight.  Amazingly, in the midst of an economic crisis, congressional Democrats want to increase the annual spending included in this omnibus by 8 percent, which, compared to last year, is twice the rate of inflation.  At a time when Americans are learning to cut back, Democrats in Congress are suggesting we double up. As Senator Bayh put it in the same op-ed:       The bloated omnibus requires sacrifice from no one, least      of all the government. It only exacerbates the problem and      hastens the day of reckoning. Voters rightly demanded change      in November's election, but this approach to spending      represents business as usual in Washington, not the voters'      mandate.  Nobody wants an open-ended recession. But so far the only solution to the economic crisis that Democrats in Congress are offering is open-ended spending without any end in sight. And let's be clear about something: we cannot end a recession by digging the country into deeper and deeper debt any more than one can pay off a credit card by using it more often. And we can't tax our way out of a recession.  February was an expensive month for American taxpayers. In the month of February, Congress spent more money than we did in 7 years on the war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan and Hurricane Katrina relief combined.  All of this spending is reason to carefully consider and pare back this massive spending bill, particularly in these areas which contain funding for 122 programs already funded in the stimulus bill.  Remarkably, even Senator Hutchison's amendment, which sought to find $12 billion, or just 1 percent, in duplicative spending from two bills totaling $1.2 trillion, was struck down.  I hope our friends across the aisle will join Republican efforts to ensure every taxpayer dollar is spent with care, and support amendments to protect taxpayer dollars.  This current spending bill is only one step in the spending process. It doesn't include the President's budget, the housing proposal, or untold trillions to stabilize financial markets and other programs  Our children and grandchildren can't afford this level of spending. They will be the ones left to pay off the Federal Government credit card that Democrats in Congress are busy maxing out.                          ____________________
