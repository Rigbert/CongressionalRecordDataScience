President, if you look at the root cause of our economic crisis today, most people would agree that it started in the housing industry. People across America signed up for these new mortgages--adjustable rate mortgages--with terms that some people had never seen before. Sometimes they were terms that turned out to be unrealistic for the person's income and the value of the property; and at the end of a reset period, what was an affordable mortgage became unaffordable. People were then faced with the grim reality that they could not stay in their homes.  Some of the folks who entered into these mortgages signed up for bad mortgages. Others were misled into them. Some signed up for a mortgage and lost their jobs.
