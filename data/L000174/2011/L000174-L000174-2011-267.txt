Most people, when they go into court, do not go in as a Republican or Democrat. They are just an American seeking justice. But the courts' doors are now being closed; closed because the Senate will not allow confirmation of the judges who could open those doors. That is wrong. It is a stain on the judiciary, and it is a stain on this body.                               Exhibit 1                                              U.S. District Court,                                 Southern District of Florida,                                         Miami, FL, July 21, 2011.     Re Nominations of Kathleen Williams and Robert Scola to the          U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.     Senator Mitch McConnell,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: As Chief Judge of the United States      District Court for the Southern District of Florida, I urge      you to expedite the Senate's confirmation of Kathleen      Williams and Robert Scola to the positions of district judges      in our district. I understand that the Judiciary Committee      has sent both nominations by unanimous voice vote and is      awaiting a vote by the full Senate. Ms. Williams, our      district's Federal Public Defender, has been awaiting      confirmation for the longest period of any present nominee to      the district court in the entire country. State Judge Robert      Scola's nomination is of a more recent vintage but the      litigants are eagerly awaiting his confirmation.       The judgeship Ms. Williams has been nominated to fill has      been vacant for two years! At the present time, our district      has three vacancies. Unfilled positions in our Court present      an undue hardship on the citizens residing in the Southern      District of Florida, particularly those with cases pending in      the affected division of the Court. Our district is huge and      heavily populated. It includes the most populous counties in      Florida, Miami-Dade, Broward (where Fort Lauderdale is      located) and Palm Beach Counties. The district also includes      Monroe, St. Lucie, Highlands, Okeechobee, Martin, and Indian      River Counties.       We have been laboring under a judicial shortage for quite      some time. The Judicial Conference of the United States has      for the past several years annually recommended to Congress      three additional permanent judgeships and to convert one      temporary judgeship into a permanent one.       This shortage is exacerbated by the fact that we are one of      the busiest district courts in the nation. Our district had      10,556 new filings in both criminal and civil cases in 2010,      an increase of 6.7% over the year 2000. The latest national      statistics (FY 2010) are attached and show that our district      is first in ``weighted filings'' in the Eleventh Circuit.       In sum, the judicial shortage with three vacancies in our      district is becoming acute. For this reason, I ask your      assistance in expediting both confirmations. The Judiciary      Committee has found the nominees qualified and the people of      South Florida eagerly await their service.       Please call me if I can provide any additional information.      I thank you in advance     for your consideration of this important matter.           Sincerely,                                               Federico A. Moreno,                                        Chief U.S. District Judge.
