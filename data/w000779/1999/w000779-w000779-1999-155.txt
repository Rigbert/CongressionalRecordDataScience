I will be brief.  I think what the chairman of the Commerce Committee is suggesting is a practical way to get at it. This Member of the Senate believes, with all due respect to my friend from Massachusetts, that the Kerry amendment would be a lightning rod for additional frivolous lawsuits with respect to Y2K. I think, for example, some of the language is so vague--this question of identifying the potential for Y2K failure.
