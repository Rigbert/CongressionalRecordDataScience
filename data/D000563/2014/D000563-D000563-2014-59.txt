It is officially titled the Carl Levin and Howard P. `Buck' McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. It couldn't be more appropriate.  This will be the 54th year in a row that Congress has passed the Defense Authorization. It has never been an easy task. Senator Levin has had a great deal to do with that annual labor of love. He has served as the highest ranking Democratic member on the committee since January 1997, and he has served as its Chairman for eleven of the last 14 years. Every year, he has kept the needs of our service members and their families front and center.  It isn't an easy job.
