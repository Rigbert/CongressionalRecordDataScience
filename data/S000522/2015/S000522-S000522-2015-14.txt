Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this resolution.  As a member of the Benghazi panel, I think what we have learned from the Benghazi panel is that this House majority is not to be trusted when it comes to forming special investigatory panels. Basically, they form them for purely partisan reasons, as Representative McCarthy admitted just last week.  The second point here is one that has been made repeatedly. There is no evidence whatsoever that Planned Parenthood has violated the law.  So what exactly is it exactly that we are investigating? Even the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight has admitted there is no evidence that Planned Parenthood has violated the law.  Third, there is a House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. In fact, just about every committee in Congress has an oversight function.  So why don't we use that instead of wasting taxpayer dollars on something like the Benghazi Committee, which is admittedly breaking all kind of records in terms of wasting taxpayer dollars? But we don't need to pile on with another wasteful committee.                              {time}  1615  If you want to investigate this, do it through the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Do it through the existing committees.  Lastly, it is incredibly important to point out that Planned Parenthood performs enormously important services to women in this country. They provide much-needed health care to poor women and much-needed family planning to poor women.  You should have a family when you want a family. If you are not prepared to take care of children, then family planning makes an enormous amount of sense. In fact, what it does is it prevents abortions. It stops women from getting pregnant when they are not ready to have children. It goes after precisely the issue that the majority is most concerned about, to prevent abortions.  Planned Parenthood deserves our support, not another wasteful, taxpayer-funded, partisan investigation.
