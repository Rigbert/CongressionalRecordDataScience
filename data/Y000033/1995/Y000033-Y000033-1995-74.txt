Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank my friends and colleagues for their leadership on the Animas-La Plata project, and for the inclusion of section 507 of the fiscal year 1996 energy and water development appropriations bill. I also support this language, and I urge this Congress to take a stand and ensure construction of the Animas-La Plata project in a timely fashion to fulfill the settlement.  In 1988, Congress determined that this project was the best alternative for meeting the needs and interests of the parties to the settlement agreement. We passed the 1988 Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act in order to ensure that the senior water rights of the two Ute tribes were satisfied.  As the chairman of the authorizing committee, I have a message for the Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary has the responsibility under the 1988 legislation to build the Animas-La Plata project. In hearings on the fiscal year 1994 energy and water development appropriations bill, Secretary Babbitt stated: ``I understand that Congress has mandated that this project get going, and I will comply with the mandate.''  Mr. Secretary, you now have yet another mandate from the Congress, section 507 provides you with the necessary tools to move forward and build this project in accordance with obvious congressional intent. I urge you to move forward and build the Animas-La Plata project immediately so that the United States may preserve the integrity of the water rights settlement.
