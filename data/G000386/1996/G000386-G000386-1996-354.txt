 It is an attempt to better manage the Pentagon's resources, because enough is enough. Promised reforms are not the same as real reforms. We shovel billions into the defense budget on the promise of reforms. Historically the reforms have failed to materialize, yet we still throw good money after bad.  If we fail to learn the lessons of the past, as George Santayana preaches to us, ``We're doomed to repeat them ad nauseam.'' If we do that again this year, Mr. President, we will be falling into the familiar trap once again expressed by the great philosopher Georg Hegel. He said, ``We learn from history that we learn nothing from history.''  So I urge my colleagues to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. I ask them to vote for the bipartisan amendment, the Grassley-Exon amendment. I yield the floor.
