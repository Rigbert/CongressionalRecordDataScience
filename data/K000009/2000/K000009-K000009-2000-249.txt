Speaker, today I have a heavy heart. It is in great sadness that I honor my dear friend, Myra (Casimira) Lenard, who fought her courageous and long bout with grave illness so valiantly. On Monday afternoon, May 1, Myra passed from this life after having served as the long time Executive Director of the Washington Office of the Polish American Congress. For nearly 20 years, she became the much revered force representing Polish Americans here in our Nation's Capital. Her fortitude was to be admired as she guided the Congress through the tumultuous times of Solidarity and Martial Law. What a gift that she lived to witness the fall of the Berlin Wall, and then saw the fulfillment of a life-long quest as Poland left the Warsaw Pact and became a member of NATO. She may be best remembered, though, for leading the charge to convert proceeds of the Polish American Enterprise Fund into the Polish American Freedom Foundation. It was Myra who worked tirelessly with the White House and Members of Congress ensuring that voices of Polish Americans in our country would be heard. It was Myra who sacrificed so much to fight for those unable to do it themselves.  Born in Poland, she emigrated to the United States as a small child, where she spent many years involved in Chicago's Polonian organizations. There she met the love of her life, Casimir I. Lenard, whom she married and then moved with him to Washington, DC in 1962. Once here, she immediately began volunteering her time to needy, worthy causes. Her talents were recognized as she ultimately achieved a leadership position at the Polish American Congress. Myra was the worthy recipient of numerous awards, including the Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit--the highest civilian award granted by Poland, presented by Polish Foreign Minister Wladslaw Bartoszewski in 1995. At a meeting of the Supervisory Council of the Polish National Alliance in December 1998, she and her husband were enrolled in the PNA's Legion of Merit. The list of her accomplishments cannot fully capture the fullness of this dynamic, gracious, dedicated and politically brilliant woman. Truly she was a freedom-lover.  Mr. Speaker, may we gain some small comfort in knowing the spirit and fire that Myra carried through her life that helped bring freedom to her first homeland inspired thousands who have been touched with her light and love. May peace bless her always. And may the work to which she dedicated her life--with family and career--stand as a living testament to this regal and loving woman. America is fortunate indeed that she chose this nation as her permanent homeland.                          ____________________
