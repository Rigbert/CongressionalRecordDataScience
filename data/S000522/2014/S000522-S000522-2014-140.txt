Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Taryn Wilcox of Robbinsville, New Jersey for her tireless advocacy on behalf of those suffering from diabetes.  As you will read in her statement submitted for the Record, fourteen-year-old Taryn was diagnosed with Type I diabetes at the age of five. Serving as the American Diabetes Association's Teen Ambassador and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation's Advocate, Taryn has chosen to make a meaningful difference by raising awareness of diabetes and joining the fight to find a cure.  I had the opportunity to meet with Taryn in my office and hear first-hand her testimony--and could not have been more impressed with her passion and focus. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly 26 million Americans--roughly 8.3% of the population--suffer from diabetes. Diabetes is a leading cause of heart disease and stroke, hypertension, blindness and eye problems, kidney disease, nervous system damage, and amputations, among other ailments. I've worked with diabetes advocates in the past on such things as legislation I authored to extend Medicare coverage for therapeutic shoes for elderly diabetics. This commonsense solution has helped countless numbers of senior diabetics over the last twenty years.  Many young Americans--an estimated 215,000 under the age of twenty, like Taryn--are suffering from diabetes. The relative rarity at this age bracket only leads to common misconceptions about those affected by juvenile diabetes. As Taryn states, she cannot simply take a break from diabetes--it is constant. She must monitor her disease twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, both checking her blood glucose and giving herself insulin injections up to twelve times a day.  Taryn writes about teachers and swim coaches who became frustrated with her need to monitor and manage her blood sugar and publicly questioned her ability to compete. But Taryn has refused to quit, using these all-too common incidents as motivation to succeed and accomplish her goals. She has achieved straight A's and has become one of the best swimmers in the State. Through her accomplishments, Taryn has shown that while diabetes is a daily struggle, increased awareness can assist those suffering from diabetes--providing them with positive support and enabling them to achieve their goals.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Taryn Wilcox of Robbinsville, New Jersey for her personal testimony and leadership in the fight against diabetes, and encourage all of you to read her testimony. Her efforts and her passion are an inspiration to us all.       Congressman Smith, I really appreciate the opportunity to      speak to you about how diabetes affects me and the importance      of finding a cure.       I am 14 years old and was diagnosed with Type I Diabetes at      the age of 5. I was hospitalized, during my diagnosis, two      months prior to entering kindergarten. I have had diabetes      for as long as I can remember . . . for most of my life.       To be honest, it has been challenging managing my diabetes,      a disease requiring 24/7 monitoring! I count carbohydrates in      everything I eat, check my blood glucose up to 12 times a day      as well as give myself up to 12 insulin injections a day. My      parents check my blood glucose 2-3 times every night while I      sleep! I've had over 68,000 needle sticks since my diagnosis.      If I stacked all the needles I've used, it would reach the      top of the Washington Monument 26 times!!!!       Although I try to stay positive, I'm fearful of the many      complications and challenges which can result from diabetes      such as blindness, amputations, cardiovascular disease,      kidney failure and the arduous task of maintaining my blood      sugar in a normal range. Sometimes my blood sugar will drop      too low or go too high and I feel HORRIBLE. My legs shake . .      . I can't think well . . . my heart beats rapidly and      sometimes my vision is blurred. There are times I have to sit      out during fun activities or miss class time and sit in the      nurse's office. It can be a very lonely feeling. Once, soon      after my diagnosis, I had a seizure while visiting my      grandmother in Arizona. It was an extremely scary experience.      It's frustrating not being able to have any time away or      vacation from diabetes, it always comes with me.       Managing my diabetes isn't the only challenge I've had to      face since my diagnosis. In 6th grade I asked my teacher to      go to the nurse's office to give myself an insulin injection      to lower my high blood glucose. She clearly wasn't happy      about me missing class time and said loudly in front of my      class. . . . ``You make diabetes convenient don't you!''      Trust me there's nothing convenient about having diabetes.       Years ago while in 2nd grade, I had to change schools      because my teacher started treating me differently from my      peers. No matter HOW much information was given to her about      the disease, she became frustrated with me whenever I needed      to manage my diabetes in her classroom. She couldn't      understand why I had to check my blood sugar several times      during school hours, leave class to go to the nurse's office      when my blood sugar was too high or low and told me how      unfair it was to drink juice in front of my peers. Looking      back, I don't understand why she didn't think how unfair it      was for a 7 year old kid to live with diabetes.       A similar challenge arose in when one of my competitive      swim team coaches thought it was RIDICULOUS I had to stop      swimming laps during swim practice to manage my blood sugar.      One day she crouched down and looked me in the eye in front      of my team mates and said, ``If you can't manage to swim      continuously during the 1 1/2 hours of practice, you will      NEVER make a state swim team!''       The good news is . . . I became a straight ``A'' student at      my new school and I placed 5th and 14th in State with my new      swim team! It's a frustrating feeling knowing I have to work      TWICE as hard as everybody else to achieve my goals because      of trying to balance my diabetes with everyday life. It makes      it even harder when some people around me don't have the      patience to try to understand my disease. I can't take a      ``break'' from diabetes--it's constant.       Although, I face many challenges every day, living with      diabetes, I stay positive by spreading awareness and above      all, supporting the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation,      the American Diabetes Association and other organizations in      their mission to finding a cure and promoting advocacy. There      are over 26 million people in the U.S. who have diabetes so      it is important for Congress to fund diabetes research at the      highest level as possible. Hopefully, by working together      Congressman Smith, we can make a difference in the lives of      people living with diabetes to live a happy and healthier      life and one day soon, be cured.     Taryn Wilcox.                          ____________________
