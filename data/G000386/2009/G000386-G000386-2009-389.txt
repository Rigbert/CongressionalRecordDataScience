 President, I know the Senator from Maryland always thinks things through very well, but I am going to rise in opposition. I don't do it easily. But this is a time when we are in a recession. I know the motivation is to help us get out of a recession, but we have a massive amount of increase in consumer debt, and this is going to just encourage more consumer debt.  We have other things in the Tax Code that help people who buy hybrid cars and electric cars, and we have incentives for the automobile industry within TARP. So I have to oppose this, and in opposing it, I will do it this way, by raising the point of order against the Mikulski amendment pursuant to section 201(a) of Senate Concurrent Resolution 21 of the 110th Congress.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
