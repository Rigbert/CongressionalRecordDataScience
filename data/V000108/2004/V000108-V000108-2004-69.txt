Speaker, it is with great honor and enthusiasm that I congratulate St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church as they join together in celebration of their 90th anniversary. They will be celebrating this very momentous and special occasion November 13 and 14, 2004.  St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church and School is known throughout the northwest Indiana community as ``Serbian Gary'' because of its continued efforts over the past 90 years to perpetuate the Serbian Orthodox faith and traditions. In 1914, the founders proclaimed their mission of their new church before the Secretary of State in Indianapolis, Indiana. Their mission is as follows: ``The purpose of this parish is to preach the Word of God (the Lord Jesus) and take spiritual care of its members; to spread goodness, justice, brotherly love, and respect among its members.''  After much debate and discussion on who would be their chosen patron saint, it was unanimously decided that the patron saint of the parish and church would be St. Sava, the First Serbian Archbishop and Enlightener. In 1917, the parishioners, although under tremendous economic hardships, built the first church and school on 20th Avenue and Connecticut Street in Gary. Mr. Michael Pupin, a well-known Serbian scientist, served as Kum at the consecration services. Immediately after the Great Depression, the parish built an even larger church, school, parish hall, and library on 13th Avenue and Connecticut in 1938. Mr. Nikola Tesla, a well-known Serbian inventor and scientist, served as Kum at the consecration services.  In 1969, after Chairman Nick Chabraja purchased 40 acres of property on 49th Avenue in Hobart, the parish built a new parish hall for their summer meetings and family picnics. In February of 1978, during the day of honor to St. Simeon and Ana, the church was completely destroyed by a terrible fire. Under the leadership of President Zivojin Cokic and many volunteers, they built another church in the small hall of the 49th Avenue building. In May of 1991, the parish celebrated a ``new beginning'' when a brand-new building was constructed. The new building opened in Merrillville, where relics which survived the fire were blessed and installed into the new church.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church on their 90th anniversary. Throughout many hardships and trials, the members of St. Sava have dedicated themselves to providing a spiritual and guiding light through the protection of the Serbian Orthodox faith and traditions for all of northwest Indiana. Their constant dedication and commitment is worthy of the highest commendation.                          ____________________
