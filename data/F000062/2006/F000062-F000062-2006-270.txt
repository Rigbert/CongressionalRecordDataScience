 President. I am pleased today to introduce legislation with Senator Specter to reaffirm the exclusivity of the Foreign Surveillance Intelligence Act of 1978, FISA, and streamline the process by which it works.  This measure brings the so-called Terrorist Surveillance Program being conducted by the National Security Agency under the process required by FISA. The bill will enhance our national security and provide constitutional protections against government intrusion into the privacy of ordinary Americans.  Specifically, the bill that we introduce today would:  Restate, in no uncertain terms, that FISA is the exclusive means by which our Government can conduct electronic surveillance of U.S. persons on U.S. soil for foreign intelligence purposes;  Expressly state that there is no such thing as an ``implied'' repeal of our FISA laws. No future bill can be interpreted as authorizing an exception from FISA unless it expressly makes such exception;  Increase flexibility under FISA by extending the period of emergency electronic surveillance from 72 hours to 7 days, which should cover all contingent needs; and  Authorize designated supervisors at the NSA and the FBI to initiate emergency electronic surveillance, provided that the surveillance is reported to the Attorney General within 24 hours, and approved by the AG within 3 days and the FISA Court within 7 days. The purpose of this is to prevent bureaucratic delay in an emergency circumstance.  In addition to these major provisions, the legislation we introduce today makes several additional changes to reinforce FISA's exclusivity and adapt existing FISA authorities and procedures.  These changes are designed to allow applications to move faster from the field to the FISA Court, and to allow that Court to handle any increased caseload that will result from bringing the current NSA program into the FISA regime.  These additional authorities, streamlined procedures, and additional resources respond directly to needs described by the Attorney General, current and former FISA Court judges, and outside experts. Specifically, the bill:  Allows the Attorney General to delegate his authority to approve applications going to the FISA Court to two other Senate-confirmed Justice Department officials;  Takes FISA's current allowance for 15 days of warrantless electronic surveillance following a declaration of war and extend it to the 15 days:  1. Following a Congressional authorization to use military force, or  2. A major terrorist attack against our nation for the same period of time.  Authorizes additional personnel at the NSA, the FBI, the Department of Justice, and the FISA Court, to reduce the time it takes to initiate, review, and file a FISA application.  Allows for additional judges to the FISA Court as needed to manage the caseload;  Facilitates a review of the FISA application process, culminating in a report designed to eliminate any unnecessary delay in the filings; and  Mandates the creation of a secure, classified document management system to facilitate electronic filing.  In addition to reaffirming FISA's exclusivity, as I mentioned before, the legislation:  Prohibits the use of Federal funds for any future electronic surveillance of U.S. Persons that does not fully comply with the law; and  Requires that the full Intelligence Committees be briefed on all electronic surveillance, and related, programs.  We are in a war against terrorists, who seek to attack us in unpredictable and asymmetric ways.  Intelligence is the key to our defense; we must know about the terrorists' intentions and capabilities to do us harm if we are to stop them.  Electronic surveillance, including surveillance conducted within the United States on U.S. persons, is part of our defense. The men and women at the NSA and the FBI who do this work are careful, dedicated officials.  But even in this war on terror, we should not sacrifice basic protections enshrined in the Constitution, including the fourth amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizures.  The FISA Court was created in 1978, following the Church Committee's investigation of some of our Government's worst civil rights violations--J. Edgar Hoover's spying on Martin Luther King, Jr., and Vietnam-era ``enemies lists,'' for example. These abuses were the result of domestic spying--electronic surveillance--under the guise of foreign intelligence.  In response, Congress, working with both the Ford and Carter administrations, drafted and later enacted FISA in 1978 to be the exclusive means to conduct electronic surveillance of U.S. persons. It created a special court--operating in secret--that has to approve a warrant for every domestic wiretap, and provides for careful congressional oversight.  Over the years, this FISA court has rejected only a small handful of thousands of warrant requests, and has never had a significant leak. After the PATRIOT Act was passed in October 2001, for example, the Justice Department stated that FISA has worked efficiently and well.  In the past 28 years, technology has changed, as have our enemies. And from time to time, when requested by various administrations, we have made technical changes to FISA.  But the need to protect privacy rights by requiring individual warrants from a FISA judge, and the exclusivity of FISA, have remained constant.  The domestic electronic surveillance that has been conducted since October 2001 operates, for the most part, outside of the law. In addition, the way the administration has moved forward with this program has brought us to the brink of a constitutional confrontation.  The legislation that Senator Specter and I are introducing today brings the surveillance program under appropriate supervision and restores the checks and balances between the branches of government.  As one who has been briefed on the details of the NSA surveillance program, I have come to believe that this surveillance can be done, without sacrifice to our national security, through court-issued individualized warrants for all content collection of U.S. persons under the FISA process.  Further, testimony and letters from the Attorney General, former Director of the NSA General Hayden, and other administration officials have provided no reason, other than that of timeliness, why the NSA program couldn't proceed under the FISA regime.  This legislation would help transform the FISA process into one agile enough to meet the administration's need for timely action, while also preserving judicial oversight and our important constitutional privacy protections.  In an April 6 hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Gonzales openly suggested that warrants might have been obtainable for everything that the NSA is doing, and then testified that the main ``problem'' he saw with FISA was one of ``timing.''  After the Attorney General's testimony, I wrote to him asking him why these timing problems could not be addressed directly, so that we could return to the FISA process followed by all Presidents since Jimmy Carter.  The Justice Department's response does not provide a reason why FISA's timing problems are incapable of being fixed. All it demonstrates is that this administration is not interested in trying to fix them.  This bill addresses all of the concerns noted in the Attorney General's letter.  The primary concern raised was that current law requires the Attorney General to determine that FISA's factual predicates have been met before authorizing the surveillance to begin. In other words, he suggests that there isimportant surveillance he might delay, or even avoid, if he must determine in advance that a court will grant approval. But this bill eliminates the requirement for Attorney General approval before surveillance begins.  Under this bill, if the circumstances warrant, an Attorney General-designated supervisor of the NSA or FBI can begin emergency surveillance immediately. The designated officer would have to notify the Attorney General's office within 24 hours of starting, and then get approval from the AG within 72 hours. The Department of Justice would then need to obtain an emergency warrant from the FISA court within 7 days of the initiation of surveillance.  The Attorney General's role would simply be to decide whether to stop the surveillance--not authorize it on the front end. And even on this decision to stop surveillance, the bill allows him to delegate that decision to two other Department of Justice officials. If the Court does not issue a warrant, the information cannot be used in any legal proceeding.  This provision is respectful of the administration's needs. The 7-day emergency window in this bill more than doubles the existing 3-day period that exists for emergencies now. It also extends substantial additional resources to the Department of Justice and the intelligence agencies. And as I say, our bill expressly authorizes a designated agent to go ahead with necessary surveillance right away.  The Attorney General's letter also asserts that FISA is unworkable because prompt action increases the chance that the target of surveillance may ultimately be notified if the FISA Court later turns down the warrant.  The risk here is no different than the risk every prior Administration has faced. And it is also infinitesimal, since only a small handful of FISA applications--only 4 out of 18,747 from 1979-2005, according to press reports--have ever been refused by the FISA Court.  Even in the extremely rare case of where a FISA Court denies an emergency warrant, and therefore directs notification of the target of surveillance, the FISA law has a provision that exempts the Attorney General from notifying the target if he certifies that doing so would imperil national security.  Despite the remote chances of national security being compromised, the legislation gives the Attorney General the benefit of the doubt, and provides that if the Attorney General or his designees stops the NSA or FBI surveillance within 72 hours, the target of surveillance will not be notified.  Beyond the Attorney's General letter, the White House, the Department of Justice, and intelligence officials say that court review of the surveillance is not necessary for three reasons:  First, they argue that the President has the constitutional authority to order the surveillance, regardless of statutory prohibitions. This is a question for the courts to decide.  It is highly debatable whether the President has plenary article II constitutional power, but even if he does, he clearly does not have plenary authority to decide which of his powers are plenary. If he did, any Executive Branch official could open mail, or enter homes at any time without a warrant in the name of national security, and the doctrine of separation of powers as we know it would end.  Secondly, the administration argues that the NSA electronic surveillance program is subject to numerous reviews and safeguards at both the Department of Justice and the National Security Agency, thus making outside oversight unnecessary.  This argument flies in the face of our system of government. We have three separate branches of government, each with checks and balances on the other two. The framers of the Constitution did not vest the Executive Branch with the right to oversee itself; that is the responsibility of the Congress and the Courts.  We have also recently seen how this arrangement of internal reviews, even if it were acceptable, simply does not work. Within the Department of Justice, the Office of Professional Responsibility was recently asked to review the legality of the activities of those involved in the surveillance program outside of FISA, but we have learned that OPR was denied the security clearances needed to do their work.  Finally, as I noted before, the Executive Branch says that outside review by the Congress and the courts would hamstring their ability to prevent terrorist attacks. I do not believe that is true, based on the briefings I have received, but even if it were, the answer is to amend FISA, not to throw it out. The FISA law has been changed since September 11 through the PATRIOT Act and the renewal of the PATRIOT Act. It can be done again. In short, if the President sees problems with an existing law, the simple answer is that he should ask to change it--not refuse to follow the law.  This war on terror will be a long war, and it will be mostly fought in the shadows.  It is thus especially important that the Congress and the American people be assured that we are waging that war in a way that upholds our principles and follows the Constitution.  I believe that our national security and core privacy interests can both be protected, given the right tools and authorities, if each branch of government will work together to fulfill their respective roles and obligations.  Congress was able to do that more than 25 years ago when it first enacted FISA, and I am confident we can do it again today.  I have been waiting for the NSA to submit views regarding metadata--that is, information about communications that does not include content. It is my strong belief that any and all metadata collection programs should be approved by FISA on a program basis. I would hope to add such a provision to this bill at a later time or to introduce a new bill to cover this subject.                          ____________________
