President.  I strongly oppose this amendment. This amendment specifically singles out those who sell goods over the Internet for discrimination. It applies to one class of people and that is those who sell goods on the Internet. The amendment would impose on those sellers of goods on the Internet a new requirement that would not be imposed on someone who sells goods over the phone or someone who mails the goods when they get a check.  Now, let's picture the kind of person who is going to be hurt by this amendment. My State, the State of the Presiding Officer of the Senate, has 100,000 home-based businesses. These are some of the most exciting businesses in the country coming up with new products. They are small. They are entrepreneurial. If this amendment passes, those 100,000 home-based businesses in Oregon--and there are thousands and thousands of other home-based businesses across the country in States that we all represent--they, and only they, will be subject to this new requirement.  This amendment seeks to do what the Internet tax freedom bill seeks to prevent. Our legislation is about technological neutrality. We should treat the Internet like we treat everything else. It shouldn't get a preference. It shouldn't be discriminated against. But if you read section (a) of this amendment, you will see that it applies requirements to one class of people, and one class of people only. Those are individuals who sell goods over the Internet.  This is discriminatory. This does what our legislation seeks to prevent. Those who vote for the amendment, in my view, in this Senator's view, are fostering the kind of policy that is going to lead to selective and discriminatory activity against those who sell goods through the World Wide Web.  I yield back my time, Mr. President.
