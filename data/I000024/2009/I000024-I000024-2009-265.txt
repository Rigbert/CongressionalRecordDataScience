President, there has been a lot of discussion and complaints about there not being enough funds in terms of infrastructure--roads and buildings and all that. Actually, it is under 4 percent in this bill. We have talked about that. What we have not talked about is the need for military procurement.  In a Washington Post article, Martin Feldstein talked about the fact that infrastructure spending on domestic military bases and procurement is one of the things we could do that would be very helpful, citing there are 655,000 employees in the aerospace industry alone.  Now, what I am trying to do with this amendment is to increase procurement by $5.3 billion. It is offset. So you have a decision: Do you want to spend $20 million for fish passage barrier removal, $34 million to renovate the Department of Commerce, or have a strong national defense? Do you want to spend $13 million to research volunteer activities or have a strong national defense?
