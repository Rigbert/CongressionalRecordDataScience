President, today we made an important step forward for the hope of millions of patients and their families.  Unfortunately, with this important step forward, there was also a small step backward.  I had initially stated that I would vote in favor of S. 30, but after carefully reviewing the language, I decided to vote against it.  I will ask to have printed in the Record a letter from the Joint Steering Committee on Public Policy that supports S. 5 and opposes S. 30.  The Joint Committee is a group made up of the American Society for Cell Biology, the American Society for Clinical Investigation, the Genetics Society of America, Science Service, and the Society for Neuroscience.  Many of us here believed that S. 30 was a harmless bill.  After all, it is an initiative that would show we are supportive of all forms of embryonic stem cell research.  And I believe that some still feel that way.  But after hearing from a variety of research organizations and scientists, I have serious reservations.  After carefully reviewing the legislation, it is now clear that S. 30 sends the wrong message to the scientific community.  S. 30 puts forth a number of scientific issues that negatively position the scientific debate around what constitutes life and death and raises concepts that may not even be scientifically defined.  As elected officials discussing complex science issues, we are already in somewhat unfamiliar territory.  If we are to delve deeper into this discussion and the details of it, we need the scientific community on our side.  I stand for the advancement of medical research and I hope that this vote has made it clear.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the aforementioned letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                          Joint Steering Committee                                            for Public Policy,                                      Bethesda, MD, April 9, 2007.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Senate Majority Leader,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Reid: On behalf of the Joint Steering      Committee for Public Policy (JSCPP), I would like to express      our support for S. 5, the ``Stem Cell Research Enhancement      Act of 2007.'' S. 5 would expand the current federal policy      regarding federally funded embryonic stem cell research to      allow the use of cells derived since August, 2001, from      embryos originally generated for reproductive purposes that      would otherwise be destroyed.       I would also like to express the JSCPP's opposition to S.      30, the ``Hope Offered through Principled and Ethical Stem      Cell Research Act.'' The purpose of S. 30 is to ``promote the      derivation of pluripotent stem cell lines without the      creation of human embryos for research purposes and without      the destruction, discarding of, or risk of injury to a human      embryo or embryos other than those that are naturally dead.''       S. 5 represents an important step forward for human      embryonic stem cell research, a new field that offers great      promise for the replacement of damaged cells, the      understanding of the mechanics of disease, and the      development and testing of new drugs. Unfortunately, current      federal policy, in place since 2001, has not kept pace with      the speed of scientific discovery and is today of limited      value to the scientific community, a position endorsed by the      Director of the National Institutes of Health, Elias      Zerhouni, at a recent Senate appropriations hearing.       While the JSCPP is supportive of S. 5, we strongly oppose      S. 30. S. 30 is proposed as an alternative to S. 5, but      contains no substantial measure to reverse current      limitations on embryonic stem cell research and simply      endorses research avenues that are already open under current      law. We oppose the bill because it contains unnecessary      provisions and places confusing and short-sighted      restrictions on biomedical research.       The prohibitions in S. 30 against the use of government      funds to derive stem cells with methods that generate embryos      for research purposes or that involve the destruction of      embryos are unnecessary, because the annual Departments of      Labor, Health & Human Services and Education Appropriations      bill has, for many years, included the same prohibitions.       Furthermore, the central provision of S. 30 appears to      allow research on embryos considered to be ``naturally      dead.'' We are particularly concerned about this requirement      because the term ``naturally dead'' is not a scientific term,      and there are no scientific or clinical standards for      determining the quality of embryos at the early stages of      embryonic development.       We are also concerned about the provision in S. 30 that      requires a priority to be placed on research ``with the      greatest potential for near-term clinical benefit.'' Not only      is it impossible to know the benefits of research in advance,      but limiting the scope of research in this way places a      muzzle on the scientific process, placing short-term      incremental advances ahead of the more challenging goals of      preventing or curing diseases such as diabetes.       For these reasons, we believe that passage of S. 30 would      be a significant step backwards for human embryonic stem cell      research and for biomedical research in America. Therefore,      we urge a ``yea'' vote on S. 5 and a ``no'' vote on S. 30.           Sincerely,                                            Harold Varmus, MD,                                   Chair, Joint Steering Committee                                                for Public Policy.
