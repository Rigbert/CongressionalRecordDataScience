 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Lloyd Redman on the occasion of a special recognition of his commitment to Kentucky's youth.  Lloyd Redman has led a life that is certainly worthy of recognition. First and foremost, Lloyd is a dedicated family man. He and his wife of 55 years, Loretta, are the proud parents of two children, who have blessed them with three grandchildren and one great grandchild.  Lloyd also is a tried and true Kentuckian. He grew up in Kentucky and played basketball and football at Okalona High School. After high school Lloyd played football for Western Kentucky University and the University of Louisville, where he received a bachelor of science degree in 1949, and a masters degree in 1955. Lloyd's football talent also earned him a place on the 1944 U.S. Navy team. Lloyd was skilled at baseball too, and served as captain of the U of L baseball team in 1949. He gave a great deal of his time and energy playing and coaching sports in Kentucky. Lloyd has coached at Okalona High School, Southern High School, and Durrett High School and was named ``Jefferson County Football Coach of the Year'' in 1959. He also coached football, basketball and softball at The Cabbage Patch for eleven years. Lloyd currently works with the Cabbage Patch Settlement House in Louisville to help provide athletic, arts and educational programs for children.  While Lloyd obviously loves youth athletics, he is equally as concerned for the educational well-being of Kentucky's children. He received administration certification from Eastern Kentucky University in 1962, and served in numerous administrative positions within the Jefferson County school system including director of adult education and administrative problems, assistant and associate superintendent, and he currently serves as a consultant at the Kentucky State Department of Education.  Lloyd Redman has had a positive influence on Kentucky's youth throughout his many years as administrator, coach, and mentor--and I am certain his concern for and service to the community and its children will not end here. Lloyd, on behalf of my colleagues and myself, thank you for your service and congratulations on your worthy efforts.                          ____________________
