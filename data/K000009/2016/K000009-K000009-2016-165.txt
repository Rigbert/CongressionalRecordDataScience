Speaker, I rise today in this season of thanksgiving when we are especially grateful for family and friends to pay tribute to one such friend, The Honorable David A. Katz. Judge Katz passed from this life during the summer on July 26, 2016.  A justice with the United States District Court, Northern District of Ohio, Judge Katz was appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1994 and had served on senior status since 2005. His tenure was marked by strong jurisprudence and included his tireless perseverance of a new federal courthouse in Toledo. A highly regarded and well respected jurist, the flags flew at half staff the day after his death to honor his public service. In issuing the order, chief judge for the Northern District of Ohio Solomon Oliver, Jr. summed up Judge Katz' service most succinctly when he stated, ``Judge Katz' contribution to our court has been immeasurable. He came to the court with a keen sense of fairness and a very large dose of common sense. He could always be counted on. He was highly respected by the lawyers in the community. Though he had many strengths, one of his greatest was his ability to resolve complex cases involving multiple parties. As Chief Judge, I often sought and received his wise counsel. Every judge on our court highly valued David's friendship. We will all miss him greatly.''  David Katz was born in Toledo to parents Ruth and Samuel Katz and raised in Findlay, Ohio. He married Joan Siegel in 1955. He graduated from Ohio State University's College of Law in 1957. He began private practice with the Toledo firm of Spengler Nathanson where he ably practiced until his judicial appointment. Strong in his faith and proud of his Jewish heritage, Judge Katz gave of his time and talents to the Toledo Jewish Community Foundation, where the David A. Katz Philanthropic Fund was established.  Even with all of the public accolades, Judge Katz' proudest and most important achievement was his family. A family man to his core, he cherished his wife, their children, grandchildren and great-granddaughter above all else. Though a public man and elder statesman whose imprimatur is writ large through the decisions he rendered and his contributions to our community, his true legacy is given to his family. As his family and friends remember Judge David A. Katz in thanksgiving for his life, we recall the words in the poem by Sylvan Kamens & Rabbi Jack Riemer, entitled We Remember Them.     At the rising sun and at its going down; We remember them.     At the blowing of the wind and in the chill of winter; We            remember them.     At the opening of the buds and in the rebirth of spring; We            remember them.     At the blueness of the skies and in the warmth of summer; We            remember them.     At the rustling of the leaves and in the beauty of the            autumn; We remember them.     At the beginning of the year and when it ends; We remember            them.     As long as we live, they too will live, for they are now a            part of us as We remember them.     When we are weary and in need of strength; We remember them.     When we are lost and sick at heart; We remember them.     When we have decisions that are difficult to make; We            remember them.     When we have joy we crave to share; We remember them.     When we have achievements that are based on theirs; We            remember them.     For as long as we live, they too will live, for they are now            a part of us as, We remember them.                            ____________________
