 President, I rise to address Senators Lautenberg and Corzine's proposed amendment to the budget resolution. Superfund and the cleanup of pollution sites should be an important concern to all of us. We must be concerned that our future generations are not jeopardized by past inactions. But this amendment has been offered in an inapproprate forum, at an inappropriate place, using an inappropriate procedural method and I have voted no. As chairman of the Finance Committee, we will be able to consider this issue under more appropriate circumstances.
