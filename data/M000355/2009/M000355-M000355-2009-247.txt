 On top of their success in business, Don and Mira should be commended for the good work they have done on behalf of their community. They have supported several community initiatives, including the Hope Center that helps at-risk and homeless individuals get the stability and the help they need to improve their lives. I am proud to have joined them in support of this and other efforts for the good of everyone in their city and surrounding region.  I know all of my colleagues will join me in recognizing Don and Mira for all they have done for the Lexington community, and for 50 years of Ball Homes.  I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, Aug. 9, 2009]       Homeseller: Ball Homes Is Celebrating 50 Years in Business                          (By Melissa Nipper)       Now Central Kentucky's largest home builder, Ball Homes was      incorporated in 1959 by Don and Mira Ball. Today, the company      is still family owned and operated by Don and Mira and their      three children. Ray Ball is the president, and siblings Mike      Ball and Lisa Ball Sharp serve as vice presidents.       Ball Homes has built thousands of affordable houses in      Kentucky neighborhoods over the last five decades. Every year      since 1998, BUILDER magazine has named Ball Homes one of the      top 100 builders of single-family homes in the nation.       While the Ball name is usually associated with home      building, the family is also deeply ingrained in the      community, supporting organizations such as Habitat for      Humanity, the Hope Center, Virginia Place and many others.      Many of their efforts promote home ownership, helping people      overcome obstacles to the American Dream.       ``We are glad that our children see the value of the family      business and that what we do is not just to make a living,''      Mira said. ``We are building affordable homes that people can      be proud of. We love this community, all of us do, and I      don't think there's a better place to be.''                          A STRONG FOUNDATION       Don and Mira met while attending the University of      Kentucky. Don was a pre-law student and worked part time      distributing brochures for a builder. The couple married in      1955 and four years later started their business. They share      fond memories of the early days.       ``I remember when Don had his real estate license, we moved      13 times in two and a half years,'' Mira said. ``We would      find a house that was marketable, fix it up, sell it and buy      a new one. That enabled us to get started. Don used to say      that our furniture was on wheels.''       Ball Homes started targeting the first-time home buyers and      over the years evolved into a company that builds for the      ``total market,'' Mira said.       ``I guess the biggest change is, back then we were building      houses for $10,950,'' Don said. ``Now the lots cost more than      that.''       One thing that hasn't changed is that Ball Homes has always      been a family affair. Don and Mira never pushed the home-     building business on their children. But from his earliest      days, Ray remembers coming to the office with his parents.      And of course, there were always summer jobs to be had for      the Ball siblings.       ``I think (the family business) says a lot about the way      our parents raised us,'' said Lisa, who focuses on Ball      Homes' sales, marketing and customer relations. ``They      weren't in any way overpowering, but they gave us moral      lessons and giving back to the community was just inherent in      the way they live.''                        A BLUEPRINT FOR SUCCESS       So how does a builder remain successful for five decades--     throughout a continuously evolving market, constant changes      in technology and even during economic downturns and      recessions?       Like all businesses, Ball Homes has had its share of      challenges. The toughest time for the company was in the      1980's, when mortgage interest rates soared to 22 percent.      The family had to develop creative products and financing to      weather the hard times. ``And of course, it helped us that      that period was a relatively short duration,'' Don said.       The family has never been afraid to try new ideas and adapt      to the marketplace. In the early 1990s, Ball Homes expanded      its product line, offering more styles of homes in a wider      variety of price ranges.       They also stretched their base into surrounding communities      of Versailles, Paris, Richmond, and Frankfort. The company      also builds in Louisville, and in 2008 was ranked      Louisville's No. 1 home builder by BUILDER magazine.       In recent years, the builder has incorporated energy-     efficient materials and technology into all of its homes. New      Ball Homes meet Energy Star qualifications. (The Energy Star      designation signifies that a home meets strict energy      efficiency guidelines set by the U.S. Environmental      Protection Agency.)       ``People may say they don't build (homes) like they used      to,'' Mira said. ``Well, today we do so much more with energy      efficiency and we build them better than we used to.''       Ball Homes has several ongoing projects, including the      Chilesburg community which features a six-home model village      where home buyers can see a variety of floor plans and      amenities in one location.       They recently opened another model home village at their      newest development, Glasford. Located in Lexington on the      outer loop of Man O' War Boulevard between Tates Creek and      Nicholasville roads, Glasford offers 30 floor plans and many      luxury options, including beautiful tilework, built-in book      cases and crown molding, chair rail and wainscoting packages      in formal living and dining rooms.                            A BRIGHT FUTURE       Innovative products, careful planning and great employees      helped make Ball Homes what it has become over the past 50      years. However, Ball family members say their success and      future depend on the most important component of their      business--the customers, many of whom are living in their      second and even third-generation Ball Home.       ``One of the keys to our success in the environment is that      we are recognized as a company that has been here many years,      and we will remain here,'' Ray said. ``We just try to take      care of the customer and offer a good product in good      locations.''                          ____________________
