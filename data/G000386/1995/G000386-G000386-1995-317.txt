 President, I am pleased to join the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, and my other distinguished colleagues in cosponsoring this resolution to amend the Constitution of the United States to grant Congress and the States the power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States.  Let me state from the outset, as I have stated before, this amendment will merely restore the power to Congress and the States to prohibit flag desecration--a power that we believe they have always had.  Unfortunately, the Supreme Court incorrectly interpreted the Constitution's first amendment. The Court failed to discern the difference between protected speech, and an act--a type of hate crime of physical desecration of the flag.  Therefore, our amendment does not tamper or tinker with the Constitution's Bill of Rights that protects speech.  But, Mr. President, for argument's sake, assume this amendment does tamper with the speech clause.  Let us ask ourselves a question. If we had to choose, should we amend the speech clause to: protect the American flag from acts of desecration; or protect our reelection to office by restricting the right of voters to hear words of opposition and opponents to speak against us--the incumbents?  I regret, Mr. President, that too many Senators have sided with incumbent protection instead of flag protection.  Remember, the Senate in 1990 fell 9 votes short of the 67 needed to pass a flag protection amendment to the Constitution because, by and large, it was argued that there is something very special, and untouchable about the speech clause.  Mr. President, you may be astonished to learn that 28 of the 42 Senators who voted against amending the speech clause to protect the American flag, had either sponsored, cosponsored, or voted to facilitate the passage of a constitutional amendment pegged the ``incumbent protection bill.''  This speech clause amendment was aimed at overturning the Supreme Court's Buckley versus Valeo decision. The Court said the first amendment speech clause is violated by restrictions on money used on political communication during campaigns.  So while these Senators supported incumbent protection, they strongly opposed flag protection.  Had only 9 of these 28 Senators had their priorities straight, the Senate would have passed the flag protection amendment 5 years ago.  And let us keep in mind, during the 200 years following 1789, over 10,000 constitutional amendments were introduced to the various Congresses.  In fact, in 1990, 525 out of 535 U.S. Representatives and Senators had sponsored or cosponsored amendments to the Constitution for everything under the Sun--from ERA to D.C. statehood.  So, the fact is, a vast majority of Congressmen and Senators do support amending the Constitution.  And more to the point at hand, many of those 28 Senators--who were happy to amend the speech clause to protect their incumbency, but joined in killing an amendment to protect the American flag--are still serving in the 104th Congress.  Mr. President, in fact, enough are still serving, that if they would change their priorities and their votes, this time our efforts to pass an amendment to protect the American flag will succeed.                          ____________________
