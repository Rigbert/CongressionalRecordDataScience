President, I rise today to pay special tribute to the Committee of 200, a distinguished professional women's organization headquartered in my home State, on the occasion of its 15th anniversary the week beginning October 20.  The Committee of 200 is dedicated to promoting entrepreneurship and corporate leadership among women of this generation and the next. The committee is comprised of 370 members from the United States and abroad, representing 70 different industries. Each member is an accomplished businesswoman, including entrepreneurs whose companies generate annual revenue of $10 million or greater and U.S. corporate executives who manage divisions that produce more than $50 million in annual revenue.  Recognizing the needs of young women who will soon be entering the business world, the Committee of 200 established a foundation in 1986 to enhance its outreach activities. This foundation provides important assistance and scholarships for women business students and provides grants to foster entrepreneurship among young women.  The Committee of 200 exemplifies the spirit of American business, promoting entrepreneurship, corporate innovation, and community awareness. It supports the careers of young women by giving them the tools to complete effectively in an intensely competitive environment.  Mr. President, the Committee of 200 has provided critical support services over the last 15 years to business leaders and business students. It has distinguished itself as a preeminent professional organization for women. I am confident that over the next 15 years, the committee will continue to be a credit to American businesses and women corporate leaders. I want to congratulate all the members of the Committee of 200 as they celebrate this important milestone in the organization's history.                          ____________________
