 President, I only hope Mr. Hamre understands my position on this issue.  From day one, I have merely tried to hold him accountable for the improper progress payment policy.  I do my best to watchdog the Pentagon.  And when the IG tells me something is wrong, then I'm going to speak out. I'm going to dig and bore in--until things are right.  That's what I did in this case.  I believe that together we have crafted a constructive solution to this problem.  I thank the committee for its leadership and for helping me resolve this issue.
