 The majority leader has other important matters he would like the Senate to turn to after Tuesday. That is his decision.  What I suggest to both of the Senators, who have been waiting patiently, is to describe the amendment that would have been offered had the Senator been given an opportunity to do so, and put that in the Record. Maybe at some point between now and Tuesday, there will be some change of heart. But I think we ought to say to the Senate what the Senator wanted to be able to do had he been permitted.
