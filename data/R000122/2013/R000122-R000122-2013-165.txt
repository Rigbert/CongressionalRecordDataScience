President, first, let me commend the Senator from Illinois for a very thoughtful statement about the pending appropriations bill, particularly with respect to the funding of the Department of Defense.  I wish to spend a moment to talk about another looming issue that is beyond appropriations but is rapidly approaching.  In June of last year, as we commemorated the 40th anniversary of legislation to establish the Pell Grant Program, we narrowly averted a doubling of the interest rate on need-based student loans.  Back in January of 2012, Congressman Courtney and I introduced legislation to permanently extend the 3.4-percent interest rate that has helped make college loans more affordable for millions of students across the country. But my colleagues on the other side of the aisle instead voted for budgets that effectively called for the doubling of the rate.
