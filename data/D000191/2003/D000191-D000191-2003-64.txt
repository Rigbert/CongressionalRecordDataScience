  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I have heard about the sweetheart deals andthe war profiteering in the rebuilding of Iraq, the billions that are being wasted, but how are the troops doing over there on the ground? Not so well, it turns out. Thirty to 40,000 of our troops cannot get $500 pieces of body armor. They are working with flak vests from the Vietnam era which will not stop an AK-47 bullet. We have Humvees with canvas side curtains. Some of our troops are being sent over there with jungle camouflage. We cannot afford that desert camouflage.  How is it with the buildup for months by this administration, a $380 Pentagon budget, $80 billion appropriated by Congress last April for this war, that the Bush administration, Secretary Rumsfeld in all of his great wisdom, could not have thought to buy our young men and women body armor, to give them armored Humvees, to get them desert fatigues, boots and sidearms that work, and other critical supplies? They said we just cannot afford it, we need more money, then maybe we will give the young men and women what they need.  Mr. Speaker, they can find that money. It is about 2 minutes' spending at the Pentagon.                          ____________________
