President, for the information of all Senators, tomorrow at 9:45 a.m., the Senate will vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the intelligence reform bill. We have made good progress on the bill, disposing of dozens of amendments. It is my hope that cloture will be invoked tomorrow morning so that we can move toward final action on the bill. For the remainder of the bill, the Senate will work through additional amendments to the bill. Senators should, therefore, expect rollcall votes throughout the day tomorrow.  Finally, I remind everyone of the majority leader's announcement that following the conclusion of this bill, the Senate will begin consideration of the intelligence reforms related to the organization of the Senate.                          ____________________
