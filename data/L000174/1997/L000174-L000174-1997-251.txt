Wellstone, Mr. Levin, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Dodd) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Environment and Public Works:                            S. Con. Res. 28       Whereas there has been a two-to-threefold global increase      in mercury in the environment since the 1850's, increases of      3 times have been found in wilderness areas of the United      States, and much higher increases have been found in      developed areas of the United States;       Whereas mercury is truly a State, national, and      international concern because mercury is atmospherically      transported indiscriminately across political boundaries;       Whereas atmospheric deposition resulting from human      activities, including area sources, waste incineration and      disposal, and fossil fuel burning contributes to mercury      loading in the environment;       Whereas mercury is a persistent bioaccumulative toxic      substance that presents particular problems in aquatic      systems;       Whereas fish consumption advisories have been issued for at      least 1,500 water bodies in 37 States, including Vermont,      because of high levels of mercury contamination in fish,      resulting in losses to tourism and fishing industries and      related activities;       Whereas, according to estimates by the Administrator of the      Environmental Protection Agency, each year in the United      States between 80,000 and 85,000 pregnant women are exposed      to mercury levels high enough to produce risk to their      children;       Whereas the study of mercury required under section      112(n)(1)(B) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7412(n)(1)(B)),      required to be completed by November 15, 1994, represents the      best information in the world on the use, generation, and      disposal of mercury;       Whereas the Administrator of the Environmental Protection      Agency effectively completed the draft report in 1995, but      has continually delayed submittal of the study to Congress;       Whereas there are known substitutes for most mercury-     containing products and devices, except for high-efficiency      lighting;       Whereas over 500,000,000 mercury-containing lamps are      annually produced in the United States, representing one of      the largest sources of mercury in municipal waste streams,      and typical waste management practices involve compaction,      which results in mercury releases, before and during      disposal;       Whereas landfill air emissions test data for mercury is      lacking;       Whereas the Administrator of the Environmental Protection      Agency is establishing simultaneously maximum achievable      control technologies for mercury sources pursuant to the      Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), proposing tightening      water quality criteria for mercury under the Federal Water      Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), placing      priority on mercury-contaminated superfund sites, but is      proposing to exempt mercury-containing lamps from hazardous      waste regulations;       Whereas the United States and Canada have jointly agreed in      the Agreement on Air Quality, Agreement on Great Lakes Water      Quality, 1978, and Agreement on Virtual Elimination of      Persistent Toxic Substances in the Great Lakes Basin to      control transboundary emissions and to cooperate on research      and development projects to eliminate toxic substances,      including mercury; and       Whereas Federal and State governments have taken many      actions to reduce mercury in the environment: Now, therefore,      be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring),     SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS.       It is the sense of Congress that the Administrator of the      Environmental Protection Agency should--       (1) immediately release to Congress the study of mercury      required under section 112(n)(1)(B) of the Clean Air Act (42      U.S.C. 7412(n)(1)(B));       (2) initiate a pilot program for landfill air emission      tests for mercury in the Northeast and nationally; and       (3) not exempt mercury-containing lamps from hazardous      waste regulations, but should instead adopt universal waste      rules that foster mercury recycling.
