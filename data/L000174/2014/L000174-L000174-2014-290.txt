 Tough decisions in Washington have led many with the means to increase their charitable giving, but none compare to the generosity of David Rubenstein, businessman, family man, philanthropist. He is also a friend to many. But most importantly, he is a friend to many of America's national treasures. I cherish his friendship.  You need not walk far in Washington to find Mr. Rubenstein's mark. I hear often from Vermonters who have come to Washington, for work or a family vacation, who visit such iconic places as the National Zoo, the Kennedy Center, the Library of Congress, and, of course, the Smithsonians. All bear some sign of Mr. Rubenstein's generosity.  The New York Times recently featured a profile of this man and what he calls ``patriotic giving.'' I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that profile be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordred to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Feb. 21, 2014]  A Billionaire Philanthropist in Washington Who's Big on ``Patriotic                                 Giving''                        (By Jennifer Steinhauer)       Washington.--The expansive reach of David M. Rubenstein      into the public life of the nation's capital can be seen      during a brief excursion from his downtown office at the      Carlyle Group , the private equity firm that he co-founded      and that made him a billionaire.       Begin across the street at the National Archives, the site      of the new gallery, named after him, where Magna Carta, which      he bought in 2007 for $23 million, is on permanent loan. Then      head to the Library of Congress, and see the first map of the      United States, also his, in the Great Hall.       Make your way to the earthquake-damaged Washington      Monument, which will reopen this spring after a $15 million      repair, half paid for by Mr. Rubenstein, then zip to the John      F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, where his $75      million has bought, among other things, a new pipe organ. End      up at the National Zoo, where baby Bao Bao frolics in the      panda habitat Mr. Rubenstein endowed, part of a $7 million      Smithsonian gift.       Over the years, Mr. Rubenstein, who has a fortune estimated      at $3 billion, has made gifts to the usual array of      universities, hospitals and cultural organizations beloved by      wealthy donors. But he stands nearly alone in shoring up      institutions generally under the purview of the federal      government. About $200 million of the $300 million he has      given away has been what he calls ``patriotic giving.''       ``The United States cannot afford to do the things it used      to do,'' Mr. Rubenstein said, ``and I think it would be a      good thing if more people would say: 'My national zoo needs      money, the archives need money. I think we're going to have      to do more for them.' ''       And there is plenty more to do in a city that has not only      suffered from cutbacks in federal spending but which      historically has lacked both the wealth and the philanthropic      traditions of places like New York. While there were wealthy      and civic-minded men like Duncan Phillips and Eugene Meyer      who left their mark on Washington in the last century, it was      the federal government that built and maintained the parks      and museums that in other cities donors endowed, according to      Steven Pearlstein, a professor of public and international      affairs at George Mason University and a columnist for The      Washington Post. ``The federal government was the sugar      daddy,'' he said.       For the most part, according to Mr. Pearlstein, Washington      has been a place where the currency has been power more than      money. In the past two decades, that has begun to change as      government contracting, banking and the law have created a      new wealthy class in the city and its suburbs, but no one has      given his money away quite like Mr. Rubenstein.       ``This kind of giving is starting to happen more often      because governments are really suffering,'' said Stacy      Palmer, the editor of The Chronicle of Philanthropy. ``But      the extent of Rubenstein's giving sets him apart.''       Such giving, she said, is a subject of feverish debate in      the philanthropy world, where many believe that private money      should not permit government to abdicate responsibilities and      in turn drain cash from food banks, hospitals and other      services in need. There are ``concerns about whether it is a      good idea for philanthropy to step in for government,'' Ms.      Palmer said.       Mr. Rubenstein, 64, who first came to Washington to work in      government, offers a simple explanation for what he has done:      ``I felt I owed my country a lot. I also felt I owed the city      a lot. I built my company here; I met my wife here.''       He grew up in modest means in Baltimore; his father sorted      mail for the Postal Service and his mother was a homemaker.      After college and law school, he worked in a New York law      firm before getting a job on Capitol Hill for the Senate      Judiciary Committee. In 1977, he joined the Carter      administration, where he spent his days toiling over domestic      policy as a White House aide, and met his wife, Alice Rogoff,      who worked at the Office of Management and Budget. Newsweek      once called him ``the White House workaholic.''       After his stint ended, Mr. Rubenstein took another      corporate law job but reassessed and concluded that he was      ``a mediocre lawyer.'' With some partners, he set out to      found Carlyle, named after the hotel in New York City,      quickly accruing a fortune in the world of leveraged buyouts.       Ten years ago, Mr. Rubenstein said, he began to consider      his legacy, and after learning from some actuarial tables      that white Jewish males were likely to live to 81, decided to      start plowing a lot of his money--and his time--into      philanthropic causes. ``There are other wonderful donors in      Washington,'' said Michael M. Kaiser, president of the      Kennedy Center, ``but it's the range of his giving and his      collection of interests that is staggering.''       In choosing his beneficiaries, Mr. Rubenstein relies on his      interests and his gut. He has a passion for American history      and can lecture extemporaneously and at length about      presidents, historic documents, the civil rights movement and      beyond--and has no staff or foundation to vet requests.       He spends little time agonizing over a donation. ``To some      extent when you've made the money, you feel you can give it      away more rapidly,'' he said.       In January 2013, Curt Viebranz, the president of George      Washington's Mount Vernon, took Mr. Rubenstein around the      museum to show him how it had displayed some of his      documents.       Over lunch, Mr. Viebranz recalled: ``I felt emboldened to      ask him for a large gift, and much to my surprise and      happiness, he made that $10 million gift in February. It was      a remarkably efficient process.'' He added, ``It can take      years of cultivating a donor to get a gift of that size.''       If you don't call Mr. Rubenstein, he might call you. If you      do ``make the ask,'' expect to get an answer in weeks. While      Mr. Rubenstein likes to see results--and despite his      unassuming manner, is not averse to seeing his name on the      doors of his beneficiaries--he does not use the complex      success metrics of philanthropists like Eli Broad in Los      Angeles. He tends not to check in, but if beneficiaries send      an update, they hear back from him, no matter his time zone      (he travels roughly 250 days a year).       The donations can be transformative. Mr. Rubenstein will      endow the expansion of the Kennedy Center, which otherwise      would have had to go to Congress for an appropriation. At      Monticello, his $10 million gift allowed Leslie Greene      Bowman, president of the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, as she      puts it, ``to return the mountaintop of Monticello to      something Jefferson would have recognized in just a few years      what I would venture to say would have taken at least a      decade to accomplish.''       Mr. Rubenstein says he likes to apply the ``mother      standard'' to giving. ``When I built Carlyle, my mother      didn't call to say, `I'm so proud,' he said. ``When I give a      gift to some place of importance, she calls and says, `I'm      proud.'
