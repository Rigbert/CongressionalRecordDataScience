Look at that drop, that fall off of the cliff of the birth rates for unmarried teens. Imagine if we went back to this program, to reauthorize it, as the governors have asked, and I think we have a strong bipartisan majority, certainly both in our Committee on Education and the Workforce and the Committee on Energy and Commerce, the committee we both serve on, but in this Congress as well, and imagine if we saw this program come to the brink of whether it gets reauthorized or not, something that all of us want, and somehow this program for abstinence was not included, despite the numbers showing the very positive effects of having this program included. Imagine if we just said no, we are not going to do that and then watched those numbers then rise.  Now, the jury is still out. We will see what the Congress does, this side as well as the other side of the Capitol, but imagine if all of a sudden we do not do it and the numbers go back up. Think of the impact on those kids that the gentleman and I see every day and of those families in virtually every single community across the country. I do not know that I could vote for a bill without this program.
