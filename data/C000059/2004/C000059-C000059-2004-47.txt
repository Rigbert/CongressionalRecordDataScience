Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Riverside County, CA, are exceptional. We have been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give of their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Mischelle Townsend is one of these individuals.  Mischelle Townsend has lived and worked in the Inland Empire most of her life. Today she retires from public service, where she will be greatly missed.  Mischelle Townsend came to Riverside County after five years working with the aerospace industry, North American Rockwell Corporation, including direct support of the Apollo Project. She then entered the public sector, where her time and talent has been vital to the growth of the Inland Empire. She has a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Redlands and a Masters in Public Administration from California State University, San Bernardino.  Twenty-two years Riverside County has been privileged to have Mischelle Townsend, as the Executive Officer of the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO). LAFCO is a state regulatory commission responsible for jurisdictional changes such as the incorporation of new cities, annexations and formation of new special districts. Under Mischelle's tenure at this agency, three cities where established in seven years: Moreno Valley, La Quinta and Cathedral City.  Mischelle Townsend later served six years as Assistant Chief Administrator Officer, where her responsibilities included: preparation of Riverside County's annual budget, development of policy recommendations from 33 county departments and agencies, administration of an $18 million Special District Augmentation Fund, preparation of the annual Capital Improvements Program, and chairmanship of various task forces and policy advisory committees.  She then moved onto Director of Riverside County's General Services Agency and eventually moved into her current position as Registrar of Voters on July 31, 1997. As Registrar of Voters, Mischelle has been widely recognized as an innovator in modern election services.  Outside of the office, Mischelle has been equally giving of her talents. Her community involvement includes, but is not limited to: President of the Executive Council for the American Society for Public Administration (ASPA/Inland Empire); Vice President/Volunteer Personnel for the Inland Empire Chapter of the Boy Scouts of America; past member of the Board of Directors for Alternatives to Domestic Violence; Soroptomist International of Riverside; and, active member of Crossroads Christian Church.  Mr. Speaker, Mischelle Townsend's tireless passion for her profession and community has contributed immensely to the betterment of the Inland Empire, California. She has been the heart and soul of many innovative projects and events and I am proud to call her a fellow community member, American, and friend. I know that the community is equally grateful for her service and salute her as she retires from professional service.                          ____________________
