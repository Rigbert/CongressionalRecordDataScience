President, all night long? Well, that is going to be fun.  By the way, the Oklahoma City Thunders are not playing tonight, so we may get a few more viewers.  It is nice to look over and see probably the most articulate and knowledgeable of all of the alarmists historically as our newest Senator from Massachusetts, Ed Markey.  You can be good friends and still disagree. The Senator from Rhode Island certainly knows that because we had a little disagreement last week. The Senator from California certainly knows this as well.  We have been working on this for a long time. This started with the Kyoto Treaty. I think most people have forgotten about that. During the Clinton-Gore administration, Gore came back from Rio de Janeiro and said we are all going to die from global warming. I will say that he knows what he is doing. The New York Times speculated that Al Gore is very likely the first environmental billionaire in existence, so I guess he knows what he is doing there.  In spite of the fact of what has happened recently, I think it is probably necessary to have something all night, something to get the attention of the American people, because they keep saying--and I hear it over and over--climate change is real, global warming is real; it is real; it is real; it is real. If you say it enough times, then people are going to think it is real.  Tonight, all night long, you can say ``it is real, it is real, it is real,'' but I think people have heard that before and times have changed. A couple of things have happened, and I know a lot of you regret this.  I remember so well when Lisa Jackson was the Administrator of the EPA.  I have often said some very good things about her, even though she is very liberal and I am ranked most of the time as the most conservative Member of the Senate. Yet when she is asked a direct question, she always comes out with an honest answer.  I asked my good friend Senator Markey just a few minutes ago, who was there--first of all, let me say the United Nations started all this stuff. They have one big annual party, and it is usually in very nice places. I think at last count 190 countries were there. I remember talking to one of my good friends from one of the sub-Saharan African countries who was there with his administration. I said: You don't believe this stuff, do you?  He said: No, but this is one of the biggest parties of the year.  One of the big parties in 2009 was Copenhagen. They set a record of how cold it was in Copenhagen. I remember that very well. I remember at that time--and I hope I get this right because we had several people from the administration. We had at that time Senator John Kerry, of course, Congressman Ed Markey, Nancy Pelosi, and President Obama, who was Senator Obama at that time--no, he was already President at that time. Their job was to convince the 191 other countries that were in Copenhagen that we in the United States were going to pass some type of real cap and trade legislation.  So we had a hearing. At that time I think the Republicans were in control. But I said to Lisa Jackson: I am going to go to Copenhagen tomorrow to be a one-man truth squad. Everybody has been there talking about what we are going to do here in the United States and somebody has to tell them thetruth. So I said: I have a feeling when I leave tomorrow, you are going to have a declaration and when you do, it has to be based on some type of science. I could tell by looking at her that they were going to have the endangerment finding.  I ask my friend if he remembers that, the endangerment finding.  Anyway, I left the next morning for Copenhagen, and that afternoon they had the endangerment finding. Before I left I said: When you have the endangerment finding, it has to be based on some type of science. What science are you going to use?  She said: Well, mostly the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  So that is the kind of science they have been using for a long period of time.  But, ironically, the timing couldn't be better. It wasn't a matter of weeks after that; it was a matter of hours after that, that climategate was exposed. Climategate was the--it all started with East Anglia University's Climate Research Unit--the CRU--one of the main universities that helps put together the information about global warming for the IPCC. There it was disclosed that the IPCC was systematically distorting the facts, cooking the science of global warming to either cover up data that didn't tell the story they wanted everyone to hear and exaggerating the impacts of changing climate to help drive people out of fear into action.  There are three things one needs to know about the IPCC. First of all, the Obama administration has referred to the IPCC as the gold standard of climate change science and global warming. Some say its reports on climate change and global warming represent the so-called consensus of the science opinion about global warming. IPCC and Al Gore were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for their efforts to build and disseminate greater knowledge and doing so through the IPCC. Simply put, what this means is that in the elite circles, the IPCC is a big deal.  So as a result of climategate--when they found they had been lying all this time--when ABC News, when The Economist, when Time Magazine, when The Times of London, among many others, report that the IPCC's research contains embarrassing flaws and that the IPCC chairman and scientists knew of the flaws but published them anyway, we have the makings of a major scientific scandal. There are two examples of how the IPCC was cooking the science.  The IPCC claimed that the Himalayan glaciers would melt by 2035. Of course, this is not true. It is simply false. Yet it was put into the IPCC's fourth assessment report. According to The Sunday Times, the claim about the Himalayas was based on a 1999 story in a news magazine which, in turn, was based on a short telephone interview with someone named Seyed Hasnain, who is a very little-known Indian scientist.  Next, in 2005, the activist group World Wildlife Fund cited the story in one of its climate change reports. Yet despite the fact that the World Wildlife Fund report was not scientifically peer reviewed, it was still referenced by the IPCC. Next, according to The Times, the Himalayan glaciers are so thick at such high altitude that most glaciologists believe it would take several hundred years to melt at the present rate.  Anyway, all of that was taking place. It has to be really disturbing to a lot of those individuals who are alarmists, that all of a sudden this backbone of the science they have been referring to of the IPCC was exposed.  I remember one of the emails in 1999. These were the emails that were exposed. These are the ones that are behind--giving the information to the IPCC:       I've just completed Mike's Nature trick of adding in the      real temps to each series for the last 20 years, i.e., from      1981 onwards, and from 1961 for Keith's to hide the decline.  So they were actually adding higher temperatures to give the trends they wanted.  In 2009:       The fact is that we can't account for the lack of warming      at the moment, and it is a travesty that we can't.  These are the people who were supplying the information to the IPCC.  I could go on and on; there is not time to get to all of them.  Christopher Booker of the U.K. said: ``This is the worst scientific scandal of our generation.'' He was talking about the IPCC. That is the basis of all of this.       Clive Crook, Financial Times: The closed mindedness of      these supposed men of science . . . is surprising, even to      me. The stink of intellectual corruption is overpowering.       IPCC Prominent Physicist Resigns: Climategate was a fraud      on a scale I've never seen.       U.N. Scientist Dr. Phillip Lloyd calls out IPCC ``fraud''--     ``The result is NOT scientific.''       Newsweek: Once celebrated climate researchers feeling the      used car salesman.       Some of the IPCC's most quoted data and recommendations      were taken straight out of unchecked activist brochures . . .  Now, I am quoting right now. This was in Newsweek.  George Monbiot--I probably mispronounced that. He is a columnist who is on the other side of this issue from me. He said:       It's no use pretending that this isn't a major blow. The      emails extracted by a hacker from the climatic unit at the      University of East Anglia could scarcely be more damaging . .      . I'm dismayed and deeply shaken by them . . . I was too      trusting of some of those who provided the evidence I      championed. I would have been a better journalist if I had      investigated the claims more closely.  We have the other problem, and that is that instead of increasing, we are going through now some cold spells that are just shocking and setting new records. In January of 2014, 4,406 cold temperature records were set around the country. In January of 2014, in my city of Tulsa, it got down to minus 2 degrees, breaking a record that was held since 1912--over 100 years; in Enid, OK, minus 3 degrees. In Bartlesville, it went down to minus 14 degrees--colder than the South Pole, where it was only minus 11 on that same day.  February 2014: 5,836 cold temperature records set around the country. March 2014: Snow cover at third highest level on record; 1969, 1978 were higher. The Great Lakes, second highest ice cover on record--91 percent; 1979 is highest at 94 percent.  This is not surprising given the 15-year pause in global warming. Nature magazine stated that over the last 15 years ``the observed [temperature] trend is . . . not significantly different from zero [and] suggests a temporary `hiatus' in global warming.''  The Economist magazine said the same thing.  The President hasn't acknowledged this. On multiple occasions he has said--this is a quote from the President: ``The temperature around the globe is increasing faster than was predicted even 10 years ago.''  Unfortunately for his talking point, the data that has been reported in Nature, The Economist, and even in the United Nations IPCC report shows that this simply is not true. Increases in global temperature have stalled over the last 15 years.  This has to be really shocking to an awful lot of advocates who put their reputation and their lives on the idea that this world is coming to an end and global warming is a reality.  Several weeks ago, in a hearing held in the EPW Committee, Gina McCarthy--she is the one who is the current EPA Administrator--was pressed on this point. Asked whether or not President Obama's statement was true, she responded: ``I can't answer that.''  With all this in mind--climategate, recent cold temperatures, and a 15-year hiatus--how could Congress, in good conscience, move forward with legislation that gives EPA the authority to regulate greenhouse gases? How could EPA, more importantly, move forward with regulations based off of this cooked science?  There have been several votes on global warming-related legislation over the past decade since we first started debating it here in the late 1990s, but they have all failed to show that there have even been the 60 votes required to pass cap and trade.  In 1997 the Byrd-Hagel legislation, 95 to 0, the United States should not be a signator to the Kyoto Treaty. The Kyoto Treaty was a treaty that was negotiated with Al Gore down in South America.  In 2003 we had the McCain-Lieberman bill. It failed 43 to 55. Then we had the McCain-Lieberman bill again in 2005, and it failed 38 to 60. The trend is going in the wrong direction for them.  In 2008 the Lieberman-Warner bill failed 48 to 36.  In 2010, a resolution of disapproval on EPA's greenhouse gas rule was 47 to 53.  In 2011, the Inhofe-Upton prohibition on greenhouse gas regulation was 50-50. In 2013, the Inhofe-Upton prohibition on greenhouse gas regulations as a budget amendment was 47 to 52.  What I am saying here is the sentiment of the House and the Senate is going in the reverse direction. So it has been virtually impossible to try to pass a cap-and-trade bill.  I know there are a lot of people who at one time were looking at this and feeling as though this was something that was going to be a reality. But I have to say this. One of the reasons--this is kind of interesting. I am sorry my good friend from Massachusetts is not on the floor right now. But I can remember back when Republicans were in the majority in the Senate, and I was the chairman of a subcommittee of the Environment and Public Works Committee that was addressing this item. At that time everyone was talking as though global warming was here and it must be true, and I believed it probably was true, until they came out with the financial analysis. What would it cost if we passed cap and trade as a law?  At that time the scientists and the economists from the Wharton School of Economics and from MIT who participated--all of the estimates were between $300 billion and $400 billion a year. That is something we want to be very careful about. I know every time we hear ``billion dollars'' it doesn't really register how much that is. In my State of Oklahoma, what I do at the end of each year is I get the total number of people who filed a Federal tax return, and then I do my math as to what it is going to cost. For $300 billion to $400 billion a year, it would cost each taxpayer in the State of Oklahoma some $3,000 a year. That could be really significant, but not if there is a problem they are addressing out there. Getting back to Lisa Jackson, who is the Obama appointee to be Administrator of the EPA, I asked the question--and this was at a hearing, and I am sure the Senator from California remembers this as well because it was in one of the hearings of that committee, live on TV.  I said: Right now we are looking at different bills. We are looking at the Waxman bill and several others. The cap and trades are pretty much cap and trades. If we were to pass this, any of this legislation, would this have the effect of lowering the release of CO2?  Her answer was: No. The reason is this is not where the problem is. The problem is in China, in India, in Mexico, and in places where they do not have any regulations.  In fact, you can carry it one step further. If we were to pass that either by regulation or by legislation, and go ahead and incur this huge tax increase--the largest tax increase in the history of America--if we were to do this, as she said, it would not lower greenhouse gases. It could increase them because we would have to be chasing our manufacturing base where they could find the generation of electricity; and that would be in countries I just mentioned where they have no restrictions at all. So it could increase, not decrease, the greenhouse gases.  This is very significant, but it is in the weeds to the point where it is rather difficult to understand. Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA--well, I want to talk about the timing just for a minute because we are going through this. Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA must finalize new rules within 1 year of its publication in the Federal Register.  What I am saying now is, what they could not get done through legislation they are trying to do through regulation. One of the things they are trying to do is have the greenhouse gas legislation come under the EPA.  Anytime you have a new EPA rule, it has to be finalized within 1 year of its publication in the Federal Register. So the rule was released on September 20, 2013, but it was not published until January 8, 2014. Why do you suppose that was? Had the new rule been published on September 30, the rule would have gone into effect 6 weeks prior to the midterm elections and people would have known how much it was going to cost them.  If there is any doubt in anyone's mind, I have an article that was published on December 14 in the Washington Post that goes through the details as to why they did this so people would not know when they were voting how much all these regulations were going to cost. I ask unanimous consent this article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 14, 2013]  ICYMI: White House Delayed Enacting Rules Ahead of 2012 Election to                            Avoid Controversy                          (By Juliet Eilperin)       The White House systematically delayed enacting a series of      rules on the environment, worker safety and health care to      prevent them from becoming points of contention before the      2012 election, according to documents and interviews with      current and former administration officials.       Some agency officials were instructed to hold off      submitting proposals to the White House for up to a year to      ensure that they would not be issued before voters went to      the polls, the current and former officials said.       The delays meant that rules were postponed or never issued.      The stalled regulations included crucial elements of the      Affordable Care Act, what bodies of water deserved federal      protection, pollution controls for industrial boilers and      limits on dangerous silica exposure in the workplace.       The Obama administration has repeatedly said that any      delays until after the election were coincidental and that      such decisions were made without regard to politics. But      seven current and former administration officials told The      Washington Post that the motives behind many of the delays      were clearly political, as Obama's top aides focused on      avoiding controversy before his reelection.       The number and scope of delays under Obama went well beyond      those of his predecessors, who helped shape rules but did not      have the same formalized controls, said current and former      officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of      the sensitivity of the topic.       Those findings are bolstered by a new report from the      Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS), an      independent agency that advises the federal government on      regulatory issues. The report is based on anonymous      interviews with more than a dozen senior agency officials who      worked with the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs      (OIRA), which oversees the implementation of federal rules.       The report said internal reviews of proposed regulatory      changes ``took longer in 2011 and 2012 because of concerns      about the agencies issuing costly or controversial rules      prior to the November 2012 election.''       Emily Cain, spokeswoman for the Office of Management and      Budget, said in a statement that the administration's      ``approach to regulatory review is consistent with long-     standing precedent across previous administrations and fully      adheres'' to federal rules.       Administration officials noted that they issued a number of      controversial rules during Obama's first term, including      limits on mercury emissions for power plants and Medicaid      eligibility criteria under the Affordable Care Act.       ``OMB works as expeditiously as possible to review rules,      but when it comes to complex rules with significant potential      impact, we take the time needed to get them right,'' Cain      said.       But Ronald White, who directs regulatory policy at the      advocacy group Center for Effective Government, said the      ``overt manipulation of the regulatory review process by a      small White House office'' raises questions about how the      government writes regulations. He said the amount of time it      took the White House to review proposed rules was      ``particularly egregious over the past two years.''       Previous White House operations have weighed in on major      rules before they were officially submitted for review. But      Jeffrey Holmstead, who headed the EPA's Office of Air and      Radiation in the George W. Bush administration, said the      effort was not as extensive as the Obama administration's      approach.       ``There was no formalized process by which you had to get      permission to send them over,'' Holmstead said, referring to      rules being submitted to the White House.       The recent decision to bring on Democratic strategist John      Podesta as a senior White House adviser is likely to      accelerate the number of new rules and executive orders,      given Podesta's long-standing support for using executive      action to achieve the president's goals despite congressional      opposition.       Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who chairs the Judiciary      Subcommittee on Oversight, Federal Rights and Agency Action,      said he's concerned about the real-world impact of the      postponements in the first term.       ``Legal protection delayed is protection denied,''      Blumenthal said. ``I've spoken to officials at the top rungs      of the White House power structure and at OIRA and we're      going to hold their feet to the fire, and we're going to make      sure they're held accountable in a series of hearings.''       The officials interviewed for the ACUS report, whose names      were withheld from publication by the study authors, said      that starting in 2012 they had to meet with an OIRA desk      officer before submitting each significant rule for formal      review. They called the sessions ``Mother-may-I'' meetings,      according to the study.       The accounts were echoed by four Obama administration      political appointees and three career officials interviewed      by The Post.       At the Environmental Protection Agency, for example, a      former official said that only two managers had the authority      to request a major rule in 2012: then-administrator Lisa P.      Jackson and deputy administrator Bob Perciasepe. Perciasepe      and OIRA's director at the time, Cass Sunstein, would have      ``weekly and sometimes semi-weekly discussions'' to discuss      rules that affected the economy, one said, because they had      political consequences, the person said.       ``As we entered the run-up to the election, the word went      out the White House was not anxious to review new rules,''      the former official said.       Sunstein, who has returned to his post as a Harvard Law      School professor, declined to comment.       Several significant EPA proposals were withheld as a result      of those meetings, officials said, including a proposal      requiring cleaner gasoline and lower-pollution vehicles that      had won the support of automakers but angered the oil      industry.       That regulation, which would reduce the amount of sulfur in      U.S. gasoline by two-thirds and impose fleetwide pollution      limits on new vehicles by 2017, was ready in December 2011,      said three officials familiar with the proposal. But agency      officials were told to wait a year to submit it for review      because critics could use it to suggest that the      administration was raising gas prices, they said. The EPA      issued the proposed rule in March.       Other EPA regulations that were delayed beyond the 2012      election included rules on coal ash disposal, water pollution      rules for streams and wetlands, air emissions from industrial      boilers and cement kilns, and carbon dioxide limits for      existing power plants.       Ross Eisenberg, who serves as vice president of energy and      resources policy at the National Association for      Manufacturers and has criticized several EPA regulations,      noted that in the past year the administration moved ahead      with proposals such as the rules on greenhouse gas emissions      and boilers.       ``The agenda certainly did slow down, but it doesn't      change,'' he said.       The administration also was slow to handle rules pertaining      to its health-care law. Several key regulations did not come      out until after the 2012 election, including one defining      what constitutes ``essential health benefits'' under a health      plan and which Americans could qualify for federal subsidies      if they opted to enroll in a state or a federal marketplace      plan.       The latter focused on what constitutes ``affordable.''      Treasury proposed a regulation in August 2011 saying an      employer plan was affordable as long as the premium for an      individual was no more than 9.5 percent of the taxpayer's      household income. Several groups--including labor unions--     argued that the proposal did not take into account that the      premium for a family plan might be much higher than that      standard.       Unions represent a vital part of the Democratic coalition,      in part because they help mobilize voters during elections.       The Treasury Department held the proposal back while      finalizing all the other tax-credit rules on May 23, 2012.      Treasury officials later told those working on the regulation      that it could not be published before the election, according      to a government official familiar with the decision who spoke      on the condition of anonymity because of its sensitive      nature. The department made the rule on Feb. 1.       OMB has reduced the length of time that rules are pending      this year. The agency has cut the number of rules that were      under review for more than 200 days by more than half.       But while the administration is pressing ahead, activists      say the delays took a toll. Peg Seminario, director of safety      and health for the AFL-CIO, points to an update of the      nation's silica standards proposed Sept. 12 after a long      delay. The rule, which would prevent an estimated 688 deaths      and 1,585 silica-related illnesses each year, won't be      finalized until 2016.       Jon Devine, a senior lawyer in the Natural Resources      Defense Council's water program, said small streams and      wetlands remain vulnerable because of the administration's      foot-dragging. The EPA recently withdrew a proposal to      outline what kind of water bodies deserve federal protection      that had been pending since February 2012 and announced it      would issue a legally binding rule instead.       ``What's disappointing is it leaves waters subject to the      existing, weak state of affairs until they get the rule over      the final hurdle,'' Devine said.
