 I came to the Senate and heard Senator Lott. He was exasperated and frustrated. He said Members were not offering amendments, so I came to the Senate quickly to find out the extent of it.  Would the Senator from Oklahoma clarify, is it not true that we now have, in effect, a new bill--about 1,000 pages, the substitute--that is being copied now and being shared for the first time? Members who seek to amend the bill should at least be given a chance to review this new version of the bill so their amendments are in order.
