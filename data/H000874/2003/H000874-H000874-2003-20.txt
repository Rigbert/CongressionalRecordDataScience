Speaker, at this time I am pleased to yield to the distinguished majority leader, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), for the purposes of informing us of the schedule for next week and, perhaps, the coming weeks.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) for yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, the House will convene on Wednesday of next week at 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several measures under suspension of the rules. A final list of those bills will be sent to the Members' offices by the end of today. Any votes called on these measures will be rolled until 6:30 p.m.  On Thursday the House will convene at 10 a.m. for legislative business. We plan to consider the conference report on H.R. 6, the Energy Policy Act of 2003, and the conference report on H.R. 2754, the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2004.  Now for the following week, the week of November 17, we expect our first votes to occur after 6:30 p.m. on Monday. We will confirm this schedule early next week as we get a better sense of the workload and timing for completion of the various conference reports. But Members should know that there is a good chance that we would be in session through Saturday, November 22.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I will be glad to answer any questions.
