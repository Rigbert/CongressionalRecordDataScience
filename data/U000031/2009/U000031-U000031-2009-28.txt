 Madam Speaker, it is time to get America moving again, and that's exactly what this bill does. The auto sector is so important to our country in virtually every single community. It doesn't have to just be a community that has an assembly line. It's the communities that build parts, whether it be a gas cap or a part for a brake, a side panel, a piece of trim, a window. Auto dealers are in virtually every community across the country, and they average about 50 employees per dealership. So this bill impacts every single community across America.  No one here today has talked about what this bill also does. We will rely less on foreign oil because the average consumer, by taking advantage of this program, will save $780 in fuel costs because they're going to trade in that old car and they're going to have a more fuel-efficient, better emission vehicle than they had before; $780 per household for those that take advantage of it. We have fraud and abuse provisions in here so that they won't be taken advantage of.  And to my good friend Mr. Flake, yes, there is a sunset. This program doesn't go on forever. There is a sunset. It's a temporary Band-Aid to fix an economic problem that needs America's attention.  Isn't it better, isn't it better to have people work and have a job and pay taxes than having them laid off and receive benefits? I think most Americans would rather have that job. They want to pay their taxes. This is a bill that helps America, and that's one of the reasons why it passed in our committee 50-4.  I would urge all of my colleagues to support this. And, sadly, because of the procedure, it does have to pass tonight by a two-thirds vote rather than a majority. I would like to think that we can exceed that two-thirds and pass it.  With that, Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
