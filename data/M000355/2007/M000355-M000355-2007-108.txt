 President, let me briefly add, it is not too late for this first session of Congress to achieve a better record. We need to get appropriations bills not just sent to the President but signed by the President. We need to get the AMT fixed so we don't inconvenience, to the tune of $75 billion, millions of American taxpayers. We need to provide bridge funding for our troops that we all know is needed. And we need to confirm an Attorney General. Our colleagues on the other side have been saying we need a new Attorney General all year long. Now it is time to do it.
