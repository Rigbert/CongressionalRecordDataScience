 For the past 11 months, Mr. Glickstein has assisted the committee and its members with high-priority work overseeing defense contracting reform. His contributions to our committee's work have been significant and highly valued by our staff.  On behalf of the Senate Committee on Armed Services, I thank Mr. Glickstein and wish him future success as he continues to support the U.S. Government.                          ____________________
