Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  In view of the time, I think it is our intention to be respectful to the Members and their needs to catch their flights. Our motion instructs conferees to simply insist that the funding level of $76 million provided in the House-passed bill for the WIC Program, which was agreed to overwhelmingly by this body yesterday, prevailed in conference with the Senate.  The Senate version of the bill includes only $58 million for the WIC Program, and in its statement of administration policy on the Senate version of the bill, the administration estimated that the number of women, infants, and children served would be reduced by 75,000 to 100,000 participants if the $58 million number prevailed.  So we ask, Mr. Speaker, that we have this motion to instruct the conferees, and I reserve the balance of my time.
