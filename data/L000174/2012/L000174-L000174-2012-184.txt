 In the last two presidential election years, we were able to bring the number of judicial vacancies down to the lowest levels in the past 20 years. In 2004 at end of President Bush's first term, vacancies were reduced to 28 not the 77 we have today. In 2008, in the last year of President Bush's second term, we again worked to fill vacancies and got them down to 34, less than half of what they are today. In 2004, 25 nominees were confirmed between June and the presidential election, and in 2008, 22 nominees were confirmed between June and the presidential election.  In 2004, a Presidential election year, the Senate confirmed five circuit court nominees of a Republican President that had been reported by the Committee that year. This year we have confirmed only two circuit court nominees that have been reported by the Committee this year, and both were filibustered. By this date in 2004 the Senate had already confirmed 32 of President Bush's circuit court nominees, and we confirmed another three that year for a total of 35 circuit court nominees in his first term. So far, the Senate has only been allowed to consider and confirm 30 of President Obama's circuit court nominees five fewer, 17 percent fewer while higher numbers of vacancies remain, and yet the Senate Republican leadership wants to artificially shut down nominations for no good reason.  As Chairman of this Committee, I have also assiduously protected the rights of the minority in the judicial nomination process. I have only proceeded with judicial nominations supported by both home state Senators. That has meant that we are not able to proceed on current nominees from Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Louisiana. I even stopped proceedings on a circuit court nominee from Kansas when the Kansas Republican Senators reversed themselves and withdrew their support for the nominee. Nor did I accede to the Majority Leader's request to push a Nevada nominee through Committee who did not have the blue slip of the state's Republican Senator. In stark contrast, it was Senate Republicans and the Republican chairman who blatantly disregarded Senate Judiciary procedure by proceeding with nominations despite the objection of both home state Senators. And I have been consistent. I hold hearings at the same pace and under the same procedures whether the President nominating is a Democrat or a Republican. Others cannot say that. So those have been my rules respect for minority rights, transparency, deference to home state Senators, consistent application of policies and practices, and allowing for confirmations well into presidential election years for nominees with bipartisan support.  Personal attacks on me do nothing to help the American people who are seeking justice in our Federal courts. I am willing to defend my record but that is beside the point. The harm to the American people is what matters. What the American people and the overburdened Federal courts need are qualified judges to administer justice in our Federal courts, not the perpetuation of extended, numerous vacancies.  The judicial vacancy rate remains almost twice what it was at this point in the first term of President Bush. I wish Senate Republicans would think more about our responsibilities to the American people than some warped sense of partisan score settling. Vacancies have been near or above 80 for three years. Nearly one out of every 11 Federal courts is currently vacant. Their shutting down confirmations for consensusand qualified judicial nominees is not helping the overburdened courts who cannot administer justice in an expedient fashion. It is not helping owners of small businesses.  Last week, after his nomination was reported with near unanimous voice vote by the Judiciary Committee approximately three months ago, the Senate was finally able to confirm Judge Kevin McNulty to the District of New Jersey. Despite vacancies still remaining near or above 80, Senate Republicans continue to obstruct and stall nominees on the Senate floor for no good reason. We could easily have confirmed both Judges Shipp and McNulty together three months ago. It is this type of across-the-board obstruction of judicial nominees by Senate Republicans that has contributed to the judicial vacancy crisis in our Federal courts.  Last week, I spoke about the novel excuses that some Senate Republicans have concocted for refusing to allow for votes on nominees. One excuse was that having confirmed two Supreme Court justices, the Senate cannot be expected to reach the 205 number of confirmations in President Bush's first term. Work on two Supreme Court nominations did not stop the Senate from working to confirm 200 of President Clinton's circuit and district nominees in his first term. Similarly, there were two Supreme Court confirmations in President George H.W. Bush's term, and that did not prevent Senate Democrats who were in the Senate majority from confirming 192 of his circuit and district nominees, including 66 in the election year of 1992 alone.  Last week we heard another self-serving misconception of more recent history from the Republican side of the aisle. They claimed that Democrats were responsible for growing judicial vacancies in 2008. The charge was as follows: ``[A]t the beginning of 2008 there were 43 vacancies. So the practice for Democrats who controlled the Senate during that last year of President Bush's term was to allow vacancies to increase by more than 37 percent.'' In fact, what we did in 2008 was to reduce vacancies back down to 34 in October 2008 when the Senate recessed for the year. The increase in vacancies after October and through the remainder of 2008 was not because Senate Democrats were obstructing Senate votes on qualified judicial nominees with bipartisan support as Senate Republicans are today. In November and December 2008 the Senate met on a few days only to address the financial crisis. There were no nominations pending on the Calendar after the election in 2008. Their charge is fallacious. Judicial vacancies have not been as low as 34 or 43 or even the 55 that they stood at when President Obama took office for years. Due to Republican obstruction, President Obama will be the first President in 20 years to complete his first term with more judicial vacancies than when he took office.  Last week Senate Republicans also contended that they have no responsibility for the lack of progress in 2009. In fact, that year ended with 10 judicial confirmations stalled by Senate Republicans. The obstructionist tactics they employed from the outset of the Obama administration had led to the lowest number of judicial confirmations in more than 50 years. Only 12 of President Obama's judicial nominations to Federal circuit and district courts were confirmed that whole year. The 12 were less than half of what we achieved during President Bush's first tumultuous year. In the second half of 2001, a Democratic Senate majority proceeded to confirm 28 judges. Despite the fact that President Obama began nominating judicial nominees two months earlier than President Bush, Senate Republicans delayed and obstructed them to yield an historic low in confirmations. Republicans refused to agree to the consideration of qualified, noncontroversial nominees for weeks and months. And as the Senate recessed in December, only three of the available 13 judicial nominations on the Senate Executive Calendar were allowed to be considered.  By contrast, in December 2001, the first year of President Bush's administration, Senate Democrats proceeded to confirm 10 of his judicial nominees. At the end of the Senate's 2001 session, only four judicial nominations were left on the Senate Executive Calendar, all of which were confirmed soon after the Senate returned in 2002. By contrast, it took until May 2011, a year and a half later, to complete action on the judicial nominees who should have been confirmed in December 2009 but had to be renominated. Although noncontroversial, several were further delayed by filibusters before being confirmed unanimously. The lack of Senate action on those 10 judicial nominees in 2009 was attributable to Senate Republicans and no one else. Despite the fact that President Obama reached across the aisle to consult with Republican Senators, he was rewarded with obstruction from the outset of his administration. While President Obama moved beyond the judicial nominations battles of the past and reached out to work with Republicans and make mainstream nominations, Senate Republicans continued their tactics of delay.  For Senate Republicans to claim that ``only 13 [sic] judges were confirmed during President Obama's first year'' because of ``decisions made by the Senate Democratic leadership'' and that it was ``the choice of Democrats'' and ``not because of anything the Republican minority could do'' is ludicrous. Senate Democrats had cleared for confirmation the other 10 judicial nominees stalled by Republicans in 2009. Their assertion ignores the facts and the truth. Just as they cannot escape responsibility for their unwillingness to move forward with the 21 judicial nominees ready for a final up-or down vote now before the end of this year, they cannot escape responsibility for what they did in 2009.  Senate Republicans choose to offer weak excuses and blame everyone but themselves for the delays and obstruction in which they have excelled. Their sense of being justified by some view of tit-for-tat is distorted and should be beside the point while vacancies remain so high that the American people and our courts are overburdened. The way Senate Democrats helped reduce vacancies was not by limiting confirmations to one nominee per week, as Senate Republicans have. In September 2008, with Democrats in the majority, the Senate confirmed 10 of President Bush's nominees in a single day, all by voice vote. There were 10 consensus nominees pending on the Senate floor, and we confirmed all of them in minutes. Likewise, in 2002, Senate Democrats joined in confirming 18 of President Bush's nominees in a single day, again by voice vote. I wish Senate Republicans would duplicate that precedent and help clear the logjam of judicial nominees dating back to March who are still awaiting up-or-down votes.  While I am pleased that we will confirm Judge Shipp today, I wish that Senate Republicans would help us confirm the 20 additional judicial nominees who can be confirmed right now. Then we could make real progress in giving our courts the judges they need to provide justice for the American people, just as we did in 1992, 2004 and 2008.  After today's vote, I hope Senate Republicans will reconsider their ill-conceived partisan strategy and work with us to meet the needs of the American people. With more than 75 judicial vacancies still burdening the American people and our Federal courts, there is no justification for not proceeding to confirm the judicial nominees reported with bipartisan support by the Judiciary Committee this year.  Each day that Senate Republicans refuse because of their political agenda to confirm these qualified judicial nominees who have been reviewed and voted on by the Judiciary Committee is another day that a judge could have been working to administer justice. Every week lost is another in which injured plaintiffs are having to wait to recover the costs of medical expenses, lost wages, or other damages from wrongdoing. Every month is another drag on the economy as small business owners have to wait to have their contract disputes resolved. Hardworking and hard-pressed Americans should not have to wait years to have their cases decided. Just as it is with the economy and with jobs, the American people do not want to hear excuses about why Republicans in Congress will not help them. So let us do more to help the American people.                               Exhibit 1                 [From theatlantic.com, July 16, 2012]   William Kayatta and the Needless Destruction of the Thurmond Rule                           (By Andrew Cohen)Why do Republican leaders still play along with an informal Senate rule   that prevents up-or-down votes on even those judges who have strong                           Republican support?       Meet William Kayatta, another one of America's earnest,      capable judges-in-waiting. Widely respected in his home state      of Maine, nominated by President Obama in January to fill a      vacancy on the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, eagerly      endorsed by both of Maine's Republican senators, passed for      confirmation to the Senate floor by an easy voice vote in the      Senate Judiciary Committee, Kayatta's nomination instead has      become yet another victim of the Senate GOP's suicidal      tendencies.       The litigants of the 1st Circuit need Kayatta. There are no      serious arguments against him. Yet the Republican leadership      in the Senate has blocked a vote on the merits of his      nomination in obedience to the so-called ``Thurmond Rule,''      an informal practice as self-destructive as was its namesake.      The Thurmond Rule is typically invoked by the opposition      party in a presidential election year to preclude substantive      votes on federal judicial appointments within six months of      Election Day. It is the Senate's version of a sit-down      strike.       In April, just after the Judiciary Committee favorably      passed along Kayatta's nomination to the Senate floor for      confirmation, Maine's junior senator, Susan Collins, had      wonderful things to say about the nominee:       Bill is an attorney of exceptional intelligence, extensive      experience, and demonstrated integrity, who is very highly      respected in the Maine legal community. Bill's impressive      background makes him eminently qualified for a seat on the      First Circuit. His thirty-plus years of real world litigation      experience would bring a much-needed perspective to the      court. Maine has a long proud history of supplying superb      jurists to the federal bench. I know that, if confirmed, Mr.      Kayatta will continue in that tradition. I urge the full      Senate to approve his nomination as soon as possible.       And how did her fellow Republicans respond to her request?      They blew her off. There has been no vote on Kayatta's      nomination and none is scheduled. Instead, last month, Sen.      Mitch McConnell, the Senate Minority Leader, invoked the      ``Thurmond rule'' to block floor consideration of      appointment--as well as up-or-down votes on the rest of      President Obama's federal appellate nominees (This in turn,      initially prompted Sen. Collins to blame the Obama      Administration for going too slow in nominating Kayatta in      the first place.)       In theory, the Thurmond Rule is something official      Washington defends as the price of divided government. In      reality, it's another outrageous example of how the Senate      has re-written the Constitution by filibuster. In practice,      in the Kayatta case and many more, the Thurmond rule is the      antithesis of good governance. Your Senate today perpetuates      a frivolous rule which, for the most cynical political      reasons, blocks qualified people from serving their nation.      It's not misfeasance. It's malfeasance.       Just because Strom Thurmond was willing to jump the Senate      off the bridge doesn't mean that today's Senate Republican      leaders had to do likewise.       In a more prudent and practical era in Senate history,      nominees like Kayatta would have been confirmed in days.      Fifty years ago, for example, when another bright Democratic      appointee with strong Republican support came to the Senate      seeking a judgeship, the Judiciary Committee took all of 11      minutes before it endorsed him. Byron ``Whizzer'' White then      served the next 31 years as an associate justice of the      United States Supreme Court. That's wholly unthinkable      today--even with lower federal court nominees.       Now even slam-dunk candidates like Kayatta linger in the      wings waiting for Senate ``consent'' long after the body      already has definitively ``advised'' the executive branch of      how great it thinks the nominee would be as a judge. Can you      imagine the uproar if the Senate ever used its filibuster      power to block the deployment of troops already endorsed by      the Armed Services Committee? Now please tell me the material      difference here. Surely, the judiciary needs judges as much      as the army needs soldiers.       There are currently 76 judicial vacancies around the      country. There are 31 districts and circuits designated as      ``judicial emergencies'' because vacancies there have      lingered so long. In the 10th Circuit, what's happening to      Kayatta is happening to Robert Bacharach, who has the support      of Oklahoma's two Republican senators. The Senate also is      blocking Richard Taranto from a Federal Circuit spot even      though he breezed through the Judiciary Committee and has      been endorsed by Robert Bork and Paul Clement. The same goes      for Patty Shwartz in the 3rd Circuit.       This is unacceptable on every level. When we talk about      ``false equivalence'' in modern politics the business of      these judges should be the lede. These nominations require no      great policy choices on the part of Congress. They don't come      with thousands of pages of ambiguous legalese disguised as      the language of a federal statute. There is no room for spin.      These nominees are either qualified, or they aren't, and when      they sail out of the Judiciary Committee with voice votes no      one can plausibly say they aren't qualified.       And yet here we are. It would be convenient to blame Strom      Thurmond, one of the most divisive politicians of the 20th      century, for one of the Senate's most divisive rules. But      Thurmond is long gone. And there was never anything about his      rule that demanded it be followed, session after session,      under both Democratic and Republican control. Just because      Strom Thurmond was willing to jump the Senate off the bridge,      in other words, doesn't mean that today's Senate Republican      leaders had to do likewise. But they have.       America has trouble enough today without a senseless Senate      rule that blocks highly skilled, highly competent public      servants from joining government. The nation's litigants in      federal court, burdened by judicial vacancies, already are      waiting long enough to have their corporate disputes decided.      This isn't gridlock. This is destruction. ``I think it's      stupid'' to block good judges from confirmation, Sen. Tom      Coburn said earlier this year. For once, he is right. And      Sen. Collins? Even she's come around. ``I have urged my      colleagues on both sides of the aisle to give Bill the direct      vote by the full Senate that he deserves,'' she said late      last month. Amen to that.                                  ____              [From the Los Angeles Times, July 12, 2012]                      Reject the ``Thurmond Rule''  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell invokes the legacy of Strom Thurmond to hold up judicial confirmations--It's bad for judges and bad                               for justice       The late Strom Thurmond is best known for his 48 years in      the U.S. Senate representing South Carolina, his      segregationist candidacy for the presidency in 1948 and the      fact that even though he was a longtime opponent of racial      equality, he fathered a child with a black teenage      housekeeper. But Thurmond also lent his name to the so-called      Thurmond Rule, according to which Senate action on judicial      confirmations is supposed to stop several months before a      presidential election.       The rule--actually a custom that sometimes has been honored      in the breach--goes back to 1968, when Thurmond and other      Republicans held up action on President Johnson's nomination      of Abe Fortas to be chief justice of the United States.      Fortas withdrew in the face of a filibuster, and President      Nixon, the Republican victor in the 1968 election, was able      to choose a successor to the retiring Earl Warren. In      subsequent years, senators of both parties have cited the      Thurmond/Fortas episode as a precedent for not acting on      judicial nominations close to an election.       Even in the case of a Supreme Court appointment, the      Thurmond Rule violates the spirit of the Constitution, which      doesn't distinguish between nominations made earlier or later      in a president's term. It is less defensible still in      connection with nominations to lower courts. Yet Senate      Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told colleagues last      month that he was immediately invoking the rule to end      nominations to the U.S. Court of Appeals, and would block      confirmation votes on nominees to federal district courts      after September.       Such delays are a disservice to the nominees and to an      overburdened federal judiciary. At present there are 12      vacancies on federal appeals courts, 63 on district courts      and two on the U.S. Court of International Trade. The Obama      administration, although it has been slow to fill vacancies,      currently is proposing seven candidates for the appeals court      and 28 for the district courts. The Senate should hold up-or-     down votes on these nominations and any others put forward in      the near future.       Apart from the Thurmond Rule, the timely confirmation of      judicial nominees has long been frustrated by petty      partisanship. Democrats and Republicans share the blame. The      most recent logjam was broken in March when Republicans      agreed to timely votes on 14 nominations.       Obviously Republicans hope that Barack Obama is a lame-duck      president, but even lame-ducks are entitled to expeditious      consideration of their nominations. And the administration of      justice shouldn't be held hostage to partisan politics even      in an election year.  Mr. President, I see the distinguished senior Senator from New Jersey on the floor. If he seeks the floor, I will yield to him; otherwise, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
