Speaker, reclaiming my time, I am talking about the Members. The gentleman brought up the Members' pay raise. The gentleman said this was about a Members' pay raise. My representation to the gentleman is that, in fact, the committee included the preclusion, the prohibition on the receipt by Members of a pay raise.  There is nothing in this bill about employees' pay raises, as the gentleman knows, so that what I am saying to the gentleman is whether this rule fails or whether this rule passes, Members will not get pay raises, the reason being because, if we have to go back to the drawing board, we will come back with the same provision. The gentleman knows that, and Members ought to know that.  Mr. Speaker, if I might therefore conclude, I say to my friend, the chairman of the Committee on Rules, his representation about a Members' pay raise vote is, frankly, political tactics, not substance. It is political tactics to try to scare Members into voting for or against this rule.  What this is about is the failure of the Committee on Rules to protect what are democratically adopted in the Committee on Appropriations provisions, some of which I like, some of which I did not like.  Now I will tell my friend, he says if he protects the Lowey amendment, for instance, which provides for access to contraception, which I believe the overwhelming majority of Americans believe is good policy and good family practice, the overwhelming majority of Americans in my opinion believe that, he says that people will vote against the rule to prohibit a vote in the people's House on that issue. It does not make sure that it happens. What it says is that the representatives of the American public will be able to vote on that issue.  The gentleman has provided for a procedure, as the Chair well knows, where one Member can come and strike out what the Committee on Appropriations adopted in a democratic process.
