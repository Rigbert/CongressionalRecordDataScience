President, On July 1, the interest rates will double for the most vulnerable students in our society. Access to college, which is fundamental to our growth, our prosperity, and individual advancement will be compromised for 7 million low-and moderate income students in this country.  Republicans have a long-term proposal, but they do not have a long-term solution because it is not just about interest rates, it is about college costs. It is about refinancing the huge amount of debt that families have today--not just families but students--debt they may never be able to pay off. First, we need the time to work on a long-term solution; but, second, we need to reassure vulnerable individuals and families that their rates will not double. Student debt today is the second largest debt for American households. We cannot let it go any further. Their proposal not only will not solve the problem because it doesn't deal with all aspects, but it will increase student debt for borrowers with financial need on July 1.  Instead, I urge passage of our proposal, the Student Loan Affordability Act.                             Cloture Motion
