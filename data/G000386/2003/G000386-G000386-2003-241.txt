 President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. In S. 1, beneficiaries who are enrolled in both Medicaid and Medicare will continue to receive the generous drug coverage that they currently know through the Medicaid program.  Some of my colleagues have argued that by having dual eligibles remain in the Medicaid program, Congress is treating these vulnerable seniors as second-class citizens and subjecting them to a lower quality benefit.  This is not the case. In fact, this letter from the Long Term Care Pharmacy Alliance applauds S. 1 for keeping the duals in Medicaid.  Specifically, the letter states, ``This approach will preserve the time-tested safeguards designed to prevent medication errors and ensure quality care for the majority of these beneficiaries in the institutional setting.''  The policy decision to cover the drug cost for dual eligibles in Medicaid was not made in vacuum. These vulnerable citizens deserve the best benefit available, which is the benefit provided through Medicaid. I also remind my colleagues that the intent of this legislation is to expand prescription drug coverage to our senior citizens who do not have access to prescription drugs or who are faced with paying a large share of their income for their drug coverage.  This does not describe the current coverage experienced by those who are dually eligible.  These seniors currently have a drug benefit through the Medicaid program. In fact, many advocates and beneficiaries describe and know this benefit to be very generous.  Medicaid was created to assist individuals who do not have the means to pay for their share of health care costs. That is a responsibility shared between the Federal Government and the States. Medicaid pays for many benefits that Medicare does not.  We all know that the purpose of S. 1 is to provide prescription drugs to seniors that do not currently have access to drugs or are paying extremely high drug costs.  However, recognizing the costs associated with covering the cost of providing prescription drug coverage to the dual eligible population, S. 1 does provide nearly 18 billion in new Federal dollars to compensate States for some of these costs.  This is because S. 1 provides minimum standards that ensure that every aspect of the benefit provided through Medicaid is the same high quality that is provided through part D of the Medicare program.  I remind my colleagues that adoption of this amendment will not expand coverage at all; it will simply shift the cost to the Federal Government and in time to the other Medicare beneficiaries.  In closing, I remind my colleagues that S. 1 helps to deliver care that is consistent with current law and is familiar to vulnerable beneficiaries.  I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment.  I ask unanimous consent to print the letter to which I referred in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                             Long Term Care Pharmacy Alliance,                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 2003.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     Chairman, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Dirksen          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Grassley: On behalf of the Long Term Care      Pharmacy Alliance, I appreciate this opportunity to express      our support for provisions of Medicare legislation you have      advanced to protect the nation's frail elderly beneficiaries      residing in nursing facilities. In particular, we are pleased      that your legislation would allow dual eligible beneficiaries      to retain their prescription drug coverage under Medicaid.       While most Medicare beneficiaries are able to walk into      pharmacies to pick up their prescriptions or to receive vials      of pills through the mail, a sizable percentage of      beneficiaries cannot do so and need special services that      retail and mail order pharmacies do not provide. Nursing home      residents have specific diseases and multiple co-morbidities      that require specialized pharmacy care.       To meet these needs, long-term pharmacies provide      specialized packaging, 24-hour delivery, infusion therapy      services, geriatric-specific formularies, clinical      consultation and other services that are indispensable in the      long-term care environment. Without such treatment, we cannot      expect positive therapeutic outcomes for these patients.      Failure to take into consideration the special pharmacy needs      of the frail and institutionalized elderly will lead to a      marked increase in medication errors and other adverse      events.       In recognition of these concerns, your proposed legislation      would retain the current system of Medicaid coverage to      provide specialized pharmacy services to dual-eligible      beneficiaries residing in nursing facilities. This approach      will preserve the time-tested safeguards designed to prevent      medication errors and ensure quality care for the majority of      these beneficiaries in the institutional setting. Medicaid      today provides generous benefits to dual eligible      beneficiaries and has experience in addressing the special      needs of nursing home patients. The proposed new Medicare      Part D benefit does not contemplate the impact on nursing      home residents which must be considered to protect these      patients.       We are encouraged that Section 104 of the Senate bill      requires the Secretary to provide recommendations to cover      dual eligible beneficiaries by the new Medicare Part D      benefit before statutorily mandating such action.      Nevertheless, we strongly recommend additional language to      address the special pharmacy needs of beneficiaries residing      in nursing facilities who are not dually-eligible for      Medicare and Medicaid. Such language would require the      Secretary of Health and Human Services to review the current      standards of practice for pharmacy services provided to      patients in nursing facilities and to report to the Congress      its     findings prior to implementation of the new prescription drug      benefit. This report would include a detailed description of      the Department's plans to implement the provisions of this      Act in a manner consistent with applicable state and federal      laws designed to protect the safety and quality of care of      nursing facility patients. Such provisions were included in      legislation approved by the House Ways and Means and Energy      and Commerce Committees, and we would respectfully request      that you adopt similar language.       We appreciate your leadership in carefully considering the      multitude of complex issues related to the creation of a new      Medicare prescription drug benefit. We are grateful for the      chance to work constructively with you to protect patient      safety and to ensure the continued provision of quality      pharmacy services to the most vulnerable seniors.       If you have any questions or would like additional      information, please feel free to contact me. Again, thank you      for your efforts to ensure patient safety and promote quality      care for Medicare beneficiaries residing in nursing      facilities.           Sincerely,                                                     Paul Baldwin,                                               Executive Director.
