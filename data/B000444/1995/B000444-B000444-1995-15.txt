  Mr. President, I believe that the amendment of my friend from Utah is fatally flawed. For the first time ever, it puts the Federal Government in the position of the State governments of choosing what types of speech they think are appropriate. My amendment protects the flag, plain and simple. It is straightforward. It does not allow the Government to choose. It defines it. It says the flag cannot be burned, trampled upon. It is very specific.  I ask that my colleagues look at it closely and, hopefully, support it. I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.
