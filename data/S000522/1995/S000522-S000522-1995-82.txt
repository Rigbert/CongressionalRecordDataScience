Mr. Chairman, that is an accounting deal. We are talking about U.S. taxpayer dollars, mine, the gentleman's, going into a fund that then is doled out as part of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Yes, there is a contribution made by the employee, roughly 30 percent, but there is also a 70-percent contribution made by the Federal Government, we as taxpayers, and then there are the premium payers. I myself, my wife and I, got out of Kaiser because they were providing abortions. We were providing premiums, so then both as taxpayer and as premium payer, we were contributing to abortion at Kaiser. We got out of it because we were so upset with the killing of unborn children at Kaiser Permanente.
