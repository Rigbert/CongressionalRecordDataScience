Mr. Speaker, in the coming days the participating States of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) will conduct in Vienna, Austria, a Supplementary Meeting on Freedom of Religion with the intent to discuss some of the key human rights concerns raised at the 1998 Human Dimension Implementation Meeting. The United States has a sincere interest in the deserved attention the OSCE is bringing to violations of religious liberty.  As Chairman of the Helsinki Commission(which has the mandate to monitor compliance with the Helsinki Accords), I continue to be concerned with the growing evidence that religious intolerance is on the rise and violations of this precious freedom are cropping up among the stalwart participating States of the OSCE. This trend is especially noteworthy in Western Europe, in countries such as France and Belgium, where the parliaments, respectively, reports listing a variety of religious groups and institutions as ``dangerous sects.'' The French, Belgian, and Austrian Governments have also established governmental centers to advise citizens which religious groups meet government criteria as a bona fide religion. If I may, Mr. Speaker, I want to take a moment and share with my colleagues these alarming initiatives so that we may consider what these actions portend for all peoples of faith.  The clearest and most comprehensive commitments on religious liberty found in any international instrument are enunciated in the OSCE documents. Non-interference in the affairs of religious communities is central to the OSCE understanding of religious liberty. The tendency of a number of European governments to establish themselves as the determiner of the rightness or wrongness of a particular belief is in direct contravention to this principle. In addition, OSCE States have committed to eliminating and preventing discrimination based on religious grounds in all field of civil, political, economic, social and cultural life. Other commitments include the freedom to profess and practice one's religion alone or in community, the freedom to meet with and exchange information with co-religionists regardless of frontiers, the freedom to freely present to others and discuss one's religious views, and the freedom to change one's religion.  Over the past three years, the parliaments of France, Belgium, and Germany each established commissions to study ``dangerous sects and cults` that have contributed to the discrimination and harassment of targeted groups. For example, an investigative report undertaken by the French Parliament in 1996 contained a list of ``dangerous'' groups in order to warn the public against them. Suspect activities, according to the report, include ``recruitment'' through evangelistic outreach and distribution of tracts, activities clearly within the internationally recognized right to free expression. Similarly, the Belgian Parliament's 1997 report had a widely circulated informal appendix that listed 189 groups and included various allegations against many Protestant and Catholic groups, Quakers, Hasidic Jews, Buddhists, and the YWCA. In Belgium, the unofficial appendix appears to have gained significance in the eyes of some public officials who reportedly have denied access to publicly rented buildings for Seventh Day Adventists and Baha'i because they were listed in the appendix.  Equally alarming, the French, Belgian, and Austrian Governments, as well as a number of state governments in Germany, have set up hotlines for the public and, through government-sponsored ``information centers'', distribute information on groups deemed by the government to be ``dangerous.'' Characterizations of religious beliefs by these government information centers and publication of unproven and potentially libelous materials have already caused problems for a number of minority religious groups. Such government action presumes that religious beliefs and spiritual convictions can be objectively analyzed by government bureaucrats in their consumer protection role. These information centers contradict the OSCE commitments to ``foster a climate of mutual tolerance and respect,'' and excessively entangle the government in the public discussion on the viability of particular religious beliefs.  A few months ago, in October 1998, the French Prime Minister's office created the ``Interministerial Mission to Battle Against Sects'', which by its very name, suggests confrontation with religious minorities rather than tolerance. The Interministerial Mission's mandate includes the responsibility to ``predict and fight against actions of sects that violate human dignity or threaten public order.''  This is the latest example of how the French Government has taken steps which have negative effects on religious liberty. In 1996, the French Parliament placed the Institut Theologique de Nimes, a mainstream Baptist seminary closely connected to the Luther Rice Seminary in Atlanta, Georgia, on its list of so-called ``sects.'' Since then, libelous articles about the Institut have been published in newspapers. The articles were based on hearsay of dubious origin. In addition, the church connected with the Institut recently reported that a loan application was rejected for the reason that the church is on the Parliament's ``sect'' list. Members of the Institut have also apparently suffered discrimination from people in the region; according to report, at least one church member has lost her job due to her attendance.  Since the 1997 Belgian Parliament's report with the unofficial appendix listing 189 groups, the Belgian Government has moved ahead with plans to establish an ``Advice and Information Center on Dangerous Sects.'' It is my understanding that this center should be fully operational by the latter part of this year. According to Belgian officials at the Ministry of Justice, the new center will distribute official government views on the groups identified by the Parliament and may expand its inquiries to other groups not previously listed. A coalition of Belgian religious groups registered their concern at a press conference held in May 1998 in Brussels and continues to oppose the Belgian Government policies toward religious groups.  In Austria, a law restricting religious freedom became effective in January 1998. The law requires that a religious group prove a 20-year existence in Austria, have a creed distinct from previously registered groups, and have a membership of at least 0.02% of the population or 16,000 members before they are granted full rights under law. The Austrian Government's opinion that the government must ``approve'' religious belief before it is available for the public reveals a shocking retreat from democratic principles which encourage the free exchange of ideas and quality before the law for all religions or beliefs.  The tendency to increase control over religion or belief groups extends to Europe as a whole. Pan-European institutions such as the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly and the European Parliament have in the last year debated the role of government in controlling ``sects.'' The tone of these discussions has been ominous and proposals include instituting even more government controls over minority religions.  The people of the United States are deeply committed to religious liberty. The 105th Congress overwhelmingly passed the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. This act establishes an Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom and a nine-member Commission on International Religious Freedom who will monitor the status of religious freedom in foreign countries. Additionally, the Act encourages the President of the United States to become more thoroughly involved by regularly reporting to Congress on the state of religious liberty and by requiring the President to take specific actions against countries which violate this freedom.  Let me emphasize that the Act mandates U.S. Government action against not only countries engaged in persecution of religious believers, but also mandates U.S. Government action against countries that are actively intolerant of religious groups or those that allow societal intolerance to exist. The intolerant actions of Western European governments squarely are in the purview of the Act. The Commission, the Ambassador at Large, and the President are mandated to focus on issues of religious intolerance, and I encourage them to focus on the actions taken by Western European governments in light of international law an international commitments on religious liberty.  Clearly the actions taken by the Governments of France, Belgium, Germany, and Austria call into question the commitment those countries made to ``foster a climate of mutual tolerance and respect.'' I urge the Administration to continue raising these issues with the Governments of Western Europe to insure through law and governmental practice that religious freedoms for minorities are protected.                          ____________________
