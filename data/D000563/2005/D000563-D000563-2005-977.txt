We are about to consider whether we are going to shut down debate on this bill. It is called cloture. It closes down the debate on the bill, limits the amendments to the bill. As to the Senator's amendment, which protects these widows and surviving children of a soldier killed in combat, once we have closed down debate and limited amendments, would we still be able to vote on the Nelson amendment?
