Speaker, I want to say very seriously I have served along with the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier) for over 2 decades in this institution. I care a great deal about this institution, and the attacks made on this institution for the 14 years that I was in the majority and the assertions that were made and the characterization which I did not fully express on the floor that the minority whip made of Mr. Wright, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the names or the epithets that were used against him, there has never been an apology for that, notwithstanding this new information and new perspective that the Republican Party has gained now that they are in the majority and perhaps see the necessity to take actions that at some point in time they thought were corrupt, undemocratic, and undermining of civility.  We are not going to resolve this, but I will state that the gentleman and I have had discussions about comments the gentleman made about open rules, about amendments, about motions to recommit, about time for debate, about time for consideration prior to the Committee on Rules meeting and reporting out bills, and that perspective, as has been noted in our discussions in the Committee on Rules, has somewhat changed.
