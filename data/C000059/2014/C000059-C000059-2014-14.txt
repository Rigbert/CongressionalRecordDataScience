Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an organization whose dedication and contributions to the Southern California community are exceptional. For the past 40 years, Guide Dogs of the Desert have tirelessly committed themselves to the service of the legally blind community. We have all heard the age-old adage, ``a dog is a man's best friend,'' but a guide dog is so much more than a best friend. Guide dogs are essential to the legally blind in ways that are simple, such as crossing the street to go grocery shopping, and ways that can be more complex, like airplane travel. These dogs dedicate their lives so that the blind may see, and in light of all they have done for the community, I would like to recognize these faithful and dutiful animals as well as their equally devoted trainers and volunteers at Guide Dogs of the Desert.  Founded in 1972, Guide Dogs of the Desert was built on the premise that every legally blind person should have the opportunity to adopt a guide dog, regardless of the depths of their hardship. This dream could only be made into a reality because of the amazing volunteers that give their time and effort to this organization's mission. These volunteers selflessly provide love, food, shelter, discipline and socialization to puppies that are just beginning on their journey toward guide dog graduation. The fingerprints of these individuals are found at every juncture of this organization. Among many other responsibilities, these volunteers take in 12 week-old puppies, assist with student interaction to increase awareness in the community, and complete the basic office tasks that allow Guide Dogs of the Desert to run smoothly. These individuals go above and beyond the call of duty to help those visually impaired come one step closer to independence and today they deserve commendation.  While many of us know the pleasure of canine companionship and loyalty from our family pet, we cannot appreciate the complexity of the relationship that develops between a visually impaired person and their guide dog. These dogs help these individuals in such a wide variety of ways, and their service enriches these lives powerfully, improving their daily quality of life. With over 1,000 dogs trained, many of these success stories may be found scattered throughout the Nation.  The organization's tireless passion for service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the visually impaired community. Although there are many schools, Guide Dogs of the Desert is one of the most exceptional. As one guide dog recipient stated, ``Frankly, all of the schools do an adequate job in developing extraordinary animals, but only Guide Dogs of the Desert adapts the training according to the very special needs of the people with multiple disabilities, veterans and even difficult cases like mine.'' I am certain that many more individuals and families are grateful for the guide dogs, the volunteers, and the organization itself for all of their services and I salute their efforts moving forward into their fourth decade of dedicated assistance.                          ____________________
