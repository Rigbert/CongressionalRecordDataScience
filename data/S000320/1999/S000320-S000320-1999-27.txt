 President, I am pleased that today the Senate has the opportunity to consider the conference agreement for the Fiscal Year 2000 Transportation Appropriations bill, and expect that we will reinforce the Senate's strong support for this legislation, which was passed just 18 days ago by a vote of 95 to 0.  The Transportation Appropriations bill provides more than $50 billion for transportation infrastructure funding, and for safe travel and transportation in the air and on our nation's highways, railroads, coasts and rivers. I am pleased that we have reached an accommodation between the House and the Senate Conferees on the Transportation appropriations bill. The House didn't win on every issue, the Senate didn't win on every issue, the Administration didn't get everything that they wanted--there was a fair amount of give and take on the part of all interested parties and I am confident that the result is a balanced package that is responsive to the priorities of the Congress and of the administration.  The 302(b) allocation was tight and constrained our ability to do some things that I would have liked to do-- but we have stayed within the allocation agreed to by the House and the Senate and we have a bill that the Administration will sign. I believe this bill represents a balanced approach and a model for how appropriations bills should be constructed. It stays within the allocation, it stays pretty close to the budget request with the exception of denying new user fee taxes and making some firewall shifts that the authorizing committee objected to, it adheres to the commitment made in TEA-21 on dedicated funding for Highways and Transit, it provides adequate--but constrained--levels for FAA, it maintains a credible Coast Guard capital base and operational tempo, and it continues to focus on making further strides in increasing the safety of all our transportation systems.  At the same time, Chairman Wolf, Ranking Member Sabo, the senior Senator from New Jersey and I have gone to great lengths to craft a bill that accommodates the requests of members and funds their priorities. Scarcely a day passes where one member or another does not call, write, or collar me on the floor to advocate for a project, a program, or a particular transportation priority for their state. I received over 1,500 separate Senate requests in letter form over the last six months. This bill attempts to respond to as many of those requests as possible.  As many of you know, the current fiscal constraints were especially felt in the transit account, where demand for mass transit systems is growing in every state, but funding is fixed by the TEA-21 firewall. I won't belabor that point other than to say we did the best we could under very difficult circumstances.  It has been a constant challenge this year to ensure adequate funding for FAA operations, facilities, equipment and research, and for the Airport Improvement Program; for the Coast Guard operations and capital accounts; and for operating funds for the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration. This clearly illustrates the pitfalls of firewalls and the disadvantages of trying to manage annual outlays in multi-year authorization legislation. Our experience this year with this bill is one of many reasons the Congress should reject a proposal to establish more budgetary firewalls around trust fund accounts in the future.  I want to mention one other issue that has been the topic of many conversations over the past couple of weeks. That is, the Senate provision concerning the release of personal information by state departments of motor vehicles. My concern is that private information is too available. The proliferation of information over the Internet makes it easy and cheap for almost anyone to access very personal information.  I think members would be shocked by what virtually anyone--including wierdos or stalkers--can find out about you, your wife, or your children with only a rudimentary knowledge of how to search the Internet.  I believe that there should be a presumption that personal information will be kept confidential, unless there is compelling state need to disclose that information. Most states, however, readily make this information available, and because states sell this information, a lot of information about you effectively comes from public records.  Section 350 of the conference protects personal information from broad distribution by requiring express consent prior to the release of information in two situations. First, individuals must give their consent before a state is able to release photographs, social security numbers, and medical or disability information. Of course, this excludes law enforcement and others acting on behalf of the government. Second, individuals must give their consent before the state can sell or release other personal information when that information is disseminated for the purpose of direct marketing or solicitations. I want to be clear: this applies only when the state sells your name, address, and other such information to people who are using that information for marketing purposes.  We recognize that states may need time to comply with this provision. And we've proposed to delay the effective date 9 months. In addition, there was concern expressed about this provision being tied to transportation funds under this bill, and the conference agreement eliminates the sanction language and expressly states that no states' fund may be withheld because of non-compliance with this provision. In addition, the Congressional Budget Office has performed a cost estimate analysis of this provision, and found that the total implementation cost for States is well below $50 million nationally.  I believe that the general public would be as shocked as my colleagues in the Senate if they learned that states were running a business with the personal information from motor vehicle records.  There are a few people I would particularly like to thank before we vote. My Ranking Member, Senator Lautenberg, has been a valued partner in this process, and I'm sorry that we only have one more year to do this together. Senators Stevens and Byrd have provided guidance throughout the year, and made a successful bill possible by ensuring an adequate allocation for transportation programs. My House counterpart, Congressman Frank Wolf and his staff: John Blazey, Rich Efford, Stephanie Gupta and Linda Muir, have been professional, accommodating, and collegial. This last week has been a blueprint for how conference negotiations should be conducted. Senator Lott and his staff have been gracious and extremely helpful in moving this legislation forward. And on the Appropriations Committee staff, I want to recognize Steve Cortese and Jay Kimmitt for their invaluable assistance and advice.  I look forward to passing this bill and sending it to the President. I ask unanimous consent that the letter from OMB relating to this conference report be printed in the Congressional Record at the end of my remarks and after the table regarding federal highway aid. From the OMB letter, it is my expectation that the President will sign the bill in its current form.  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to include the following table for the Record which shows the estimated fiscal year 2000 distribution of Federal highway fund obligational authority. This table illustrates the state-by-state distribution of non-discretionary highway funds under the conference agreement. It is important to note that none of the discretionary programs, including public lands highways, Indian reservation roads, park roads and parkways, or discretionary bridge are included in this distribution, as these funds are granted on an individual application basis. In addition, these figures do not include the carryover balances from prior years, the final computation of administrative takedown, or the final minimum guarantee adjustments. However, these figures are very close to the actual state distribution that will be made by the Federal Highway Administration based on the agreement outlined in the conference report.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION--ESTIMATED FY 2000 DISTRIBUTION OF OBLIGATIONAL AUTHORITY (INCLUDING DISTRIBUTION OF                  RABA UNDER CONFERENCE PROPOSAL AND DISTRIBUTION OF $98.5 MILLION IN ADMINISTRATIVE TAKEDOWN FUNDS FOR OTHER

Washington, DC, September 29, 1999.     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,     Chairman, Subcommittee on Transportation and Related          Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, United States          Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The purpose of this letter is to provide      the Administration's views on the Transportation and Related      Agencies Appropriations Bill, FY 2000, as passed by the House      and by the Senate. As the conferees develop a final version      of the bill, we ask you to consider the Administration's      views.       The Administration appreciates the House and Senate's      efforts to accommodate many of the Administration's      priorities within their 302(b) allocations and the difficult      choices made necessary by those allocations. However, the      allocations of discretionary resources available under the      Congressional Budget Resolution are simply inadequate to make      the necessary investments that our citizens need and expect.       The President's FY 2000 Budget proposes levels of      discretionary spending that meet such needs while conforming      to the Bipartisan Budget Agreement by making savings      proposals in mandatory and other programs available to help      finance this spending. Congress has approved and the      President has signed into law nearly $29 billion of such      offsets in appropriations legislation since 1995. The      Administration urges the Congress to consider other, similar      proposals as the FY 2000 appropriations process moves      forward. With respect to this bill in particular, the      Administration urges the Congress to consider the President's      proposals for user fees.       Both the House and Senate versions of the bill raise      serious funding concerns. First, both versions of the bill      underfund the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's)      operations and modernization programs, reduce highway and      motor carrier safety, and underfund other important programs.      The conferees could partially accommodate the funding      increases recommended below for these programs by adhering      more closely to the President's requests for the Airport      Improvement Program, High Speed Rail, Coast Guard Alteration      of Bridges, Coast Guard capital improvements, and other      programs.       In addition, both the House and Senate have reduced      requested funding for important safety, mobility, and      environmental requirements. The Administration proposes to      meet these requirements through the reallocation of a portion      of the increased spending resulting from higher-than-     anticipated highway excise tax revenues. Under this proposal,      every State would still receive at least as much funding as      was assumed when the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st      Century was enacted. The conferees are encouraged to consider      the Administration's proposal as a means to fund these      important priorities.       The Administration's specific concerns with both the House      and Senate versions of the bill are discussed below.                   aviation safety and modernization       The funding provided by the House and the Senate is not      sufficient to meet the rising demand for air traffic      services.  The Administration strongly urges the conferees to fully fund the President's request for FAA Operations. The request consists of $5,958 million to maintain current operations and $81 million to meet increased air traffic and safety demands. Neither bill provides sufficient resources to maintain current service levels, let alone meet increased demands.       The Administration urges the conferees to provide at least      the House level for the FAA's Facilities and Equipment      account. The Senate reduction, including the rescission,      would seriously compromise the FAA's ability to modernize the      air traffic control system. At the Senate level, safety and      security projects would be delayed or canceled, and      critically-needed capacity enhancing projects would be      postponed, increasing future air travel delays. In addition,      the conferees are urged to provide the requested $17 million      in critically-needed funds for implementation of a Global      Positioning System (GPS) modernization plan to help enable      transition to a more efficient, GPS-based air navigation      system. This is a top priority, and the conferees are asked      to fund this in addition to the FAA's other capital needs.       The Administration supports the decision, in both Houses,      to eliminate the General Fund subsidy for FAA Operations and      urges the conferees to enact the Administration's proposal to      finance the agency. Such a system would improve the FAA's      efficiency and effectiveness by creating new incentives for      it to operate in a business-like manner.                             cafe standards       The Administration strongly opposes, and urges the      conferees to drop, the House bill's prohibition of work on      the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. These      standards have resulted in a doubling of the fuel economy of      the car fleet, saving the Nation billions of gallons of oil      and the consumer billions of dollars. Because prohibitions      such as this have been enacted in recent years, the      Department of Transportation has been unable to analyze this      important issue fully. These prohibitions have limited the      availability of important information that directly      influences the Nation's environment.                          livability programs       The Administration is very disappointed that both versions      of the bill fund transit formula grants at $212 million below      the President's request and the Transportation and Community      and Preservation Pilot Program at approximately $24 million      below the request. Further, the Administration is      disappointed that the House bill does not direct additional      funding to the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality      Improvement program. These programs are important components      of the Administration's efforts to provide communities with      the tools and resources needed to combat congestion, air      pollution and sprawl. The Administration also objects to the      addition of unrequested and unreviewed projects within the      Transportation and Community and Privatization Pilot Program      formula grants. The conferees are strongly urged to fully      fund the President's request for these programs.                             highway safety       The Administration urges the conferees to provide funding      consistent with the recently enacted reauthorization for the      National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's operations      and research activities. This would provide an increase of      $20 million above the House and Senate funding levels. This      funding would allow expanded Buckle Up America and Partners      in Progress efforts to meet alcohol and belt usage goals. It      would also provide enhanced crash data collection, increased      defects investigations, and crucial research activities on      advanced air bags, crashworthiness, and enhanced testing to      make better car safety information more readily available to      the public.                          motor carrier safety       The Administration appreciates the Senate bill's funding of      $155 million, the amended request, for the National Motor      Carrier Safety Grant Program. This will allow the Office of      Motor Carrier and Highway Safety to undertake improvements in      the area of motor carrier enforcement, research, and data      collection activities that are designed to increase safety on      our Nation's roads and highways. The Administration strongly      urges the conferees to continue to provide this funding as      well as the additional $5.8 million requested for motor      carrier operations.                     job access and reverse commute       The Administration is disappointed that both the House and      Senate would provide only $75 million--half of the amount      authorized and requested--for the Job Access and Reverse      Commute program. This program is a critical component of the      Administration's welfare-to-work effort and local demands far      exceed available resources. Demand is expected to increase      further as more communities around the country work together      to address the transportation challenges faced by families      moving from welfare to work and by other low income workers.      The Administration urges the conferees to provide full      funding at $150 million.                        office of the secretary       The Administration urges the conferees to provide the      President's request of $63 million for the Office of the      Secretary in a consolidated account and delete the limitation      on political appointees in both bills. This is necessary to      provide the Secretary with the resources and flexibility to      manage the Department effectively. In addition, we request      restoration of the seven-percent reduction to the Office of      Civil Rights contained in the Senate version of the bill.      This reduction would hamper the Department's ability to      enforce laws prohibiting discrimination in Federally operated      and assisted transportation programs.                          language provisions       The conferees are requested to delete provisions in both      bills that would restrict the Coast Guard's and Federal      Aviation Administration's user fee authority. User fees can      help the Coast Guard and Federal Aviation Administration by      providing resources to meet their operating and capital needs      without significantly reducing other vital transportation      programs.       The conferees are requested to delete provisions in both      versions of the bill that would impose DOT-wide reductions in      obligations to the Transportation Administrative Service      Center. These reductions, which are particularly severe in      the Senate, would impose significant constraints on critical      administrative programs.       The conferees are requested to delete Section 316 of the      Senate bill, which would extend the traditional anti-lobbying      provision in DOT appropriations acts to State legislatures.      This broad, ambiguous provision would chill the informational      activities of the Department and limit the ability of the      Department to carry out its safety mandate. The existing      requirements of Section 7104 of TEA-21 adequately address      this issue.       There are several provisions in both bills that purport to      require congressional approval before Executive Branch      execution of aspects of the bill. The Administration will      interpret such provisions to require notification only, since      any other interpretation would contradict the Supreme Court      ruling in INS versus Chadha.                         report language issue       The Administration is concerned with the House report      language that would not fund the controller-in-charge      differential, which was part of the carefully crafted air      traffic controller agreement research last year.       We look forward to working with the Committee to address      our mutual concerns.           Sincerely,                                           Jacob J. Lew, Director.
