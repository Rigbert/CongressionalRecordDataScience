Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, the previous speaker either did not hear clearly the comments that were made, or has misrepresented them. I choose the former as the alternative.  What I said was that an American citizen has the right to go to court to question the constitutionality under which someone is asking that citizen to do something. In this case, that citizen has done so. The court just 8 days ago, I would say to the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. Barr], decided that they did have the constitutional right, and 8 days later, we demand that the U.S. Attorney take action, without giving the U.S. Attorney the opportunity to do so.  I think that is a precipitous and uncalled for action of this body sworn to uphold and defend the Constitution. That is what I said, I say to the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. Barr].
