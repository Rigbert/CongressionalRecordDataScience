Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong opposition to H.R. 1. I believe in Medicare, I believe that Medicare is a sacred trust between the Federal Government and the American people. I believe with all my heart, with all my soul, and with all my being that Medicare must have a dependable, affordable, and strong prescription drug benefit. And that is why I cannot support this bill.  Mr. Speaker, 38 years ago the Republicans did not like Medicare and they do not like it now. Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich gleefully stated that he wanted to see Medicare wither on the vine. Mr. Speaker, my colleagues, Newt Gingrich is back, and his fingerprints are all over this bill.  If this bill is passed, it would be a dagger in the heart of Medicare as we know it. This bill is an attempt by the Republican party to privatize Medicare. I stand against privatizing Medicare, and I stand against this bill.  Medicare is a sacred trust. It is a covenant with our seniors. Let us not breach this trust. Let us not violate this covenant. We must do what is right.  I urge my colleagues to vote against this unreliable bill, vote for the seniors, vote for those that are in need. Vote against this bill.
