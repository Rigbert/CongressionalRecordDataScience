Chairman, I support competition, and these competitions, as a whole, have been beneficial to the Department of Defense.  The OMB has reported that, regardless of whether the Federal Government or the private contractor win the competition, the act of competition alone has saved or generated a cost savings up to 10 to 40 percent--10 to 40 percent, just having the competition.  This amendment would block opportunities for the defense industrial base, protect the status quo within the DOD civilian workforce, prevent cost savings at the DOD, and negate the natural innovation that comes from competition.  I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.
