President, last Sunday, the Republic of Haiti held parliamentary and local elections. These were the first elections in Haiti since the United States forced Raoul Cedras and his henchmen to abandon power and allow the return of democratically elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide last fall.  These elections were the first test of President Aristide's commitment to establish real democracy in Haiti, and they were watched closely by the international community.  Mr. President, the elections were far from perfect. The selection of candidates leading up to the election was not as open, well-organized, and impartial as many of us would have liked. Some voting stations opened late. Some station workers were not paid their promised salaries and did not execute their responsibilities conscientiously. Some voters were not given full privacy in voting and there were some reports of voter intimidation. Some ballots were lost or miscounted.  These irregularities were unfortunate, although given Haiti's tragic history, not unexpected. But the fact that these elections were imperfect in no way confirms, as some would suggest, that President Aristide and his government are insincere in their expressions of commitment to true democracy, or that the administration's policy there has failed. Far from it.  Let us be realistic. Haiti is the poorest country in this hemisphere. So many people are illiterate that the ballots had to carry symbols to identify the different parties. Many villages cannot be reached by road at all. The only highway across the country is literally impassible except by 4-wheel-drive. Most of the people have had no experience at all with democracy and have only the vaguest notion of what it means and how it should work.  In a country like Haiti today, the conduct of elections cannot possibly be perfect. Some mistakes and malpractice are inevitable.  But one must start somewhere, and the fact that these elections were held at all is an important achievement. Even more important, indeed historic, is that fact that there was practically no violence. We should remember past elections in that country, where the Government and its armed thugs intimidated, beat, and murdered in cold blood people waiting in line to vote.  The real question, Mr. President, is whether the Haitian people are satisfied. My perception is that the vast majority of the Haitian people feel that they took an important step forward with this election, and one more step away from the atrocities of the past. We owe it to those people now to help them get to work on the next step.  I want to commend President Clinton, General Shalikashvili, who has been to Haiti many times over the past couple of years, Secretary Christopher and others, who had the patience and sense of history to devote the attention and effort that they have to the cause of democracy in Haiti.  In a hemisphere where the trend is decidedly in favor of elected civilian government, I do not believe the United States could ignore the brutality in Haiti. Our resolve there in support of the Haitian people's yearning for a better life, has sent a strong signal in support of democratic government throughout the hemisphere.                          ____________________
