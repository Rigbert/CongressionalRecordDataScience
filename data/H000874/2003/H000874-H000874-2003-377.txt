 What impediments would you see to us having a substitute to the pension bill that is offered?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will continue to yield, I am not advised nor do I contemplate any impediment whatsoever, particularly on a pension bill. As the gentleman knows, on a bill that comes from the Committee on Ways and Means, particularly when it deals with the Tax Code, it is always and has always been a closely held bill because any amendment or any substitute has long-ranging implications and consequences. And so the Ways and Means bills have always been held. In the case of a pension bill, it is pretty straightforward. If the minority has a substitute that is germane to the bill, certainly we will give it every consideration.
