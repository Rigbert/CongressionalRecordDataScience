 President, I am offering this amendment on behalf of the Senator from Illinois, Mark Kirk, because the time has come for our country to sanction the Central Bank of Iran.  It has become commonplace for political leaders to state that an Iranian regime armed with nuclear weapons is unacceptable. President Obama has stated that an Iranian regime armed with a nuclear weapon is unacceptable. Unfortunately, the Iranian regime has not been deterred from conducting activities relevant to the development of such an explosive device.  The report of the IAEA of November 8, 2011, makes clear that Iran has worked on the development of an indigenous design of a nuclear weapon, including the testing of components, and that Iran has yet to answer all of the IAEA's questions concerning the military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program.  Last month, the world learned of the Quds Force plot to assassinate the Ambassador of Saudi Arabia to the United States.  Iran remains undeterred, and the United States is left with fewer options for dealing with the Iranian nuclear program as time elapses.  This amendment by Senator Kirk from Illinois would add to the current sanctions against Iran by targeting the central bank of that country. This, in my judgment, is one of the few remaining actions, short of an embargo of Iranian shipping and military intervention, to slow or end the Iranian nuclear program. It is worth supporting and pursuing.  I yield the floor.
