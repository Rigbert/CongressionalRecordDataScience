Woodson and the Origins of Multiculturalism. Dr. Woodson's life and words remind us, as Americans, that in order to continue to move forward, we must take the time to reflect on the past.  The theme for this year's Black History Month, Carter G. Woodson and the Origins of Multiculturalism, is a reminder that in striving for a greater society, we must examine the past. A brilliant author, publisher, and historian, Dr. Woodson understood that history was much more than facts on a page, but rather a detailed account and interpretation of the struggles and achievements of society as a whole. It was this belief that motivated Dr. Woodson to author many books and publish many articles on the outstanding contributions of so many proud and courageous African Americans.  Dr. Woodson's belief in the importance of historical study played a critical role in preserving the rich history of African Americans throughout the United States. His efforts led to the foundation of Negro History Week, which would later become Black History Month. His writings and teachings encourage not only African Americans, but all Americans, to reflect on, become educated about, and treasure these outstanding efforts. Dr. Woodson has also been seen by many other historians as a true inspiration. In the First Congressional District, I am proud to represent organizations such as the Interfaith Federation of Northwest Indiana, under the leadership of Executive Director Patricia Jackson, and the Gary Frontiers Service Club, under the leadership of President Oliver J. Gilliam, which have carried on such important ideals, reiterating the need for merging cultural beliefs and tradition and coming together to reflect on the past in seeking to improve the future.  It is the efforts of organizations like the Interfaith Federation and the Gary Frontiers Service Club that allow us to reflect on what makes the United States of America so special. Nowhere else in the world do you find such an integrated society. While the United States is made up of people from so many different cultural, religious, social, and ideological backgrounds, it is our freedom and our ability to share our backgrounds with each other that is the true testament to the American way of life.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my distinguished colleagues join me in honoring Dr. Carter G. Woodson, the Interfaith Federation, the Gary Frontiers Service Club and the many organizations throughout the United States that continue to preserve the African American heritage for all Americans. Through their words and teachings, these honorable individuals and organizations remind us all of the struggles and accomplishments that African Americans have made to lead us to where we are as a Nation today, while reminding us that there is still progress to be made.                          ____________________
