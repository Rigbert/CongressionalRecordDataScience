Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Shays-Meehan bill. Now is the time for us to do what is right. It is time to remove the corrupting influence of soft money from the political process. It is time to open up the political process and let the average person come in and participate. It is time to let all of our citizens have an equal voice.  We must pass Shays-Meehan to lessen the people's growing cynicism. Soft money and big campaign contributions have polluted the political process. When people give $50,000 or $100,000 to candidates, they expect something, and, most of the time, they get something for it. We are sending the wrong message to the American people. It is time for us to enact real reform. It is time to restore the people's faith in their government.  This bill is good for America. It is not just good for the political parties, for Democrats and Republicans, it is good for our country.
