President, I wish to commend Minot Consolidated School in Minot, ME, on being named a 2015 National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence. This year, Minot Consolidated was one of only 335 schools across the country and one of only two schools from Maine to receive this prestigious recognition of high accomplishment by the U.S. Department of Education.  Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon Schools award honors schools that are either academically superior in their States or that demonstrate significant gains in student achievement. The schools singled out for this national recognition are models of high educational standards and accountability.  With just 240 students from prekindergarten to sixth grade, Minot Consolidated takes pride in a strong sense of community that contributes to the success of its students. Staff, families, and community members have come together to create a welcoming school environment where students are challenged, motivated, and rewarded for good work. Self-confidence and personal responsibility are strongly encouraged and have produced positive results for Minot Consolidated's high-achieving student body.  I am pleased that the U.S. Department of Education has selected Minot Consolidated School for this well-deserved honor and congratulate not only the students, but also the administrators, teachers, staff, and parents on this outstanding achievement. Together, they are making a difference in the lives of hundreds of students by helping them become energetic learners and engaged citizens.                          ____________________
