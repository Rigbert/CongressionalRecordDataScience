Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in paying tribute to Detective John Michael Gibson and Private First Class Jacob Joseph Chestnut of the United States Capitol Police who lost their lives Friday, July 24, 1998 defending the United States Capitol, the tourists who visit it, and the Members and staff who serve there. It is thanks to their dedication to duty that an already tragic day did not result in additional loss of life. It is thanks to their heroism, and the heroism of their fellow United States Capitol Police Officers, that the People's House is and can remain open to the American people.  Today, flags fly at half staff over the United States Capitol to honor the fallen officers. Officer Chestnut, an 18 year veteran of the U.S. Capitol Police, had served in the U.S. Air Force. Detective Gibson was an 8 year veteran who was assigned to the dignitary protection division of the Capitol Police. Both officers leave behind a wife and children, as well as countless family and friends. At this very difficult time, it is my hope that they will find some solace in knowing that their loved ones died protecting America's hard-won freedom. Of this, they can be proud.  Friday's criminal act should not result in calls to close the Capitol and have Congress work away from the citizens it represents. Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson gave their lives so the American people can visit their Capitol and see their Congress at work. The officers' sacrifice cannot have been made in vain.  My thoughts and prayers, along with those of every Member of this House, are with the fallen officers and their families at this difficult time. Detective Gibson and Officer Chestnut served their country well. The service and heroism they displayed is exemplary, and we will always be thankful for the sacrifice they made.
