Speaker, I rise today in honor of the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater's Warhawks, who won the NCAA Division III World Series on May 27, 2014. The Warhawks, led by pitcher Scott Plaza and Head Coach John Vodenlich, displayed a tremendous amount of grit, determination, skill, and athleticism throughout their outstanding 44-7 season, which culminated in a resounding 7-0 win over Emory University in the championship game. With this victory, the UW-Whitewater athletic program accomplished something no other NCAA team has ever done before: sweep the three major men's sports championships in one year.  The success of the UW-Whitewater baseball team has made the residents of Wisconsin proud and I salute the entire team: Daytona Bryden, Dylan Bersch, Jordan Kuczynski, Matt Langlie, Austin Jones, Colin Grove, Nick Kuhlmann, Hayden Fenner, Kyle Haen, Trey Cannon, Dylan Friend, Mike Nompleggi, Mikole Pierce, Austin Finn, Trent Diekvoss, Curtis Morgan, Donnie Manke, Steve Chamberlain, Jared Fon, Adam Gregory, Justin Mortensen, John Olejniczak, Mike Mierow, Brock Liston, Michael Gonzalez, Casey Power, Andrew Lowe, Connor Hurst, Scott Plaza, and Matt Roberts.  Winning a national championship is never easy. On behalf of my congressional office and my constituents in Wisconsin's fifth district, I commend the coaches and players at UW-Whitewater for their hard work and dedication, and wish them continued success in the future.                          ____________________
