Let me read three lines that were the offer of the President of the United States in substitution of the language that was in the CR, because I think it accomplishes what the gentleman from Florida just articulated.       The goal of the negotiations is to enact a budget agreement      that balances the budget in 7 years under Congressional      Budget Office's economic assumptions, or in a timeframe and      under economic assumptions agreed to by the negotiators.  Your side did not like the last phrase, because it did not bind the President to the CBO assumptions. As the gentleman knows, he believes the CBO assumptions are not correct. There are many private sector economic analysts who also believe they are more conservative in terms of growth and other statistics.  Having said that, this language says 7 years, CBO as a basis, and it does leave, yes, some options for the negotiators to go beyond that. Clearly, it is not exactly what you wanted. But I suggest to my friend, it was offered in good faith to try to get to where your side believes we ought to go, and that is 7 years. I agree with that.
