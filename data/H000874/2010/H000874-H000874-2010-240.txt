We are about to do that now. The gentleman from Michigan, my dear friend, Dale Kildee, is the epitome of gentleman. I don't think there is a person in this House that doesn't think that Dale Kildee is a thoughtful, considerate, compassionate gentleman, a person who cares deeply about his country, cares deeply about the Page program to which he has devoted so much of his talents, and cares about each one of us.  None of us are objective in talking about Dale Kildee because he is such a decent, wonderful, good human being. He is also an extraordinarily faithful Member of this House.  I am going to yield to Mr. Dingell, the Dean of the House, at this point as we are about to witness Mr. Kildee casting his 20,000th vote in the House of Representatives.
