Speaker, I would like to rise in support of the resolution and to say that I would merely beg the leadership to allow this vote to occur, because over 228 of our Members have asked for it. I think to bottle this up and not allow a vote is truly not in the best spirit of this House when in fact the Constitution provides that trade-making authority rests in the House, in the Congress, and all revenue measures begin here in the House. With what is going to happen at the end of the month in Seattle and the beginning of December, we want to send a strong message to our trade negotiators, we do not want them opening up the antidumping and countervailing duty provisions of our trade laws.  No industry in this country has suffered more than the steel industry and been forced to restructure. It has the most modern production in the world. Yet we continue to lose thousands and thousands of jobs, even over this last year. It is absolutely essential that our negotiators hear this, and it is not the executive branch's responsibility, it is our responsibility to enforce the laws that we pass. And so we ask and beg of the leadership of this institution, please allow us to bring up this resolution which allows us to instruct our negotiators as the Constitution intended. There are 228 Members of this institution that want to be allowed to be given voice and this resolution brought to the floor. I rise in strong support of the resolution.
