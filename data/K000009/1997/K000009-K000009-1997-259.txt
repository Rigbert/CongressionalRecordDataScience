Speaker, it's spring, and that means the gypsy moths are back, hatching by the millions, causing severe damage to trees and our environment, and leaving much debris in their paths. Lucas County is the first urban community in our State to be affected in such a major way by these insects that all migrate down here from Michigan.  We must act expeditiously, and neighborhoods must work together to apply safe biological controls in order to protect our trees, homes, businesses, yards, and parks. A local task force has been set up to coordinate help for our region.  The gypsy moths will never be eliminated completely, but it can be controlled.  Its life cycle has four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult moth. The female moth lays egg masses in July and August in clusters of up to 1,000. While most eggs are laid on the bark of trees, females also will lay clusters in any sheltered location, including homes, vehicles, firewood, playground equipment, and stones. Egg masses are beige and about the size of a quarter.  Larvae (in the form of caterpillars) emerge the following April and May and begin devouring leaves. The caterpillar stage lasts for 10 to 12 weeks. Caterpillars are 1\1/2\ to 2\1/2\ inches long when full grown, with hairlike structuresalong their length of their body. They are grayish with five pairs of blue spots and six pairs of red spots along their backs. They also have yellow markings on their heads.  Oak trees are the favorite food of the gypsy moths, but they also feed on 500 different species of trees and shrubs. And because northwest Ohio is known for its hardwood forests, we are the targets of hungry gypsy moth larvae.  The answer is not for individuals to spray their own trees and yards with harmful toxic pesticides. In fact, toxics could do more harm then good when thousands of citizens act independently.  Call the Lucus County Agricultural Extension Office at 245-4254 or the Agriculture Business Enhancement Center at 1-800-358-4678 to learn what you can do to control these destructive insects.  You can help by getting your local Boy Scout and Girl Scout troops or other community groups to collect signatures to give the State of Ohio permission to spray affected areas with safe biological control agents. This approach can save you money. If you decide to spray your property on your own--which can be expensive--then use only licensed, certified professional firms that have been trained to handle the proper control agents safely and responsibly.                          ____________________
