They passed a bill 68-30. They sent it here, and it was blocked from coming to the floor. And it would have passed.  If you believe, as you asked me, do I believe, should we consider things, the answer, of course, is yes.  And I said, as an aside, Peter King, the former chairman of the Homeland Security Committee has two bills that are supported by over 85 percent of the American public. Bring them to the floor on the premise, Mr. Speaker, that we ought to debate, consider, and vote. Bring them to the floor. Bring Mr. King's bills to the floor. Bring the Senate bill. You know the Senate bill has 68 votes.  Mr. Speaker, I will tell the majority leader that, had he brought the Senate bill to the floor--we were precluded from voting on the Senate bill, Mr. Speaker. The majority leader just said, Oh, we ought to bring the bill to the floor. Isn't that the right thing to do? Well, if it is right for the Senate--and we can't control the Senate, but we can control the House. And, as a matter of fact, Mr. Speaker, as you know, I was the majority leader, and I could decide whether to bring the bills on the floor or not bring them on the floor. The majority leader has that authority.  Bring the Senate bill to the floor. If, in fact, as the majority leader just said we ought to have debate, we ought to consider it, and we ought to vote, and if it goes down, fine; if it passes, that is the will of the House--will of the Senate, you said. If that is a good premise in the Senate, it is an even better premise in the House of Representatives.  So, Mr. Speaker, I ask my friend, the majority leader, to bring that bill to the floor. Let's vote on it. That is what he said his premise was and what we were committed to. I agree with him.  I don't like the filibuster. I don't like the 60-vote rule in the Senate, I will tell you that. The 60-vote rule undermines democracy. If a bill has 50 percent and a committee reports it out, it ought to come to the floor. I agree with the majority leader on that. And Mr. Reid and I have had some discussions on that. My colleague Senator Cardin and I have had some discussions on that.  But if it is good for the Senate, it is good for the House. And the House does that. The majority can rule in this House. And if he brings that bill to the floor, it will pass. It will pass on Monday, I guarantee the gentleman.  And I know we need to conclude this. In all consideration, Ms. Kelly is coming over to explain to me schedules.  But this is serious, and I don't say this--the majority leader and I do work together. But let's pass this Zika bill, as the Senate passed it, and then have the arguments on stuff that we don't agree on. We do agree on the Senate bill, at least to the extent it goes, and there are things that we don't agree.  To make an aside, you stripped the Confederate Flag amendment from the conference report on the MILCON bill because you didn't want your guys to vote on it. Mr. Speaker, I understand that. That is why it was done. I didn't like that, but that passed the House, stripped out of the bill, not by the Senate, but by us. But that is an aside.  It is an aside because, you are right, Mr. Speaker, the majority leader is right, that doesn't affect Zika. What affects Zika is that $1.1 billion that we can get to them on Monday, Mr. Speaker. If the majority leader will bring it to the floor, we can pass it on suspension.  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the majority leader's discussion on this matter, but we have some critical issues, Mr. Speaker, that we need to deal with: funding government, getting Zika passed, helping the people in Flint, funding opioids. We passed a bill. It was a good bill. The President signed it. We passed it in a bipartisan way, but we didn't fund it. Another health crisis.  We need to address these critical matters. These other bills may have merit, but they are not a crisis.  Mr. Speaker, unless the majority leader wants to say something further, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________
