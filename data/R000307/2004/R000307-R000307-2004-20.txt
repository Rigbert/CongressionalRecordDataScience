I got wound up pretty good.  I have one more page, and the Senator from Pennsylvania asked how long will that take? How about 2 minutes, 3 minutes.  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Kansas be permitted an additional 3 minutes, to be followed by the Senator from Virginia for 12 minutes.
