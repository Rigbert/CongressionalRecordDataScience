Speaker, today, I, along with over 100 of my colleagues, introduced the Maintain United States Trade (MUST) Law Resolution. This resolution will send a clear message to our trading partners that the President and the Congress will maintain our antidumping and countervailing duty laws. This measure will put the House on record as opposing the renegotiation of these critical trade laws at the upcoming Seattle round of the World Trade Organization. These laws are the cornerstone of a free and fair open market policy, and represent one of the few means of redress for American producers and workers.  According to the U.S. International Trade Association, as of March 1, 1999, over 290 products from 59 different countries were under antidumping and countervailing duty orders. Following my statement are a list of over 120 of these products. Throughout the steel crisis, antidumping and countervailing duty laws have represented one of the few means of relief for American steel workers. These laws are far reaching and affect countless products throughout the United States. It is imperative that the administration uphold these important trade laws at the WTO Seattle Round.  The World Trade Organization's Ministerial Conference, to be held in Seattle from November 30 to December 3, 1999, will launch a new round of trade negotiations. These talks will focus on reshaping WTO rules regarding agriculture, services, and intellectual property. However, many foreign countries are seeking to expand the agenda in order to debate the WTO's antidumping and countervailing duty laws. The MUST Law Resolution will allow the Administration to attend the Seattle negotiations with a unified statement from the Congress declaring that the United States must not agree to reopen negotiations on any antidumping and countervailing duty laws.  The MUST Law Resolution will call upon the President to not participate in any international negotiation in which antidumping and antisubsidy rules are part of the negotiation agenda, refrain from submitting for congressional approval agreements that require changes to the current antidumping and countervailing duty laws and enforcement policies of the United States, and enforce the antidumping and countervailing duty laws vigorously in all pending and future cases.  We, as elected members of Congress, have the obligation to protect American producers and workers from unfair foreign trade practices. Consequently, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor and support this resolution to protect free and fair trade.                         agricultural products       Canned Pineapple Fruit, In Shell Pistachios, Fresh      Kiwifruit, Fresh, Chilled and Frozen Pork, Fresh Cut Flowers,      Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice, Red Raspberries, Preserved      Mushrooms, Live Swine, Lamb Meat, Sugar, Pasta, Codfish,      Honey, Garlic, Rice, Wool, Agricultural Tillage Tools,      Freshwater Crawfish Tailmeat, Fresh and Chilled Atlantic      Salmon, Fresh Atlantic Groundfish.                          industrial products       Dry-cleaning Machinery, Carbon Steel Wire Rod, Barbed Wire      and Barbless Wire Strand, Line and Pressure Pipe, Oil Country      Tubular Goods, Iron Construction Castings, Malleable Cast      Iron Pipe Fittings, Brass Sheet and Strip, Industrial      Nitrocellulose, Stainless Wire Rod, New Steel Rails, Tapered      Roller Bearings, Heavy Forged Hand Tools, Chrome-plated Lug      Nuts, Tungsten Ore Concentrates, Compact Ductile Iron      Waterworks Fittings, Helical Spring Lock Washers, Brake      Rotors, Nitrile Rubber, Mechanical Transfer Presses, Drafting      Machines and Parts Thereof, Gray Portland Cement and Cement      Clinker, Gas Turbon Compressors, Extruded Rubber Thread, Low      Fuming Brazing Copper Wire & Rod, Industrial Nitrocellulose,      Industrial Phosphoric Acid, Professional Electric Cutting/     sanding/grinding Tools, Collated Roofing Nails,      Antifriction Bearings, Calcium Aluminate Cement & Cement      Clinker, Large Newspaper Presses & Components, Industrial      Belts, Industrial Phosphoric Acid, Pressure Sensitive      Plastic Tape, Brass Fire Protection Products, Internal      Combustion Industrial Forklift Trucks.
