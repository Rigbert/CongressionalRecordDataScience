 President, today I rise to tell you about St. Paul School in my hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. In a country that can only be measured by the well-being of its least-advantaged citizenry, St. Paul has a special story that is too often left untold.  St. Paul Church and the adjoining school are landmarks on the Wilmington skyline, visible from Interstate 95 heading North through Wilmington. Surrounding it are remnants of a once heavily-populated Irish and German immigrant communities and now is in the heart of the Hispanic section of the city. It sits at the base of the West Side and since the 1800's, has been a safe haven for generations of children and families newly arriving to American shores and settling in our community.  St. Paul School was founded in 1874. Its 125 year history is clear--providing quality education to immigrant and minority children. Yet at St. Paul, there is a much deeper, much more powerful message. While St. Paul is a school of 235 kindergarten through eighth graders, 99% of whom are urban children of color from some of Wilmington's most distressed areas, its students are prepared well and consistently perform above the national indicators of student achievement.  There is no culture of poverty or sense of hopelessness in any child, in any classroom in this school. St. Paul's dispels the assumptions and myths about the innate inability of inner-city minority children from very precarious circumstances to succeed academically and socially in mainstream society. At St. Paul, parents are properly engaged, teachers are supremely dedicated and most important, children come ready to learn. This in a school where more than half the students enter with limited English-speaking ability, most of the families live on the margins of poverty and the teachers and administration work for pay well-below their parochial, public and private counterparts.  St. Paul is indeed a special place, but in my view, it is one of so many other stories we need to find out about, embrace and share with America. Furthermore, it is the reason that we must continue to invest in the education of our children. On February 9, 2000 in Wilmington, there will be a Commemorative Mass benefiting the Saint Paul School Scholarship Fund. It is a time when St. Paul School will take center stage for many in our community. It makes perfect sense because every day, education and its importance takes center stage in the lives of St. Paul children.  Our community--both now and in future--will be better because of the efforts of schools like St. Paul around the country where truly no one child is left behind. We in Wilmington salute St. Paul School.                          ____________________
