 The gentleman from Ohio brought up something very weird, saying that, somehow, if we used a simple resolution of disapproval, they couldn't write a new rule.  He is confusing it with the bill you passed last year, which said that the rule is rejected and you can't use anything you use to write that rule to write a new rule. A number of us raised questions about that at the time. You did pass that last year. That is probably what he is thinking of.  This is a simple resolution of disapproval. It would not have any impact on future actions of the Agency.  I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Maryland (Ms. Edwards).
