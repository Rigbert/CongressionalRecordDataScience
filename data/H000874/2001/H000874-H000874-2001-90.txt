Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I simply want to say to the gentleman from Georgia, he is absolutely correct, the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, located in Glynco, in his district, is not only a law enforcement agency that trains Treasury law enforcement, but, as the gentleman knows, trains a broad array of law enforcement officers, including non-Federal officers. It is a very, very important facility.
