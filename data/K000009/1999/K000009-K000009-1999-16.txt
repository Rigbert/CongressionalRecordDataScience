Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, let me commend my colleague, the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Skeen), for his hard work on this bill, though I cannot support the bill. I think it is like a two-legged dog being brought to the floor of the Congress today.  Mr. Speaker, I will reserve my remarks until closing.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from the great State of Minnesota (Mr. Peterson), who has fought harder than any other Member here to try to get the needs of not just his district but rural America recognized.
