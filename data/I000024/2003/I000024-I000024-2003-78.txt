I would say this. We are going to correct it. We are in the process of cleaning it up. A lot of the funding is not going to be coming from the Superfund that is in place right now. Nonetheless, it is going to be cleared up. The point is this. It was a tax that expired during the Clinton administration. The Clinton administration didnot want to renew it and never made an effort to. This administration has never made an effort to renew it because it is wrong. It is bad public policy to pass a tax for people to pay for pollution cleanups that they didn't cause. It is as simple as that.  I thank the Senator for yielding for questions.
