 President, I might say to my friend from Rhode Island, his amendment on climate change was a part of the Keystone bill the President vetoed. I know he and I have very different views about this. What may be challenging for his State is equally challenging in mine. We have a depression in the coalfields of Eastern Kentucky. It is a pretty grim picture. We all know Rhode Island and Kentucky may see this issue quite differently.                          ____________________
