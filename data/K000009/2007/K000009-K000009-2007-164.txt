Joseph Tomasi, lifetime labor union leader and resident of Ohio, passed from this life to the next at the age of 86 after a decade long and valiant struggle with kidney disease. He loved his family and community and devoted his noble life to the cause of working men and women.  For nearly all his life, Mr. Tomasi built the labor movement within Ohio and America. In an effort to stand up for what he believed in, Mr. Tomasi lost his first job because of participation in union activities, and later dedicated his life to this cause. He served our Nation during World War II in the United States Army and was awarded the Purple Heart medal. When he returned, Mr. Tomasi continued to exhibit his dedication to his community by working as the director of Region 2B for the United Auto Workers for 17 years. Even after retirement, Mr. Tomasi helped to establish and served on the board for the Northwest Ohio Cooperative Labor Management Center at the University of Toledo. His efforts there saved thousands of jobs in our region through careful attention to negotiated workouts and settlements and gained respect from all involved.  Joe Tomasi showed compassion to all. He gave back to the community every chance he was given. He served on numerous boards and committees throughout the Northwest Ohio area, always striving to help bridge the gap between management and labor.  Mr. Tomasi's calm and collected manner, his keen insight and unbounding enthusiasm will be missed by all. He always fought for the underdog--in his profession, his community, and his politics. His spirit inspired all those who knew him. May God royally bless him for a life lived for others. We extend our deepest sympathies to Mr. Tomasi's daughter, son, grandchildren, brothers and sister and extended family. We know Joe joins his childhood sweetheart, Evelyn, in the heavens beyond.                          ____________________
