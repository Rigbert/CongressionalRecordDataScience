 Mr. Speaker, what we do not support is taking away protections from American workers, Native and non-Native alike, who work in commercial enterprises owned by tribes. All of our people deserve the chance to earn a decent living, be safe at work, and reach for a better life. This bill is not a step in the right direction.  Courts have ruled that tribes must also comply with other laws. I want to adopt the comments of the gentlewoman from Illinois.  Courts have ruled that tribes must also comply with the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act and many criminal laws, among others. Should we repeal that and have unhealthy working conditions in commercial enterprises? Perhaps that is the next bill you will bring forward in the name of Native sovereignty.                              {time}  1430  Why is the NLRA being singled out from among these laws of general applicability by the proponents of this bill? I suggested why at the beginningof my comments: because that side does not support National Labor Relations Act rights.
