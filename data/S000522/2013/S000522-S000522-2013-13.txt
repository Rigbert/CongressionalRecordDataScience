Thank you, Mr. Stutzman, for your eloquent remarks as well as those of Chairman Franks', who is compassionate and courageous like you and like our next speaker, who is also eloquent in the defense of the most defenseless.  I would like to yield to Dr. Andy Harris, who is a board-certified anesthesiologist at Johns Hopkins Hospital Medical Center.
