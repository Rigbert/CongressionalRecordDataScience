SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have no objection to that. I assume it is a colloquy--but I would not want to concede that rather small amount of time remaining on this side.  Mr. McCONNELL. We would lose no time, as I understand it. We would end up, actually, with more time, 7 minutes, which will allow the Senator from Alabama to have 5 and the Senator from Pennsylvania to have the remaining 2.
