 I know he is objecting on behalf of another Senator. I just wish to say that this is such an important bill.  We had an amazing woman come and visit last week. Her name is Natalie, and she has two young children. She is living in Issaquah, in my home State of Washington. She has been through some very tough times. She is a Navy veteran. She is a single mom. She came home from serving our country and ended up without a place to live, and they are now living on the streets. She, like any mom, wanted to do everything she could to take care of her kids and provide them the kind of quality of life every one of us does, but she could not find a stable job or income and ended up on the streets.  Natalie became homeless in 2007 when she could not find work and had to move out of the house she was staying in.  Natalie wanted nothing more than to provide her two children with the stable and loving home every family deserves, so she fought to secure transitional housing, and she was very fortunate to find a program called Hopelink in Washington State that gave her the support she needed to get back on her feet.  Natalie is now back in stable housing, taking care of her children and advancing in her nursing career. She came to Washington, DC, last Tuesday to help make sure no other family has to face the challenges she overcame so bravely.  Unfortunately, not every family gets the support that Natalie's did.  Homeless women veterans and homeless veterans with children are two terribly vulnerable groups that are growing by the day.  Back in my home State of Washington, veterans service organizations and homeless providers have told me they are seeing more homeless veterans coming for help than ever before.  And unfortunately, more and more of these veterans are women, have young children, or both.  In fact, female veterans are between two and four times as likely to be homeless as their civilian counterparts and they have unique needs and often require specialized services.  That is why I introduced the Homeless Women Veterans and Homeless Veterans with Children Act and it is why it's so important that we move quickly to pass it.  My bill would take three big steps forward toward tackling the serious problems facing this vulnerable group.  First of all, it would make more front-line homeless service providers eligible to receive special needs grants.  This would help organizations in Washington State and across the country help support families like Natalie's.  It would also expand special needs grants to cover homeless male veterans with children as well as the dependents of homeless veterans themselves.  And it would extend the Department of Labor's Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program to provide: workforce training, job counseling, child care services, and placement services to homeless women veterans and homeless veterans with children,  It is so important that we not just provide immediate support but we also make sure our veterans have the resources and support they need to get back on their feet.  This is a very personal issue for me.  Growing up, I saw firsthand the many ways military service can affect both veterans and their families.  My father served in World War II and was among the first soldiers to land on Okinawa. He came home as a disabled veteran and was awarded the Purple Heart.  Like many soldiers of his generation, my father did not talk about his experiences during the war. In fact, we only really learned about them by reading his journals after he passed away.  And I think that experience offers a larger lesson about veterans in general. They are reluctant to call attention to their service, and they are reluctant to ask for help.  That is why we have got to publicly recognize their sacrifices and contributions.  It is up to us to make sure that they get the recognition they have earned.  And it is up to us to guarantee they get the services and support they deserve.  This bill passed through the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee with strong bi-partisan support.  Because supporting our veterans should not be about politics, it should be about what kind of country we want the United States to be. And about what our priorities are as a nation.  That is why I am proud to stand here today: for Natalie, her children, and families just like hers across the country.  At this time, with our economy struggling--it is a very tough time, particularly for our veterans who are returning home--the most vulnerable population today is our women because many of the transitional housing and projects for our veterans don't have facilities for women or for women with children or, as a matter of fact, for men who are veterans coming home to young children.  So this is an extremely important piece of legislation. This had bipartisan support coming out of our committee. I will keep coming to the floor to ask for unanimous consent because I cannot go home and look at someone who served our country with distinction and honor who today is living on the street because the Senate is objecting. I will just let my colleagues know I will keep working on this because it is the right thing to do.                          ____________________
