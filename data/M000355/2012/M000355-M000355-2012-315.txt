 Doug, his wife Sue, and their son Ritter have spent the greater part of theirlives investing in the future of their local community, to make it not only a better place for themselves, but for all of the residents of their beloved town.  The Mortimer family is active in several different areas of the business world, but they got their start in the media industry. Doug and Sue were photographers for WSAZ TV in Huntington, WV, for quite some time. But what they found was that Huntington was too far away to be covering Magoffin County news. One day when Ritter told his parents that he wanted to do something ``creative'' instead of return to school, it sparked a crazy idea in Sue. She thought of the potential that a local TV news station could have, and she proposed her idea to her husband and son. They were sold. And YNT, ``Your News Today,'' took off.  Ritter is the sole proprietor of the 30-minute news show that started in 1998. He operates virtually every part of the show that airs every weekday. The family has found that the town cherishes their local news. Ritter believes its success comes from the fact that the material his news show covers can't be heard anywhere else in the world. The show covers serious topics such as fatal accidents as well as happier topics like Little League softball games, making it really local news for local people.  As the news station continues to grow, so do the other projects of the innovative Mortimer family. The family opened up two restaurant franchise locations, a Dairy Queen and a Lee's Famous Recipe Chicken, on the city's new parkway. The location on the parkway was necessary to bring in business because of the heavy traffic flow in the area. But Doug and Sue remember a time when downtown Salyersville was the place to be. The downtown area has been slowly decaying in the town of Salyersville as businesses move to the parkway, downtown buildings get older, and times change.  Sue, however, believes that downtown still has a lot more potential than one may think. She has headed up a movement called Renaissance on Main that is devoted to renovating and restoring the historic buildings of the once-popular downtown area. The movement has already made major headway in the downtown area, thanks to the superb leadership of Mrs. Mortimer.  Whether it is delivering the news, serving up the day's meal, restoring a building to its former glory, or taking wonderful photographs, the Mortimers have a driving force behind every move that they make, and that force is family. The good of the family is at the heart of every decision they have made, the greatest of these probably being the decision to stay in the small town of Salyersville despite their many chances to move away. Doug, Sue, and Ritter believe they have an obligation to stay and serve the town in which they were born and raised, and they are saddened when young and talented residents move away. The Mortimers are constantly fighting to better their community so that young ones are motivated to take a stake in their heritage and invest in the future of their hometown.  The Mortimer family treasures the past and embraces the future. They have come to understand the importance of their heritage and to respect the legacy of those before them. They have also realized that change is necessary, and if you embrace the future and prepare for it, you can be more in control of the changes brought on by time. The Mortimer family is passionate about bettering their local community, providing jobs, delivering information, and beautifying their surroundings--all things that contribute to helping their fellow residents of Salyersville. That is why I would like to take the time today to give them the credit they most assuredly deserve.  Mr. President, I would ask my Senate colleagues to join me in recognizing the Mortimer family of Salyersville, KY, for honoring and preserving the past, as well as preparing and embracing for the future.  In 2011, an article was included in a publication released by the Southeast Kentucky Chamber of Commerce that highlighted the many accomplishments of this remarkable family over the years. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:        [From the Southeast Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, 2011]                The Mortimers--A Good Place To Call Home       Spending time with Salyersville's Mortimer family--Doug,      Sue, and their son, Ritter--is almost like being in two time      periods simultaneously.       Doug and Sue live in the same home Doug's mother's parents      lived in, and Ritter lives in the previous home of Doug's      father's parents. Doug and Sue have decorated the first floor      of their home with the charming period furnishings; they even      have a family tree on display they've created from their      study of Doug's North Carolina genealogy. They are      enthusiastic supporters of the Magoffin County Historical      Society and have recently bought two buildings downtown which      they are planning to restore.       Then there's Ritter. Ritter owns his own television news      broadcast, YNT (Your News Today), and is getting ready to      stream his news show online. The innovative technology of      today is something that was not even dreamed about in the era      when the homes were built. The Mortimers have seamlessly      embraced respect for the past and enthusiasm for the future.       Perhaps the most impressive dynamic among the family is      their obviously deep love and admiration for one another, and      not just among the three of them, but towards all their      family. When asked why, with their talent and business      acumen, they chose to stay in Magoffin County, Doug says      without hesitation, ``It's family first--nothing would matter      if we couldn't be near family.''       Sue continues, ``My siblings had left here and when we      married, Doug said, `Look, there's not going to be anyone      here to take care of our parents when they get older. I've      tried working away and I don't like it. It'll be hard, but I      think we just need to stay here,' '' she laughs. ``Whatever      it takes, he's going to stay here.''       So how did they make it in a small town in eastern      Kentucky? ``Sue and I have been photographers for 40 years,''      Doug says, ``since just after we were married. My dad was a      photographer, too, so it was an outcrop of that.''       ``Besides photography, we've been in the restaurant      business about 25 years with the DQ and Lee's Famous Chicken      on the Parkway,'' Sue continues. ``We've tried the oil      business, an outcrop of my dad's business, which was always      boom and bust. This whole area has been a big part of our      success, especially our photography--it's not just our town      and county.''       Years ago, both Doug and Sue were stringers for WSAZ TV in      Huntington, West Virginia. ``During that time,'' Sue      explains, ``if something newsworthy happened here, I'd grab a      camera, cover the story, and stick it on a Greyhound bus to      Huntington. Then when the bus service stopped it finished the      whole thing because it wasn't worth the effort to drive it to      Huntington--but we still had those connections. They'd call      and say, `We're going to be up there next week and do three      or four stories. Can you set something up for us?' Well, then      Ritter came around one day and said, `I'm not going back to      school. It might sound crazy, but I know I have to do      something creative, and I want to stay here.' I thought, `Oh,      gosh, if we try something and it fails, he could go into a      tailspin and never find his way--that can be typical of young      people. What could he do that was ``guaranteed'' to succeed?'      Then I thought of the news thing. They both thought I was      crazy.''       Doug agrees. ``We both thought it sounded crazy, but Sue      was right. She knew the potential.''       ``Well,'' Sue explains, ``we had done videos of weddings,      so we had a lot of the basic equipment.''       When asked why he decided to pursue TV, Ritter laughs and      says, ``Because my mother pushed me! It really was her      idea.'' He continues, ``I had a camera and a VCR and a few      pieces of equipment and just started doing it.''       YNT News, referred to locally as RittTV, first aired on      November 2nd of 1998. It's carried on local cable network      Howard's Cable, which goes into Magoffin, Morgan, and Johnson      counties and averages 3,500 to 3,700 subscribers. The show is      30 minutes long and airs at 6:00 and 11:00 p.m. every      weekday. It is now approaching 4,000 broadcasts.       Sue says, ``When it started out, the local cable advertised      it was coming maybe the week before it started, and people      were already like, `When's the new show going to start?' It      was the buzz around here.''       ``I don't really know what got it off the ground,'' Ritter      says, ``but I think it's successful today because it's      material no one can see any other way. I'll cover a court      meeting or a child doing well in school. One family has told      us they have a 92-year-old grandmother who lives where she      can't get TV cable, so they record the show every night and      take it to her so she can watch the show.''       Ritter does it all--covers and prepares the stories for the      air, sells and produces the commercials, everything needed to      get the story on and make a living doing it.       ``No two days are alike,'' Ritter says, ``and that makes it      interesting. One day I might do a reconstruction of a fatal      accident. I'm also on the rescue squad, so Thursday I was up      helping with emergency service. Then     after that's over, I do pictures and get back to the news.      Another day, I'll cover a city council meeting, an ATV story,      the softball championship game, or someone knocking down      mailboxes!''       ``He's very versatile. He's like his daddy--he can do just      about anything,'' Sue says proudly. ``All the new technology      has made Ritter's station possible. The change from tapes has      allowed him to work with less manpower.''       The Mortimers' devotion to where they live goes beyond lip-     service. They are very involved with the Renaissance on Main      program, as well as personally investing in restoring      downtown Salyersville.       ``We bought a couple of buildings downtown that we're in      the process of restoring,'' Sue says. ``When Doug's parents      were young, they had the Tavern Restaurant, and people would      come and just sit and visit.       ``Downtown was a hopping little place then. We'd like to      see that again. It does make you stop and think about the      need to revitalize downtown.       ``The second floor of one of our buildings is going to be      the Mortimer Inn--a B&B without the breakfast. There's no      place here at all for families to stay who have sold the      homeplace and want to come back for a visit, or whatever      reason. Paintsville or Prestonsburg are the closest. So we'll      try it and see how it works.''       Doug explains, ``The first floor in one building is rented      to a gas company. The other--which we bought just about four      months ago--we haven't done much with yet. We couldn't do a      lot with the first as far as restoration, but the second one,      we may be able to take it back to the original '30s when it      was built; it's in good enough shape, we think, to do a true      restoration. It was originally a grocery store--the oldest      business in town--run by a woman named Grace Howard for as      long as she could breathe. She owned the building and lived      upstairs.''       Sue continues the story. ``Eight or 10 years ago, I put      together the local Renaissance on Main group and I guess I      took myself too seriously. When we saw the building, I      thought, `Oh, we can do something with that.' We put two      businesses on the Parkway, but they had to be there to get      the traffic. The strip is in the city limits, and the      business and restaurant taxes do help different things in the      city. Still, we've helped pull things out of the downtown      area, so maybe what we're doing now will help bring it      back.''       ``One of the greatest things downtown, I think,'' says      Doug, ``is the Pioneer Village, a project of the Magoffin      County Historical Society led by Todd Preston. It's just      amazing what a handful of people have done. Those are      original homes and schools from out in the county that have      been dismantled and reassembled. It's very active--open to      tourists. At Christmas, we have a beautiful parade, and on      that night the cabins are opened up, with fires in the      grates, and people come in with banjos. It is really nice.''       Sue talks further about the Renaissance on Main program.      ``Our headquarters are in an old stone building, probably the      second location of Salyersville National Bank, and they      donated it to Renaissance. They had already made some changes      on the first floor added--sheetrock and took out tin--but now      we've got it and we're looking at restoring it. We've gotten      the money to finish the second floor. Behind the building,      there's a garden area that we've had put in using stone from      a two-story, hand-carved stone drug store that was being torn      down. Renaissance saved all that stone and used it for the      garden area and will use the rest for the base of the stage      of a theatre.       ``Behind the Judicial Center, there's a mural you can see      on your way out of town. We raised money through donations      and picked out some historic locations to have painted on the      wall. Renaissance also did a water feature when you first      come into town,'' Sue finished. ``We've really worked hard.''       When looking at the future, it's clear to see that to the      Mortimers, the history and heritage of the past is an      important part of the future.       When Ritter is asked what lies ahead for him, he smiles and      says, ``I spend so much time getting stories, I don't have      much time to look down the road.''       Sue adds, ``He was offered a top position at a Knoxville      station several years ago, but moving doesn't interest him. A      regional station called him also--he told them, `You don't      have enough money.' ''       Doug says, ``From all of us, we couldn't imagine living      anywhere else--we just wouldn't. Right now, there are lots of      changes happening. It may not happen overnight, but      Salyersville and Magoffin County are only going to keep      getting better. It's easy for a community to lose its way,      but I think people are realizing they need to be involved and      to claim it. When young, talented people think about leaving,      we need to tell them, `You're really going to be sorry if you      leave; the bright lights of the big city aren't all they're      cut out to be.' They need to understand they have a sort of      obligation to stay around and help this region get better.      After all, you can travel to wherever you want--you're not      that far from Lexington or wherever you want to go--but this      is a good place to call home.''       ``We've taken advantage of opportunities here and we've      been successful and happy,'' Sue goes on. ``Take Ritter, not      many people his age can say `I love what I'm doing and I'm      making a living out of it--and I stayed home.' ''       Ritter's sisters, Kim and Cindy, live in Atlanta and      Birmingham. ``Their growing-up years were in the South, but      they and their children share the same enchantment for this      area that we do.''       In the midst of the Mortimers, it is easy to see they're a      family with both roots and wings--and very comfortable with      both.                          ____________________
