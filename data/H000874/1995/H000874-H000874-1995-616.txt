Chairman, to respond to my friend, the gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Volkmer], as I said at the beginning, that is on the merits of this issue. I think this is a serious issue. There are a lot of Members on this floor who are very concerned about the fourth amendment, which is an amendment that sets us apart from much of the world. It was an amendment that the forefathers thought was critically important so that the King Georges to come in future generations could not simply say, ``I'm going to come into your house; I'm going to come into your private spaces to investigate'' absent probable cause and a magistrate supposedly and in most instances objectively making a determination that there is probable cause.  That is, I say to my friend, the gentleman from Missouri, the objective issue. This amendment does not deal with a substantive issue. It deals with politics, and in the process of politics and posturing it deals with trying to embarrass the other side. I understand that. But my concern with it is that in the process of doing that it slanders a group of people that we ask to do one of the most dangerous jobs in America.  Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject this amendment and then vote on the policies raised by the substantive bill itself.
