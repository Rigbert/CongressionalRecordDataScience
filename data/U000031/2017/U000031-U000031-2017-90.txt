Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  This bill, H.R. 2292, was introduced by Mr. Faso from New York, and the bill authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, upon request, to extend by 8 years the time period during which construction must commence on the Cannonsville hydroelectric project--which is located on the west branch of the Delaware River in the Catskill Mountains of upstate New York.  The city of New York was granted a construction license for the Cannonsville hydroelectric project on May 13, 2014. Additionally, FERC may reinstate the construction license if it is expired. The bill was reported by unanimous consent from the Energy and Commerce Committee, and I support its passage on the floor today.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2292, a bill to extend the deadline for commencement and construction of a hydroelectric project involving the Cannonsville Dam.  On May 13, 2014, FERC licensed construction of a hydroelectric facility at the Cannonsville Reservoir located on the west branch of the Delaware River in Delaware County, New York. The licensee for this project was not able to commence construction by the deadline of May 2016.  The additional reviews and repairs to the dam, which are necessary to begin construction of the hydroelectric project, will delay construction commencement beyond the expiration date of the original license and the 2-year extension which FERC is authorized to grant.  The bill would, therefore, authorize FERC to extend up to 8 years the date by which the licensee is required to commence construction.  Similar legislation passed the House during the 114th Congress by a vote of 417-2. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
