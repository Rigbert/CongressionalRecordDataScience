Speaker, I rise to call your attention to a special award that was recently given to our distinguished colleagues and longstanding leaders of the Congressional Steel Caucus, Ralph Regula and Jack Murtha. Last month, Ralph and Jack were recognized by the American Iron & Steel Institute and the U.S. Department of Energy [DOE] during DOE's Industrial Efficiency Symposium in Arlington, VA.  On February 25, Ralph and Jack received individual awards testifying to their unflagging contributions to the future of the American steel industry. The awards were in recognition of the central role they have played, both as leaders of the caucus and as individual legislators, in creating the metals initiative program within the energy efficiency function of DOE. The metals initiative, a government-industry collaborative program designed to improve the competitiveness of steel and other metal industries, has received $120 million in appropriations over the past decade to develop direct steelmaking, advanced process controls, and an optical sensor for measuring temperatures.  In their respective positions as chairman and vice chairman of the Congressional Steel Caucus, Ralph Regula and Jack Murtha have worked tirelessly over the years to promote and expand the economic viability of the American steel industry and the jobs of its workers. The Steel Caucus is a bipartisan organization, which has served as a forum since the 1970's for Members of Congress to exchange information and ideas with steel industry representatives, steelworkers and their representatives, and the administration. And their hard work has paid off handsomely: Today, the American steel industry and its workers are the most productive and efficient in the world.  Mr. Speaker, I hope you and my other House colleagues will join me in congratulating Ralph and Jack for receiving this award in recognition of their crucial support for the American steel industry and its workers.                          ____________________
