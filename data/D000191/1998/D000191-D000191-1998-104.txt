Speaker, May 17, 1998 marks the Sesquicentennial of the date that Walter and Thomas Montieth filed a land claim in what became known as Albany, Oregon.  Found in the heart of the Williamette Valley along the banks of the Williamette and Calapooia rivers, Albany, is renowned for its beautiful victorian homes, gracious downtown district, and diverse economy. Albany has flourished as a center of business activity for the region while preserving its roots as a pioneer settlement. Oregonians should take great pride in the foresight of Albany's community leaders who preserved its historic architecture and in those who make it available to all of us to enjoy today.  I'm proud to have the honor to represent the people of the Albany area in the United States Congress. I congratulate the City and its leaders on its 150th birthday.                          ____________________
