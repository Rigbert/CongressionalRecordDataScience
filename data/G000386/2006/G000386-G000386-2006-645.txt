 President, I rise today to honor an heroic American who has fallen while serving his country in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. First Sergeant Tobias Meister died December 28, 2005, when a bomb was detonated near his humvee just south of Asadabad, Afghanistan. First Sergeant Meister was part of the Sand Springs based 486th Civil Affairs Battalion and was assigned to the Army Reserve's 321st Civil Affairs Brigade based in San Antonio, TX. My deepest sympathies go out to his wife Alicia, his 1 year old son Will, his parents David and Judy, his brother and many more family and friends.  First Sergeant Meister was born in Kingsley, IA and graduated from Remsen-Union High School in 1994. He was employed by Horizon Natural Resources, an oil and gas firm, after he had successfully completed a business administration degree with a concentration in international business from the University of Texas at San Antonio.  Tobias Meister joined the Iowa National Guard in 1992 and served as an infantryman before transferring to the U.S. Army Reserve in 1998. He was named Drill Sergeant of the Year in 2002, the award for the Nation's top Army Reserve drill sergeant. He will be remembered for his patriotism, his love for his country and his fellow soldiers. As written by comrades on his website, he had ``so much passion for what he was doing, so much patriotism it was a privilege and an honor to work with him.'' I urge all of my colleagues here and all Americans to extend their prayers to the family of a truly heroic American, First Sergeant Tobias Meister.                         ROLAND CARROLL BARVELS
