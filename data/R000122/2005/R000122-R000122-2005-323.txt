We are waiting. We were not impatient, but there is a limit to patience. I would point out, too, that there will be an attempt this evening to move to other matters such as CAFTA and the Energy bill which will take away time to debate a vote on the pending gun liability bill. I just think we have wasted too much time, that we should establish some rules with respect to the amendments, vote on those amendments and move forward towards a cloture vote.
