President, let me just say kind of the same thing. I had occasion to research Senator Cowan. I do this because one of the things I enjoy doing every Wednesday morning, when we have our Prayer Breakfast, is introducing those who are speaking. He was speaking. When one researches someone like him and you find things out, you kind of redevelop a love for everyone, and I wonder: Are you sure you are in the right place here? I have to question that.  But I hold you in the highest regard. I am very familiar with how you tick, how you think, what you said, and we will miss you in this place. Thank you so much.
