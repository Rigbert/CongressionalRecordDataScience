President, I rise today to honor Dave Mattio, Marian Catholic High School graduate and head coach of the Spartan football squad for 29 seasons.  The message that Coach Mattio instills in his players is ``energy and ownership'' and his accomplishments demonstrate the success of this motto.  Over the course of his 29 seasons with the Spartans, Coach Mattio has created a football program that remains among the most successful in the state of Illinois. Among his many accomplishments, Coach Mattio has seen hundreds of his players go on to play football in college and three go on to the National Football League.  Coach Mattio has led the Marian Catholic Spartans to a state championship and a Chicagoland Prep Bowl championship. He has also shown consistency, with teams qualifying for the playoffs 16 times and compiling winning records 26 of the last 29 seasons.  Coach Mattio's successes have been recognized many times by his peers. He was inducted into the Illinois High School Football Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 1997 as well as the Marian Catholic Alumni Association Hall of Fame in 1994. He was also named the Frank Leahy Prep Coach of the Year in 1994.  I congratulate Dave Mattio on his accomplishments as head coach of the Marian Catholic Spartans and wish him many more years of happiness and accomplishment, both on and off the football field.                          ____________________[Page S9718]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                          HONORING DAVE MATTIO
