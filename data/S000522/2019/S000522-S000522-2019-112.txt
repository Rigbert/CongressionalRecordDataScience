Madam Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.  The motion was agreed to.  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Castro of Texas) having assumed the chair, Mrs. Fletcher, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2500) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2020 for military activities of the Department of Defense and for military construction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                          ____________________
