 I have been trying for some time to get an amendment in, and it is at the desk. I am not going to ask that it be brought up right now, but I am going to announce that regardless of the procedure that is used, I am going to get a vote on it between now and the passage of this bill. It is a one-sentence amendment that says: Beginning with fiscal year 2007 and thereafter, all nondefense, nontrust fund discretionary spending shall not exceed the previous fiscal years without a two-thirds vote of the Members.  It is very simple and straightforward. I am not going to do it right now, but I will do it before final passage.
