 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until Friday, May 5, at 12 noon, for a pro forma session only, with no business being conducted. I further ask that when the Senate adjourns on Friday, May 5, it next convene at 2 p.m., Monday, May 8; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and morning business be closed; finally, that following leader remarks, the Senate resume executive session as under the previous order.
