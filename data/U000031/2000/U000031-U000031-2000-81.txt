Speaker, I rise today to honor my friend, Robert Dolsen, upon his retirement after 26 years of dedicated service as the Executive Director of the Region IV Area Agency on Aging. Over the years, Bob has made a tremendous difference in the lives of thousands of elderly and their families in St. Joseph/Benton Harbor and surrounding communities. He has been a great community leader.  Bob established the Region IV Area Agency on Aging in 1974 as a small operation with a staff of four. Today, the Agency operates with a staff of 60 and a budget of over $10 million. Through the Agency, over 5,000 families are receiving the support services they need to maintain their independence through life's transitions and changes.  Bob has long recognized that one of the greatest challenges facing our community and our nation is the aging of our population and the need for long-term care services. He is providing great leadership on this issue. We are growing old--fast. Today, those 65 and over comprise 12 percent of our population. In just 30 years, those 65 and over will comprise nearly 20 percent of our population. One in five Americans will be a senior citizen. Rising to this challenge, Bob established the first demonstration project for Michigan's home-based long-term care system. It was successful and led to the State's initiation of a Medicaid waiver for home-based services and to the statewide replication of care management through Area Agencies on Aging.  Bob is recognized state-wide and nationally for his knowledge of aging issues, and especially long-term care. He has testified before Congressional committees on 9 different occasions, he is a frequent speaker and trainer at statewide and national conferences, and he was the 1992 recipient of the Harry J. Kelley Award from the Michigan Society of Gerontology for outstanding service in the development of policy and programs for older persons. He is a founding member of the Great Lakes Alliance, an interstate corporation to facilitate cooperation and communication onage-related issues among six states, and he is a founding member of the Healthy Berrien Coalition, an initiative designed to mobilize key community resources to bring the health status of Berrien County's citizens up to or above national and state standards. Last year, it was my pleasure and honor to co-host a forum on Aging in America with the Coalition. Bob also serves on the Public Policy Committee of the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging and was on the Association's Board of Directors for 8 years. He is the past president and a current Board member for the Area Agencies on Aging Association of Michigan. In addition, Bob has served on the Board of the Michigan Society of Gerontology, the Statewide Health Coordinating Council, and the Governor's Long-term Care Task Force.  With all these responsibilities, Bob still finds the time and energy to serve on the United Way Allocation Committee, an advisory group recommending local United Way awards, and to actively participate in and be a benefactor of the St. Joseph-Benton Harbor Rotary Club.  Southwest Michigan is a much better place for all of its citizens, and especially for the elderly, because we have been blessed with Bob Dolsen. He has touched each of our lives in ways large and small, and always with a gentle grace. I know everyone in Southwest Michigan joins me in wishing Bob Dolsen well upon his retirement and in thanking him from our hearts for all he has done and is doing for our community.                          ____________________
