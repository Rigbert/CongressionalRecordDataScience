Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's yielding time to me, and I regret we are here maintaining the status quo for another 7 days.  The status quo for 6,700 people in the First Congressional District of Indiana is unemployment. The status quo for many of those 6,700 people who have probably permanently lost their job in the domestic steel industry and in other industrial facilities is that they have now also permanently lost their health care. Their status quo for the next 7 days is to pray that they, their spouses, and their children do not have an injury and that they do not get sick.  Many of those 6,700 people in the First Congressional District of Indiana who have lost their job have been forced into early retirement. They were promised a pension. The status quo for a good number of those people who were promised a pension is that they will get less than they were promised because the companies they worked for are some of the 37 that have entered into bankruptcy over the last several years.  We have had programs over the last several years under the Clinton administration to help reduce class sizes so that the children in the First Congressional District could receive the best education possible, so hopefully, if jobs ever return to the First District, they would be eligible for them; but we are talking about the status quo and not reducing class sizes over the next 7 days.  We are the status quo Congress, and given the market's collapse, given the recession that we are in, given the deficit that has been created, I think we have much better things to be doing today than maintaining the status quo.  I hope that the rule is defeated.
