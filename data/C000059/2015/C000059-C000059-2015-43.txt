Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment because it provides an appropriation for an unauthorized program and, therefore, violates clause 2 of rule XXI. Clause 2 of rule XXI states in pertinent part:  ``An appropriation may not be in order as an amendment for an expenditure not previously authorized by law.''  Mr. Chairman, the amendment proposes to appropriate funds. The amendment, therefore, violates clause 2 of rule XXI.  I ask for a ruling from the Chair.  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point of order?
