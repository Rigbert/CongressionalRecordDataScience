 President, if there is no further business to come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the provisions of S. Res. 184, as a further mark of respect to the late Jim Bunning, former United States Senator from the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:33 p.m., adjourned until Tuesday, June 6, 2017, at 10 a.m.                          ____________________
