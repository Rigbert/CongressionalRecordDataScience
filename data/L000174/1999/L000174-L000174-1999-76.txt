President, in reference to the bankruptcy bill, I am pleased that the Senate has offered the managers' amendment. It greatly improves the underlying bill and will improve the suggestion from both sides of the aisle.  I am pleased we passed the Kohl-Sessions-Grassley-Harkin amendment on homestead exemption.  I wish the drug amendment, which was adopted by a 50-49 vote earlier this afternoon, had not been agreed to. I think it was the wrong direction to go. But the Senate voted.  I regret that the Senate rejected the Dodd amendment. But I note that with the efforts of the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Utah, the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Torricielli, and myself, we narrowed the number of amendments from over 300 to approximately 30. We are working through them.  I should note just for the schedule that we have a number of Democrats who have offered short time agreements on their amendments to expedite getting their votes.  I thank Senators Feinstein, Schumer, and Dodd for their cooperation in getting very short time agreements on their amendments. I compliment the Senator from Iowa. He and his staff worked with me and my staff, as well as Senator Hatch and Senator Torricelli. We have cleared out an awful lot of what looked to be a totally unmanageable bill with the number of items we had before us.  I yield the floor.
