 We sent a message to the families who have watched our Nation's drug overdose fatalities double in the last decade alone; to those in recovery who have struggled to access the housing and work opportunities they need to get back on their feet; to the Governors, mayors, and local leaders who have seen communities from rural towns to inner cities literally hollowed out and threatened by this epidemic; to the police, firefighters, paramedics, and other first responders whom our Nation has asked to confront this crisis, often without all of the specialized training and resources they need; and to every American affected by the opioid epidemic.  The landmark legislation the Senate passed yesterday says: The Nation will not stand for this. More help is on the way. Yesterday evening we voted to build on Congress's prior efforts and deliver more relief to the communities that need it most.  This landmark legislation addresses the crisis at every step of the way. It contains provisions to cut down on fentanyl and other illegal drugs coming across our borders, to reform how painkillers are prescribed and packaged, to invest in comprehensive opioid recovery centers, and to provide for more long-term medical research.  It also contains two provisions I was pleased to secure for my fellow Kentuckians and for the whole country. The CAREER Act will help individuals in recovery to find housing and the job opportunities they need to rebuild lives of sobriety, and the Protecting Mothers and Infants Act will help the Federal Government to do more to support pregnant women and to protect unborn children from these drugs. This landmark legislation is like a Swiss Army knife that will help the Federal Government to fight opioid addiction in many different ways.  I am grateful to Chairman Alexander for assembling this package, integrating the input of more than 70 Senators and shepherding it through passage.                          ____________________
