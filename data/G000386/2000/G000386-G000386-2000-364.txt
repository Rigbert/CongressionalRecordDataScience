 President, while we were away for the winter break, the annual high school survey on drug use trends among 8th, 10th, and 12th graders came out. This annual Monitoring the Future study, released on December 17, revealed little change in trends of illicit drug use among our young people. The administration has tried to put a happy face on the results. But there is little to be happy about.  Although the Monitoring the Future study found that the increase in drug use among teens has slowed down, what the data show is that use and experimentation remain at high levels. You can see from this chart that we still face the discouraging fact that nearly 50 percent of our high school seniors reported use of marijuana, not only in1999, but in the 2 previous years as well. In fact, 12th grader use of marijuana is at its highest since 1992. In addition, 23 percent of the high school seniors questioned in the past 3 years, reported that they had used marijuana in the past 30 days. Sadly, the study also found that the percentage of 10th graders who reported use of marijuana increased from 39.6 percent in 1998 to nearly 41 percent in 1999. Hardly news to find comfort in.  Marijuana remains a gateway drug for even worse substances and this next chart shows overall illicit drug use among high school seniors. You can see in this second chart that, in 1999, nearly 55 percent of 12th graders reported using an illicit drug in their lifetime. What that ``lifetime'' means is that 55 percent of 17-year-olds have at least tried marijuana or other dangerous, illicit drugs. That's an appalling figure. You can also see that this number is the highest it's been since 1992. With the Office of National Drug Control Policy's recent blitz of ads through the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign, these high numbers are truly disappointing. It seems though, as the news gets worse, the press releases get happier. But it's still double-speak.  Another upsetting finding was the increase in the use of the ``club drug,'' Ecstacy. Use of Ecstacy among 10th graders increased from 3.3 percent in 1998 to 4.4 percent in 1999. In addition, use among 12th graders increased from 1.5 percent in 1998 to 2.5 percent in 1999. The increase in the use of these so called club drugs, such as Ecstacy, is particularly disturbing. This is so, because club drugs are frequently referred to as recreational drugs and are perceived by many young people as harmless. On December 23 of this past year, we were given a glimpse of the sheer magnitude and severity of the market for Ecstacy, when Customs officials seized 700 pounds of Ecstacy. These 700 pounds would have been enough to provide 1 million kids each with a single dose. Unfortunately, Ecstacy is quickly becoming the drug of choice among our young people. And it too is a gateway to wider drug use. Parents need to take a harder look at what their children are being exposed to.  Last session I gave a floor statement on one particular club drug, that is frequently used in sexual assault cases, called GHB. I am pleased to learn from this year Monitoring the Future study that in next year's survey, young people will be questioned about use of GHB. But the issue is not this drug or that drug but the climate that encourages use and recruits kids into the drug scene. We must work to reverse the trend to normalize and glamorize drug use that has taken root in recent years.  There is an encouraging decline in the use of inhalants among 8th and 10th graders. And, use of crack cocaine among 8th and 10th graders is down slightly. In addition, 12th graders reported a significant decrease in the use of crystal meth from 3 percent in 1998 to about 2 percent in 1999.  As we begin not only a new year but a new millennium, we are faced with the difficult challenge of making the 21st century safe for our young people. Although we have made some progress, these study results leave our young people facing an uncertain future. We cannot be satisfied with unchanging trends in teenage drug use. We have not seen a significant decline in drug use among our country's young people since 1992. In fact, what we have seen are dramatic increases. This fact makes me pause and wonder what we have been doing for the past 8 years. Whatever it is, it has failed to make the difference we need to be seeing. We need to move toward significant decreases in use. We need coherent, sound, accountable efforts. We must not neglect our duties in keeping our young people drug free. We are not in any position to let our guard down. We need policies and strategies that make a difference.                          ____________________
