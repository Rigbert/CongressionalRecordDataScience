Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I have worked closely with the gentleman from Tennessee, and he does great work. In fact, he did great work in chairing a special committee of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on improving the Nation's freight transportation system.  One of the key recommendations in that report was: draw down the $7 billion balance of the harbor maintenance trust fund without adversely affecting appropriations for other programs, projects, and activities carried out by the Corps of Engineers for other authorized purposes.  Well, it is a little dated because this is 2 years ago. So now there is $9.8 billion in the so-called harbor maintenance trust fund, which doesn't exist. There is no line item, no account at the Treasury. The money is poof, gone, unless we authorize the establishment of a trust fund and begin to better invest in our harbors.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green).
