 President, I am pleased to join in cosponsoring the Alzheimer's Family Assistance Act of 2007 introduced by my colleague, Senator Mikulski.  As much as we all would like to think that we will remain healthy and strong throughout our lifetimes, many of us will need long-term care. The cost of that care, whether provided in a nursing home, assisted living facility, or in one's own home with the assistance of health aides, can quickly add up. That is why we should do everything we can to make people aware of long-term care insurance and to ensure that policies are affordable.  We need to encourage people to include long-term care insurance in their planning, especially when people are younger and premiums would be lower. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, DRA, made good progress in that regard by expanding State long-term care partnership programs. In addition, the DRA established an information clearinghouse to help individuals learn about long-term care insurance options in their states.  We also need to encourage older individuals to purchase long-term care insurance. By establishing a deduction for long-term care insurance premiums, this legislation will help accomplish that goal. In order to qualify for the deduction, the policy must include several important consumer protections recommended by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, NAIC. The DRA incorporated the same protections plus some additional NAIC consumer protections into the State long-term care partnership policies. As this bill moves forward, I look forward to working with Senator Mikulski to ensure consistency in the application of these consumer protections to long-term care policies. Specifically, I hope we can expand the consumer protections in this bill so they are in line with those included in the DRA.  Finally, this legislation recognizes that individuals and their caregivers may need assistance in paying for medical supplies, nursing care, and other long-term care expenses. The tax credit called for in the bill, which increases from $1,000 to $3,000 in 2011 and beyond, will help defray these costs.  Mr. President, I have long supported the policies included in this legislation and commend my colleague for her work on this important issue.                                 ______                                       By
