I hope the U.S. Commerce Secretary will travel to Africa. That has not happened in years. I would encourage our Secretary to discover the opportunities on this continent for the good of our economy here in the United States.  It is hard to imagine, as well, the Commerce Department is actually cutting its staff in Africa at this point, and the Export-Import Bank doesn't have an African staff at this point. This can change. The tremendous growth of the African economy and its middle class makes lack of engagement inexcusable. We can reverse it, and this bill is a step in the direction to reverse it.  As Senator Boozman said, it is modest, commonsense, and doesn't add to the deficit. It thinks of ways to use current resources more effectively. It moves us in that direction with low-cost steps that will actually earn U.S. money while creating U.S. jobs.  I will yield on this issue and allow my colleagues to close if they have closing remarks.
