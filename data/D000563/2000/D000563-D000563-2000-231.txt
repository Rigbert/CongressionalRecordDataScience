Twelve Presidents, as well as Confederate leader Jefferson Davis, currently have presidential libraries. Abraham Lincoln, as the man who preserved the Union, truly deserves such an institution where people from around the world can learn about his great achievements.  This project enjoys tremendous support at the federal, state, and local levels. The entire Illinois Congressional Delegation, the Illinois General Assembly, and City of Springfield have all expressed their strong support for this library to be completed. The State of Illinois has contributed $50 million, and the City of Springfield $10 million, to begin construction on the interpretive center. In addition, the Lincoln Library received $3 million from the FY 2000 Interior Appropriations Bill. While these federal funds are greatly appreciated, we need a stronger federal commitment to make sure construction of the Library can get underway. I would like to ask the Senator from Washington if there is any possibility to receive increased funding from the FY 2001 Interior Appropriations Bill for this important endeavor.
