Every one of those five newspapers endorsed NAFTA.  Now just a little, tiny bit of history. I am from Oregon. We are famous for Willis Hawley. Everyone who has studied economics 101 hears about the disaster of the Great Depression having been caused by the Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act was passed 9 months after the crash of the stock market. So it is hard to say that somehow those tariffs triggered the stock market crash or the Great Depression. But they become a convenient whipping boy.  Now, if anyone raises reasonable concerns about our trade agreements, the fact that we do not have reciprocity with Japan, the fact that we are giving away sovereignty with GATT, or the fact of the case of the North American Free-Trade Agreement that we are now obligated to prop up the Government of Mexico with billions of United States taxpayer dollars, you are called a protectionist. I do not call that a protectionist.  We are told that this is a national security issue. Yes, it is a national security issue. We are talking about American jobs and American taxpayer dollars, and we want to protect our national security by revising and rewriting wholesale this agreement because it is a loser for the people of this country and for the people of Mexico.
