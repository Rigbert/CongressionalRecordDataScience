Chairman, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Texas for yielding, in that we have both worked on the gentleman's statement, and we have mutual concern and interest in making sure this bill in no way impedes the regular, normal business procedures and, yes, also regulations simply within the Department of Agriculture.  I think the colloquy is extremely important. I associate myself with the gentleman's remarks, and I think this should take care of many concerns that both of us share.
