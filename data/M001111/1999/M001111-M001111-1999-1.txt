 President, I rise today with Senators Craig, Smith of Oregon, Boxer, and Feinstein to introduce the Agricultural Market Access and Development Act.  Mr. President, farmers and ranchers in our nation are hurting. Rural communities in my home state of Washington have been severely impacted by the current crisis in agriculture. The causes are complex and diverse, and have been discussed at great length on the floor of the United States Senate. Low prices, the loss of markets in Asia, foreign trade barriers, dumping, and industry concentration are just a few of the difficulties farmers and ranchers, the Administration, and Members of Congress are struggling to overcome.  I am pleased Congress acted to provide emergency assistance as part of the fiscal year 2000 agriculture appropriations act. However, while this package was desperately needed, it leftour many so-called ``minor crop'' producers across the country. It failed to reform our nation's plicy on unilateral sanctions. And it didn't compel us to dedicate time to really resolve long-term issues that will put American agriculture on a more solid foundation. One long-term issue that deserves attention is federal support for market access and development.  Today, I am introducing the Agricultural Market Access and Development Act to ensure our producers have the resources they need to expand their overseas markets. My bill would authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to spend up to $200 million--but not less than the current $90 million--for the Market Access Program. And it would set a floor of $35 million for spending on the foreign Market Development ``Cooperator'' Program.  While many Members of Congress and producers have advocated increased funding for MAP and the Cooperator Program, these efforts have been complicated by our work to balance the budget and meet other important national commitments. At the same time, the agricultural community is frustrated over the use--or lack of use--of the Export Enhancement Program.  Debate will continue on the merits of using the Export Enhancement Program. Nevertheless, I believe we cannot afford to continue wasting the precious dollars we target toward agricultural trade. That is exactly what is happening now: hundreds of millions of dollars in the Export Enhancement Program remain unspent and unused while foreign governments heavily subsidize and protect their agricultural economies to the detriment of American producers.  My bill seeks to recover some of our lost trade resources and convert them into new opportunities for our farmers and ranchers. My bill would give the Secretary of Agriculture the authority to direct a percentage of unspent Export Enhancement Program dollars to market access and development programs within the Commodity Credit Corporation. If less than 20 percent of funds authorized for the Export Enhancement Program are spent by July 1 of a given fiscal year, the Secretary could direct up to 50 percent of unspent EEP funds to other programs. If less than 50 percent--but more than 20 percent--of funds authorized for EEP are spent by July 1 of a given fiscal year, the Secretary could direct up to 20 percent of unspent EEP funds to other programs.  Mr. President, I am introducing this legislation today to advance the discussion on using all of our trade resources. The numbers included in my bill will be subject to further discussion and I welcome it. However, I believe this legislation represents a serious effort to use our scarce resources wisely.  Our current trade negotiations on agriculture show that we must be willing and able to use federal resources to promote trade. If we do not, our negotiations and our producers cannot succeed.  As we head into the Seattle Round of the World Trade Organization this fall, we need to commit ourselves to promoting trade and expanding market access. Without this commitment, we will lose opportunities to market our products overseas. Without this commitment, the changes we made to our farm policy in 1996 will not have a chance in the world of succeeding.  As I said before, Mr. President, agricultural producers in my state of Washington are hurting. My state is home to more than 200 ``minor'' crops. Washington state is known for its productive apple industry. Unfortunately, that industry is in the midst of a terrible economic crisis. The loss of markets in Asia, non-frozen apple juice concentrate dumping by China, oversupply, poor weather conditions in 1998, and generally low prices are driving hundreds of family farms out of business.  This Congress needs to do a better job of addressing the plight of all commodity producers, not just those who grow major commodities. My legislation is a step in the right direction. It seeks to increase funding for the Market Access Program, which is popular among fruit and vegetable growers. In fact, it is one of the few federal programs that benefit fruit and vegetable producers. Since this Congress has shown its reluctance to target meaningful federal aid to minor crop producers, the least we can do is strengthen the voluntary programs that work for these producers. If we do not, we will be failing to promote economic stability in many rural communities.  However, my bill is not just intended to help fruit and vegetable producers. It also encourages transferring unused trade dollars to the Foreign Market Development Program, which is used by program commodities. Both MAP and FMD represent the kind of federal-industry partnerships we should be encouraging at a time of limited government resources.  Mr. President, let me briefly address one criticism of the Market Access Program: the issue of whether it is primarily a program that benefits large corporations. Congress reformed MAP--known before the 1996 farm bill as the Market Promotion Program--in 1996 to ensure that large corporations with no connections to producers could not access MAP funds. I strongly supported that change.  The new law did allow for the program's continued use by farmers' cooperatives, some of which are major industry players. However, it is clear to me, and to others who follow the farm economy, that encouraging the development of farmers' cooperatives is one of the few bright spots in our efforts to keep family farms on the land. Therefore, while opponents will continue to point to a few examples of entities they believe in no way should be involved in the program, I believe my colleagues should keep the broader picture in mind. MAP deserves our support.  Next year, Congress should address long-term agricultural issues. And one of those issues should be the transfer of unused Export Enhancement Program funds to market access and development programs. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1983       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
