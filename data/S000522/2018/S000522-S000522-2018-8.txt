Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for his comments and for his strong support.  Mr. Speaker, this is a true bipartisan bill. Our fingers are crossed for the people of the DRC. They deserve a free and fair election. Whoever emerges as the winner hopefully will take them on a new course.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
