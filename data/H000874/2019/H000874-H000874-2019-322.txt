Lighthizer to address members of the Democratic Caucus on where we stood.  As you know, that agreement has not been submitted. The Speaker said the other day that, in order to consider that in a positive way, the Mexicans, whom the President has been somewhat critical of through the years, take certain actions which make sure that our workers and their workers are treated fairly so we are competing on an even keel.  But we certainly are in discussions. There are a number of items of concern, which have historically been of concern, regarding the environment, regarding workers' rights, regarding the availability of prescription drugs for people, as well as enforcement, dispute resolution.  So those are being discussed. The conversations are ongoing, and I believe that the administration will make a determination when they believe it is timely to submit that document to us. As the gentleman knows, once they do so, there is a timeframe in which the House and Senate must act. The committees must act within, essentially, a 3-month period of time.  So we are in discussions. We are waiting on the administration's judgment as to when to submit. And I am sure they are discussing with us as to when we think that is timely as well, but there are still substantive matters that are being discussed.  I would presume some of those are on your side as well.
