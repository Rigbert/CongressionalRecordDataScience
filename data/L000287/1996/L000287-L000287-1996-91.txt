Mr. Speaker, I have long championed our second amendment right to bear arms. Time after time, I have voted against misguided attempts to limit or restrict our rights to buy and own guns or ammunition. As you may know, I have strongly opposed and voted against both the Brady bill and the assault weapons ban.  I have always been a strong supporter of law enforcement but I believe that we need to solve our crime problems directly and not by curbing the constitutionally protected rights of law abiding citizens. The ban on semi-automatic weapons will not stop criminals from procuring these firearms. The only people who will not have access to illegal weapons are law abiding citizens. Our Federal Government needs to protect law abiding citizens and not take away their means with which to protect themselves. It is for these reasons that I support efforts to repeal the assault weapons ban.
