 President, today, Senator Wellstone and I are introducing the Battered Women's Economic Security Act. This legislation was developed in order to address the numerous economic obstacles facing victims of domestic and family violence as they try to escape this violence.  I know that Senator Wellstone joins me in applauding Senator Biden's efforts in crafting legislation to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act programs. Senator Biden developed a bipartisan bill to build on the success of VAWA and expand those programs aimed at the immediate needs of victims of domestic violence.  The legislation we are introducing today takes the next step. As a result of VAWA and the increased federal commitment to addressing the domestic violence crisis, we now have an infrastructure in place that helps the community respond to this violence. VAWA has been a success in helping local law enforcement, and the courts, prosecute those who batter and abuse women. VAWA provides a strong law enforcement component as well as services to provide immediate and emergency assistance to victims. But, the road to recovery is much longer and much harder because of economic barriers.  As I learned last year in my efforts to maintain a safety net for victims of family violence, often times it is basic economics that trap women and children in violent homes and relationships. Economic barriers threaten the success of VAWA and work to maintain the threat of violence.  We all know the cost of domestic and family violence. But, there is a much greater cost to the community that is often overlooked. How many police officers have been caught in the cross fire when responding to domestic and family violence calls? How many innocent children grow up in a violent home and bring this violence into the classroom or future relationships? We have made a commitment to ending domestic violence, however, in order to succeed we must tear down the economic barriers.  We have insurance policies that discriminate against victims of domestic violence. Some insurance companies think that victims of domestic violence are engaging in high risk behavior similar to a race car driver or sky diver. Life, homeowners, auto and health insurance are essential elements of economic security. Eliminating this protection for victims of domestic violence threatens their ability to achieve economic independence. It also discourages women from coming forward and reporting this violence and abuse for fear that their insurance company will use it against them.  Don't let anyone tell you this does not happen. I can give many examples of insurance discrimination faced by victims of domestic violence. Just ask Kaddas Bolduc from Washington, whose estranged husband burned down her home. Her insurance company refused to honor her homeowner's policy as they decided this was not arson, but a violent response to the break up of a relationship. Her husband had been released from jail shortly before the fire. She was told that she had no claim and no way to rebuild her home. I would have to say that this is a serious economic barrier that must come down.  I have met with many domestic violence advocates in Washington and have listen to their concerns about finding long term security for victims. I have heard horror stories about the lack of affordable housing or the inability of victims to secure safe housing. Many landlords refuse to rent to a victim for fear that the violence will follow her. Many women do not have a lease or mortgage in their name. They have no real credit history and certainly cannot prove that they were reliable tenants. As a result they have a difficult time finding housing. Shelters are simply temporary solutions and in many communities the need far outweighs the availability of emergency shelter space.  We need to expand Section 8 opportunities for victims of domestic violence in order to ensure that they can find long term housing. A safe, affordable home is often a goal that many battered women are unable to achieve. Many women end up back in violent homes or relationships as they have no where else to go. In order to end domestic and family violence we must provide greater housing assistance and opportunities to those who have suffered this violence.  Currently, there are many barriers to work for victims of domestic violence. Safe, affordable child care would be the greatest barrier and I believe the bonus provisions included in this bill will provide the incentives to the states to address this problem. We need to expand child care options and benefits for victims of domestic violence, but we cannot do it at the expense of other low income women an families struggling to stay off of welfare. I believe we need to work with the states in addressing the unique needs of victims of domestic violence.  Unfortunately, the violence can follow women into the work place which jeopardizes their health and safety as well as their job. Many women are unable to take leave to seek relief in the courts. They do not have the luxury of taking time off to file for a restraining order or to testify against their abuser. They cannot take sick leave to seek medical attention or treatment. Many employers simply do not offer or provide the flexibility that these womenneed. Included in this legislation we are introducing today is the Employment Protection for Battered Women introduced by Senator Wellstone. I believe these provisions will help battered women maintain their jobs without jeopardizing their safety.  But when the threat of violence becomes so great as to jeopardize the woman and her coworkers she must be able to leave the job immediately. Unfortunately, many states refuse to allow these women the ability to collect unemployment compensation as they rule that she left on her own accord. However, many women are forced to leave a job and should not be penalized because they are being harassed and have been subjected to abuse in the past. Our legislation includes provisions that would allow a victim of domestic violence to collect unemployment compensation when they are forced to leave their job due to the thereat of continued violence.  I have also heard first hand from advocates who have been working with women in an effort to change their Social Security number in order to flee a violent abuser. It is impossible to secure employment without giving out one's Social Security number. It is impossible to rent an apartment or even establish credit without a Social Security number. Yet giving out this number can make it easier for an abusive husband or boyfriend to track a woman down. The ability to change their Social Security number becomes the difference between economic dependency and economic independence. Yet it is easier to change one's number based on superstition than it is because one is trying to flee a violent relationship.  The Office of Victims Advocacy at the Washington State AG's office told me that it can take as long as six months to change a Social Security number and that is in a case where there was a clear need to change the victim's identity. But, in most cases it takes more than 12 months and for some it may never happen. The Social Security Administration must work to correct this threat. Included in our legislation is a requirement that the Social Security Administration expedite requests from victims of domestic violence for a change in their Social Security number in order to achieve economic independency faster and safer.  The legislation is the result of months of drafting and working with domestic violence advocactes to address the many economic barriers facing victims. In working to strengthen the Family Violence Option in welfare reform, I became painfully aware of the barriers that punitive welfare reform provisions had created. But I realized that this was only one of many barriers.  VAWA took the first step in dedicating federal resources to addressing the domestic violence crisis, but its whole focus is law enforcement and emergency response. We need to go to the next level to truly end violence against women. We need to address these economic needs and problems. I believe our legislation meets this test and will eliminate many of the economic barriers that trap women and children in violent homes and relationships.  I urge my colleagues to join us in support of this important legislation.                                 ______                                       By
