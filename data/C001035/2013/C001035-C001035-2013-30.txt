I would inquire, through the Chair, how long she is seeking to speak. We were about to proceed to the consideration of the amendment that has been filed by Senator Portman and cosponsored by Senator Ayotte, Senator Heller, and Senator McCain.  This is a rather complicated parliamentary situation. Then there is going to be a debate. If the Senator from Massachusetts is going to speak very briefly, I would withhold. If she is going to speak at length, then since we have Members on their way, I would proceed.
