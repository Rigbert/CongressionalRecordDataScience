President, on May 25, loving family members and countless friends will gather in Presque Isle, ME, to celebrate the remarkable life of Audrey Bishop Thibodeau, who passed away January 2, at the age of 97. I rise today in tribute to a caring citizen and dear friend.  It has been said that we all have a birth date and a death date, with a dash in between. It's what we do with our dash that counts.  Audrey Thibodeau's dash was long, and she made it count. She was a devoted wife, a wonderful mother, an educator, a farmer, and an entrepreneur. Wherever there was a need, she was a committed volunteer and a generous philanthropist.  She was born Audrey Elaine Bishop on December 13, 1915, in Caribou, ME, my hometown. She attended Caribou public schools and, in 1937, graduated from the University of Maine with a degree in nutrition. It was while teaching high school home economics that she developed one of the great passions of her life--raising awareness and fostering education for students with reading disabilities. Her commitment to youth was also seen years later when she founded a Pony Club to help young people learn the skills and responsibilities of horsemanship.  In 1939, she married Lawrence Thibodeau, a high school classmate. After a brief adventure with farming in New York State, they returned to Maine and settled in Fort Kent, on the Canadian border. It was there that Audrey immersed herself in French to better appreciate the culture of the region.  The couple, with their growing family, relocated to Presque Isle in 1946 and soon became valued members of that community. Audrey's love of local culture led her to become instrumental in the incorporation of the Vera Estes House into the Presque Isle Historical Society and the creation of the Cultural and Museum Center at the Old Presque Isle Fire House, which celebrates the heritage of the local area. Audrey witnessed much history during her long life. Just as important, she was devoted to preserving the rich history of Aroostook County for future generations.  Her husband, Lawrence Thibodeau, better known as ``Tib,'' passed away in 2008, but he will long be remembered for his contributions to Maine agriculture and support of the University of Maine Cooperative Extension Service. Together, the couple will always be remembered for the Larry and Audrey Thibodeau Scholarship that helps Aroostook County students pursue careers in medicine. After Audrey's passing, her family carried on her commitment to others by asking that memorial contributions be made to the Audrey B. Thibodeau Charitable and Educational Fund.  Audrey's philanthropy and volunteerism earned her accolades from the Maine Legislature and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Presque Isle Area Chamber of Commerce. Her service and compassion will always be cherished by the people of Aroostook County. A strong leader, Audrey Thibodeau filled her dash with an infectious smile, enthusiasm for life, assistance to others, community participation, a dedication to Aroostook County, and a great deal of love for her remarkable family. May her memory inspire us all to follow her example.                          ____________________
