Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, at long last the House of Representatives will now consider a farm bill, and in this regard I would like to make some commentary as to the reasons why we on the Republican side adopted the policy approach that we have.  In that regard I think, unfortunately, during most of the debate in this regard to this year's farm bill, much of the rhetoric has ignored several basic facts. There are dramatic changes taking place that involve U.S. agriculture. Farmers are competing for increased demand in a growing global marketplace.  The Congress is serious, finally, about a balanced budget. The political climate will not permit any rubber-stamped acceptance of status quo policies in agriculture or anywhere else. Farmers and ranchers know, boy do they know, the current farm program is outdated and in need of reform.  So the question is, what kind of policy takes these givens into account and makes sense? After conducting 19 hearings, traveling over 60,000 miles, and listening to over 10,000 farmers and ranchers, agribusiness men and women, and many others involved in agriculture, this is what farm country told us: One, they are sick and tired of regulatory overkill and demand regulatory reform; two, they strongly support a balanced budget. They know a balanced budget will save agriculture and farmers and ranchers $15 billion in lower production costs. They also requested a consistent and aggressive export program, and they want more flexibility and ability to respond to market signals and to make their own financial decisions.  So taking all of these points into account, we have proposed an innovative approach to farm program policy. It has received the most debate of any farm program proposal in modern history. It was originally called freedom to farm, and is now before us as the Agricultural Market Transition Act.  Let me explain the policy rationale. The original New Deal farm programs over 60 years ago were based on principles of supply management. If you control supply, you raise prices. Over the last 20 years, the principal justification for the programs has been that farmers received Federal assistance in return for setting aside a portion of their wherewithal, that is, their acreage.                              {time}  1315  That assistance was largely in the form of something we called deficiency payments to compensate farmers for prices below a Government-set target price for their production. Today, unfortunately, that system has collapsed as an effective way to deliver assistance to farmers.  Worldwide agricultural competition takes our markets when we reduce production. The more we set aside, the more our competitors overseas simply increase their production by more than we set aside. They steal our market share. In short, the supply management rationale not only fails under close scrutiny by the many critics of ag policy, it has enabled our competitors to increase their production and we lose the market share.  As I have indicated, the Freedom to Farm Act, Agriculture Market Transition Act, was born of an effort to create a new farm policy from an entirely new perspective. Acknowledging that budget cuts were inevitable, that we must meet our budget responsibilities, freedom to farm set up new goals and new criteria for farm policy.  No. 1, get the Government out of farmers' fields. No longer do you put the seed in the ground to protect your acreage base to receive a Government subsidy. Return to farmers the ability to produce for the markets, not the Government programs. And to provide a predictable and guaranteed phasing down of Federal financial assistance.  By removing Government controls on land use, freedom to farm effectively eliminates the No. 1 complaint of farmers about the programs: bureaucratic redtape, paperwork, all of the regulations and the Government interference. Endless waits at the county ASCS office or the SCS office will end. Hassles over field sizes, whether the right crop was planted, or the correct amount of acres would be a thing of the past. Environmentalists should be pleased that the Government no longer forces the planting of surplus crops and what we call monoculture agriculture. And a producer who wants to introduce a rotation on their farm for various environmental or agronomic reasons would be free of the current restrictions.  This bill builds on the conservation compliance requirements, the environmental requirements, if you will, of 1985 and 1990, of the 1985 and 1990 farm bills, and positively impacts 300 million acres.  This bill is the most environmentally responsible farm program in 60 years. We will have more to say about that in the future debate. Under freedom to farm, farmers can plant or idle all their acres at their discretion. They are in control. The restrictions on what they can plant are greatly reduced. Response to the market would assume a larger role in our farmer planning. And divorcing payments from production and, by the way, we already started that when yields were frozen in 1985 and we went to flex acres and we froze target prices and we cut target prices, that has already happened, that would end any pressure from the Government in choosing crops with which to pursue. So all production incentives would come from the marketplace and the individual farmer.  In return for this, we proposed a guaranteed payment, the guarantee of a fixed, albeit it declining, payment for 7 years would provide the predictability and consistency that farmers have wanted and provide certainty to creditors as a basis for lending.  Listen up, Mr. and Mrs. American farmer and your banker and your farm credit troop, any other lending institution, sit down with your banker, your lender, 7 years, you know what you are going to get. You can plan on it. It is a risk management account. You do not have to wait on the Congress.  The current situation in wheat, corn, and cotton country, under which our prices are very high but we do not have any crops but large numbers of producers have lost their crops due to weather or pests, that would be corrected by this kind of a payment system. These producers this year cannot access the high prices. They do not have a crop. And instead of getting help when they need it the most, the old system really cuts off their deficiency payments and even demands they pay back the advance deficiency payments. What a time. We are blowing away in the Great Plains. We are bone dry. We have prairie fires. We do not have any crops.  The current farm program says pay back advanced deficiency payments, and we get no payment, no disaster payments or no help. The freedom to farm ensures that whatever financial assistance is available will be delivered regardless of the circumstances, because the producer signs a contract with the Federal Government for the next 7 years. High prices, high payments, oh, we have heard a lot of criticism about that. First, the payments will not be high. You cannot cut annual spending in half compared to the last farm program bill over the last 5 years and have high payments. That does not work.  No farmer, let me repeat this to all of the critics and you will hear it in this debate, no farmer is going to take his market transition payment and retire. Farmers will continue to farm.  Second, under freedom to farm, the payments made to producers must be looked at from a new perspective. It is a transition to full farmer responsibility for his economic life, a risk management account.  Just as farmers will need to look to the market for production and marketing signals, freedom to farm will require that farmers manage their finances to meet all the price swings. It is true that when prices are high, farmers will receive a full market transition payment. It is equally true that if prices decline, farmers will receive no more than the fixed market transition payment. That means the farmer must manage his income, both market and Government, to account for weather and price fluctuations.  But under this plan, he makes the decision, not Washington, not Congress, not the ASCS office, not the SCS office. He makes that decision.  In short, under freedom to farm, we authorize the market transition payments to farmers as opposed to the current program's deficiency payments, to serve as a form of compensation as we move U.S. Agriculture from an economy heavily influenced by the Federal Government to one in which our Government role is substantially reduced and the primary influence is the marketplace.  The old program did provide market insulation for each bushel of production. But that system is collapsing under the weight of budget cuts. You have heard the former chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture, the gentleman from Texas, the Hon. Kika de la Garza, chairman emeritus of the committee. You have heard the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Stenholm], a leader in the farm community, a spokesman for agriculture. You have heard me, you have heard others talk about how farmers have already given at the office in regards to their budget responsibilities and that $65 billion in budget authority has already been cut from farm programs over the last 10 years. True. Nobody knows that in Washington, or very few know it in Washington. Not many people in the press understand that, that we have already cut ag spending 9 percent a year for about the last 9 or 10 years.  Well, what is to prevent the continued slow asphyxiation in regards to budget cuts and the amount of money that we should have in regard to a responsible farm program? Under freedom to farm, we enhance the farmers' total economic situation. In fact, under freedom to farm it results in the highest net farm income over the next 7 years of any of the proposals before Congress. You represent farmers. Under this plan you have more investment in production agriculture, more farm income than any other plan. We lock it up, and we still meet our budget responsibilities.  Now, if you believe there will be no more budget cuts and no more budget reconciliations and no more budget battles, freedom to farm is not for you. If you believe that if farmers just hang on a little longer, their prospects for more Government support will improve in this climate, freedom to farm is not for you. If you believe that farm programs will not continue under the budget gun, that we will not have our fingers, our arms, our legs on the budget chopping block, freedom to farm is not for you.  If, however, you believe that there will be more reconciliations, that the heat on farm programs--and you will hear amendments about that in the debate on down the road during the amendment process--if you think that this heat on farm programs will only increase and that Congress needs more than deep budget cuts to present to farmers and not so slow asphyxiation, then freedom to farm makes sense.  Now, the severest, the severest critics of farm programs in the press, on television, major newspapers, have hailed the freedom to farm as the most significant reform in ag policy since the 1930's. We have received national acclaim from our critics of farm program policy that this is long-needed, long-awaited reform. Our congressional critics have also decided that our freedom to farm program represents the kind of reform that they can support, and they believe that it is the kind of reform that is needed.  Nearly every agriculture economist who has commented on freedom to farm has supported its structure and its probable effect on farmers in the ag sector. We are at a crossroads now, folks. We can either sink deeper into Government controls and rapidly sagging Government support and a lack of investment in regards to our ability to feed this Nation and the troubled and hungry world, or we can strike out in a new direction that at least holds out the prospect of assisted transition to a private marketplace, a market-oriented agriculture.  The Freedom to Farm Act is that new direction. We need to seize it. Now is the time.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr. de la GARZA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  (Mr. de la GARZA asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. de la GARZA. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2854 as currently presented to the House, and in support of three en bloc amendments which I will be offering. Let me preface this by saying that my opposition is in no way indicative of the actions of the chairman of the committee but, rather, Mr. Chairman, in past years we have had the opportunity to prepare comprehensive farm policy in a deliberate, all-inclusive manner. When we have been required to comply with budget reconciliation instructions, the House Committee on Agriculture has complied to the tune of $50 billion in savings from 1981 through 1993. However, in this particular farm bill, if you call it a farm bill, national farm policy for the next 7 years was developed by the Republican leadership.  Mr. Chairman, Americans are the best fed people in the world. They have a stable and abundant supply of nutritious food and pay a lower percentage of their disposable income for food than any other of the industrialized nations in the world.  I would like to think that the House Committee on Agriculture, on a bipartisan basis and in spite of what editorial writers say, has played a constructive role in this success story. But that is no more, unfortunately. For example, last year Speaker Gingrich, the Republican leader, and the Republican whip wrote a letter to the gentleman from Kansas, Chairman Roberts. That letter dictated to the Committee on Agriculture, in no uncertain terms, the specific policy option that the committee was to choose in order to meet its reconciliation savings.  No room was left for the committee to deliberate, for the committee to obtain views of farmers, of consumer groups, of the administration. That leadership-dictated policy was the foundation of what is now included in H.R. 2854.  Mr. Chairman, the policy included by decree of the gentleman from Georgia, Speaker Gingrich, in the bill now before the House was first introduced as a bill in August. In a blatant rejection of our sacred principles of open government, our committee did not hold one single hearing on this proposal and still has not to this day. There were other hearings held to gather information, much before this time, but none on the proposal itself.  Mr. Chairman, farmers in every region of this country have very grave concerns about the agriculture provisions before this House. They represent a sudden and dramatic abandonment by the Government of its role in sharing the farmer's risk. Farmers are particularly concerned that a sudden withdrawal of the Federal Government may make the difference in their fight to stay on the farm. Yes, they may know that each year they will get a cash payment, but if prices collapse next year, will that payment be enough? If wheat prices fall to $2.50, how many wheat farmers will be out of business in Kansas, in the Dakotas, in Washington States? If cotton prices fall back down to 45 cents, how many cotton growers spread out all over the South and areas of the Southwest will survive? If corn prices are under $2, where will the corn belt be? What if milk prices fall to $9. How many of New England's dairy farmers make it?  Mr. Chairman, farmers will hope for the best. But if the best does not materialize and a substantial base of our food and fiber production capacity is lost, will we feel that it was worth the risk?  All these questions, Mr. Chairman, and we have no answers; not even opinions. All we had in the Committee on Agriculture this year were a few votes. No discussion. No consideration of the views of farmers, the consumers, the businesses that thrive on the products of agriculture, those hearings on which we have always heavily relied. The policy before the House was not aired out in the Committee on Agriculture, it was dictated by the Republican leadership. When a bipartisan majority of our committee defeated this bill last fall, the Republican leadership nevertheless packaged it with tax cuts and health care program changes and forced it on the floor.                              {time}  1330  Mr. Chairman, it was inevitable that the President would veto that bill and he did, and I agree that it should have been vetoed. Rather than acting quickly to move farm policy forward, our committee sat until the end of January and did nothing. Only in the hours before a 3-week congressional break did our committee finally act, and again I respectively state this is through no fault of the chairman of the committee. The actions were held in other areas by other people.  Mr. Chairman, a further frustration to us is that farm policy continues to be driven by outdated decisions. The Republican leadership continues to insist on cutting over $13 billion from agriculture programs. We know that these cuts were not conceived in the context of any consideration to good farm policy. We were cutting acting with numbers in a vacuum only. We have to attach faces and places to legislation. This has not been done to this day. Rather, the decision to cut the very heart out of farm programs was integral to the radical Republican policy of cutting $270 billion out of the rate of increase in Medicare and providing for a $245 billion tax cut. This has fluctuated, it has changed up and down, and the administration has become involved in these overall considerations, all of it outside of the realm of the members of the Committee on Agriculture.  Mr. Chairman, all parties have now conceded that any tax cut will be for less, as will reductions in health care program spending as we move forward to a balanced budget. No committee in this House has provided more for a balanced budget than the Committee on Agriculture. Had every committee done what we have done, we would not be worrying about a balanced budget at this point in time. If the enormous tax and Medicare cuts have been abandoned, is it not also time to recognize that the size of the cuts ordered for agriculture should be reexamined? Those policies were after all the driving force behind the Republican decision to cut $13 billion from agriculture.  Mr. Chairman, we are in a difficult position. Time is not available to fully address the errors that have been committed in this flawed process. There will be some who would say, well, there will be a conference. Conference has limitations, limitations that restrict activity by members of the conference. Farmers who should have already made crucial farming decisions are kept waiting. The very fact that we have not acted yet has jeopardized agriculture. Action in farm policy for 1996 must be taken and taken quickly.  In that light, our No. 1 priority is to make what changes we can in this flawed bill to strengthen our farm economy and its rural base.  Mr. Chairman, the bill is titled the ``Agriculture Market Transaction Program,'' and we believe that few have escaped the meaning of the term ``transition'': That the Federal Government will withdraw completely from its partnership with the producer in providing for the food security of our Nation. And I have just come back from my district and other parts of Texas, and they now say that ``this bill is not what we were talking about.'' We want to reduce regulation; we want to reduce needless spending. We did not want to say ``take the Government completely out as we act in unison, together, for the betterment of America.''  So they did not say that we should withdraw completely from the partnership with the producer in providing for the food security of our Nation. However, if such a transition is to occur, we believe that now is an appropriate time for investments to be made with the posttransition period in mind.  Regretfully, the rule does not provide for that. It is limited in scope, it is limited as to how many amendments, what type of amendments. Many of you heard the chairman of the Committee on Rules: We did this because we did not want this many more amendments from Wisconsin, and so on. Toward the end, Mr. Chairman, we proposed to increase the Department of Agriculture's authority to invest in the rural infrastructure, water deliveries, sewage disposal. We propose to increase this authority to make investments that conserve and protect our natural resources, and we propose to make crucial investments in agriculture research, education and extension.  Yesterday I was in my district, for a meeting of rural housing representatives and all you need to do is go down there and you will see the immense need in rural housing, and as I told them and I repeat to you today, the creature of G-d has a certain level of dignity mandated by laws beyond, beyond our country and beyond this Chamber. The human dignity that needs to be addressed includes decent housing so that those of higher intellect have a decent place to live. Only within government can we form a partnership. Earning a minimum wage is not going to allow someone to buy housing for them and for their family, and we have hundreds of thousands of those people, but yet we are not addressing those areas.  We propose to ensure that our highly productive oilseed industry, which will receive no benefit from the bill's contract payments, is able to continue to compete effectively in world markets. We would delete the set level for the oilseed market loan in the bill, which is set at an arbitrary fixed amount, dealing in a vacuum, and replace it with a formula based on actual market prices.  Finally, we believe that our agriculture sector is so important to our Nation that we deserve a farm policy debate in 2002. To ensure that debate, we propose to retain permanent farm support authority.  Therefore, on behalf of Democratic members of the Committee on Agriculture, I will offer three amendments en bloc, the first, authored by the gentlewoman from North Carolina [Mrs. Clayton]. The amendment would provide the Commodity Credit Corporation with the authority to dispense $3.5 billion of its funds for rural development conservation and research, education and extension.  The second was written by the gentleman from South Dakota [Mr. Johnson], who has been a tremendous inspiration in this endeavor. It would set the loan rate for oilseed marketing assistance loans at 85 percent of the 5-year average price for oilseeds, excluding the high and the low years.  The third would strike the provision of the committee substitute which repeals the permanent farm law.  Mr. Chairman, I am dismayed over this process. Our people deserve better from this Congress. We have been the partnership. The experts and the major periodicals in New York and San Francisco and Orange County; I keep reading editorials form Orange County about the farm, farm products, farm process, farm policy. We have in my family seven grandchildren who know more about farm policy that the editorial writers from Orange County, CA, Mr. Chairman.  Also, I ask the committee and the Members to stay with us on the amendments that we will be opposing. Many of those amendments that were granted are aimed at satisfying the needs of major media. They have not spoken to agriculture. They have not spoken to rural America. They have not spoken to the people. They are looking at that headline in the major periodical. Would you trust a newspaper in New York City to set the policy for the farmers and ranchers of America? And, needless to say, Mr. Chairman, of all of the matters involving the budget, we have met our commitment.  Furthermore, Mr. Chairman, let me say that everything that we do as far as production in this country, manufacturing, industrial production, everything is in deficit as far as international trade is concerned. Everything is deficit. That is the free market. It is in deficit. Dollars are flowing out, dollars we do not have. The only thing that is bringing money back, green back, green dollars back, is agriculture. The only thing that is positive is agriculture. And yet they say subsidy, subsidy, subsidy. Look at this chart. You cannot see the line at the bottom. That is how much of an impact we make on the budget, seven-tenths of 1 percent is agricultures share of the trillions of dollars we spent on the budget.  And then here is a major one. The green is agriculture. The red is everything else. The red is in deficit, has been. Except for selling a few high tech items and airplanes, agriculture is the only one bringing money back from abroad.  So saying we need a new direction, we need another this, another that, what we need is, with the help of the good Lord, a little more rain here and less rain there, and a policy that manages, I do not care how you slice it. Every company, every industry manages, manages, and we cannot go and face the world because all other countries, most of them camouflage support of their agriculture and we would be the only one that does not support agriculture under the guise of satisfying our New York newspaper who says the free market.  The free market has never existed. There has always been some manipulation. There will be more manipulation, and we are shooting ourselves in the foot when we yield to those pleas for liberators so that we can be eaten by those that camouflage their intentions and their agriculture.  We need strong agriculture, we need to have a program where the government participates, and this program unfortunately phases out. Yes, you will get a little money. If somebody goes to Las Vegas and they win the first thing on the machine and second thing on the machine, they say we got it. Stay there long enough and you have lost it all. This is what this is going to do, show a little money, show a little candy up front. Eventually, 7 years, we are off and away and we will be as loose as that satellite that broke from the tether up in the skies the other day. It is loose out there and heaven knows where it is going to be. We do not want American agriculture to be in that condition.  So I urge Members to support those amendments that might make this a little better, oppose those that try and destroy programs that have worked. We are the best fed people in the world, we spend less money than everyone else in the world, and, oh, the sugar, sugar, sugar. We are talking about jobs, jobs for Americans, and if you open up and the world unloads all the sugar, we are not going to have a sugar program and the people are not going to have lower prices in sugar. Even now when we did not have a sugar program the prices skyrocketed, skyrocketed to the consumer. When we have held it down to a level, when we have reduced, the product at the retail store did not come down, the product that they talk about the consumer as being gouged, that did not come down at all, the soft drinks, all of the cookies, all of the candies. They did not come down at all. We kept paying the same. But yet they blame it all on the program.  So, Mr. Chairman, I hope that the Members that have listened will agree with us also that we need stability. Stability can only be done in a partnership. That partnership has worked and is working, and I hope that we continue it.
