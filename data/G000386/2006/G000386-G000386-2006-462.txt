 President, 16 million additional American families could find themselves subject to the alternative minimum tax if we do not act quickly. Failure to pass a minimum level of alternative minimum tax relief, as was provided in the Senate-passed reconciliation bill, is not an option. In fact, I support full AMT repeal. Some of my colleagues are creating a false choice when they suggest that in order to provide AMT relief we need to remove incentives that encourage economic growth. We can design a tax package which will include dividends, capital gains, AMT, and a 1-year extension for all expiring tax relief, all within that $70 billion limit. I encourage my colleagues to vote for this motion which provides relief for alternative minimum tax and capital gains and dividends as well.  I yield.
