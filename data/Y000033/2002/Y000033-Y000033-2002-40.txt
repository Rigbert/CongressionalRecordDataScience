Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman for his comments.  Mr. Speaker, this has been an interesting afternoon. Changes came and went and were never implemented, but we are finally at the point to vote on this continuing resolution to keep the government functioning beyond midnight tomorrow night, and to keep us going until midnight Friday of next week.  I am satisfied that between now and then we will have another exercise very similar to this one. I look forward to that exercise, and I am sure all the Members of the House do. But for now, I would just ask the Members to vote this CR and let us adjourn for the night.
