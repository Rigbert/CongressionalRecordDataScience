Chairman, I would note that this Gibbons amendment would bar the Department of Energy from planning for the transportation of spent nuclear fuel or high level radioactive waste through any State unless the Governor of the State certified that an adequate emergency response team existed in the State.  This, in a sense, would give every Governor a veto over nuclear waste transportation through their State. All that the Governor would have to do is to refuse to certify that their State has adequate emergency response teams, and that is it. That is it. A killer amendment.  The temptation would be irresistible to perhaps the Governor of Nevada, because no matter how adequately trained their emergency response team might be, the Governor would just say, no.  I would ask my colleagues to vote no on this amendment. I would note that in the deliberations in the markup before our full committee, the gentlewoman from Missouri, Karen McCarthy, a respected Member, wanted to offer an amendment. We worked with her, it was included, in fact, in the manager's amendment, and it directed that the Secretary of Transportation would, in fact, establish procedures for the selection of preferred railroad routes for transportation of nuclear waste to an interim storage facility and repository, and DOT would be directed to consult with State emergency response officials in the development of these preferred routes.  That means that there is local input. The Governors and the States aregoing to be involved. Thanks to the input of the gentlewoman from Missouri [Ms. McCarthy], that amendment has been adopted as part of this bill, and, therefore, there is no need for the Gibbons amendment.
