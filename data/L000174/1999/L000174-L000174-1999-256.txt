President, I rise today to congratulate a recent college graduate who resides in Rutland, Vermont. Lyba Cohen has joined the multitude of students who received their bachelor's degrees from colleges and universities across the country in the past months. She graduated from Lehman College in the Bronx, New York with a bachelor's degree in English literature with a minor in Italian. She also walked away with a nearly perfect GPA. Although Lyba Cohen speaks seven languages fluently, she considers the English language her greatest love. She has an insatiable love of learning, and plans to continue her education next fall.  there is one detail that I have failed to mention regarding this recent college graduate. Mr. President, Lyba Cohen is 82 years old. she was born and raised in Estonia, became part of the Zionist movement after high school, and was among the first people to settle the state of Israel. A woman who has worn many hats throughout her life, Mrs. Cohen is a tribute to students and senior citizens alike. She relocated to Rutland two years ago, and I am proud to honor this fascinating Vermonter. Mrs. Cohen has led a rich and fulfilling life,and at 82 she has embarked on yet another journey. this unique student deserves recognition, and I ask that the article from the Rutland daily Herald be printed in the Record so that all Senators may read about this remarkable women.  The article follows.    A Lifelong Learner--Rutland Woman Earns College Degree at Age 82                           (By Cauley Greene)       Lyba Cohen is a great student. She's graduating with a sky-     high GPA and a bachelor's degree in English literature with a      minor in Italian.       Like other graduates, she looks forward to a summer of rest      before deciding whether to delve back into academia.       But unlike most college graduates, Cohen is 82 years old.       She'll be accepting her diploma from Lehman College in the      Bronx, N.Y., on Friday with the rest of the class of 1999.       The more than 60 years between her high school diploma and      her bachelor's degree have been packed full with feats that      make her latest accomplishment seem more like a brief stop      along the way than a final destination.       She has been a pioneer, a working mother and, most      recently, a student.       Although her life as a traditional student began 10 years      ago at a non-traditional age, Cohen has been something of a      student all her life, learning as she went along.       Born and raised in Estonia, Cohen ventured off the beaten      path early.       ``When I graduated from high school I joined a group of      friends that I had in a Zionist youth organization,'' she      said. For two years the group trained for a life in      agriculture, to be among the first to settle what is now      Israel.                           *   *   *   *   *       When war broke out in 1948, Abraham traveled back and forth      to Israel while Lyba stayed in New York, helping her father-     in-law with the family bakery. After the war ended her      husband returned and took over the bakery. Cohen helped run      the business until their two sons were out of school.       In 1970, she took the civil service test and took a      position with the New York City Human Resources      Administration, where she worked for 17 years, living in the      Bronx. Widowed in 1973, Cohen lived and worked in the Bronx      by herself. She retired in 1987.       Restless and driven by what she described as a love of the      English language, she enrolled at Lehman College a year after      she retired. An interest in English, sparked when Cohen was      in high school, guided her toward a concentration in      literature and modern language.       ``I just fell in love with the English language,'' she said      of her high school years.       She has been taking college classes since 1988, averaging      two courses a semester.       ``It took me a very long time because of health problems      and hospital says,'' she said. Her health and other factors      prompted her move from the Bronx to Ruthland in December      1997, but she stayed in school.       ``I didn't give up,'' she said.       She now lives across the street from her son, Barry Cohen.      Her other son, Boaz, who lives in Warren N.J., will join the      family as they watch her accept her diploma.       The move made finishing her degree more difficult, but Lyba      Cohen said she's glad she came north.       ``I love it here, it's a wonderful place . . . I wish I had      come here earlier,'' she said.       Her love of language is greater. She speaks seven different      tongues, and when she speaks it seems every word she uses has      been carefully chosen. She cites the same discrimination in      her favorite author, Vladimir Nabokov, who also learned      English as a second language.       ``I like him, I like his linguistic proficiency,'' she      said.       Cohen's love of language has also translated into academic      success. She has received grades higher than an ``A'' in her      last two semesters, and was told by her professor that three      papers on author Toni Morrison she had recently done were      written on a graduate level. Cohen's GPA is also very high,      but she said that it doesn't really matter to her.       ``It's close to 4.0, I think . . . It's really of no      importance to me at all. The fact is I've acquired a lot of      knowledge, she said.       Which begs the question: what will she do with her degree?      Her answer probably echoes that of graduates 60 years her      junior.       ``After the summer I'm going to think about taking some      courses . . . but I have the summer to think about it,'' she      said.                          ____________________
