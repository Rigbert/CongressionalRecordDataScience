 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 866, to make technical corrections to the United States Code. I introduced this legislation on February 16, 2005, along with Committee on the Judiciary's Ranking Member Conyers. The Office of Law Revision Counsel of the House of Representatives has prepared this bill and submitted it to the Committee on the Judiciary under section 285(b) of title 2, United States Code. Pursuant to rule X of the House of Representatives, the Committee on the Judiciary maintains jurisdiction over the revision and codification of statutes of the United States.  This bill revises, codifies and enacts without substantive changes certain general and permanent laws. The effective titles of the United States Code under this bill, include: title 10, armed forces; title 23, highways; title 28, judiciary and judicial procedure; title 36, patriotic and national observances,ceremonies and organizations; and title 40, public buildings, property, and works.  Let me be clear that this bill makes no substantive change in existing law. Rather it removes ambiguities, contradictions and other imperfections from existing law and repeals obsolete, superfluous and superseded provisions.  Madam Speaker, H.R. 866 is a simple bill that makes necessary technical updates to existing law. I urge my colleagues to support it.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
