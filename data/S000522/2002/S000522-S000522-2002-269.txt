Mr. Speaker, troubling amendments to the current Kazakh law on religion await President Nursultan Nazarbayev's signature to enter into force. Both the lower and upper houses of the Kazakh parliament passed the amendments without any substantive modifications. As a result, if President Nazarbayev signs the legislation into law during the ten-day window, Kazakhstan would seriously undermine its commitments as a participating State in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to ensure the freedom of the individual to profess and practice their religion or belief.  Introduced without public consultation in late November 2001, the amendments passed the lower house on January 17 and the upper house on January 31 of this year. The sudden rush to passage was surprising. Kazakhstan had been working with the OSCE Advisory Panel of Experts for Freedom of Religion or Belief to craft a law in harmony with its OSCE commitments. In fact, an earlier draft heavily criticized by the Advisory Panel was withdrawn in August 2001. The Advisory Panel issued a report on the latest draft on January 16, 2002, highlighting serious deficiencies in the text. However, it appears little heed was given to their critique. Reportedly, the executive branch pushed vigorously for legislation providing stricter controls on minority religious groups, which would explain the rapid consideration.  In response to these unfolding events, myself, Chairman Ben Nighthorse Campbell and six other Commissioners of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Helsinki Commission, wrote President Nazarbayev last week about these developments. The text of that letter which I am submitting for the Record, highlights several, but not all problematic elements of the recently passed legislation. Of particular note are the increased hurdles for registration and vaguely worded articles, which could allow for arbitrary denials of registration for religious groups, and consequently their legal existence. Accordingly, there is great concern for the future of religious freedom in Kazakhstan, whether for Muslims or Christians.  Mr. Speaker, in the letter we respectfully asked President Nazarbayev not to sign the amendments into law.  Our concerns are not based on mere supposition; related laws and regulations have been utilized to suppress faith communities in Kazakhstan. For example, this past summer Article 375 of the Administrative Code was introduced, requiring the registration of all religious groups and including language penalizing unregistered religious groups. Police have since justified several raids on religious meetings citing Article 375, resulting in harassment and imprisonment as well as reported beatings and torture. Actions late last year against unregistered Baptist pastors is an illustrative example.  On October 27, 2001, Pastor Asylbek Nurdanov, a Baptist leader in the Kyzyl-Orda regional city of Kazalinsk, went to a police station after his church was raided for failing to register. Once there, he was reportedly severely beaten and stripped, with one officer attempting to strangle him with a belt. Another threatened to cut off his tongue with scissors if he did not renounce his faith. It was also reported that on November 10, Pastor Nurdanov was forcibly taken and detained in a psychiatric hospital in Kyzyl-Orda. While he was released on November 16, such abuse is unacceptable. Other reports of police harassment and detention of Baptist pastors who have not registered their faith communities also exist. For example, on September 25, 2001, the Aktobe public prosecutor initiated legal proceedings against Baptist Pastor Vasily Kliver on the charge of ``evading the registration of a religious community.'' In October, Baptist pastor Valery Pak was jailed in Kyzyl-Orda for five days on the same charge.  These reports of harassment, torture and detention indicate a serious failure to uphold Kazakhstan's human rights commitments as an OSCE participating State. As is evident, our concerns about Kazakh authorities utilizing the proposed amendment's restrictive nature to harass, if not condemn, religious groups are borne out by past practice in Kazkahstan. Mr. Speaker, it is my hope that President Nazarbayev will honor the obligations his nation freely chose to uphold as a participating OSCE state and not sign the amendments into law.  Mr. Speaker, I request that the text of the letter sent to President Nazarbayev last week be included in the Record.                                                 January 30, 2002.     His Excellency Nursultan Nazarbayev,     President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Astana, Kazakhstan.       Dear President Nazarbayev: We write today to express our      concern over the proposed amendments to the Law on Freedom of      Religion and Religious Associations. We view the amendments,      scheduled for consideration by the Senate on January 31st, as      problematic, since they would seriously undermine      Kazakhstan's commitments to human rights as a participating      State in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in      Europe (OSCE). Therefore, should the Kazakh Senate approve      the amendments, we respectfully ask that you not sign them      into law.       The OSCE Advisory Panel of Experts on Freedom of Religion      and Belief issued a review of the proposed amendments on      January 16, 2002. The review found the proposed amendments,      while an improvement from an earlier draft withdrawn in      August 2001, seriously deficient in many respects. In      addition, the OSCE Centre in Almaty has stated the current      religion law meets international standards and found no      justification for initiating the new provisions. Therefore,      we believe the remarks contained in the OSCE Advisory Panel      critique should be followed fully.       Problematic areas include, but are not limited to,      permitting the registration of Muslim groups and the building      of mosques only after a recommendation of the Spiritual      Administration of Muslims of Kazakhstan. In addition, the      number of individuals required to form a religious      association would increase from 10 to 50, regardless of      religion. Furthermore, the proposed amendments would permit      dissolution of a religious group should individual members of      the group commit repeated violations of the law. Each of      these examples would allow the government to arbitrarily deny      registration, and thereby     legal existence, on specious legal grounds not in harmony      with OSCE commitments.       Reportedly, your government's justification for the new      requirements in the current amendments, which create hurdles      for registration, is to combat religious extremism. Yet the      definition of ``religious extremism'' in the amendments is      vague and inherently problematic, potentially categorizing      and prohibiting groups on the basis of their beliefs, rather      than on their having committed illegal actions. Such vague      language would allow the arbitrary interpretation of a      group's beliefs and uneven implementation of the law.       Our fear of Kazakh authorities harshly employing new      requirements against religious groups is not unfounded. While      the existing religion law does not require registration of      faith communities, Article 375 of the Administrative Code, a      provision added last year, requires the registration of faith      communities. Since the promulgation of that article, we have      received several reports of unregistered groups being      penalized through criminal sanctions, as well as individuals      being beaten while in custody. The harassment, detention and      beating of individuals for merely belonging to unregistered      religious groups, as well as disproportionate criminal      charges for an administrative violation, are in direct      violation of OSCE commitments.       In calling for these actions, we remind you of the 1991      Moscow Document in which the OSCE participating States      declared that ``issues relating to human rights, fundamental      freedoms, democracy and the rule of law are of international      concern'' and ``are matters of direct and legitimate concern      to all participating States and do not belong exclusively to      the internal affairs of the State concerned.'' It is in this      light that these requests are made.       Last autumn, your government made a wise decision by      choosing to honor its OSCE commitments and withdrawing the      earlier version of the amendments. Recognizing the crucial      importance that the very highest standards of religious      freedom and human rights agreed to and proclaimed in various      Helsinki documents be upheld, we respectfully urge you to      take similar steps and not sign the amendments into law,      should they pass the Senate without substantive modification.           Sincerely,         Ben Nighthorse Campbell, U.S.S. Chairman, Steny H. Hoyer,            M.C., Zach Wamp, M.C., Alcee L. Hastings, M.C.,            Christopher H. Smith, M.C. Co-Chairman, Joseph R.            Pitts, M.C., Robert B. Aderholt, M.C., Louise McIntosh            Slaughter, M.C.                                     ____________________
