Speaker, I would like to submit the following Remarks for the Record. We have before us H.R. 4518, the ``Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act of 2004'' (SHVERA). H.R. 4518 reauthorizes certain expiring communications and copyright act provisions that govern the retransmission of broadcast television signals by direct broadcast satellite (DBS) providers such as DirecTV and EchoStar. It also modernizes other provisions to enhance consumer choice, increase parity between satellite and cable operators, and further promote competition. Because the bill implicates both communications and copyright issues, the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the House Judiciary Committee have worked closely in drafting the legislation.  Indeed, pursuant to a compromise between the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the House Judiciary Committee, H.R. 4518 has now been amended to combine its copyright provisions with the Communications Act provisions of H.R. 4501. H.R. 4501 resulted from an extensive examination of satellite television issues in the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet held an oversight hearing on March 10, 2004, and a legislative hearing on April 1, 2004. The Subcommittee then marked up legislation on April 28, 2004, and the full Committee marked up legislation on June 3, 2004. That legislation became H.R. 4501. The Committee filed a report on H.R. 4501 (H. Rept. 108-634) on July 22, 2004.  What follows is a section-by-section analysis of some of the Communications provisions in Title II of H.R. 4518, as amended, that have changed from the provisions that originated in H.R. 4501. Mr. Barton, Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, has also addressed some of the changes.               Section 202. Cable/Satellite Comparability  Section 340(f) creates a mechanism to enforce the new provisions regarding satellite delivery of significantly viewed signals. Under section 340(f)(1), the FCC may issue a cease and desist order if it finds in response to a complaint that satellite operators are carrying broadcast signals in violation of Section 340. If a broadcast station seeks damages, section 340(f)(1)(A) authorizes the FCC to award the station up to $50 per subscriber illegally served, per station illegally carried, per day of the violation if the FCC finds that the satellite operator did not have a good-faith belief that provision of the signal was lawful. Conversely, if a broadcaster seeks damages and the FCC finds that the broadcaster's claims were madein bad faith, section 340(f)(1)(B) allows the FCC to award the satellite operator up to $50 per subscriber, per station, per day that the broadcaster alleged the satellite operator was serving in violation of Section 340. If the broadcaster does not seek damages, however, the FCC may not grant damages to either the broadcaster or the satellite operator. Section 340(f)(2) gives the FCC 180 days from the submission of a complaint to render a decision. If the pleadings indicate that material facts underlying the case are subject to genuine dispute, the FCC may--but is not required--to hear witnesses. Section 340(f)(3) makes clear that an FCC proceeding under Section 340 is available in addition to any remedies that may be available under the Copyright Act. For example, a broadcaster who also holds copyrights in the programming it carries might bring a claim before the FCC if it believes a satellite operator has carried a signal in a way that violates the Communications Act conditions for providing significantly viewed signals, as well as a suit in court if it believes that the same carriage also violates the terms under which a compulsory license is available under the Copyright Act. Section 340(f)(4) makes clear that any action or inaction by the FCC in response to a section 340 complaint shall have no bearing on a copyright suit, and that filing a section 340 complaint with the FCC is not a prerequisite for filing a suit in court alleging that carriage of a purportedly significantly viewed signal has violated a copyright.  Section 340(g) requires satellite operators to give local broadcasters 60 days notice before retransmitting into a market the signal of distant stations that are significantly viewed over the air in the local market, and to list on their web sites the significantly viewed signals they carry. This provision is intended to help make consumers aware of what signals the satellite operators are offering. It is also intended to help local broadcasters monitor satellite compliance with the conditions SHVERA creates for the provision of significantly viewed signals.  Section 340(h)(1) gives the FCC until April 30, 2005, to revise its rules so that a network station may elect ``carry-one, carry-all status'' from a satellite operator on a community-by-community basis within a local market. Under current law, when a satellite operator offers local-into-local service in a market, the local broadcasters may choose between carry-one, carry-all status and retransmission consent. If the local broadcaster elects carry-one, carry-all status, the satellite operator must carry the station, but the station is not entitled to compensation. If the station chooses retransmission consent, the broadcaster can try to negotiate for compensation, but runs the risk of not getting carried at all.  Because cable systems are subject to local franchising, each community within a local market generally has a separate cable system. If a cable system is carrying a significantly viewed signal in a community, a local broadcaster of the same network can elect must-carry for that system, but still negotiate retransmission consent for cable systems elsewhere in the local market where no significantly viewed signal for the same network is being carried.  Because satellite operators have a nationwide--rather than local-franchise-based--service area, however, local broadcasters ordinarily must choose between carry-one, carry-all status and retransmission consent as an all-or-nothing proposition throughout the entire local market. To accommodate the new significantly viewed authority for satellite operators and to recreate, as best as possible, a similar bargaining framework for local broadcasters as exists with cable systems, section 340(h)(1) allows a local broadcaster to elect carry-one, carry-all status in communities with a significantly viewed signal from the same network, while continuing to negotiate retransmission consent in other communities in the market.  To ease the administrative burden on the satellite operator, section 340(h)(2) specifies that the community-by-community elections within a local market shall take place in a unified negotiation between each satellite operator and broadcaster. There is no particular time limit on the negotiation. Nor must it take place in one sitting. The broadcaster shall, however, ``lay all its elections on the table at once'' so that the satellite operator can see the entire picture in anticipation of any retransmission consent negotiations that may be necessary in the communities where the broadcaster does not elect ``carry one, carry all.''  To facilitate the community-by-community election process, section 340(h)(3)(A) gives the FCC until April 30, 2005, to revise its rules to require satellite operators to notify broadcasters in advance of any communities in which they intend to carry significantly viewed signals. The satellite operators are permitted to carry significantly viewed signals only in communities for which the satellite operators provide such notice. Section 340(h)(3)(B) recognizes that a satellite carrier could begin importing a ``significantly viewed'' signal after the expiration of a long-term retransmission consent contract but before the next three-year election cycle would allow the television station to choose between retransmission consent and carry one, carry all on a community-by-community basis. Consequently, section 340(h)(3)(B) allows a broadcaster to choose between retransmission consent and carry one, carry all on a community-by-community basis for any portion of the three-year cycle not covered by an existing retransmission consent agreement.  One way the FCC might implement section 340(h)(3) for a station that entered into a retransmission consent agreement before the effective date of the Act, and that expires before the end of 2005, would be to require the satellite operator to send the station, by certified mail, at least 60 days before the agreement expires, the required notification for any period between the date of expiration of that agreement and December 31, 2005. If the satellite carrier gives that notice, the station could then, within 30 days of receipt, choose retransmission consent or mandatory carriage for those communities covered by the notification for the period between the date of expiration of the agreement and the end of 2005. For existing retransmission contracts that expire later but between election periods under 47 C.F.R. 76.66, the FCC could require the satellite carrier to provide the station by certified mail, at least 60 days before the election date under section 76.66 that immediately precedes the expiration date of the contract, the required notification for any period between the date of expiration of the agreement and the end of the next three-year election cycle under section 76.66. If the satellite carrier gives that notice, the station could then, on the same schedule provided under section 76.66, elect retransmission consent or mandatory carriage for those communities covered by the satellite carrier's notification for the period between the date of expiration of the agreement and the date of expiration of the next three-year election cycle. Retransmission consent contracts entered into after the effective date of the Act will not be affected by this harmonization provision, because negotiators will be able to take into account the possible importation of significantly-viewed stations in the future.        Section 203. Carriage of Local Stations on a Single Dish  Section 203(b)(1) of the bill amends sections 338(a)(1) and (a)(2) of the Communications Act (47 U.S.C. 338(a)(1)-(2)) to make clear that the FCC may enforce satellite operators' carry-one, carry-all obligations. The Communications Act currently grants the FCC authority to enforce cable operator's must-carry obligations to carry all local broadcast stations upon request. There apparently is some ambiguity regarding the FCC's authority to enforce satellite operators' analogous carry-one, carry-all obligations. Section 203(b)(1) of the bill is intended to remove any doubt that a carrier can seek enforcement from the FCC under the Communications Act, in addition to any remedies it may have in court under the Copyright Act.  Section 203(b)(1) of the bill also adds section 338(a)(3) of the Communications Act (47 U.S.C. Sec. 338(a)(3)) to clarify that satellite carriage of low-power television stations is permissive, not mandatory. Section 104 of the bill grants satellite operators a compulsory copyright license to carry low-power stations. Section 338(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, makes clear that carriage of such stations does not fall within the carry-one, carry-all requirements of Section 338.  Sections 203(b)(2) and (b)(3) of the bill make conforming changes to the Act to implement section 203(b)(1) of the bill, and to define ``low power television station'' for purposes of that section.     Section 204. Replacement of Distant Signals with Local Signals  Section 204 of the bill amends section 339 of the Communications Act (47 U.S.C. Sec. 339) to require a satellite operator to stop providing distant signals of a network to certain subscribers in a market once the operator begins providing local signals of that network in that market, absent a waiver from the affected network station. It does, however, permit certain subscribers to continue receiving distant signals, and allows future distant signal subscribers in non-local-into-local markets to continue receiving such signals under certain circumstances. Section 204 does not apply to carriage of distant signals from non-network stations.  New section 339(a)(2)(A) requires certain grandfathered subscribers to choose between receiving a distant and a local signal of a network. Under SHVIA, some households that can receive a ``Grade B'' intensity over-the-air signal from a local network affiliate but not a ``Grade A'' signal qualify as ``unserved'' by that network because of a grandfathering provision in the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. Sec. 119(e)). These grandfathered customers are sometimes referred to as ``Grade B doughnut'' households. The grandfathered status of thesesubscribers is set to expire at the end of this year. Under section 339(a)(2)(A), once a satellite operator makes the local signal of a network available under section 338 to customers receiving the distant signal under the Grade B doughnut provisions, the customers must choose between the local signal and the distant signal. They may continue to receive the distant signal if they elect to do so, but the subscribers may not receive both the distant and local signals of the network. Customers who were eligible for distant signals under the Grade B doughnut provisions but were not receiving such signals under those provisions on October 1, 2004, will no longer be eligible for such grandfathering. Thus, the universe of grandfathered households is fixed as of that day and cannot be expanded thereafter.  New section 339(a)(2)(B) allows a satellite operator to provide both a local and a distant signal of a network to a subscriber who is unserved over-the-air by a Grade B signal of the network's local affiliate, so long as the satellite operator was offering the local signal of the network pursuant to section 338 by Jan. 1, 2005, and complies with certain notice obligations. If the satellite operator was not offering the local signal of the network pursuant to section 338 by Jan. 1, 2005, the satellite operator may provide both the distant and local signals to the subscriber only if the subscriber sought to subscribe to the distant signal before the satellite operator made the local signal available, and the satellite operator meets certain notice obligations.  New section 339(a)(2)(C) provides that a satellite operator may not provide a signal of a distant affiliate of a network to a consumer if the consumer is not lawfully receiving the signal from the satellite operator on the date of enactment of SHVERA and the consumer seeks to receive the distant signal after the satellite operator began making the local signal of that network available in the market.  New section 339(a)(2)(D) allows a local affiliate to waive any of the limitations in section 339(a)(2) as they apply to the retransmission, into the local affiliate's local market, of the distant signals of a station affiliated with the same network. The waiver can be as broad or as narrow as the affiliate wants. For example, a local affiliate can waive the application of section 339(a)(2) to one or more consumers in the local market, with respect to one or more specific distant affiliates of the same network, and with respect to one or more satellite operators. The broadcaster may do so as part of a negotiated agreement and for any reason, including common ownership among the stations. This is intended to be a private negotiation, not one over which the FCC or any other governmental body must preside; nor must any governmental body grant or approve the waiver. Whether to grant a waiver is a decision to be made solely based on the broadcaster's own business judgment, although a broadcaster may grant a waiver as part of an agreement made with a satellite operator or other parties. A broadcaster is also not required to execute any particular document as part of the waiver process, although parties who intend to rely on such a waiver or any attendant agreement will likely want to reduce the waiver and the agreement to writing, so that they have something to refer to should any dispute arise in the future. Such waivers are distinct from the waivers referred to in section 339(c)(2) of the Communications Act, although broadcasters are free to execute both types of waivers in tandem or with a single document. Unlike the section 339(c)(2) waivers, broadcasters must affirmatively grant section 339(a)(2)(D) waivers; they shall not be deemed granted by the broadcaster just because the broadcaster has not responded to a request within a certain amount of time. Nor are section 339(a)(2)(D) waivers or agreements subject to the section 325 good-faith negotiation requirement. Section 339(a)(2)(D) will facilitate agreements that provide consumers with more viewing choices.  New section 339(a)(2)(E) requires satellite operators to provide networks, within 60 days after enactment of SHVERA, with lists of certain subscribers to whom they offer distant signals. It also requires satellite operators, within 60 days after commencing in a market local-into-local service under section 338, to provide networks with lists of the subscribers to whom they offer certain distant signals. The notice obligations are designed to help networks monitor compliance with the new ``no-distant-where-local'' requirements that SHVERA creates.  New section 339(a)(2)(F) makes clear that the distant-signal limitations of section 339(a)(2) do not apply to the provision of significantly viewed signals under new section 340, or to the provision of distant signals to trucks and recreational vehicles.  Nothing in section 204 of the bill is intended to affect any existing waivers under section 339(c)(2) of the Communications Act.                          ____________________
