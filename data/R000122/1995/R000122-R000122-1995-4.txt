Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1350, the Maritime Security Act of 1995.  As a member of the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee and the Subcommittee on Merchant Marine in the 102d and 103d Congresses, I was actively involved in several maritime reform efforts. While that committee no longer exists, I am glad that we are making another attempt to ensure our status as a maritime power.  H.R. 1350 would support a fleet of militarily useful U.S.-flagged commercial vessels and American merchant marines for future needs. It would prevent foreign shipping interests from controlling all U.S. maritime trade. It would reduce the costs of the operating assistance program and eliminate burdensome administrative requirements. H.R. 1350 would also help our Nation's shipyards by encouraging the construction of new vessels here in America.  Throughout my tenure in the House of Representatives, I have been proud to come to the floor and vote in favor of several bills to ensure a vibrant American merchant marine and maritime industry. Such legislation is good for our economy and our national security.  Unfortunately, maritime reform and revitalization efforts failed to get the support of the other Chamber. I would urge my colleagues in the other body to get on board and support our Nation's maritime industry.
