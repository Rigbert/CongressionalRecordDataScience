And I did not know whether our Democrats had worked with people on your side of the aisle. If that is the case, then when I read the resolution, I am sure I will be pleased. But if there are questions, I will bring them to the attention of the leader.  Mr. Leader, of course we have next week's schedule. Next week's schedule does not include the only appropriation bill that we have not yet passed. As you know, we have passed 10 out of the 11 appropriations bills. The Labor-Health bill was passed through the House Appropriations Committee and ready to report in June. So it has now been pending for approximately 60, 75 days.  Do you have any expectation that the Labor-Health bill will be brought to the floor within the foreseeable future?  I yield to my friend.
