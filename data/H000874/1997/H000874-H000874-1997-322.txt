Speaker, today I am introducing the Farmer Estate Tax Relief Act of 1997. This bill is designed to make it easier for America's farming families to keep farming.  In discussions and visits with farmers throughout my district, I have learned that there is serious concern about the ability to pass farms on to future generations. The $600,000 exclusion from estate taxes is not enough to preserve these small businesses that are so dependent upon large capital and land investments.  In Maryland, I understand that there are about 1,000 farms valued at more than $1 million. A typical farm has anywhere from $20,000 to $200,000 worth of equipment.  It is a shame to hear stories of sons and daughters that must sell off part of their parents' farm simply to pay off the estate tax. While retaining the $750,000 ``special use'' valuation, my legislation would raise the exclusion by $1.4 million, allowing these heirs to exclude a total of $2 million of farm assets.  To encourage these heirs to stay in one of America's most crucial professions, my bill offers the total higher exclusion only to heirs that continue farming for at least 10 years.  Maryland farmers have raised a second issue with me that is addressed by my bill. These independent business people, who often do tough, physical labor into their 70's and 80's, must sometimes sell farm assets to pay high medical bills.  The legislation I am introducing today would allow a one-time exclusion from capital gains taxation for up to $500,000 of medical expenses. Taxpayers could apply this exclusion to the sale of farm or farm assets in the year of, before, or after the medical expenses occurred.  I know that there are many other Members that share my concerns on these issues. While estate taxes can also have a negative impact on other types of family businesses, I am most concerned about the impact on the men and women who put food on our tables.  As a nation, we cannot afford to push these farm families out of business and I am pleased to introduce this bill to provide them with relief. I urge prompt passage of the Farmer Estate Tax Relief Act.                          ____________________
