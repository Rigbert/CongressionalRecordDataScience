President, I would like to salute Richard ``Dick'' Pembroke, of North Bennington, VT, for his years of service and dedication to the State of Vermont.  Dick has been chosen as this year's honoree at the fourth annual Living History Day that will be held August 9, 2009. Dick's friends and family will pay tribute to him in downtown Bennington, for his many achievements and contributions to Bennington and to the State of Vermont.  I have had the good fortune to have known Dick for many years. Born and raised on a family farm in my hometown of Montpelier, Dick and I also share St. Michaels College in Vermont as our alma mater. He is a good friend and I am delighted for him and the recognition that he is being given.  In honor of Dick Pembroke, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Bennington Banner's story, ``Pembroke will be honored August 9 as `Living History,' '' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Bennington Banner, July 23, 2009]        Pembroke will be honored August 9 as ``Living History''       North Bennington.--Richard ``Dick'' Pembroke of Harrington      Road will be this year's honoree for the fourth annual Living      History Day to be held on Aug. 9 in front of Powers Market.       A different resident is chosen each year to be recognized      for their achievements and contribution in shaping the local      community. The two-hour event offers others a venue to share      stories about the honoree and enjoy time with neighbors and      friends. In addition to stories, there will be music, Kevin's      hot dogs and much more. The event takes place from noon to 2      p.m., is free and open to all ages.       Pembroke has lived a spiritually rich and diversified      private and public life. He was the eldest of four children,      born and raised in Vermont on the family farm in Montpelier.      He attended St. Michael's College in Winooski and      subsequently served in the Navy during the Korean War and      afterward, from 1951 to 1955. He met and married his wife,      MaryAnn, while stationed in Pensacola, Fla. Upon returning to      Vermont a short time later, he was employed at the First      National Grocery Store Corp.       Pembroke managed several stores before opening one in      Bennington in 1962. His love of horticulture and the outdoors      was insatiable. To fulfill this passion, he began a      landscaping business on the side, which gradually grew. In      1973, he left the grocery business and directed his full      attention to Pembroke Landscaping.       Being the father of one daughter and three sons kept him      busy and involved with loyal education. Pembroke coached      Little League and helped to construct the local Little League      park. He was also a member of the Mount Anthony Union High      School Booster Club from 1973 to 1980 as well as other school      organizations. Pembroke joined the Lions Club in 1957 and was      involved with building the current Lions Field. He was a      member of the University of Vermont board from 1980 to 1986,      director for the American Red Cross and a member of the      Knights of Columbus since 1963. He served on the Bennington      Zoning Board of Adjustment from 1975 to 1987 and was chairman      for 11 years.       In 1986, he discovered another avenue of public service      that suited him quite well: He was elected to the Vermont      House of Representatives, where he was chairman of the House      Transportation Committee for 12 of the 16 years he served. He      championed the construction of Route 279 in and around      Bennington and worked diligently on many infrastructure      projects related to safety and economic development.       In 2006, he was voted chamber of commerce person of the      year. ``Retirement'' is not a word in Pembroke's vocabulary.      He continues to keep a foot in the door of Pembroke      Landscaping and currently sits on the State Environmental      board as well as trustee/director of the Southwestern Vermont      Medical Center.                          ____________________
