 Mr. President, I am worried in this country that we hear rhetoric that is dangerous, and it is time to stop. It shames the very nature of what America is. These are ideas that are wrong, and I would say they are deeply anti-American.  My grandparents--my Italian grandparents, my Irish great-great-grandparents--heard some of this rhetoric when some in this country said they shouldn't come here: Don't allow these Papists into the United States; don't allow these Irish, who are opposed to the rule of Great Britain on their island, and they actually stood up and fought against Great Britain.  The words back then, like some of the words today, come from a place of fear and hatred. I do not want to stand by quietly and see the victims of terrorism and torture be demonized just so people will have talking points for the local evening news. We are better than this.  The bill my colleague, the junior Senator the from Texas, introduced an hour ago would prevent refugee protection for virtually all nationals of Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen, regardless of how much they have suffered at the hands of terrorists and despots. Women fleeing gang rapes and children fleeing horrors we cannot even imagine would be closed off.  A few weeks ago the world came together, stunned and heartbroken over the image of a 3-year-old Syrian child's lifeless body washed up on a Turkish beach. His tragic death focused our attention on the desperate plight of so many Syrians who have fled the horror of ISIS and Bashar al-Assad.  We called it the humanitarian issue of the day. We called forth images of our Statue of Liberty and our proud history as a land of refuge for those fleeing persecution. I heard so many on this floor as well as from commentators in the news. Those who call now for us to slam our doors on even properly vetted Syrian and other refugees should remember that the people we will shut out are those very children who touched our hearts just weeks ago.  Of course, we are horrified by what happened in Beirut and Paris, and we need an effective, thoughtful strategy for countering ISIS and other terrorist organizations. That is what we should be debating. What we have done so far is not working, and we should be talking about how more countries should be involved in this fight. ISIS is our enemy; the people fleeing ISIS are not.  In fact, we have had discussions about other things that could be done. Somebody who is on a terrorist watch list but who is in this country legally can go to a gun show and buy all the automatic weapons they want, and they break no law. They can buy all the ammunition they want, and theybreak no law. They can go to the store, as did one of the greatest terrorists this country faced--the man who did the Oklahoma city bombing--and buy the components of a bomb, and they break no law. These are the things we ought to be discussing.  I do not understand why Senator Cruz is on the Senate floor seeking unanimous consent to pass this bill. This very bill is on the Judiciary Committee agenda, and the committee is currently considering it and needed improvements to it.  When the Senate Judiciary Committee debates this bill, we will have a lot to discuss. This legislation affects constitutional rights, and should be carefully vetted by the judiciary committee. Serious constitutional concerns have been raised by voices from across the political spectrum--from the National Review to the ACLU.  Just yesterday I received a letter from former NRA president David Keene and Georgetown Law professor David Cole, in their roles with The Constitution Project. They urge opposition to this bill because it ``serves virtually no practical purpose, raises serious constitutional concerns, and would do nothing to keep America safe.'' These are strong words, and I take these concerns seriously. Rushing a bill to the floor when that very bill is already scheduled for consideration by the committee of jurisdiction is not a responsible approach to legislating. And when legislation involves something as fundamental as citizenship, we should give the judiciary committee an opportunity to consider and debate this bill before it is brought to the Senate floor.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record several articles relating to the topic at hand.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                     The Constitution Project,                                Washington, DC, November 18, 2015.     Hon. Chuck Grassley,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Hart Senate Office          Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Russell Senate          Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Leahy, and Judiciary      Committee Members: On January 22, 2015, Senator Ted Cruz (R-     TX) introduced S. 247, the Expatriate Terrorists Act (ETA).      Representative Steve King (R-IA) simultaneously introduced      companion legislation in the House. According to the bill's      sponsors, the ETA is a common sense counterterrorism tool      that would strip U.S. citizenship from Americans who fight      with or support foreign terrorist organizations working to      attack the United States. The ETA would also purportedly      ``fill . . . statutory holes'' in the Secretary of State's      ``authority to revoke a terrorist's passport.''       In fact, the ETA serves virtually no practical purpose,      raises serious constitutional concerns, and would do nothing      to keep America safe. We urge you to oppose it.       Like previous iterations of the same idea, the ETA would      amend 8 U.S.C. 1481(a), which sets out limited circumstances      under which U.S. citizens can be denaturalized or      expatriated. The bill would add the following to the short      list of predicate acts that can result in loss of      citizenship: 1) taking an oath of allegiance to a foreign      terrorist organization; 2) joining a foreign terrorist      organization's armed forces while they are fighting the      United States; and 3) ``becoming a member of, or providing      training or material assistance to,'' a foreign terrorist      organization.       The ETA also amends the Passport Act of 1926 to require the      Secretary of State to deny a passport to, or revoke one from,      anyone who the Secretary has determined is a member, or is      attempting to become a member, of a foreign terrorist      organization.       Senator Cruz has said repeatedly that the ETA works a      ``formal'' or ``affirmative'' renunciation of U.S.      citizenship. To the extent he means to suggest that, under      the bill, a person would automatically lose citizenship      simply by engaging in the above conduct, he is wrong. The ETA      does not and could not achieve that result.       Citizenship is a constitutional right, and the Constitution      prohibits the government from revoking a person's citizenship      against his will under any circumstances. As the Supreme      Court has explained, ``the intent of the Fourteenth      Amendment, among other things, was to define citizenship . .      . [and] that definition cannot coexist with a congressional      power to specify acts that work a renunciation of citizenship      even absent an intent to renounce. In the last analysis,      expatriation depends on the will of the citizen rather than      on the will of Congress and its assessment of his conduct.''      As a constitutional right, citizenship can be knowingly and      voluntarily waived, but it cannot be taken away from an      individual absent such a waiver. Thus, to revoke a person's      citizenship the government must prove not only that he      committed an expatriating act prescribed in section 1481(a),      but also that he did so voluntarily and with the specific      intent to relinquish his citizenship.       Given these requirements, the ETA will almost certainly      result in no additional expatriations. Unless Senator Cruz      expects citizens subject to expatriation proceedings freely      to admit that they joined or supported a foreign terrorist      group specifically intending to renounce their U.S.      citizenship, no one will in fact be expatriated. We doubt      that government officials would believe it an efficient use      of resources to try, especially given the broad reach of      existing laws that already provide harsh penalties for U.S.      citizens who engage in acts of terrorism.       The bill's passport revocation provisions are similarly      unnecessary. There is no ``statutory hole'' to fill--the      Secretary of State already has the authority to deny a      passport to anyone whose ``activities abroad are causing or      are likely to cause serious damage to the national security      or the foreign policy of the United States,'' and to revoke a      passport on the same grounds.       Not only is the bill practically useless, it also raises      serious constitutional concerns. The ETA makes membership in      or ``providing training or material assistance to'' certain      foreign terrorist organizations a predicate act to      expatriation. There are two constitutional problems with this      provision. First, neither ``training'' nor ``material      assistance'' is defined. Similar language in 18 U.S.C. 2339B      was ruled unconstitutionally vague until Congress added      specific definitions. Because Congress has not done so here,      this provision of the ETA suffers from the same      constitutional flaw.       Second, unlike other crimes currently listed in section      1481(a) that can result in loss of citizenship (see section      1481(a)(7)), Senator Cruz's addition does not require proof      of a conviction as a prerequisite. That omission undermines      the constitutional right of due process. As the Constitution      Project's Liberty and Security Committee explained in      opposing similar past attempts to amend section 1481(a):       [T]he language of 1481(a)(7) expressly requires a      conviction as a necessary prerequisite to denaturalization or      expatriation proceedings. This requirement protects the      constitutional right of due process, since one cannot      actually be said to have committed the acts specified in      1481(a)(7)--each of which are crimes against the United      States--until and unless those acts have been proven to a      jury beyond a reasonable doubt. As the Supreme Court      expressly held in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, Congress      cannot deprive an individual of his or her citizenship as a      ``punishment'' absent the procedural safeguards of a criminal      trial.       The rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)      and the United States' response to date raises a critical      question for Congress to consider, but it is not the ETA. For      well over a year, the United States has been at war with ISIL      and Congress has still not weighed in, notwithstanding its      constitutional responsibility to do so. Members should spend      their time debating and voting on this grave question, not      preoccupied with needless and likely unconstitutional      legislation.       We urge you to oppose the Expatriate Terrorists Act.           Sincerely,     David Cole,       Hon. George J. Mitchell, Professor in Law and Public Policy      at Georgetown University Law Center; co-chair of the      Constitution Project's Liberty and Security Committee     David Keene,       Opinion Editor, The Washington Times; Former Chairman,      American Conservative Union; co-chair of the Constitution      Project's Liberty and Security Committee.                                  ____               [From the National Review, Jan. 28, 2015]                       How Not To Fight Terrorism                           (By Gabriel Malor)       Representative Steve King and Senators Ted Cruz and Chuck      Grassley have reintroduced the Expatriate Terrorist Act, a      bill to strip U.S. citizenship from terrorists. The proposal      sounds nice in theory, but it is also unconstitutional and      unnecessary, the latest in a sad line of civil-liberties      infringements justified by politicians trying to look tough      in the war on terrorism. Even if the bill did not have these      fatal infirmities, it would put the determination of who will      retain their citizenship in the hands of unelected      bureaucrats at the Departments of Justice, State, and      Homeland Security. On that ground alone, all Americans should      unite in opposition.       The idea to strip citizenship from terrorists is not a new      one. In 2010, Senators Joe Lieberman and Scott Brown      introduced similar legislation, dubbed the Terrorist      Expatriation Act. Their bill would have amended the list of      expatriating acts in the Immigration and Nationality Act to      include material assistance to foreign terrorist      organizations. Legal scholars and civil libertarians pointed      out that the bill was neither necessary nor constitutional,      and ultimately it died.       The new bill put forward by King, Cruz, and Grassley goes      further, adding membership, training, and oaths of allegiance      to the list of expatriating acts. They claim that this      legislation is necessary to protect the homeland from      radicalized citizen-terrorists returning from abroad.       But citizenship is not a mere privilege. It is a right      specifically protected by the Constitution. Congress cannot      simply decide that individuals lose their citizenship when      they commit certain acts. Rather, to strip a person's      citizenship requires that the government prove not only that      he committed an act deemed expatriating by Congress but that      he did so knowingly and voluntarily and with the intent to      relinquish his citizenship. In the words of Justice White,      writing for the Supreme Court when this issue was settled      decades ago, ``in the last analysis, expatriation depends on      the will of the citizen rather than on the will of Congress      and its assessment of his conduct.''       Senator Cruz's claim that his bill would make the act of      becoming a terrorist an ``affirmative renunciation'' of      citizenship is deeply misleading. To be constitutional,      expatriation can be accomplished only by intent to      relinquish, something that Cruz, a lawyer and litigator of      great skill, should already know. And if he doesn't mean what      he is saying, he owes it to the American public to tell us      how he believes the law would operate or if it would even be      practicable at all.       On the issue of deception, King, Cruz, and Grassley say the      statutory change targets dangerous terrorist fighters who try      to return to the United States from abroad. The plain      language of the proposed legislation, however, is not limited      to those who actually take up arms. It applies to anyone who      merely claims membership in a terrorist organization or gives      an oath, training, or material assistance to terrorists,      regardless of whether he actually fights. And it is not      limited just to terrorists abroad; any of those actions taken      inside the United States would also trigger the citizenship-     stripping provision under the express terms of the      legislation, leading to the deplorable circumstance of      creating stateless terrorists within the jurisdictional      boundaries of the United States.       This is assuming the courts actually credit King, Cruz, and      Grassley's stated security purpose for proposing the law. If      the courts were to decide that the expatriation of terrorists      was intended to be a punitive act rather than a security      measure, a different and more stringent series of      constitutional prohibitions come into play, including the      Fifth and Sixth Amendment protections for criminal      defendants.       King, Cruz, and Grassley are selling fear to justify an      unconstitutional deprivation of rights, and they are doing it      for no good reason. If the U.S. government has enough      information to identify citizen-terrorists abroad and      intercept them on their attempted return, it has enough      information to bring criminal prosecutions against those      individuals for terrorism when they try to reenter the United      States. The authority to intercept and detain such      individuals has already been granted by Congress to the      Department of Homeland Security. The Department of Justice,      of course, also has the authority to prosecute such      individuals. And so the stated purpose for the proposed      legislation is dubious, since the government's responsibility      for intercepting returning terrorists is settled law, which      has a side benefit of being constitutional.       Even if this legislation were passed into law, because of      its constitutional infirmity it would never work as billed by      its proponents. Instead, it would mobilize an army of      bureaucrats at Justice, State, and Homeland Security to start      sniping away at Americans' rights of citizenship and travel.      For example, the Justice Department gets to designate or      decline to designate foreign terrorist organizations and so      controls the determination of who is subjected to losing his      citizenship. State Department officials have the authority to      determine who gets sent expatriation certificates. And      Homeland Security customs and border officers are responsible      for detaining and paroling or removing non-citizens,      including expatriated former citizens, who attempt entry to      the United States.       All of these bureaucratic acts are subject to abuse. For      that reason they are also subject to various types of      administrative and judicial challenge, which typically drag      on for years at great cost. Such litigation and the      bureaucratic infrastructure to support it would be for      questionable benefit in light of the alternate means already      in place to intercept terrorists.       In short, the Expatriate Terrorist Act is a      constitutionally suspect law. Well-established programs for      intercepting terrorists attempting to enter the United States      already exist. At best, the proposed bill would greatly      increase the power of government to use and abuse its      discretion to meddle with American lives. It does not      represent a genuine attempt to better our national security.      On the contrary, it is merely the latest in a series of      questionable infringements of civil liberties proposed by      politicians eager to exploit the public's fear of terrorism.                                  ____                               American Civil Liberties Union,                                Washington, DC, November 18, 2015.     Re Oppose Senator Ted Cruz's Request for Unanimous Consent on          S. 247, the Expatriate Terrorists Act, which Strips U.S.          Citizenship without Due Process and based on Suspicion               Vote ``No'' on S. 247 as Unconstitutional   S. 247 STRIPS AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP BASED ON MERE SUSPICION BY AN                       UNNAMED GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL       Dear Senator: The American Civil Liberties Union strongly      urges you to oppose S. 247, the Expatriate Terrorists Act,      which is sponsored by Senator Ted Cruz. The bill would strip      U.S. citizenship from Americans who have not been convicted      of any crimes, but who are merely suspected by an unnamed      government official of wrongdoing.       S. 247 is dangerous because it would attempt to dilute the      rights and privileges of citizenship, one of the core      principles of the Constitution. As the Supreme Court      explained in 1967 in Afroyim v. Rusk, ``the Fourteenth      Amendment was designed to, and does, protect every citizen of      this Nation against a congressional forcible destruction of      his citizenship, whatever his creed, color, or race . . . [It      creates] a constitutional right to remain a citizen in a free      country unless he voluntarily relinquishes that      citizenship.'' The bill is also unnecessary because existing      laws already provide significant penalties for U.S. citizens      who engage in acts of terrorism.       An already unconstitutional federal statute, 8 U.S.C.      Sec. 1481, provides that an American can lose his or her      citizenship by performing either of the following broad      categories of acts with the intention of relinquishing his or      her nationality:       acts that affirmatively renounce one's American      citizenship, such as taking an oath of allegiance to a      foreign government or serving as an officer in the armed      forces of a foreign nation; or       committing crimes such as treason or conspiracy to      overthrow the U.S. government, or bearing arms against the      United States, ``if and when [the citizen] is convicted      thereof by a court martial or by a court of competent      jurisdiction.''       S. 247 would add a new category of expatriating acts--     ``Becoming a member of, or providing training or material      assistance to, any foreign terrorist organization designated      under Section 219.'' This implicates several constitutional      concerns.       First, the material assistance provision added by the bill      would treat suspected provision of material assistance as an      act that affirmatively renounces one's American citizenship.      Thus, unlike treason or conspiracy to overthrow the U.S.      government, this provision would not require a prior      conviction. It would only require an administrative finding      by an unspecified government official that an American      citizen is suspected of providing material assistance to a      designated foreign terrorist organization with the intention      of relinquishing his or her citizenship.       Second, this provision would violate Americans'      constitutional right to due process, including by depriving      them of citizenship based on secret evidence, and without the      right to a jury trial and accompanying protections enshrined      in the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. In sum, the bill turns the      whole notion of due process on its head. Government officials      do not have the power to strip citizenship from American      citizens who never renounced their citizenship and were never      convicted of a crime.       Third, the material assistance provision suffers from the      same constitutional flaws that plague other material support      laws, and goes far beyond what the Supreme Court has held is      constitutionally permissible when First and Fourth Amendments      rights are at stake. In 2010, the Supreme Court      disappointingly ruled in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project      that teaching terrorist groups how to negotiate peacefully      could be enough to be found guilty of material support. Even      if that logic might apply to criminal conduct, it should not      cause an American to lose his or her citizenship.       For these reasons, the ACLU urges you to oppose S. 247.
