 Is it not correct that in the late 1990s we heard the same kind of arguments we are hearing today, that the States and localities would be bereft of revenue, and there would be financial calamity? Is it not correct in 1997, 1998, the National Governors Association said the State and local revenue system would collapse, and that very next year revenue went up something like $7 billion? Was that not the history all through this debate over the last 6 or 7 years, that we have had the projections from State and local officials that there would be disastrous financial consequences, and then you and I and Senator Sununu would look a short time later, and every single time revenue went up; is that correct?
