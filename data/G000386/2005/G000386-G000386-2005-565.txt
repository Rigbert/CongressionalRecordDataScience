 President, I am pleased to join my colleagues Senator Bayh and Senator Clinton in introducing the Improving Long-term Care Choices Act. This legislation sets forth a series of proposals aimed at improving the accessibility of long-term care insurance and promoting awareness about the protection that long-term care insurance can offer. It also seeks to broaden the availability of the types of long-term care services such as home- and community-based care, which many folks prefer to institutional care.  Before I begin my discussion of the merits of the legislation that I am introducing today, I want to take this opportunity to once again emphasize my commitment to enacting the Family Opportunity Act. I have worked to get the Family Opportunity Act enacted for many years now.  I have been motivated to work so hard because I have been deeply moved by a number of stories from families, both from my State of Iowa and elsewhere, who have had to turn down promotions, or even put their child with a disability up for adoption in order to secure for these children the medical services they so desperately need.  The Family Opportunity Act would provide a State option to allow families with disabled children to ``buy in'' to the Medicaid program; establish mental health parity in Medicaid Home and Community Based Waiver programs; establish Family to Family Health Information Centers and restore Medicaid eligibility for certain SSI beneficiaries.  As part of the on-going negotiations relative to the FOA, many stakeholders have agreed that a modification of a feature of the President's New Freedom Initiative, a demonstration program known as ``Money Follows the Person'' should be enacted along with the FOA. Money Follows the Person allows the Secretary to provide grants to states to increase the use of home and community based care and provides States a financial incentive for the first year to do so.  I want stakeholders in the disability community as well as the many organizations who support the Family Opportunity Act to understand that the legislation I am introducing today compliments rather than supplants my efforts to enact FOA and Money Follows the Person. I believe that we should provide a wide array of options to the states to encourage them to identify and eliminate barriers to community living including access to consumer direction and respite care.  Long-term care services can be prohibitively expensive. Just one year in a nursing home can cost well over $50,000. In many cases, individuals deplete their savings and resources paying for long-term and ultimately qualify for Medicaid coverage. Right now, Medicaid pays for the bulk of long-term care services in this country. In 2002 alone, we spent nearly $93 billion on long-term care services under Medicaid. With our aging population, one thing is clear: spending will only increase.  When most people think about purchasing long-term care insurance, they think, ``that's something I can put off until tomorrow.'' We need to change the perception because the older you are when you first buy coverage, the more expensive the premiums are.  Our legislation calls for the Secretary to educate folks about the protection that long-term care insurance can offer. We envision people having the opportunity to compare policies available in their States. Among other means, this could be accomplishedthrough an internet website for example.  Making people aware of long-term care insurance won't go very far though, unless we make some other changes to enhance the value and protection that long-term care insurance can bring. Our bill takes several steps in this regard.  First, the legislation would require that States disregard benefits paid under a long-term care insurance policy when determining eligibility for Medicaid. Second, it incorporates a series of consumer protections recommended by the National Association of Insurance Commissioner, NAIC, into the definition of `qualified long-term care services.' Individuals who purchase a policy that have these consumer protections will be eligible for an above the line tax deduction and a tax credit for out-of-pocket expenses made by caregivers. Third, the bill would expand the long-term care partnership program, which currently operates as a demonstration in four states. The long-term care partnerships combine private long-term care insurance with Medicaid coverage once individuals exhaust their insurance benefits. Several States would like to pursue their own long-term care partnerships and this legislation will enable them to do that.  The Improving Long-term Care Choices Act also builds on the President's New Freedom Initiative by taking further steps toward removing the ``institutional bias'' in Medicaid, giving States the option of providing home- and community-based services as part of their State Medicaid Plan.  In doing so, the bill gives States the flexibility to design long-term care benefits that will reduce the reliance on costly institutional settings and meet the needs of elderly and disabled individuals who overwhelmingly wish to remain in their homes and communities.  In his New Freedom Initiative announced shortly after taking office, President George W. Bush outlined a plan to tear down barriers preventing people with disabilities from fully participating in American society.  The President also endorses the idea of shifting Medicaid's delivery system towards one that promotes cost-effective, community-based care instead of one weighted so heavily towards institutional settings.  This legislation also challenges us to think beyond funding and program silos and directs the Secretary to address administrative barriers that impede the integration of acute and long-term care services. The Secretary also must develop recommendations for statutory changes that will make it easier for States to offer better coordinated acute and long-term care services.  The Improving Long-Term Care Choices Act is consistent with our ideals about families, individual choices in health care and financial responsibility. This bill aims high. But it is sorely evident that we need to think creatively and comprehensively, even boldly, if we hope to make the type of inroads in promoting the availability of good long-term care insurance policies and in rebalancing the institutional bias in long-term care services that no longer reflects the needs and preferences of many stakeholders.  The Improving Long-Term Care Choices Act is a good bill. The American Network of Community Options and Resources, the Arc & United Cerebral Palsy Disability Policy Collaboration, and the National Disability Rights Network, the United Spinal Association, and the Association of University Centers on Disabilities support the bill. I urge my colleagues to do the same.  I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section summary of the legislation and letters of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             Improving Long-Term Care Choices Act--Summary         TITLE I: LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS     Subtitle A       Section 101: State Medicaid Plan requirements regarding            Medicaid eligibility determination, long-term care            insurance reciprocity, and consumer education       Requires each state in its Medicaid plan to exclude      benefits, including assigned benefits, paid under a      qualified-long term care policy in determining income for      purposes of determining eligibility for medical assistance.       Requires that states with a long-term care insurance      partnership program to meet requirements for reciprocity to      with other long-term care insurance partnership states.      Reciprocity rules to be developed as specified in section      103.       Requires the Secretary to educate consumers on the      advisability of obtaining long-term care insurance that meets      federal standards and the potential interaction between      coverage under a policy and federal and state health      insurance programs.       Section 102: Additional consumer protections for long-term            care insurance       Establishes additional consumer protections with respect to      long-term care insurance policies based on the October 2000      National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) model      regulations including non-cancellability, prohibitions on      limitations and exclusions, extension of benefits,      continuation of conversion coverage, discontinuance and      replacement, prohibitions on post-claim underwriting,      inflation protection, and prohibitions on pre-existing      condition and probationary periods in replacement policies or      certificates.       Issuers of long-term care insurance policies must also      comply with NAIC model provisions related to disclosure of      rating practices, application forms and replacement coverage,      reporting, filing requirements for marketing, suitability,      standard format outline of coverage, and delivery of      shopper's guide.       Issuers must comply with model act policies related to      right to return, outline of coverage, certificates under      group plans, monthly reports on accelerated death benefits,      and incontestability period.       Applies to policies issued more than 1 year after      enactment.       Section 103: Expansion of State Long-term Care Partnerships       Permits the expansion of long-term care partnership      insurance policies to all states.       Requires all new partnership policies to be ``qualified      long-term care insurance policies'' defined as a policy that:      (1) disregards any assets or resources in the amount equal      payments made under the policy; (2) requires the holder, upon      the policy's effective date, to reside in the state or a      state with a qualified long-term care partnership; (3)      includes the consumer protections specified in 7702B of the      tax code as amended by Section 102 (additional consumer      protections); (4) requires compound inflation protection; and      (5) requires that any agent selling such policies receive      training and demonstrate knowledge of such policies,       Medicaid asset protection would apply in an equal amount to      the insurance benefit paid under the policy, referred to as a      dollar-for-dollar model. [The four states (NY, IN, CT, and      CA) that currently offer long-tenn care partnership policies      that are not dollar-for-dollar may continue to offer those      policies.]       Directs the Secretary to set standards for reciprocity in      conjunction with states, insurers, NAIC, and other groups as      deemed necessary by the Secretary not later than 12 months      after enactment to provide for the portability of long-term      care partnership policies from one partnership state to      another partnership state.       Establishes minimum uniform reporting requirements.       Section 104: National Clearinghouse for Long-term Care            Information       Provides for: (1) development of a national clearinghouse      on long-term care information to educate consumers on the      importance of purchasing long-term care insurance, and, where      appropriate, to assist consumers in comparing long-term care      insurance policies offered in their states, including      information on benefits, pricing (including historic      increases in premiums) as well as other options for financing      long-term care and (2) establishment of a website to      facilitate comparison of long-term care policies.       Authorizes such sums a necessary for the clearinghouse in      fiscal year 2006 and each year thereafter.     Subtitle B       Section 121: Treatment of premiums on qualified long-term            care insurance contracts       Provides individuals an above-the-line tax deduction for      the cost of their qualified LTC insurance policy (as defined      by HIPAA, section 7702B(b)). Phases in applicable percentage      of the deduction based on the number of years of continuous      coverage under a qualified LTC policy.       Section 122: Credit for taxpayers with long-term care needs       Provides applicable individuals with LTC needs or their      eligible caregivers a $3000 tax credit to help cover LTC      expenses. An applicable individual is one who has been      certified by a physician as needing help with at least 3      activities of daily living, such as eating, bathing,      dressing. LTC tax credit would be phased-in over 4 years as      follows: $1000 in 2005, $1500 in 2006, $2000 in 2007, $2500      in 2008, and $3000 in 2009 or thereafter. The credit phases      out by $100 for each $1000 (or fraction thereof) by which the      taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income exceeds the      threshold amount set at $150,000 for a joint return and      $75,000 for an individual return.       Section 123: Treatment of exchanges of long-term care            insurance contracts       Includes a waiver of limitations, allowing individuals to      make claims if there are changes to law. TITLE II: MEDICAID HOME AND COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICES OPTIONAL BENEFIT       Section 201: Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services            Optional Benefit       Provides states with a new option to offer home and      community-based services to Medicaid-eligible individuals      without obtaining a federal waiver. Under this option states      may include one or more home and community-based services      currently available under existing waiver authority. States      would also be permitted to allow individuals to choose to      self-direct services. Under this option, states must      establish a more stringent eligibility standard for placement      of individuals in institutions, than for placement in a home      and community-based setting. States would be permitted to      offer a limited benefit consisting of home and community-     based services only, to certain populations not otherwise      eligible for Medicaid, but not to exceed individuals whose      income exceeds 300% of SSI income and resource standards. At      states option, provides presumptive eligibility for aged,      blind and disabled for home and community-based services. If      enrollment under the state plan exceeds state projections,      the state would be permitted to change eligibility standards      to limit enrollment for new applicants, while grandfathering      those individuals already receiving services.  TITLE III: INTEGRATED ACUTE AND LONG-TERM CARE SERVICES FOR DUALLY                           ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS       Section 301: Removal of barriers to integrated acute and            long-term care services for dually eligible individuals       Directs the Secretary, in collaboration with directors of      State Medicaid programs, health care issuers, managed care      plans, and others to issue regulations removing      administrative barriers that impede the offering of      integrated acute, home and community-based, nursing facility,      and mental health services, and to the extent consistent with      the enrollee's coverage for such services under Part D,      prescription drugs. The Secretary also must submit      recommendations to address legislative barriers to offering      integrated services. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission      (MedPAC) will comment on the Secretary's recommendations.                                  ____                                     American Network of Community                                        Options and Resources,                                    Alexandria, VA, July 29, 2005.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Hon. Evan Bayh,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Grassley and Bayh: On behalf of the American      Network of Community Options and Resources (ANCOR)--the      national association representing more than 850 private      providers of supports and services to more than 380,000      people with significant disabilities--we extend our      appreciation and offer our support in the introduction today      of your ``Improving Long-Term Care Choices Act of 2005.''       It is especially noteworthy that you introduced this bill      on the eve of Medicaid's 40th anniversary. Medicaid has      worked for millions of people with disabilities, improving      their lives over the past four decades. However, Medicaid can      and should do better on behalf of the 8 million individuals      with disabilities that depend daily upon this program for      their health services and long-term supports. This is a      propitious moment to send a message to the nation--people      with disabilities can count on Medicaid. It makes clear to      all that Congress intends to maintain its commitment for a      strong federal role in enhancing the lives of people with      disabilities.       People with disabilities, their families, and providers      have for years called for the removal of Medicaid's      institutional bias. ANCOR provided testimony in. September of      2001 in conjunction with the President's New Freedom      Initiative that the Congress must change the structure of      Medicaid to include state plan home and community-based      services. Your bill builds upon the President's initiative,      the Supreme Court's Olmstead decision, and ANCOR's commitment      to community integration.       In addition to helping millions of people of all ages who      depend upon Medicaid for long-term supports, your legislation      will assist millions of moderate-income Americans to address      their future long-term needs. By encouraging reliable long-     term care insurance and tax incentives to defray costs for      long-term needs, your bill begins the important process to      adopt a national comprehensive long-term care policy. This      step is critical as the nation stands on the precipice of the      fast approaching ``sleeping giant''--the retirement of the      baby boom generation and shift in demographics. In this way,      the bill will help reduce the financial pressures on Medicaid      and our nation's reliance on it as the only public long-term      care program.       ANCOR is pleased and proud to offer its support to you on      this momentous day and to pledge our help in making the      ``Improving Long-Term Care Choices Act of 2005'' a reality      this session. We are grateful for your leadership and ongoing      commitment to people with disabilities and those who provide      them with daily supports.           Sincerely,                                             Suellen R. Galbraith,     Director for Government Relations.                                  ____                              Disability Policy Collaboration,                                    Washington, DC, July 29, 2005.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Hon. Evan Bayh,     U.S. Senate.       Dear Chairman Grassley and Senator Bayh: The Arc of the      United States and United Cerebral Palsy strongly support your      introduction of the Improving Long-Term Care Choices Act. The      Arc is the national organization of and for people with      mental retardation and related developmental disabilities and      their families. United Cerebral Palsy is a nationwide network      of organizations providing advocacy and direct services to      people with disabilities and their families.       The creation of a Medicaid home and community-based      services optional benefit is an important improvement in the      federal/state Medicaid program and one for which we have      advocated for many years. We believe that the addition of      this benefit as an option for states will make it easier for      states to serve people with severe disabilities where they      want to be served--in their own home communities, rather than      in institutions or other facilities. This will increase      opportunities for improved quality of life for many children      and adults with severe disabilities and their families.       We applaud your efforts and are grateful for your      leadership in introducing this important legislation and      pledge to work with you to secure its passage and enactment.           Sincerely,                                                Paul Marchand,                                                   Staff Director,     Disability Policy Collaboration.                                  ____                                               National Disability                                               Rights Network,                                    Washington, DC, July 29, 2005.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: The National Disability Rights      Network (NDRN) is the nonprofit membership organization for      the federally mandated Protection and Advocacy (P&A) Systems      and the Client Assistance Programs (CAP) for individuals with      disabilities. Through training and technical assistance,      legal support, and legislative advocacy, NDRN works to create      a society in which children and adults with all types of      disabilities are afforded equality of opportunity and are      able to fully participate by exercising choice and self-     determination.       NDRN strongly supports your introduction of the Improving      Long Term Care Choices Act of 2005. One of the major goals of      the P&A/CAP network is for all individuals with disabilities      to live in their own communities--independently, with their      families, or with other individuals of their choice. Your      determination in bringing forward this bill--with the      critical component of establishing home and community-based      services and supports as a optional Medicaid benefit, instead      of only available through a waiver--is a major step in the      right direction.       NDRN and the entire P&A/CAP network look forward to the day      when community-based supports and services for children and      adults with disabilities are the norm and institutional      services are non-existent or require a waiver.       We believe that this bill also is very important because it      will shine a light on the need for a true long-term care      system in our nation. While long-term care insurance is not      the answer for everyone, it can be useful--if affordable and      if it covers people for a long enough span of time; The      availability of long-term care insurance also could help to      take the pressure off of the Medicaid program.       Thank you again for your continuing recognition of the      needs of children and adults with disabilities and their      families. The disability community looks upon you as one of      its leading advocates in the U.S. Congress. NDRN is pleased      to offer any help it can in moving the Long-Term Care Choices      Act through this session of Congress. Please contact Dr.      Kathleen McGinley, 202-408-9514, [email protected]           Sincerely,                                               Lynn Breedlove,                                                        President,     NDRN Board of Directors.                                  ____                                    United Spinal Association,                                    Washington, DC, July 29, 2005.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Hon. Evan Bayh,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Grassley and Bayh: United Spinal Association,      a national disability advocacy organization dedicated to      enhancing the quality of life for individuals with spinal      cord injury or spinal cord disease by assuring quality health      care, promoting research, and advocating for civil rights and      independence, thanks you for introducing the Improving Long      Term Care Choices Act of 2005. United Spinal applauds your      leadership in bringing forward such an important measure,      which will assist thousands of Americans with disabilities      become more fully integrated and participating members of      their communities.       The Improving Long Term Care Choices Act would help states      rebalance their long term supports systems away from an      institutional bias by giving states the flexibility to     offer community services and supports as a state plan option      under Medicaid. The proposal would also encourage individuals      to purchase private long-term care insurance, which could      help elevate some of the financial pressures off of state      Medicaid programs. In addition, this bill will help states in      their efforts to comply with the Supreme Court Olmstead      decision.       People with disabilities should be able to live and work in      their communities, not segregated in large and costly      institutions. This system reform is long overdue. Thank you      again for your vision, courage and ongoing leadership to      create public policy that promotes independence, productivity      and integration of people with disabilities in their      communities. United Spinal would like to offer any assistance      you need in moving the Improving Long Term Care Choices Act      through this session of Congress. Please contact me at (202)      331-1002 for assistance.

Hon. Charles Grassley,     Hon. Evan Bayh,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Grassley and Bayh: On behalf of the      Association of University Centers on Disabilities (AUCD), a      national network that provides education, training and      service in developmental disabilities, we want to thank you      for introducing the Improving Long Term Care Choices Act of      2005. The Association of University Centers on Disabilities      (AUCD) applauds your leadership in bringing forward such an      important measure, which will assist thousands of Americans      with disabilities to be more fully integrated and      participating members of their communities.

It will also help states in their efforts to comply with the      Supreme Court Olmstead decision.       People with disabilities should be able to live and work in      the community with or close to family and friends, not      segregated in large and costly institutions. This system      reform is long overdue.       Thank you again for your vision, courage and ongoing      leadership to create public policy that promotes      independence, productivity and integration of people with      disabilities in their communities. AUCD would like to offer      any assistance you need in moving the Improving Long Term      Care Choices Act through this session of Congress.
