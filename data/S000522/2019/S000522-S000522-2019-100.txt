Amendment No. 406 Offered by Mr. Young of Alaska       At the end of subtitle G of title X, insert the following:     SEC. 10__. PLAN TO INCREASE AND EXPAND COLD WEATHER TRAINING.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The strategic importance of the Arctic continues to      increase as the United States and other countries recognize      the military and economic importance of the region. However,      the operational capabilities of the United States Armed      Forces in extreme cold weather or Arctic environments have      atrophied when compared to regional adversaries.       (2) The 2018 national defense strategy stated ``The central      challenge to U.S. prosperity and security is the reemergence      of long-term, strategic competition by what the National      Security Strategy classifies as revisionist powers.''       (3) The Government of the Russian Federation-       (A) has made significant military investments in the      Arctic, including the creation of an Arctic Command, the      Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command;       (B) has emplaced an Air Defense Missile Regiment throughout      the Arctic;       (C) has invested in the construction or refurbishment of 16      deepwater ports and 14 airfields in the region and has      conducted significant military exercises.       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that      the Arctic is a region of strategic importance to the      national security interests of the United States and the      Department of the Army must increase and expand its cold      weather training capabilities to ensure that United States      Armed Forces can operate in Arctic conditions necessary to      compete against a near peer adversary and to execute the      national defense strategy of the United States.       (c) Assessment Required.--The Secretary of the Army shall--       (1) conduct an assessment of cold weather training      requirements in light of increased operations and      vulnerability to great power competition in the Arctic; and       (2) develop a plan to increase and expand cold weather      training opportunities.       (d) Elements.--In conducting the assessment and developing      the plan as required under subsection (c), the Secretary      shall--       (1) assess all existing cold weather training requirements      to include requirements for extreme cold, or Arctic      conditions;       (2) identify capability gaps in confronting adversaries in      the Arctic that can be addressed by increased and improved      training;       (3) make recommendations for strengthening and improving      those training requirements and mitigation measures needed to      address the capabilities gaps necessary to confront      adversaries;       (4) assess existing cold weather training sites;       (5) consider steps necessary to increase student capacity      at such sites;       (6) consider manpower and supply requirements, including      cadre needed to support increased student capacity; and       (7) address any other matters the Secretary of the Army      considers relevant.       (e) Submittal to Congress.--Not later than 180 days after      the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the      Army shall submit to the Committees on Armed Services of the      Senate and the House of Representatives the plan required by      subsection (c).            Amendment No. 407 Offered by Mr. Young of Alaska       At the end of subtitle E of title XII, add the following:     SEC. _. CHINESE FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT IN COUNTRIES OF THE                    ARCTIC REGION.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:       (1) China is projecting a physical presence in the Arctic      through upgrading to advanced icebreakers, utilizing the      Arctic Ocean more regularly through subsidizing arctic      shipping, deploying unmanned ice stations, and engaging in      large and sophisticated data collection efforts in countries      of the Arctic region, including Iceland, Greenland, and      Canada.       (2) The 2017 Center for Naval Analysis (CNA) report      ``Unconstrained Foreign Direct Investment: An Emerging      Challenge to Arctic Security'' concluded that China has been      actively engaged in economies of countries of the Arctic      region.       (3) The CNA report documented a pattern of strategic      investment by China in the economies of countries of the      Arctic region, including the United States, Canada,      Greenland, Iceland, Norway, and Russia, in areas such as raw      land, oil and gas, minerals, and infrastructure.       (4) Chinese investments in countries of the Arctic region      are significant. For instance, Chinese foreign direct      investment constituted nearly 12 percent of Greenland's gross      domestic product for the period from 2012 to 2017.       (5) China's 2018 Arctic Policy White Paper documented the      Chinese intent to create a ``Polar Silk Road'' in the Arctic.       (6) China's ``Polar Silk Road'' is an extension of China's      Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).       (7) China is increasingly using the BRI as the impetus for      increasing People's Liberation Army deployments to regions      where China has significant investments, primarily through      BRI.       (8) China has demonstrated an interest in using BRI to gain      military access to strategic regions.       (9) Understanding how China's foreign direct investment in      countries of the Arctic region affects such countries is      critical to understanding the degree to which China is able      to access the region.       (b) Independent Study.--       (1) In general.--Not later than 45 days after the date of      enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall seek to      enter into a contract with a federally-funded research and      development center described in paragraph (2) to complete an      independent study of Chinese foreign direct investment in      countries of the Arctic region, with a focus on the effects      of such foreign direct investment on United States national      security and near-peer competition in the Arctic region.       (2) Federally-funded research and development center      described.--A federally-funded research and development      center described in this paragraph is a federally-funded      research and development center that--       (A) has access to relevant data and demonstrated data-sets      regarding foreign direct investment in the Arctic region; and       (B) has access to policy experts throughout the United      States and the Arctic region.       (c) Elements.--The study required by subsection (b) shall      include the following:       (1) Projects in the Arctic that are directly or indirectly      funded by public and private Chinese entities, to--       (A) build public infrastructure;       (B) finance of infrastructure;       (C) lease mineral and oil and gas leases;       (D) purchase real estate;       (E) extract or process, including smelting, minerals and      oil and gas;       (F) engage in shipping or to own and operate or construct      shipping infrastructure, including ship construction;       (G) lay undersea cables; and       (H) manufacture, own or operate telecommunications      capabilities and infrastructure.       (2) An analysis the legal environment in which Chinese      foreign direct investment are occurring in the United States,      Russia, Canada, Greenland, Norway, and Iceland. The analysis      should include--       (A) an assessment of the efficacy of mechanisms for      screening foreign direct investment in the United States,      Russia, Canada, Greenland, Norway, and Iceland;       (B) an assessment of the degree to which there is      transparency in Chinese foreign direct investment in      countries of the Arctic region;       (C) an assessment of the criteria used to assess potential      Chinese foreign direct investment in countries of the Arctic      region;       (D) an assessment of the efficacy of methods for monitoring      approved Chinese foreign direct investment in countries of      the Arctic region; and       (E) an assessment of public reporting of the decision to      approve such Chinese foreign direct investment.       (3) A comparison of Chinese foreign direct investment in      countries of the Arctic region to other countries with major      investments in such countries, including India, Japan, South      Korea, the Netherlands, and France.       (4) An assessment of the environmental impact of past      Chinese investments in oil and gas, mineral, and      infrastructure projects in the Arctic region, including the      degree to which Chinese investors are required to comply with      local environmental laws and post bonds to assure remediation      if a project becomes bankrupt.       (5) A review of the 2018 Chinese Arctic Policy and other      relevant public and nonpublic Chinese policy documents to      determine the following:       (A) China's strategic objectives in the Arctic region from      a military, economic, territorial, and political perspective.       (B) China's goals in the Arctic region with respect to its      relations with the United States and Russia, including the      degree to which activities of China in the region are an      extension of China's strategic competition with the United      States.       (C) Whether any active or planned infrastructure      investments are likely to result in a regular presence of      Chinese military vessels or the establishment of military      bases in the Arctic region.       (D) The extent to which Chinese research activities in the      Arctic region are a front for economic activities, including      illegal economic espionage, intelligence gathering, and      support for future Chinese military activities in the region.       (E) The degree to which Arctic littoral states are      susceptible to the political and economic risks of      unregulated foreign direct investment.

Amendment No. 420 Offered by Mr. Rose of New York       At the end of division A, add the following: TITLE XVII--SANCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO FOREIGN TRAFFICKERS OF ILLICIT                            SYNTHETIC OPIOIDS     SEC. 1701. SHORT TITLE.       This title may be cited as the ``Fentanyl Sanctions Act''.     SEC. 1702. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate      that from September 2017 through September 2018 more than      48,200 people in the United States died from an opioid      overdose, with synthetic opioids (excluding methadone),      contributing to a record 31,900 overdose deaths. While drug      overdose death estimates from methadone, semi-synthetic      opioids, and heroin have decreased in recent months, overdose      deaths from synthetic opioids have continued to increase.       (2) Congress and the President have taken a number of      actions to combat the demand for illicit opioids in the      United States, including enacting into law the SUPPORT for      Patients and Communities Act (Public Law 115-271; 132 Stat.      3894). While new statutes and regulations have reduced the      rate of opioid prescriptions in recent years, fully      addressing the United States opioid crisis will involve      dramatically restricting the foreign supply of illicit      opioids.       (3) The People's Republic of China is the world's largest      producer of illicit fentanyl, fentanyl analogues, and their      immediate precursors. From the People's Republic of China,      those substances are shipped primarily through express      consignment carriers or international mail directly to the      United States, or, alternatively, shipped directly to      transnational criminal organizations in Mexico, Canada, and      the Caribbean.       (4) The United States and the People's Republic of China,      Mexico, and Canada have made important strides in combating      the illicit flow of opioids through bilateral efforts of      their respective law enforcement agencies.       (5) The objective of preventing the proliferation of      illicit opioids though existing multilateral and bilateral      initiatives requires additional efforts to deny illicit      actors the financial means to sustain their markets and      distribution networks.       (6) The implementation on May 1, 2019, of the regulations      of the People's Republic of China to schedule all fentanyl      analogues as controlled substances is a major step in      combating global opioid trafficking and represents a major      achievement in United States-China law enforcement dialogues.      However, that step will effectively fulfill the commitment      that President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China      made to President Donald Trump at the Group of Twenty meeting      in December 2018 only if the Government of the People's      Republic of China devotes sufficient resources to full      implementation and strict enforcement of the new regulations.      The effective enforcement of the new regulations should      result in diminished trafficking of illicit fentanyl      originating from the People's Republic of China into the      United States.       (7) While the Department of the Treasury used the Foreign      Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (21 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.) to      sanction the first synthetic opioid trafficking entity in      April 2018, additional economic and financial sanctions      policy tools are needed to help combat the flow of synthetic      opioids into the United States.

SHORT TITLE.       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Otto Warmbier North      Korea Nuclear Sanctions Act of 2019''.     SEC. 1093. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds the following:       (1) On June 1, 2016, the Department of the Treasury's      Financial Crimes Enforcement Network announced a Notice of      Finding that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a      jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern due to its      use of state-controlled financial institutions and front      companies to support the proliferation and development of      weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missiles.       (2) The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has expressed      serious concerns with the threat posed by North Korea's      proliferation and financing of WMD, and has called on FATF      members to apply effective counter-measures to protect their      financial sectors from North Korean money laundering, WMD      proliferation financing, and the financing of terrorism.       (3) In its February 2017 report, the U.N. Panel of Experts      concluded that--       (A) North Korea continued to access the international      financial system in support of illicit activities despite      sanctions imposed by U.N. Security Council Resolutions 2270      (2016) and 2321 (2016);       (B) during the reporting period, no member state had      reported taking actions to freeze North Korean assets; and       (C) sanctions evasion by North Korea, combined with      inadequate compliance by member states, had significantly      negated the impact of U.N. Security Council resolutions.       (4) In its September 2017 report, the U.N. Panel of Experts      found that--       (A) North Korea continued to violate financial sanctions by      using agents acting abroad on the country's behalf;       (B) foreign financial institutions provided correspondent      banking services to North Korean persons and front companies      for illicit purposes;       (C) foreign companies violated sanctions by maintaining      links with North Korean financial institutions; and       (D) North Korea generated at least $270 million during the      reporting period through the violation of sectoral sanctions.       (5) North Korean entities engage in significant financial      transactions through foreign bank accounts that are      maintained by non-North Korean nationals, thereby masking      account users' identity in order to access financial      services.       (6) North Korea's sixth nuclear test on September 3, 2017,      demonstrated an estimated explosive power more than 100 times      greater than that generated by its first nuclear test in      2006.       (7) On February 23, 2018 the Department of the Treasury      announced its largest-ever set of North Korea-related      sanctions, with a particular focus on shipping and trading      companies, and issued a maritime advisory to highlight North      Korea's sanctions evasion tactics. On May 9, 2019, the United      States seized a North Korean ship, the Wise Honest, which had      previously been detained by Indonesia for carrying coal in      violation of United Nations sanctions.       (8) According to the March 2019 Final Report of the U.N.      Panel of Experts, ``The nuclear and ballistic missile      programmes of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea      remain intact and the country continues to defy Security      Council resolutions through a massive increase in illegal      ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum products and coal. These      violations render the latest United Nations sanctions      ineffective by flouting the caps on the import of petroleum      products and crude oil by the Democratic People's Republic of      Korea as well as the coal ban, imposed in 2017 by the      Security Council in response to the country's unprecedented      nuclear and ballistic missile testing.''.       (9) The U.N. Panel of Experts further concluded:      ``Financial sanctions remain some of the most poorly      implemented and actively evaded measures of the sanctions      regime. Individuals empowered to act as extensions of      financial institutions of the Democratic People's Republic of      Korea operate in at least five countries with seeming      impunity.''.       (10) North Korea has successfully tested short-range,      submarine-launched, and intercontinental ballistic missiles,      and is rapidly progressing in its development of a nuclear-     armed missile that is capable of reaching United States      territory.

(2) Civil penalty.--A person who violates, attempts to      violate, conspires to violate, or causes a violation of      regulations prescribed under this subsection shall be subject      to a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed the greater      of--       (A) $250,000; or       (B) an amount that is twice the amount of the transaction      that is the basis of the violation with respect to which the      penalty is imposed.
