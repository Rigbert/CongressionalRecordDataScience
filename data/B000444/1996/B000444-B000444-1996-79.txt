 President, I am not going to speak to the merits of the legislation. I see my friend from Iowa is in the Chamber. I was going to remain silent on this, but because of the constant partisan references to the President not caring about it, I just want the Record to show one thing. This administration since it came into office has asked for $801 million for this very purpose, and my good friend from Iowa knows the Republican Congress gave him $540 million.  Now, I find it fascinating the Senator from Iowa stands up and berates the administration for its lack of interest, and the Senator from Kansas stands up and says there is no reason we should give this much money because it is better used other places. There is some merit to her argument, but the irony, I just want the Record to show, is that fiscal year 1994 is the only year the President asked for less than the Congress gave him. He asked for 148; he got 170. In 1995, he asked for 227; the Congress gave him 105. In 1996, he asked for 213; the Congress gave him 115. And in 1997, he asked for 213, and the Congress up to now has given him, the proposal is 160, and now our friend from Georgia is getting in line with the President of the United States and getting their act together in asking what the President asked for.  So, I cannot let it go. I am trying not to respond to everything that occurs here. But the fact is, $801 million asked by the President for this function; $540 million thus far granted by the Congress. If this succeeds, and I will support them to raise it up to the President's level of $213 million, from $160 million, that $540 million will move up in the commensurate amount. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.
