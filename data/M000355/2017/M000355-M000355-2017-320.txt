 President, yesterday the Senate continued its efforts to confirm the President's talented nominees to staff the Federal Government.  We advanced the nomination of David Zatezalo to serve as the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health, an important position to the thousands of miners in States like Kentucky. I look forward to confirming his nomination early this afternoon, along with that of Mark Esper, who will be confirmed to another important position, Secretary of the Army.  Also, we will turn to Joseph Otting, President Trump's nominee to serve as Comptroller of the Currency. This position is crucial to protecting our national banking system, and Mr. Otting has the experience necessary to excel there.
