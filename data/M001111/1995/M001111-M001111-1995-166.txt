I say that any Senator who went to someone who was worried about breast cancer and said the sense of the Senate was going to do one thing to move forward the rule on mammography would simply not be telling the truth.  Of course, the Senator is correct. We cannot tell anybody who cared about this issue that the Dole substitute does a thing to help move the mammography rule along.
