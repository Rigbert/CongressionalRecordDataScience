Speaker, last weekend when I was home in Oregon I noted that gasoline prices have reached the highest level in history, and I know that my State was not alone. We apparently have the fourth highest prices in the United States. Other States are even higher, and I assume that records were set everywhere.  That might be well and good if it was all due to free market forces and the underlying cost of doing business, but I fear it is not.  We have been through this before. During the first Persian Gulf War, Desert Storm, we saw a huge run-up in oil and diesel prices and aviation fuel which caused a tremendous amount of dislocation in the economy, but the economy was nowhere near as fragile as it is today. Then we found out a little bit later that the oil companies had taken advantage of the war, war profiteering. They had, in fact, raised their prices far in excess of the underlying costs of crude and any other additional costs they might have incurred because of the war in Iraq.  Now here we are a decade later. Again, it appears that the United States will soon be at war in Iraq, and we are seeing record prices at the pump, and again, they are talking about the underlying price of crude and the instability of demand, but the increases at the pump and the increases for the aviation industry and the increases for the truckers far, far, far exceed the increases in the underlying costs of crude, and plus, many of these oil companies are selling themselves their own crude oil or they have hedged the price or they have special deals with the OPEC cartel.  No, plain and simple, they have begun war profiteering this time before the war has started. It is time for Congress to take action.  The economy is weak. Three hundred and eight thousand people lost their job last month. A number of airlines are teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, and a number of them say that if a war happens and fuel goes up any more, costs them $180 million per penny, they will not be in Chapter 11 reorganization bankruptcy; they will be insolvent and out of business, costing tens of thousands more jobs and more harm to the economy, all so a few multinational oil companies can squeeze excess profits out of American airlines and families and truckers.  The President needs to take action. He could release fuel from the National Petroleum Reserve, the oil reserve, but he has chosen not to do that. So I have introduced a bill to give him more specific direction to give him authority once held by President Richard Nixon to stabilize the price of fuel with a fair rate of return to these oil companies and making them justify a run-up in price beyond a price that has prevailed a year ago today, and secondly, to have the President draw down the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in order to help drive down prices, mitigate supply, require the oil companies now and in the future to maintain minimum inventory levels so they cannot cry wolf and jack up the price every year when they switch from home heating oil to gasoline and all those things they love to do and then they have a refinery fire, nothing anyone could ever expect.  Ban the export of Alaska oil. We are going to hear arguments we should allow drilling in ANWR, but guess what, all the Alaska oil can and probably will be exported because this Congress, against my will, lifted the ban on the export of Alaska oil.  Finally, this administration is all for free trade. OPEC is not free trade. That cartel, those people, Saudis and others, are conspiring to drive up the price of oil, setting the price of oil in violation of all the agreements of the World Trade Organization. I am not a big fan of that organization, but this administration, who loves it and wants to expand its authority, should use the authority it has to object to that price fixing. It violates all of the tenets of GATT and the World Trade Organization.                              {time}  1800  So it is time for strong action here in Congress and at the White House to stop the war profiteering, the price gouging, driving more Americans out of work, bankrupting the airlines, idling trucks and the commerce of this country, all so a few multinational oil companies can run record profits for the next couple of quarters.  Choice seems pretty easy to me. We will see what my colleagues and the President think.                          ____________________
