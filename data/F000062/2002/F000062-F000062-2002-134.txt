 I will read that letter into the Record.  The letter says:       Dear Attorney General Ashcroft: I am writing to ask that      you institute a criminal investigation to determine whether      federal fraud statutes or any other laws were violated by      Enron and other energy companies engaged in energy trading      and delivery of natural gas and electricity to the Western      Energy Market in 2000 and 2001.       In January, during a hearing before the Energy Commission I      asked Patrick Wood, Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory      Commission (FERC), to investigate whether Enron manipulated      prices in the Western Energy Market. The enclosed documents      released by FERC indicate that Enron was not only      manipulating prices in the West, but also engaged in a number      of calculated strategies such as ``Death Star,'' ``Fat Boy,''      and ``Get Shorty'' to either receive payment for energy not      delivered or increase price. In my book, this is outright      fraud.       Since Arthur Andersen (the entire company) has been      indicted by the Justice Department for shredding documents,      it seems to me that Enron is at least as culpable, if not      more so, for creating certain schemes to perpetuate acts of      fraud on consumers under the guise of corporate strategies.       Because UBS Warbug has purchased Enron's trading entity, I      am particularly concerned that the same manipulative trading      strategies may continue to be in place today. I ask that you      launch a thorough investigation into this matter which may      well involve other energy companies that delivered energy      into the Western Energy Market in 2000 and 2001 and continue      to do so today.       Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.  In the last 2 years I have listened to my colleagues, to FERC, and to energy companies tell me that the California energy crisis was caused by inherent problems in California.  I have never disagreed that California's flawed energy deregulation laws helped precipitate an energy crisis. But I have also always believed that energy companies took advantage of California and the rest of the West to manipulate the market and to drive up prices. There is simply no other way that energy costing $30 a megawatt hour at one time, a few days later could cost $350 a megawatt hour.  On March 7, one of my colleagues in this esteemed House said the following on the Senate floor to justify opposition to our futures derivatives amendment:       I have seen no evidence--in fact I will point out that      Chairman Greenspan has seen no evidence--that derivatives by      Enron, or by anybody else, had anything to do with the energy      spikes in prices in California.  So I would ask my esteemed colleague to read these documents which are today on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's Web site and tell us if he can still say that.  These documents, released yesterday, are nothing short of astonishing. They discuss strategies with popular names such as Death Star and Get Shorty to describe in detail how energy prices can be manipulated. And then there is a document, by a law firm, Brobeck, which attempts to justify the strategies.  I am not shocked to learn that this had occurred. I have been saying this for a long time now. But the arrogance of documenting such illicit and underhanded behavior, and using popular titles for it, I think speaks for itself.  Make no mistake about it, this is a smoking gun.  I ask unanimous consent these memoranda be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                        Brobeck, Attorneys at Law.  As part of our preparation for the various investigations and litigation actually and potentially facing EPMI in connection with the California energy market, Jean Frizzell, Barrett Reasoner, Mike Kirby and Gary Fergus spent several full days over the past few months at EPMI for the purpose of learning and understanding more about the data, methodology, the various strategies used by the traders and the implementation of those strategies. This is a highly complicated subject matter and all of us are still learning.  We used as our starting point the Preliminary Memorandum dated December 8, 2000, which we understand was prepared as the first step in educating you and outside counsel about EMPI trading practices. The Preliminary Memorandum was written by Steve Hall, an associate on loan from the Stoel Rives law firm, and co-authored by Christian Yoder, the in-house counsel at EMPI. Over the course of the past month, we have spent a fair amount of time with a number of traders. In some instances, we met the same traders more than once to try and understand the various practices. On January 11th, we spent another full day with Tim Belden, chief trader for EMPI in Portland going over the strategies that have been identified. Here is our summary of the status of our further investigation and present analysis of the EMPI trading practices:                                Overview       The California energy market during calendar year 2000 was      an incredibly complex and dynamic environment. Weather,      supply shortages, physical limits and market volatility      contributed to this environment. During the past month, we      have had several outside law firm lawyers, each with varying      degrees of experience with California electricity market,      work together with the EPMI traders to understand the market      and the practices. From time to time, the understanding of      and interpretation by the lawyers interviewing the same      traders about the market and the trading practices were      inconsistent. When that happened, we would go back to the      traders to try and gain a common understanding of the      particular market and trading strategy. At this point in the      process, we realize that there are very few clearly defined      trading strategies. Depending upon the particular      circumstances of the day, trading strategies were modified      and applied in response to EPMI's portfolio, market      conditions, the individual trader's understanding of them,      and the individual trader's preference within a large overall      framework. In part, this is because trading is done 7 days a      week for many different schedules (e.g. PX day ahead, PX day      of, ISO hour ahead, ISO real time etc.       EPMI is only one of the many market participants. We do not      have nearly enough information to gain a good understanding      of all of the impacts other participants, and whatever their      strategies might have been, had on the market. For these      reasons, you should consider this a work in progress, rather      than the definitive analysis of EPMI trading practices. We      may learn that some of the conclusions we have reached will      later turn out to be inaccurate. In fact, we learned during      this process that some of other information contained in the      Preliminary Memorandum, which resulted in some erroneous      assumptions and conclusions, cannot be supported by the facts      and evidence which are now known. In other instances, some      statements in the Preliminary Memorandum understandably mixed      trading strategies and schedules. In order to minimize the      risk of confusing matters further, we have taken the      additional step of having Tim Belden review this memorandum      to see if we have accurately described the trading practices      and to see whether he can spot any flaws in our analysis. We      tried to follow the same format of the Preliminary Memorandum      for easy cross reference.               ``Incing'' Load into the Real Time Market       ``Incing'' was a slang name (short for ``increasing'') for      a trading strategy used in response to the independently      owned utilities (IOU) well known and documented strategy of      significantly underestimating their load in the PX day ahead      market. This practice by the utilities apparently occurred      almost daily. Because the IOU's purchased their power through      the PX day ahead market, the PX thus became their scheduling      coordinator; the ISO's resulting schedules understated the      load for the next day. The IOU practice of underestimating      load artificially lowered the PX day ahead market clearing      price. Incing served to partially counteract the reliability      issues caused by this practice and, from the California      consumer's perspective, appears to have been preferable to      the alternative of selling outside of California. In      addition, incing may have increased the actual guaranteed      available supply of power in the California market depending      upon the shape of the demand curve. Incing reduced demand in      the ISO market, therefore reduced the ex post price and      potentially lowered the overall cost to California consumers.      When incing, EPMI was a price taker in the ISO ex post      market.                               Death Star       Death Star was a slang name for a strategy that addressed      congestion between northern and southern California. During      certain periods, there are transmission limits between      northern California and southern California on path 15 and      path 26. It appears that the source of the congestion may      have been the consistent underestimating of load by PG      same underestimating referred to above. Because the demand      was artificially lower in Northern California, it appears      supply was trying to move to southern California. By using a      combination of ISO approved scheduled counterflows and      alternative non-ISO transmission lines, EPMI increased the      transfer capability between the regions, reduced congestion,      and utilized underused pathways to increase the overall      supply of electricity in southern California. By virtue of      using multiple transmission paths, EPMI took on financial      risks, including having the transmission line derated,      assessment of additional congestion charges, and liability      for take or pay transmission charges on alternative      transmission lines to execute the strategy.       Contrary to certain statements in the Preliminary      Memorandum, congestion was relieved and energy did flow      through otherwise underutilized paths.                               Land Shift       Load shift is a general term used to describe a variety of      scheduling practices and trading strategies in the day ahead      and hour ahead markets. One variation of load shifting      involved scheduling ISO approved counterflows in the ISO day      ahead market, ISO hour ahead market or both. Generally      speaking, as an alternative to purchasing power in the north.      EPMI purchased power in the south and counterflowed that      power to the north. Such transactions had the effect of      providing congestion relief in the ISO day ahead market or      the ISO hour ahead markets. These transactions placed EPMI at      financial risk for the differences in price between the      regions.       Another category of load shifting involves shifting the      load on paths for which EPMI purchased firm transmission      rights. This category was briefly discussed in the      Preliminary Memorandum. We have learned more about his load      shifting strategy since the Preliminary Memoranda was      written. As the result of several in depth interviews with      the traders and review of the public market surveillance      reports available in the public and all market participants,      if is apparent that the assumptions and conclusions contained      in the Preliminary Memorandum were inaccurate. First, in      hindsight, it now appears likely that the load shifting      strategy, without knowing the impact of other market factors,      sometimes may have reduced the prices in the north while      leaving prices in the south unchanged or minimally impacted.      Second, it appears that the estimate of profits from this      load shifting strategy in the Preliminary Memorandum was     vastly overstated and indeed confused. It would appear that      the source of the confusion may have been that the      Preliminary Memorandum reported the total profit attributable      of the EPMI firm transmission rights on path 26, as reflected      in ISO public documents, as opposed to any calculation of the      profit of this particular strategy.                               Get Shorty       ``Get Shorty'' was the slang name for a trading strategy      involving the provision of ancillary services in the PX day      ahead and ISO hour ahead markets. EPMI committed to providing      the ancillary services in the PX day ahead market and covered      its position by purchasing those services in the ISO hour      ahead market. Accordingly, EPMI actually purchased the      services necessary to provide ancillary services if called      upon to do so. In fact, the ISO regularly called upon EPMI      for ancillary services that were provided. Based upon the      information we have so far, there was only one incident      where EPMI failed to cover its position. In that single      instance, EPMI promptly offered to, and ultimately did,      return the payment received for the ancillary services      that were not provided. Accordingly, the strategy did not      impact the reliability of the grid. This strategy,      however, did place EPMI at financial risk. On a number of      occasions, It appears the cost to cover exceeded the      amount received in the day ahead market and EPMI provided      services to the ISO at a loss.       The Preliminary Memorandum incorrectly assumed that the      information provided to the ISO was inaccurate. It now      appears that, consistent with daily ISO practices, that EPMI      did not specify the source of the ancillary services at the      time of sale.                                ricochet       ``Ricochet'' was the slang term for a trading strategy that      existed because EPMI was not permitted to make adjustment      bids in SC to SC (scheduling coordinator) trades due to      limitations in the ISO software systems. Ricochet served the      dual purpose of allowing for adjustment bids and opening up      market options for EPMI including the supplemental and      bilateral markets. By using this strategy, EPMI was at      financial risk if the PX price exceeded either the      supplemental or bilateral market price. Furthermore, the ISO      software limitation forced EPMI to incur additional costs,      export charges, ancillary services on exports and line losses      on imports.       Ricochet appears not to have been a strategy that was used      to a significant extent when compared to EPMI's overall      portfolio. It appears that other market participants with      control areas adjacent to California and access to extremely      flexible generation resources may have relied more      extensively on this strategy.       At the present time, EPMI faces its own software      limitations in implementing ISO approved adjustment bids in      SC to SC transactions.                            non-firm export       This was a trading practice that involved scheduling      counterflows three hours ahead of the time energy would flow.      The schedule counterflow had the likely effect of reducing      the congestion charge on the scheduled path. Under this      strategy, EPMI qualified for the congestion relief payment      two hours before the scheduled flow. Ultimately, EPMI did not      flow the power. Based upon the information we have, this      practice does not appear to have had any demonstrable impact      on either the PX price or the ISO ex post price. However, in      August 2000, the ISO directed that the practice be      discontinued. The EPMI traders with whom we spoke confirmed      that EPMI has complied with that mandate.                 selling non firm energy as firm energy       This was a trading strategy that was occasionally used in      southern California to allow for the import of power that      would otherwise not be available. The net effect of this      practice, in conjunction with other market factors, was to      increase the overall supply with no apparent impact on PX      price. EPMI was subjected to financial risk in that if the      non-firm power was cut, EPMI would have to cover the energy      cut by purchasing that power in the ISO market at the ex post      price.       At this time, it appears that the net result of this      practice was to bring additional supply into California.         scheduling energy to collect the congestion charge ii       The net effect of this strategy was to schedule counterflow      thereby reducing congestion in hour ahead market. This was a      high risk strategy because EPMI was exposed to the ex post      market price that could exceed the congestion price. This      strategy could have potentially lowered the congestion charge      depending upon a wide variety of other market factors.                                  ____                                              Stoel Rives LLP,                                                 December 8, 2000.     To: Richard Sanders     From: Christian Yoder and Stephen Hall     Re: Traders' Strategies in the California Wholesale Power          Markets/ ISO Sanctions     Confidential: Attorney/Client Privilege/Attorney Work Product       This memorandum analyzes certain trading strategies that      Enron's traders are using in the California wholesale energy      markets. Section A explains two popular strategies used by      the traders, ``inc-ing'' load and relieving congestion.      Section B describes and analyzes other strategies used by      Enron's trades, some of which are variations on ``inc-ing''      load or relieving congestion. Section C discusses the      sanction provisions of the California independent System      Operator (``ISO'') tariff.                           A. The Big Picture     1. ``Inc-ing'' load into the real time market       One of the most fundamental strategies used by the traders      is referred to as ```inc-ing' loan into the real time      market.'' According to one trader, this is the `oldest trick      in the book' and, according to several of the traders, it is      now being used by other market participants.       To understand this strategy, it is important to understand      a little about the ISO's real-time market. One responsibility      of the ISO is to balance generation (supply) and loads      (demand) on the California transmission system. During its      real-time energy balancing functions the ISO pays/charges      market participants for increasing/decreasing their      generation. The ISO pays/charges market participants under      the schemes: ``instructed deviations'' and uninstructed      deviations.'' Instructed deviations occur when the ISO      selects supplemental energy bids from generators offering to      supply energy to the market in real time in response to ISO      instructions Market participants that increase their      generation in response to instructions (``instructed      deviation'') from the ISO are paid the ``inc'' price. Market      participants that increase their generation without an      instruction from the ISO (an ``uninsured deviation'') and      paid the ex post ``dec'' price. In real-time, the ISO      issues instructions and publishes ex post prices at ten-     minute intervals.       ``Inc-ing load' into the real market'' is a strategy that      enables Enron to send excess generation to the imbalance      energy market as an uninstructed deviation. To participate in      the imbalance energy market it is necessary to have at least      1 MV of load. The reason for this is that a generation cannot      schedule energy onto the grid without having a corresponding      load. The ISO requires scheduling coordinators to submit      balanced schedules, i.e., generation must equal load. So, if      load must equal generation, how can Enron end up with excess      generation in the real-time market?       The answer is to artificially increase (``inc'') the load      on the schedule submitted to the ISO. Then, in real-time,      Enron sends the generation it scheduled, but does not take as      much load as scheduled. The ISO's meters record that Enron      did not draw as much load, leaving it with an excess amount      of generation. The ISO gives Enron credit for the excess      generation and pays Enron the dec price multiplied by the      number of excess megawatts. An example will demonstrate this.      Enron will submit day-ahead schedule showing 1000 MW of      generation scheduled for delivery to Enron Energy Services      (``EES''). The ISO receives the schedule, which says ``1000      MW of generation'' and ``1000 MW of load. The ISO sees that      the schedule balances and, assuming there is no congestion,      schedules transmission for this transaction. In real-time,      Enron sends 1000 MW of generation, but Enron Energy Services      only draws 500 MW. The ISO's meters show that Enron made a      net contribution to the grid of 500 MW, and so the ISO pays      Enron 500 times the dec price.       The traders are able to anticipate when the dec price will      be favorable by comparing the ISO's forecasts with their own.      When the traders believe that the ISO's forecast      underestimates the expected load, they will inc load the real      time market because they know that the market will be short,      causing a favorable movement in real-time ex post prices. Of      course, the much-criticized strategy of California's      investor-owned utilities (``IOUs'') of underscheduling load      in the day-ahead market has contributed to the real-time      market being short. The traders have learned to build such      underscheduling into their models, as well.       Two other points bear mentioning. Although Enron may have      been the first to use this strategy, other have picked up on      it, too. I am told this can be shown by looking at the ISO's      real-time metering, which shows that an excess amount of      generation, over and above Enron's contribution, is making to      the imbalance market as an uninstructed deviation. Second,      Enron has performed this service for certain other customers      for which it acts as scheduling coordinator. The customers      using this service are companies such as Powerex and Puget      Sound Energy (``PSE''), that have generation to sell, but not      native California load. Because Enron has native California      load through EES, it is able to submit a schedule      incorporating the generation of a generator like Powerex or      PSE and balance the schedule with ``dummied-up'' load from      EES.       Interestingly, this strategy appears to benefit the      reliability of the ISO's grid. It is well known the      California ISOs have systemically underscheduled their load      in the PXs's Day- Ahead market. By underscheduling their load      into the Day-Ahead market, the IOUs have caused the ISO to      have a call on energy in real time in order to keep the      transmission system in balance. In other words, the      transmission grid is short energy. By deliberately      overscheduling load, Enron has been offsetting the ISO's      real time energy deficit by supplying extra energy that      the ISO needs. Also, it should be noted that in the ex      post market Enron is a ``price taker,'' meaning that they      are not submitting bids or offers, but are just being paid      the value of the energy that the ISO needs. If the ISO did      not need the energy, the dec price would quickly drop to      $0. So, the fact that Enron was getting paid for this      energy shows that the ISO needed the energy to balance the     transmission system and offset the IOU's underscheduling      (if those parties own Firm Transmission Rights (``FTR'')      over the path).     2. Relieving Congestion       The second strategy used by Enron's traders is to relieve      system-wide congestion in the real-time market, which      congestion was created by Enron's traders in the PX's Day      Ahead Market. In order to relieve transmission congestion      (i.e., the energy scheduled for delivery exceeds the capacity      of the transmission path), the ISO makes payments to parties      that either schedule transmission in the opposite direction      (``counterflow payments'') or that simply reduce their      generation/load schedule.       Many of the strategies used by the traders involve      structuring trades so that Enron gets paid the congestion      charge. Because the congestion charges have been as high as      $750/MW, it can often be profitable to sell power at a loss      simply to be able to collect the congestion payment.                  B. Representative Trading Strategies       The strategies listed below are examples of actual      strategies used by the traders, many of which utilize the two      basic principles described above. In some cases, the      strategies are identified by the nicknames that the traders      have assigned to them. In some cases, i.e., ``Fat Boy,''      Enron's traders have used these nicknames with traders from      other companies to identify these strategies.     1. Export of California Power       a. As a result of the price caps in the PX and ISO      (currently $250), Enron has been able to take advantage of      arbitrate opportunities by buying energy at the PX for export      outside California. For example, yesterday (December 5,      2000), prices at Mid-C peaked at $1200, while California was      capped at $250. Thus, traders could buy power at $250 and      sell it for $1200.       b. This strategy appears not to present any problems, other      than a public relations risk arising from the fact that such      exports may have contributed to California's declaration of a      Stage 2 Emergency yesterday.     2. ``Non-firm Export''       a. The goal is to get paid for sending energy in the      opposite direction as the constrained path (counterflow      congestion payment). Under the ISO's tariff, scheduling      coordinators that schedule energy in the opposite direction      of the congestion on a constrained path get paid the      congestion charges, which are charged to scheduling      coordinators scheduling energy in the direction of the      constraint. At times, the value of the congestion payments      can be greater than the value of the energy itself.       b. This strategy is accomplished by scheduling non-firm      energy for delivery from SP-15 or NP-15 to a control area      outside California. This energy must be scheduled three hours      before delivery. After two hours, Enron gets paid the      counterflow charges. A trader then cuts the non-firm power.      Once the non-firm power is cut, the congestion resumes.       c. The ISO posted notice in early August prohibiting this      practice. Enron's traders stopped this practice immediately      following the ISO's posting.       d. The ISO objected to the fact that the generators were      cutting the non-firm energy. The ISO would not object to this      transaction if the energy was eventually exported.       Apparently, the ISO has heavily documented Enron's use of      this strategy. Therefore, this strategy is the more likely      than most to receive attention from the ISO.     2. ``Death Star''       a. This strategy earns money by scheduling transmission in      the opposite direction of congestion; i.e., schedule      transmission north in the summertime and south in the winter,      and then collecting the congestion payments. No energy,      however, is actually put onto the grid or taken off.       b. For example, Enron would first import non-firm energy at      Lake Mead for export to the California-Oregon border      (``COB''). Because the energy is traveling in the opposite      direction of a constrained line, Enron gets paid for the      counterflow. Enron also avoids paying ancillary service      charges for this export because the energy is non-firm, and      the ISO tariff does not require the purchase of ancillary      services for non-firm energy.       c. Second, Enron buys transmission from COB to Lake Mead at      tariff rates to serve the import. The transmission line from      COB to Lake Mead is outside of the ISO's control area, so the      ISO is unaware that the same energy being exported from Lake      Mead is simultaneously being imported into Lake Mead.      Similarly, because the COB to Lake Mead line is outside the      ISO's control area, Enron is not subject to payment of      congestion charges because transmission charges for the COB      to Lake Mead line are assessed based on imbedded costs.       d. The ISO probably cannot readily detect this practice      because the ISO only sees what is happening inside its      control area, so it only sees half of the picture.       e. The net effect of these transactions is that Enron gets      paid for moving energy to relieve congestion without actually      moving any energy or relieving any congestion.     3. ``Load Shift''       a. This strategy is applied to the Day-Ahead and the real-     time markets.       b. Enron shifts load from a congested zone to a less      congested zone, thereby earning payments for reducing      congestion, i.e., not using our FTRs on a constrained path.       c. This strategy requires that Enron have FTRs connecting      the two zones.       d. A trader will overschedule load in one zone, i.e., SP-     15, and underschedule load in another zone, i.e., NP-15.       Such scheduling will often raise the congestion price in      the zone where load was overscheduled.       The trader will then ``shift'' the overscheduled ``load''      to the other zone, and get paid for the unused FTRs. The ISO      pays the congestion change (if there is one) to market      participants that do not use their FTRs. The effect of this      action is to create the appearance of congestion through the      deliberate overstatement of loads, which causes the ISO to      charge congestion charges to supply scheduled for delivery in      the congested zone. Then, by reverting back to its true load      in the respective zones, Enron is deemed to have relieved      congestion, and gets paid by the ISO for so doing.       e. One concern here is that by knowingly increasing the      congestion costs, Enron is effectively increasing the costs      to all market participants in the real time market.       f. Following this strategy has produced profits of      approximately $30 million for FY 2000.     4. ``Get Shorty''       a. Under this strategy, Enron sells ancillary services in      the Day-ahead market.       b. Then the next day, in the real-time market, a trader      ``zeroes out'' the ancillary services, i.e., cancels the      commitment and buys ancillary services in the real-time      market to cover its position.       c. The profit is made by shorting the ancillary services,      i.e., sell high and buy back at a lower price.       d. One concern here is that the traders are applying this      strategy without having the ancillary services on standby.      The traders are careful, however, to be sure to buy services      right at 9:00 a.m. so that Enron is not actually called upon      to provide ancillary services. However, once, by accident, a      trader inadvertently failed to cover, and the ISO called on      those ancillary services.       e. This strategy might be characterized as ``paper      trading,'' because the seller does not actually have the      ancillary services to sell. FERC recently denied Morgan      Stanley's request to paper trade on the New York ISO.       The ISO tariff does provide for situations where a      scheduling coordinator sells ancillary services in the day      ahead market, and then reduce them in the day-of-market.      Under these circumstances, the tariff simply requires that      the scheduling coordinator replace the capacity in the hour-     ahead market. ISO Tariff, SBP 5.3, Buy Back of Ancillary      Services.       f. The ISO tariff requires that schedules and bids for      ancillary services identify the specific generating unit or      system unit, or in the case of external imports, the selling      entity. As a consequence, in order to short the ancillary      services it is necessary to submit false information that      purports to identify the source of the ancillary services.     5. ``Wheel Out''       a. This strategy is used when the interties are set to      zero, i.e., completely constrained.       b. First, knowing that the intertie is completely      constrained, Enron schedules a transmission flow through the      system. By so doing, Enron earns the congestion charge.      Second, because the line's capacity is set to ``0,'' the      traders know that any power scheduled to go through the      inter-tie will, in fact be cut. Therefore, Enron earns the      congestion counterflow payment without having to actually      send energy through the intertie.       c. As a rule, the traders have learned that money can be      made through congestion charges when a transmission line is      out of service because the ISO will never schedule an energy      delivery because the intertie is constrained.     6. ``Fat Boy''       a. This strategy is described above in section A(1).     7. ``Ricochet''       a. Enron buys energy from the PX in the Day Of market, and      schedules it for export. The energy is sent out of California      to another party, which charges a small fee per MW, and then      Enron buys it back to sell the energy to the ISO real-time      market.       b. The effect of this strategy on market prices and supply      is complex. First, it is clear that Enron's intent under this      strategy is solely to arbitrage the spread between the PX and      the ISO, and not to serve load or meet contractual      obligations. Second, Ricochet may increase the Market      Clearing Price by increasing the demand for energy.      (Increasing the MCP does not directly benefit Enron because      it is buying energy from the PX, but it certainly affects      other buyers, who must pay the same, higher price.) Third,      Ricochet appears to have a neutral effect on supply, because      it is returning the exported energy as an import. Fourth, the      parties that pay Enron for supplying energy to the real time      ex post market are the parties that underscheduled, or      underestimated their load, i.e., the IOUs.     8. Selling Non-firm Energy as Firm Energy       a. The traders commonly sell non-firm energy to the PX as      ``firm.'' ``Firm energy,'' in this context, means that the      energy includes ancillary services. The result is that the      ISO pays EPMI for ancillary services that Enron claims it is      providing, but does not in fact provide.       b. The traders claim that ``everybody does this,''      especially for imports from the Pacific Northwest in to      California.       c. At least one complaint was filed with the ISO regarding      Enron's practice of doing this. Apparently, Arizona Public      Service sold non-energy to Enron, which turned around and      sold the energy to the ISO as firm. APS cut the energy flow,      and then called the ISO and told the ISO what enron had done.     9. Scheduling Energy To Collect the Congestion Charge II       a. In order to collect the congestion charges, the traders      may schedule a counterflow even if they do not have any      excess generation. In real time, the ISO will see that Enron      did deliver the energy it promised, so it will charge Enron      the inc price for each MW Enron was short. The ISO, however,      still pays Enron the congestion charge. Obviously a loophole,      which the ISO could close by simply failing to pay congestion      charges to entities that failed to deliver the energy.       b. This strategy is profitable whenever the congestion      charge is sufficiently greater than the price cap. In other      words, since the ex post is capped at $250, whenever the      congestion charge is greater than $250 it is profitable to      schedule counterflows, collect the congestion charge, pay the      ex post, and keep the difference.                             c. iso tariff       The ISO tariff prohibits ``gaming,'' which it defines as      follows:       ``Gaming,'' or taking unfair advantage of the rules and      procedures set forth in the PX or ISO Tariffs, Protocols or      Activity Rules, or of transmission constraints in period in      which exist substantial Congestion, to the detriment of the      efficiency of, and of consumers in, the ISO Markets.      ``Gaming'' may also include taking undue advantage of other      conditions that may affect the availability of transmission      and generation capacity, such as loop flow, facility outages,      level of hydropower output or seasonal limits on energy      imports from out-of-state, or actions or behaviors that may      otherwise render the system and the ISO Markets vulnerable to      price manipulation to the detriment of their efficiency.''      ISO Market Monitoring and Information Protocol (``MMIP''),      Section 2.1.3.       The ISO Tariff also prohibits ``anomalous market      behavior,'' which includes ``unusual trades or      transactions''; ``pricing and bidding patterns that are      inconsistent with prevailing supply and demand conditions'';      and ``unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports      from or exports to other markets or exchanges.'' MMIP,      Section 2.1.1 et seq.       Should it discover such activities, the ISO tariff provides      that the ISO may take the following action:       1. Publicize such activities or behavior and its      recommendations thereof, ``in whatever medium it believes      most appropriate.'' MMIP, Section 2.3.2 (emphasis added).       2. The Market Surveillance Unit may recommend actions,      including fines and suspensions, against specific entities in      order to deter such activities or behavior. MMIP, Section      2.3.2.       3. With respect to allegations of gaming, the ISO may order      ADR procedures to determine if a particular practice is      better characterized as improper gaming or ``legitimate      aggressive competition.'' MMIP, Section 2.3.3.       4. In cases of ``serious abuse requiring expeditious      investigation or action'' the Market Surveillance Unit shall      refer a matter to the appropriate regulatory or antitrust      enforcement agency. MMIP, Section 3.3.4.       5. Any Market Participant or interested entity may file a      complaint with the Market Surveillance Unit. Following such      complaint, the Market Surveillance Unit may ``carry out any      investigation that it considers appropriate as to the concern      raised.'' MMIP, Section 3.3.5.       6. The ISO Governing Board may impose ``such sanctions or      penalties as it believes necessary and as are permitted under      the ISO Tariff and related protocols approved by FERC; or it      may refer the matter to such regulatory or antitrust agency      as it sees fit to recommend the imposition of sanctions and      penalties.'' MMIP, Section 7.3.
