If I could have a few minutes to respond and then turn the floor over to him for as much time as he would need--I thank the Senator from Oregon.  First, a history lesson. Sometimes facts are tenuous, difficult, sticky things you can't get rid of. Let's look at the facts. When William Jefferson Clinton left the Presidency, America's budget was in surplus. For the first time in 30 years, we were generating more revenue than we were spending. We were adding life and longevity to the Social Security system, to Medicare, and many others. We did this with a prosperous, booming economy, one of the most prosperous we had seen in modern history. We created new jobs, new businesses, new home opportunities. When William Jefferson Clinton left office, we had a national debt of $5 trillion.  In came the Republicans, billing themselves as fiscal conservatives.
