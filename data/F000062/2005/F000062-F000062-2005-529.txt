 President, I rise today in honor of Women's History Month to recognize the advancements that women have made this year and to reflect on the challenges and opportunities for the years ahead.  We have set aside this month to formally pay tribute to the contributions of women in the United States and around the world.  I would like to start by paying tribute to the women in Iraq and Afghanistan who are working to build their countries and to make a better life for themselves and their families. These women have been freed from oppressive regimes and as their nations rebuild now must secure their rights for all time.  Women throughout the Arab World are making their way into public life.In some countries, they are being elected to office, named to cabinet-level posts and appointed to leading positions in powerful civil society organizations--these are the thought-leaders and the pioneers. But there is another, parallel movement that has also begun: the quiet leadership of ordinary women who are doing extraordinary things.  On January 30, scores of Iraqi women poured into polling stations in cities and rural communities. Braving bullets, bombs, and substantial personal threat, they joined their fellow countrymen to vote in the nation's first free election, an act that warrants our deepest respect.  When I reflect on their courage, I realize that in the United States we have no point of reference to understand what they must have felt on that Monday in January. Though the women in our Nation have fought and continue to fight for justice and equal opportunity, the trip from our homes to the voting booth has never involved a life or death decision. The fact that 8 million people, 60 percent of whom were women according to some estimates, chose to risk their lives to vote is, quite frankly, astounding to me.  These women have grasped at democracy and they now clench it with tightened fists. I think we can learn something from this. I would like to call attention to their sacrifices and to highlight the lessons that their courage can teach women in the United States and around the world.  It is easy to take for granted today, but women in America also had to fight for the right to vote. After a decades' long struggle, women finally secured the right to vote in 1920 and since that time women have made incredible advancements.  Women have risen to the top of Fortune 500 companies and fill the domes of capitols and the halls of universities--today approximately 56 percent of college students are female, compared to 44 percent in 1973. The wage gap, however, is still alarming. Women who work full-time earned about 79.5 cents on the dollar compared to their male counterparts in 2003.  Women are a true political force and continue to contribute every day all across this country. In the years that I have been in politics, women have changed the face of American politics.  Issues that were once relegated to the back burner--education, health care, children, and seniors--are now at the top of America's political agenda.  Since I was first elected to the Senate in 1992, we have made remarkable progress for women by:  Increasing breast cancer research funding by 800 percent;  Tripling funding for domestic abuse shelters;  Raising lending to women through the Small Business Administration;  Passing the Family and Medical Leave Act and the Violence against Women Act;  Covering mammogram screening for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries;  Extending maternity hospitalization to 48 hours; and  Requiring health care companies to fund breast reconstruction after mastectomies.  We have come a long way, but we still have a long way to go.  That is why I am cosponsoring the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution. This amendment is essential to guarantee that the rights and freedoms granted by our Founding Fathers apply equally to men and women.  In addition, women's reproductive rights are under attack in Congress like never before, and I remain deeply committed to protecting a woman's right to choose guaranteed by Roe v. Wade. I also believe that it is extremely important that we reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and abortions.  I have spoken on this issue before and it is something that I feel very strongly about. Recently, we have seen considerable setbacks in the battle for reproductive rights and I fear that the advances we have fought so hard for are now threatened.  I am part of a generation of women who remember a time when a woman did not have the right to decide when and if she would give birth. I will not stand by and let us return to that time.  The decline of our rights under this administration has been slow but steady. Subtle encroachments occur either through the high-profile path of judicial appointments or through the silent passageways of regulations, obscure amendments tacked on to large bills, or grant limitations.  The current administration has systematically chipped away at the rights of women, and they have done so shielded from public scrutiny by employing these quiet forms of repression and intimidation. I am here to say: we have noticed, we are paying attention and we will fight.  These are issues that affect every woman in the United States. Let us not become complacent. Let us take inspiration from the women in Iraq who risked their lives to exercise their rights as we continue the struggle to defend our own. The time for basking in the glory of past achievements has passed; this is a battle that must be fought by the everyday women warriors. It is time to roll up our sleeves and get back to work.  Because of the women who have come before us, we are fortunate to participate in our democratic system of justice. We cannot take that opportunity and responsibility for granted.                          ____________________[Pages S2981-S2982]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                   IN HONOR OF WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH
