President, if there is no further business to come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consentthat it stand adjourned under the provisions of S. Res. 390 as further mark of respect for the late Kay Hagan, former Senator from the State of North Carolina.  There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:38 p.m., adjourned until Thursday, October 31, 2019, at 10 a.m.                          ____________________
