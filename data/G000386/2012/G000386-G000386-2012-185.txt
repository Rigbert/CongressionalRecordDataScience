 President, today the Senate is considering the nomination of Cathy Ann Bencivengo to be U.S. district judge for the Southern District of California. I support this nomination which will fill the vacancy that has been created by Judge Jeffrey Miller taking senior status. I would also note that this vacancy has been designated as a judicial emergency.  After today, the Senate will have confirmed 126 nominees to our article III courts. I would note that even as we continue to reduce judicial vacancies, the majority of vacancies have no nominee. In fact, 46 of 86 vacancies have no nomination. Furthermore, 18 of the 33 seats designated judicial emergencies have no nominee. So when I hear comments about ``unprecedented'' vacancy rates, I would ask my colleagues and the other interested parties to look first to the White House.
