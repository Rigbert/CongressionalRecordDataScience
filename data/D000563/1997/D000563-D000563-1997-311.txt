President, I will use just 2 or 3 minutes and defer to my colleague. I want to say I am glad he is with me today. It is one of our first bills as new Members of the U.S. Senate and one that is very important, not only to our States but also to the Nation. I think it is extremely fitting that Senator Hagel and 14 of our colleagues have joined me in introducing a bipartisan bill to provide tax relief for a group of hard-working Americans, namely the self-employed. What we are trying to do with this bill, and I think it is appropriate to discuss it on April 15, is to say that people who are self-employed, small business people, farmers and the like, should enjoy the same tax benefits of deduction for health insurance premiums as corporations. This is only simple fairness.  If I work for a big company, they can literally write off every penny of the cost of my health insurance that they pay. However, if I happen to be a farmer in central Illinois, or a self-employed woman in Chicago working at home at a computer, and I go to buy health insurance, only 40 percent of the premiums could be deducted. That is unfair and it creates a real disadvantage. We should encourage people to take out health insurance. The best way to encourage them to do it is to make it more affordable by providing full deductibility. In my State of Illinois there are over 400,000 people who are self-employed who would benefit from this tax relief. In fact, over 3 million Americans who are self-employed do not have health insurance. That represents 25 percent of the self-employed. That is a high percentage compared to other groups.  So, what Senator Hagel and I are trying to do with our legislation is to level the playing field, give them all equal treatment and fair treatment. I think this tax relief could be worth $500 or $1,000 for somebody today who could deduct only 40 percent, but in the future could deduct 100 percent under our legislation.  I thank my colleague for joining me in introducing this bill. It is supported not only by the National Federation of Independent Businesses, the National Farm Bureau, the Pork Producers, the Corn Growers and the Farmers Union, but also by the National Association of Women Business Owners. Between 1987 and 1996 the number of women-owned businesses increased by 78 percent, and about 80 percent of these are individual proprietorships.  I think this is an issue whose time has come. I have spoken to many of my colleagues and they believe that is the case, too. I hope we can work as part of any budget agreement to include this provision.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 575       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Health Insurance Tax Equity      for Self-Employed Act''.     SEC. 2. DEDUCTION FOR HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS OF SELF-EMPLOYED                    INDIVIDUALS INCREASED.       (a) In General.--Section 162(l)(1) of the Internal Revenue      Code of 1986 (relating to special rules for health insurance      costs of self-employed individuals) is amended to read as      follows:       ``(1) Allowance of deduction.--In the case of an individual      who is an employee within the meaning of section 401(c)(1),      there shall be allowed as a deduction under this section     an amount equal to the amount paid during the taxable year      for insurance which constitutes medical care for the      taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, and dependents.''.       (c) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section      applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1996.
