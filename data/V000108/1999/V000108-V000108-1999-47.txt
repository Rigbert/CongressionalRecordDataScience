Chairman, I would indicate that the amendment before the body is offered by myself, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar), and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Borski), and it goes to correct the one deficiency in the bill relative to the Clean Water Act, relative to preserving wetlands in the United States of America, and relative to the veto issue by the administration relative to the language.  It relates to two provisions in the bill, jurisdiction as far as wetlands and the Army's Corps of Engineers, and a program called Permit 26.  I have talked about the importance of wetlands in my earlier remarks. I have talked about the generic situation we find ourselves in. I would like to use the time allotted to me to talk about the potential arguments raised against the amendment, and why I think the amendment ought to be adopted.  As far as the jurisdictional arguments, I do believe that they would, as the bill is currently constituted, lead to more litigation. Several speakers before us on the floor today talked about the delay involved as far as the implementation of the new procedures as far as the appeal, the new permitting process.  There would be much further delay if the language continues to stand. There would be additional burden on the Corps, and again, we would see an increase in litigation.  As far as Permit 26, some might argue that Permit 26 works. It facilitates the process. To some minor extent, they would be correct. The problem is as far as the overarching policy we are concerned about here, that is, the preservation of our wetlands. I would note again that we are losing 70,000 to 90,000 acres a year. Permit 26 is part of the problem. I would not presuppose that it is all of the problem, but it is part of the problem, and it ought to be fixed for that reason, and for the reason that it is not in compliance with the Clean Water Act.  Some would say that this is going to increase the workload for the Army's Corps of Engineers. Earlier when the acreage was reduced in Permit 26, this same argument was raised: We are going to increase delays, we are going to increase the process, and burden two property owners.  The fact is, that turned out not to be true. There were 55,000, approximately, general permits issued in 1996 before the acreage was reduced. In 1998, general permits issued to facilitate the process did increase to 64,000. But on the other hand, the individual permits, which do take more time, were reduced from 5,028 in 1996 to 4,931.  Will there be some increase as far as the burden to the Corps? Quite possibly, but it is manageable, and the Corps is ready to assume that responsibility. Is there going to be increased cost to those who own property, who develop property? Only if they deal with wetlands.  As far as the time delay, I would point out that, again, before Permit 26 was changed in 1996, the average evaluation time for individual permits was 88 days. In 1998, it was reduced to 87 days, and it is my understanding for the individual development of a property that the delay, if you would, or the time involved before construction is started is anywhere from 6 months to a year. These are not consecutive sequences, they are concurrent.  Does the Corps listen to anybody? Has the Corps simply run roughshod over the process? That is another issue that has been raised. I think, again, it is incorrect. There have been over 10,000 comments issued in three different public comment periods. In some cases the Corps has made fundamental changes and agreed with the developmental community.  The developmental community wanted time limits for the Corps to respond regarding a completed application, and as far as the proposed Permit 26, the Corps said, you are absolutely right, it should be included.                              {time}  1800  Inversely, as far as the environmental community is concerned, they asked at one time that there be a complete prohibition in critical waters in 100-year floodplains. They asked for a complete revocation of permit 26 with no replacement, clearly an additional burden to the developmental community and the Corps said absolutely not.That is going too far in the other direction.  In the earlier debate, there was talk about the delay involved. This is a very precise, very complicated issue. The Corps is trying to do it correctly and have been about that task in both instances since 1996.              Perfecting Amendment Offered By Mr. Boehlert
