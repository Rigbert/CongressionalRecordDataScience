Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, the Taxpayer First Act is a bipartisan bill in both the House and in the Senate. This bill will improve the Internal Revenue Service and help taxpayers. This is a good and necessary bill.  Again, I would like to thank the ranking member, Mr. Brady, andthank Mr. Kelly in his absence, Chairman Neal, and our staff for all of their hard and good work on this important bill.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the Taxpayer First Act, and I yield back the balance of my time.
