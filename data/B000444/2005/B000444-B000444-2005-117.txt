 That is why I appreciate his support for the Byrd amendment as well. That is the only place we could pick up a piece of Amtrak.  I see my friend from New York. There are a million people in Penn Station today--more people, as I said--sitting at rush hour in an aluminum tube underneath New York City than a half dozen full 747s, and we are doing nothing about it.  I thank the Senator from Maryland. He has done a great job. And I thank Senator Shelby. I hope we can move it.
