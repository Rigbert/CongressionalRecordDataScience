According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, States have cumulatively cut over $1.8 billion from their mental health services between 2009 and 2011. This is the largest reduction in State mental health services in half a century.  With 1 in 17 people in America living with a serious neurological condition, how is this tremendous decrease in funding possible or humane?  Often, those who suffer the most are angels of destiny. According to a report from the Federal Bureau of Justice statistics, more than half of our country's prison population suffers or has suffered from mental disorders, but only a fraction of that population receives treatment during their incarceration. And, in fact, individuals with mental illness are far more likely to be victims of crime than the perpetrators.  Newtown is a national tragedy, Madam Speaker, but it reveals again our shared responsibility to support and treat those in this country who need our help so desperately. I urge our colleagues to support a more constructive Federal role in assuring proper and early diagnosis and intervention of affected youth and appropriate treatment.  I congratulate President Obama and Vice President Biden for their leadership in moving our Nation to a better day for us all. So many of us here in Congress wish to join them in this great national challenge.                          ____________________
