President.  Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Texas and my colleague from Maryland for their extraordinary leadership in shining the spotlight on a very dark, dark part of the Earth.  We, the women of the Senate, represent different States, different ideologies, and are from different backgrounds, but we are united in our determination to expose the horrendous treatment of the women and children of Afghanistan. We are determined to help them in every way possible.  It was our colleague from Louisiana, Mary Landrieu, who first brought to my attention an excellent CNN documentary called ``Women Behind the Veil,'' which demonstrated the appalling treatment by the Taliban of the women of Afghanistan. Women are not allowed to be educated.  That, to me, says it all because by denying women an education, you are denying them knowledge, awareness, and opportunity.  I am happy to join with the Senator from Texas, my colleague, Mrs. Hutchison, and the Senator from Maryland, my colleague, Ms. Mikulski, in this excellent initiative. I hope all of our colleagues will join in supporting this legislation.  Thank you, Mr. President.
