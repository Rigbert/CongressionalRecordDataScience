President, today, the Senate will conclude debate on the Cybersecurity Act of 2012, S. 3414. Developing a comprehensive strategy for cybersecurity is one of the most pressing challenges facing our Nation. I commend President Obama for his commitment to addressing this national security issue. I also commend the majority leader and the bill's sponsors for their work on this pressing matter.  I share the President's view that updates to our laws are urgently neededto keep pace with the many threats that Americans face in cyberspace. For that reason, I will support the motion for cloture on this bill. But, I do so with major reservations about the bill in its current form because this legislation does not address many of the key priories that must be a part of our national strategy for cybersecurity.  A legislative response to the growing threat of cyber crime must be a part of our debate about cyber security. Protecting American consumers and businesses from cyber crime and other threats in cyber space is a top priority of the Judiciary Committee. That is why I filed an amendment to the bill to strengthen our Nation's cyber crime laws, which takes several important steps to combat cyber crime.
