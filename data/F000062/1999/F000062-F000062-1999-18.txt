 President, in June, joined by Senators Reid, Boxer, and Bryan, I introduced the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act (S. 1192) which would jump start the process of cleaning up Lake Tahoe.  Lake Tahoe, one of the largest, deepest, clearest lakes in the world is in the midst of an economic crisis. Water clarity is declining at the rate of more than 1 foot each year; more than \1/3\ of the trees in the forest are either dead or dying; and sediment and algae-nourishing phosphorus and nitrogen continue to flow into the lake from a variety of sources.  Over the last few months, I worked with the Congressmen from the Tahoe areas, Representative Doolittle and Representative Gibbons to craft a House version of the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act that could garner bipartisan support. I am pleased that we've been able to build on S. 1192 and develop a compromise bill which I am introducing today.  Like S. 1192, this bill first and foremost authorizes the necessary funding to clean up and restore Lake Tahoe. This bill includes two major changes:  First, to address the problem of MTBE in the Lake Tahoe basin, I added a section that provides $1 million to the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency and local utility districts to clean up contaminated wells and surface water.  Second, to help local governments who would otherwise be burdened by relocation costs that may be needed to clean up the basin, this bill promises that the federal government will pay \2/3\ of any needed relocation costs.  I believe these provisions improve on the original bill and increase the breadth of support for this bill.  The bill requires the Forest Service to develop an annual priority list of environmental restoration projects and authorizes $200 million dollars over 10 years to the forest service to implement these projects on federal lands. The list must include projects that will improve water quality, forest health, soil conservation, air quality, and fish and wildlife habitat around the lake.  In developing the environmental restoration priority list, the Forest Service must rely on the best available science, and consider projects that local governments, businesses, and environmental groups have targeted as top priorities. The Forest Service also must consult with local community leaders.  The bill requires the Forest Service to give special attention on its priority list to five key activities: acquisition of environmentally sensitive land from willing sellers, erosion and sediment control, fire risk reduction, cleaning up MTBE contamination, and traffic and parking management, including promotion of public transportation.  The Lake Tahoe Restoration Act also requires that an additional $100 million be authorized over 10 years be as payments to local governments for erosioncontrol activities on non-federal lands. These payments will help local governments conduct soil conservation and erosion mitigation projects, restore wetlands and stream environmental zones, and plant native vegetation to filter out sediment and debris.  I spent my childhood at Lake Tahoe, but I had not been back for a number of years until I returned for the 1997 Presidential summit with President Clinton. I saw things I had never seen before at Lake Tahoe.  I saw the penetration of MTBE in the water and learned that 30 percent of the South Lake Tahoe water supply has been eliminated by MTBE. I observed gasoline spread over the water surface. I noticed that a third of the magnificent forest that surrounds the lake was dead or dying. I saw major land erosion problems that were bringing all kinds of sediment into the lake and which had effectively cut the lake's clarity by thirty feet since the last time I had visited. And then I learned that the experts believe that in 10 years the clouding of the amazing crystal water clarity would be impossible to reverse and in 30 years it would be lost forever.  The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency estimates that it will cost $900 million over the next 10 years to restore the Lake.  For me, that was a call to action and prompted me to sponsor this bill which will authorize $300 million of Federal moneys on a matching basis over 10 years for environmental restoration projects at Lake Tahoe to preserve the region's water quality and forest health. Put simply, this crown jewel deserves the attention, and the fact that the federal government owns 77 percent of that troubled area makes the responsibility all so clear.  Through funding over the past few years we have already begun to make some early strides such as the purchase of important pieces of land like the Sunset Ranch and the planning for a Coordinated Transit System.  Already, California and Nevada have begun contributing their portion of the restoration efforts.  California is in the second year of a ten year $275 million commitment through the California Tahoe Conservancy, Caltrans, and the Parks Service.  Nevada has authorized the issuance of bonds that will constitute an $82 million contribution over an 8-year period.  Local governments and private industry have also agreed to commit $300 million. The Tahoe Transportation and Water Quality Coalition, a coalition of 18 businesses and environmental groups, including Placer County, El Dorado County, the city of South Lake Tahoe, Douglass County in Nevada, and Washoe County in Nevada have all agreed. This is an extraordinary commitment for a region with only 50,000 year-round residents.  President Clinton took an important first step in 1997 when he held an environmental summit at Lake Tahoe and promised $50 million over 2 years for restoration activities around the lake. Unfortunately, the President's commitments lasted for only 2 years, so important areas like land acquisition and road decommissioning were not funded at the levels the President tried to accomplish. What is needed is a more sustained, long-term effort, and one that will meet the federal government's $300 million responsibility to save the environment at Lake Tahoe.  The Lake Tahoe Restoration Act will build upon the President's commitment to Lake Tahoe and authorize full funding for a new environmental restoration program at the lake.  I am also grateful to the Lake Tahoe Transportation and Water Quality Coalition, a local consensus group of 18 businesses and environmental groups, who has worked extremely hard on this bill.  Thanks in large part to their work, the bill has strong, bipartisan support from nearly every major group in the Tahoe Basin.  The bottom line is that time is running out for Lake Tahoe. We have 10 years to do something major or the water quality deterioration is irreversible.  I am hopeful that Congress will move quickly to consider the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Reid, Senator Boxer, Senator Bryan, Congressman Doolittle, Congressman Gibbons, Congresswoman Eshoo, and me in preserving this national treasure for generations to come.                                 ______                                       By
