President, I was unable to attend the inauguration of the new Governor of Illinois today. Bruce Rauner was elected November 4 to serve as the 42nd Governor of the State of Illinois. His wife Diana was by his side when he took the oath of office.  I had a chance to attend some of the receptions last night and called him over the weekend and said my duties in the Senate made it impossible to accept his invitation to say a few words at his inaugural. But despite the fact that we come from different political parties and despite the fact that we have many differences when it comes to issues before us, I certainly wish our new Governor, Bruce Rauner, the very best in his efforts to lead the Land of Lincoln, the great State of Illinois. He faces an extraordinary number of challenges--broken public pension systems, struggles in coming up with the revenue we need to keep our schools moving forward, and the safety net to protect the most vulnerable people living in our State.  I have given him my personal pledge, and I will renew it on the floor of the Senate today, to stand by him and his administration to solve these problems and to lead Illinois forward.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
