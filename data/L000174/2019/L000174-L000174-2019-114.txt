President, on January 16, more than 2 months ago, the House passed a supplemental appropriations bill, H.R. 268, which addressed the needs of all communities impacted by recent natural disasters. The House-passed disaster bill provided assistance to help people impacted by Hurricanes Florence and Michael, the Hawaii volcanoes, and the California wildfires. It provided aid to the people in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Guam, who were struck last year by typhoons, and the people of American Samoa, who were devastated by Cyclone Gita. It continued assistance for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to help them continue their recovery from Hurricanes Irma and Maria. They passed it 2 months ago.  Instead of moving quickly on this package to help those Americans in need, Senate Republicans, at the President's insistence, held up the House bill because it included assistance for Americans in Puerto Rico. Instead of giving aid to the people who need it, the President has chosen to delay it over petty grudges and political concerns.  The President's refusal to help Americans in Puerto Rico not only delays the important disaster bill that many of the other States are relying on tospeed their recovery efforts, it discriminates against the over 3 million Americans who reside in Puerto Rico, and that is wrong. We have never--certainly in my years here--had disaster bills in which we say that Americans in this State can be helped, but we do not like the Americans in this State, so they cannot be helped.  This is the United States of America. We are supposed to take care of all of our citizens when there is a crisis, not pick and choose who gets assistance based on who we are aligned with politically. I have voted for disaster relief for red States, for blue States, for purple States because they are part of the United States of America. I feel that as a country we have to come together to help each other when there is a disaster.  Certainly Republican Senators and Democratic Senators helped the State of Vermont when we were hit with a disaster a few years ago. Well, today it is Puerto Rico, and all of the Americans in Puerto Rico need our help.  A year and a half ago, it was hit by two back-to-back category 5 hurricanes. It is rare that anybody ever gets hit by two back-to-back category 5 hurricanes. An estimated 2,975 Americans lost their lives. Homes were demolished, communities destroyed. It was an extraordinary disaster, and it requires a commensurate extraordinary response.  I am glad we are finally moving to debate on the House-passed bill because we need that. We actually ought to just pass the House-passed bill, but, unfortunately, the Republicans say they will file a substitute that will take us backward, not forward.  Again, at the President's insistence, it eliminates critical assistance for the Americans in Puerto Rico provided for in the House bill, as well as assistance to other U.S. territories. It eliminates State-revolving funds that would help Puerto Rico rebuild damaged water systems and ensure they are resilient and can stand up to future storms. It eliminates a 100-percent cost-share for FEMA that would help cash-strapped Puerto Rico access Federal aid. It eliminates money to help Americans ensure that Puerto Rico is able to rebuild their electrical grid. It eliminates $68 million in Medicaid assistance for American Samoa, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands, whose programs face serious shortages due to the increased need.  Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle claim that this money is not needed. They point to previous disaster supplemental bills and argue that we have already addressed the needs of Puerto Rico, and we should move on. Well, that is untrue. We provided Puerto Rico with significant assistance, as we should have, given the extraordinary nature of the storms that ravaged the island and given the extent of the devastation, but as damage assessments come in and the full picture of the devastation becomes clear, we must continually reassess and provide them what is needed to fully recover.  I remember when this first happened, back when the White House was saying there may be two or three or four or a dozen fatalities in Puerto Rico. Well, they were off by thousands. There were 2,975 people who lost their lives, not just a handful.  We don't simply appropriate the same amount of money to each State or territory that is hit with a disaster no matter the level of damage. We look at each place, and we provide what is needed for the people to rebuild their homes, their communities, and their lives.  I will give you one example of why one size does not fit all. With Katrina, we in Congress passed six supplemental disaster packages--not one, six--to help rebuild Louisiana and Mississippi because the storm was unlike anything we had ever seen. They needed the assistance coming in over time. I supported the help for Louisiana and Mississippi. No one at the time would have argued to stop after the first tranche of funding we provided and then leave them to fend for themselves, because they are Americans. We saw there were more problems, and we added money.  This is no different.  The President reportedly came to the Capitol and met with Senators yesterday and made his case as to why we should not continue aid to Puerto Rico. Let me repeat. The President of the United States--something I have never seen in my 45 years here with either a Republican or Democratic President--affirmatively argued that we should refrain from helping American citizens in need.  Of course, like so many things the President has said, it was not based in fact or reality. He claimed that Puerto Rico had received over $90 billion in Federal assistance, but it has not. He knows it has not. Why does he keep saying this when he has to know that what he is saying is not true? He claims it is using Federal money to pay off its debt. It has not. The President knows that is not true. Why does he keep saying it?  Some here in this body have claimed that Puerto Rico has in the bank $20 billion in previously appropriated money that they have failed to spend, and they argue that we should provide no more until it is drawn down. I do not know if they are getting their talking points from the White House or what, but that is simply false.  The bulk of the money to which they refer, which we Republicans and Democrats alike voted to appropriate over 1 year ago, is being held up by the administration in redtape and bureaucracy. It seems as though it is being purposely held back because of inaction by this administration. Billions of dollars that Congress approved over 1 year ago for disaster recovery efforts remain in the U.S. Treasury in Washington, DC, not where they belong--assisting the American citizens of Puerto Rico. There is no excuse for that.  They cannot have it both ways. The administration cannot simultaneously hold up recovery dollars for Puerto Rico and then point to Puerto Rico's failure to spend it as an excuse not to provide additional assistance. In other words, they are holding these billions away from Puerto Rico, saying: You cannot have it, but why are you not spending it?  Come on. You cannot do that. You cannot claim they are not spending the money that is being held back from them, and then say that is why they do not need additional assistance.  Yesterday, Senator Schumer and I sent a letter to the administration about these bureaucratic delays and demanded answers.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of a letter dated March 25, 2019, to Mick Mulvaney, Peter Gaynor, and Ben Carson.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                   Washington, DC, March 25, 2019.     Hon. Mick Mulvaney,     Director, Office of Management and Budget,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Peter Gaynor,     Acting Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Ben Carson,     Secretary, Department of Housing     and Urban Development, Washington, DC.       Dear Director Mulvaney, Honorable Gaynor, and Honorable      Carson, Last November, we wrote to express our concern about      the significant and unsupported delays related to the      immediate and long-term recovery needs of Puerto Rico in the      aftermath of catastrophic Hurricanes Irma and Maria.      Specifically, we highlighted the lack of effective Federal      interagency coordination under the leadership of the Office      of Management and Budget (OMB), which has and continues to      impede on the Commonwealth's ability to finalize emergency      repairs through FEMA's Public Assistance categories A and B      programs, and subsequently its efforts to move toward      permanent reconstruction. These delays are not unique to      FEMA, as the Department of Housing and Urban Development      (HUD) has also been affected by OMB's micromanagement and      excessive bureaucracy as they attempt to administer and      oversee Puerto Rico's Community Development Block Grant--     Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) funding. The lack of leadership      and coordination, combined with delays in meeting the basic      needs of the island, more than eighteen months after      receiving a presidential disaster declaration, has left far      too many children and elderly citizens in unhealthy and      unsafe conditions, families in severely damaged homes, and      communities without adequate infrastructure to sustain a      decent quality of life.       The response that we received, several months later, was      wholly inadequate and contained no information to respond to      our concerns. Specifically, we raised concerns about OMB's      failure to work expeditiously with HUD to finalize and issue      a Federal Register Notice for nearly $16 billion in CDBG-DR      mitigation funding that Congress appropriated in February      2018, of which $8.3 billion has been allocated to Puerto      Rico. As a result, this critical source of funding remains      unavailable for obligation more than a year after it was      appropriated, and nearly     a year and half after the historic hurricanes made landfall.      The purpose of the mitigation allocation was to provide not      only Puerto Rico, but more than 15 other cities, states and      territories the resources necessary to rebuild their homes,      businesses, and critical infrastructure to updated      construction standards in order to prevent the same level of      destruction in future disaster events. As you are probably      aware, some reconstruction has started to take place, but      without the availability of the mitigation funding, Puerto      Rico is unable to strategically adopt these improved      standards, or leverage this critical resource toward a      comprehensive island-wide rebuild strategy. Further delays in      the availability of funding is unacceptable. We insist      that you finalize the mitigation notice in the next 30      days.       It has also come to our attention that several issues have      reached a critical point with FEMA that are hindering the      recovery efforts in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands as      well. FEMA needs to work with the territories to develop ways      to expedite approvals and obligations of funding, especially      for priority projects. In addition, FEMA needs to develop      clear policies with regard to the issues laid out below,      share them openly with Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands,      and Congress, and ensure that they are being implemented in a      consistent way.       First, finalizing the consistent implementation of the      ``pre-disaster condition'' language from section 20601 of the      Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 is paramount. The intent of      this provision was to facilitate the rebuilding of      infrastructure, including the electric grid, in a way that is      resilient to future weather events, reduces the need for      future federal disaster assistance, and makes use of      technology and modern standards when rebuilding. Congress      specifically wished to avoid a situation where the islands      would be forced to simply plug new pieces into antiquated      infrastructure, which would only lead to more frequent      failures in the future. It has come to our attention that      there is a lack of consistency and transparency in the way      that FEMA is implementing this language, and that FEMA's      interpretation of this language may be contrary to      congressional intent. For example, recent news reports      indicate that FEMA has reduced its cost estimate for a      Project Worksheet covering rebuilding of a number of schools      because upgrades to meet industry standards were removed from      the scope of work, after previously being discussed by the      stakeholders involved. FEMA must immediately rectify this      situation and issue clear guidance and expectations on its      approach to implementing both the ``pre-disaster condition''      and the ``industry standards'' portion of the Bipartisan      Budget Act. If FEMA needs additional guidance from Congress,      we must be informed of this need immediately.       Second, we are also concerned about changing FEMA guidance      and approaches leading to substantial replication of efforts      and excessive delays in approving and obligating funding for      priority projects in the territories. For example, according      to representatives of the Commonwealth, in March of 2018 FEMA      determined that the level of damage to the Vieques Hospital      justified replacement of the building, instead of repair.      Accordingly, in August of 2018, a scope of work was agreed      upon by the stakeholders involved, and coordination between      FEMA, COR3, and the municipality began on the cost estimate      of the replacement project. However, two months later, FEMA      representatives informed COR3 and the municipality that they      intended to review the validity of the replacement decision      that FEMA had previously made, sending the agreed upon      decision to the Expert Panel for their review. A year after      the initial decision to replace the building was made, the      fate of the Vieques Hospital project remains in question, and      it appears that no real progress has been made in addressing      the long-term health care needs of the people of Vieques, who      continue to rely on a mobile clinic.       Last, when FEMA provides disaster assistance, the receiving      State or Territory is responsible for implementing financial      controls to ensure that funds obligated for a project by FEMA      are drawn down by the grantee for the approved purpose.      Currently, FEMA applies additional fiscal oversight      requirements specifically to Puerto Rico, which require the      Commonwealth to provide detailed documentation to validate      that any costs incurred with disaster assistance funding are      for allowable expenses. FEMA manually validates a percentage      of those actions. Negotiations to end these additional      oversight measures and expedite the processing of recovery      funding have been ongoing; however, it's unclear what      remaining steps Puerto Rico must take to assume full      responsibility of their recovery assistance. Until FEMA      approves the transition of fiscal oversight to Puerto Rico,      these extraordinary measures will stay in place. FEMA must be      clear about the changes Puerto Rico needs to make in order to      properly manage its own recovery expenses and eliminate any      unnecessary bureaucratic steps.       As the territories continue to recover, it is crucial that      FEMA address these issues and move forward with a stronger      sense of urgency and consideration for the unique issues that      they face. A recovery of this scale requires consistency,      transparency, and constant coordination with territory      officials.       Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were hit by back-     to-back Category 5 hurricanes, and the damage to the islands      was catastrophic. An estimated 2,975 people lost their lives,      homes were demolished, and communities destroyed. This      extraordinary disaster requires a commensurate extraordinary      response. We have a responsibility to come to the aid of      fellow U.S. citizens in times of need, and this is certainly      one of those times.       We ask for a detailed response providing an update on the      status of these issues and the projected timeframe for their      final resolution be provided without delay. Please respond by      April 5, 2019.           Sincerely,     Patrick Leahy,       U.S. Senator.     Charles E. Schumer,       U.S. Senator.
