Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Chair, this is a sham bill. I have heard people say there was no consultation. There has been consultation. The gentleman from California has driven a wedge between two groups of Alaska Natives, one that lives there, resides there, and is directly affected, and the other one is 400 miles away. We had testimony from that group.  By the way, I am a Gwich'in. I may not be one, but my daughters are. My wife was. She would turn over in her grave right now if she heard this nonsense about the Gwich'in.  You invited a group in Alaska. This used to be the House of the people. Instead of people putting their nose in my business, I am going to put it in your business. I will figure out a way to do that because this is wrong. This has been debated for 40 years, an area set aside by this Congress for exploration.  By the way, we gave the Alaska Natives who live there at Kaktovik 70,000 acres of land for their social and economic well-being, and you are taking it away from them. You talk about a cultural aspect, you are hurting those people, and you don't care. I remember who you represent, and I understand that. You are a lawyer.  To me, to have this type of bill on the floor is not only a waste of time for this House body but a bad thing for this Nation, but worse than that is going back on their word.  I represent the whole State of Alaska. The people who live there, live on the Arctic slope, want this legislation, not the Gwich'in. Yes, they are being, very frankly, shilled and used for a sham, and that is a shame.  You can be what you want to be. You can stand there holier-than-thou. You are doing something wrong to this Nation, the Alaska people, and the Alaska Native. You listen to one side.  Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
