President, I rise today to speak in support of a friend and a constituent of mine who is a great legal thinker and writer, a pillar in her community, a respected and valuable Associate Justice on the Oregon Supreme Court, and someone who I believe will be an outstanding federal court of appeals judge--Justice Susan Graber.  Let me begin by expressing my thanks and gratitude to the Senate Judiciary Committee, and in particular the Chairman of that Committee, Senator Hatch of Utah for acting on the nomination of Justice Graber and holding a confirmation hearing earlier this year.  Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of Justice Susan Graber for appointment as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Justice Graber comes before the Senate today with the strong bipartisan support of the Oregon Congressional delegation, with broad support from Oregon's law enforcement community and with strong support from the bench and bar. From all across my home state, from both sides of the aisle in Oregon politics, from judges and litigants alike, I have heard the praise accorded to this dedicated jurist, who has just recently reached her 10th anniversary as an appellate judge --at the ripe old age of 48.  I will not dwell long on her outstanding qualifications for this position--a graduate of Wellesley College and Yale Law School, Susan Graber has excelled at every step of her fine legal career. From the moment she took the bench right up until the present day, Susan Graber remains the youngest--and I think most will agree, one of the most productive--justices of the Oregon Supreme Court.  Through her authorship of over 300 opinions in the past 10 years, Justice Graber has garnered praise from the bench and bar as being the epitome of a careful and non-ideological judge whose centrist approach has helped promote a consensus-building and collegial atmosphere on this important court. And Justice Graber's opinions point out another fact--this is an individual who respects and understands her role as a judge. She understands very clearly the difference between being a legislator and being a judge, and her opinions reflect a firm adherence to the law as written by the Oregon Legislature. She knows the role of a judge is to follow, not to make the law, and that is exactly what we need on the federal appellate bench.  I am certain that Justice Graber will bring to the U.S. Court of Appeals thesame intelligence, thoroughness and integrity that she has brought to her work as a State Supreme Court judge and as a careful and thoughtful student of the law. I want to again thank Chairman Hatch and the Senate leadership for moving us to this point in the process, and I urge my colleagues to confirm this tremendous nominee.                          ____________________
