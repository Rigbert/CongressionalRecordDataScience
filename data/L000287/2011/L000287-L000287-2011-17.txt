Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the longest running war in our Nation's history. I want to thank my friend and colleague from Ohio for introducing this resolution.  War is not the answer. It is not the way to peace. We must root out the causes of hate and violence.  Gandhi once said: ``Power is of two kinds. One is obtained by the fear of punishment, and the other by acts of love. Power based on love is a thousand times more effective and permanent than the one derived from the fear of punishment.''  Our path to peace in Afghanistan is not through war; it is not through violence. Enough is enough. The time is long overdue.  We are spending billions of dollars a week. Not another nickel, not another dime, not another dollar, not another hour, not another day, not another week. We must end this war and end it now.  I urge all of my colleagues to support the resolution.
