 Mr. Speaker, on Monday the House will meet at 3 p.m. in a pro forma session. On Tuesday, the House will meet at 10:30 a.m. for morning-hour debate and noon for legislative business, with votes rolled until 6:30 p.m. On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for legislative business and at 9 a.m. on Friday.  We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. A list of those bills will be announced before the close of business tomorrow.  Under a rule, we expect to consider a conference report on the Intelligence authorization bill and on the Department of Defense authorization bill and further action on appropriations and terrorism risk insurance. There may well be other legislation, if it comes from the Senate.
