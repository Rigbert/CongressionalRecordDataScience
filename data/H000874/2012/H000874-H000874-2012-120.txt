 Mr. Speaker, when tragedy of this kind strikes, our hearts go out to those whose lives were cut short and to those who lost loved ones. In the aftermath of this shooting, we have seen both an outpouring of love and support for the victims and their families and a quickness to point out what might have been done differently. That is our nature as Americans--always seeking answers, searching for corrective action, for a measure of logic amid the irrational.  But the first question we ought to ask and is already being asked is: How can we draw closer as a community? Not just the community of Aurora, but the community of Americans.  As President Obama said on Friday:       If there's anything to take away from this tragedy, it's      the reminder that life is very fragile. And what matters at      the end of the day is not the small things; ultimately, it's      how we choose to treat one another and how we love one      another.  I would add it is also how we commit to live with one another as neighbors.  We may not share the same faith or politics or philosophy, but we do share a fundamental belief that our people should feel safe in our theaters and malls and schools, in their homes and on the streets--wherever they go. And, today, we share the pain of the people of Aurora.  But we also share in the hope that the city whose name is the ``dawn'' will find in our sympathy and prayers the comfort it needs during this dark hour to begin the process of healing and to believe again in a brighter tomorrow.
