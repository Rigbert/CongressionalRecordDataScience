Mr. Speaker, again, I would like to thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica) for carrying this load. I had to come to this floor because there has been a lot of misunderstanding about this legislation.  All the way through this legislation the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) and his staffer, Stacy, were involved in this legislation as it passed from the committee and to this House floor. I was charged as chairman of the committee to meet with the Senate, and it is a two-way street, and the Senate and the House did meet.  By the way, in this bill, for the other side, the Democrat side, the provision included a special rule to maintain the minimum AIP entitlement at small airports that had lost passengers. That was the gentleman from Massachusetts' (Mr. McGovern) piece of legislation. It included a sense of Congress on fifth freedom and seventh freedom flights. That was the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski). Increase the Metropolitan Planning Organization, MPO, participation in airport planningprocess; that was the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer). A requirement to provide additional information to families affected by aircraft accidents, that was from the gentleman from New York (Mr. Weiner). Restrictions on flights to Teterboro Airport, that was the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Rothman). Flight attendant certification; deadline of issuance of stage 4 noise reduction rule; curriculum standards for maintenance technicians; provision on foreign repair station security. All of these came from the other side, and they are in the bill.  The conference did meet at the request of the Senate side and, at that time, the Democrats offered an amendment to prohibit the FAA from contracting out any more air traffic control towers and it lost.                              {time}  1245  And it lost. And I have to remind everybody in our bill I protected 95 percent of the control towers. Sixty-nine could have been contracted out; sixty-nine. Under of the Clinton administration 194 were contracted out. And no one said a word, privatized and no one said a word. I protected 95 percent of it. But because of the misinformation, the cry of anguish, now we went back to the old law, existing law, the way it existed for the last 10 years. And that is the law we had that was stripped out of this provision.  And, very frankly, I was disappointed that there was nobody signing the conference report from the other side. We tried to finalize it before it expired, this act itself, and now we are on the floor today. And I ask my colleagues, the good in this bill far outweighs what is said bad about it. It allows our airports to function. It improves our airports, and it improves safety all the way through this legislation.  I know there has been a lot of disinformation, and, unfortunately, I cannot control everything that happens in this House. I wish I could. I would like to be given about 20 minutes as a dictator, I would straighten everything out. But that will not happen. This is a democracy.  But this, overall, is a good piece of legislation. Yes, I even arrived at a solution with the delegation from D.C. and Virginia on the slots, an agreement we made. So there are not that many slots requested from the Senate. And I prevailed on the House side.  So I hope with the information that is given us in the debate on the rule, and the debate itself, you understand that this bill is, overall, a good piece of legislation with the bodies on both sides of the aisle having to work together to arrive at a solution.  Now, we can demagog this more and more; we can rattle on about it more and more. But in reality, the legislation before you today should become law, and I hope it will be passed on.  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), a member of the committee.                         parliamentary inquiry
