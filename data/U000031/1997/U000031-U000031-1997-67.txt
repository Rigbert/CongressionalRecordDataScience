Speaker, I rise today to honor the 75th anniversary of the Portage School District in southwest Michigan. Much has changed since the school doors opened in 1922, but throughout the years the Portage schools have consistently succeeded in providing a high quality education and outstanding services for students.  Formed in 1922 as the Portage Agricultural School District, the district then had five teachers. Today, 550 professionals educate nearly 9,000 students who fill 8 elementary schools, 3 middle schools, and 2 high schools. The school district boasts student achievement scores that are 15 percent to 20 percent higher than State averages with 83 percent of their students going on to higher education.  The strength and excellence of the school district's curriculum and programs preparesyouths for the challenges they will face following graduation. It is with great pleasure that I am able to represent the Portage schools and witness their remarkable growth. I consider their comprehensive programs to be a model of success, and I have the utmost confidence in their ability to continue serving students for another 75 years with the same excellence they have achieved.  Mr. Speaker, I know that the people of Portage have always stood behind their schools, just like the school district stands behind its students and staff. As their Representative in Congress, it is a great honor for me to rise today in recognition of their accomplishments and wish them many more years of prosperity.                          ____________________
