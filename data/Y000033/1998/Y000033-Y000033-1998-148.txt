Mr. Chairman, I want to stress that again. This issue I thought had been put to bed. The good Senator, bless his heart, never does sleep. But to be frank, I would suggest to the gentleman from California, if he wants to open up the Tongass, and he has his amendment adopted, he will really have an opportunity. And I will tell him, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Dicks), and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Regula) will tell him, he does not want to go through this.  So I was trying to do something correct for many times, dead serious, not to have the Tongass mentioned in the bill at all, so there would not be a door open for my good senior Senator who is very persevering.
