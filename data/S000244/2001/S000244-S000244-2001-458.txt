Chairman, I yield myself the balance of the time.  Mr. Chairman, this is a technical amendment. The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) is complaining about the fact that there is an omission in the technical amendment, and the fact that it is substantive in nature means that the provisions that the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) is complaining about do not belong in a technical amendment.  Now, the question before the committee, when we vote on this amendment, is whether or not to pass a technical amendment that is needed to clean up the bill and to make its provisions easier to understand and easier to execute when the court has questions placed before them.  A no vote means that people want to make it harder to understand and harder to execute. I would urge the House to support this amendment so that it can be made easier to understand by everybody.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner).  The question was taken; and the Chairman pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it.
