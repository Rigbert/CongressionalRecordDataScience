 I very much appreciate those comments. Last Friday night, I took a tumble down stone stairs and managed to have a compound fracture of my tibia and crack a couple of ribs, so I can't say I am none the worse for wear, but I thank the Senator very much for his warm words. I greatly appreciate it.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for some time in morning business for the purposes of introducing a bill.
