 President, every day it becomes harder and harder for me to listen to my Republican friends who race down to the Senate breathlessly telling the American people how concerned they are about the $13 trillion national debt we have and how ``we have to get our financial house in order.'' That is what they tell us every single day. But a funny thing happened: under the leadership of President George W. Bush, these very same Republicans turned a recordbreaking Federal surplus left by President Clinton into recordbreaking deficits. Back then, as we all recall, not so many years ago, their rallying cry was ``deficits don't matter.'' That was articulated by Vice President Dick Cheney. This ``deficits don't matter'' philosophy gave us two wars that were not paid for, including the war in Iraq, which may end up costing us $3 trillion. It gave us $700 billion in tax breaks--no worry about paying for those tax breaks that went to the very wealthiest people in our country. It gave us $400 billion in an unpaid-for prescription drug Medicare Part D bill. And, of course, it gave us a $700 billion bailout of Wall Street developed by President Bush and his Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Paulson. No worry; in those days, we did not have to pay for any of that. It is OK, just add it onto the debt of our kids and our grandchildren.  But it seems our Republican friends recently, about a year and three-quarters ago, had a change of heart. Coincidentally, that was when PresidentObama came into office. I am sure it was just a coincidence, but now it appears that deficits do matter. For 8 years, deficits didn't matter. Now they do matter. Now they are telling us we cannot afford to extend unemployment benefits to over 2 million Americans who lost their jobs in the worst recession in modern history.
