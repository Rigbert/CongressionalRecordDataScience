Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor a constituent and patriot, Ronald Shugart Barbre who passed away peacefully at his home on May 15, 2011 after a brave battle with cancer. He was 76 years old.  Ron was born December 20, 1934 at Queen of Angels Hospital in Los Angeles. His father, Thomas Russell Barbre, was the 39th captain in the history of the Los Angeles County Fire Department and his mother, Sarah Shugart Barbre, was a homemaker. He grew up in the Athens District of Los Angeles and graduated from Washington High School.  He attended the University of Southern California (USC) on a naval ROTC scholarship and graduated with a degree in International Relations. Even though she was a graduate of cross town rival UCLA, he married the love of his life, Nancy on June 23, 1957 while on active naval duty. They initially lived in Bremerton, WA while he finished his active duty, and upon honorable discharge, moved to Balboa Island before settling in Fullerton, CA. In 1969, Ron and Nancy moved to the new community of Yorba Linda, CA where they raised their family and were active members of Rose Drive Friends Church.  After his active duty military service, he earned his MBA from USC and embarked upon a successful sales career in the publishing business. He carried the first issue of Electronic Component News (ECN) and helped develop this publication in the burgeoning electronics industry for Chilton Publishing. By the time he retired in 1998, he had risen to the role of regional vice president for Chilton-ABC Publishing.  Ron helped form the Orange County chapter of the Business and Professional Advertising Association (BPAA) where he annually organized the annual tennis tournament. He became a Certified Business Communicator (CBC) through the organization and assisted countless students interested in the advertising and publishing business. He also became known as ``Mr. Closer'' and developed the art of the ``power lunch''.  Ron led a very active life as a competitive tennis player and indefatigable hiker & biker. He was an avid reader who loved history and biographies, and was always a faithful and active member of his church.  Following the loss of his first wife, Nancy, to cancer in 1993, he moved from the hills of Yorba Linda to the coastal community of San Clemente where he married his second wife, Joyce. His dream retirement was one in which he could play as much tennis as he wished, ride his bike in flat areas, and walk on the beach every day. With Joyce, Ron joined the San Clemente Presbyterian Church where they each found a new life together.  In retirement he spent time volunteering at the San Diego Air & Space Museum, as a docent at the Ocean Institute in Dana Point, and travelling the world with Joyce and many friends. He also consistently spent time with his family on both coasts and with Joyce's family of 4 children and 9 grandchildren.  Ron is survived by his wife Joyce of San Clemente; son Brian (Birgit) of Gloucester, MA; his son Brett (Jean) of Yorba Linda; his grandson Daniel of Gloucester, MA; his sister Josephine Cullen of Rolling Hills Estates; his sister Jeanette Pickering of Ventura; numerous cousins, nieces, nephews, step-children & step-grandchildren, and friends and colleagues coast to coast. He was predeceased by his first wife Nancy, his parents Tom Sr. and Sarah; his sister June Wagner and his brothers Tom Barbre, Jr. and Robert Shugart.  A memorial service celebrating Ron's extraordinary life will be held in June. Ron will always be remembered for his incredible work ethic, generosity, athleticism, and love of family. His dedication to his family and community are a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will continue. I extend my condolences to Ron's family and friends; although Ron may be gone, the light and goodness he brought to the world remain and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
