Mr. Speaker, I would assure both gentlemen, Alaska will welcome you on a visit. I hope to visit both of their communities in the future. The only way we can get things done around here is if we understand your locations, your people, and what you will treasure, as I do in my State of Alaska.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
