Mr. Speaker, the Washington Post reported that the deficit will be $45 billion this year, and maybe balance next year. How did it happen? In the 1993 Democratic budget agreement the Democrats were right and Republicans were wrong. The Democrats' 1993 budget set us on the road to a balanced budget without one Republican vote.  Thanks to Democrats, we can give the American people a tax cut and a balanced budget. The only question is, who will benefit. Republicans want to help Wall Street and the richest among us. Democrats want to help Main Street and working families.  Even U.S. News & World Report says Republicans want to help their wealthy friends. Let me quote: ``The reality is closer to the Democrats' view. The best independent estimates of the bill are that about half the benefits of the Republicans' tax relief plan would go to the richest 10 percent.''  Mr. Speaker, we must reject the Republican irresponsible tax break for Wall Street. Join Democrats and cut taxes for working Americans.                          ____________________
