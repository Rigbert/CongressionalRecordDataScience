Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend, the gentleman from California, for yielding time to me.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Dreier amendment, which brings equity back to the process of allocating refugee assistance funds. Each year for the last decade, one State has received more than 10 times the amount of Federal refugee assistance per refugee than the national average. The Dreier amendment will allow all qualifying countries to receive the same amount of targeted assistance per refugee. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, which again, brings equity back to the process of allocating refugee assistance funds.
