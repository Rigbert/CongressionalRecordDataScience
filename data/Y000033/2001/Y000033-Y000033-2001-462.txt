Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce legislation to provide for the equitable treatment of Alaska Native Vietnam veterans. My bill will amend Section 41 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA). This section applies to the Native Allotments for Alaska Native Vietnam veterans.  In 1998, P.L. 105-276 (Section 432) amended the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) to provide Alaska Native Vietnam veterans an opportunity to obtain an allotment of up to 160 acres of land under the Native Allotment Act. There are approximately 2,800 Alaska Natives who served in the military during the Vietnam conflict who did not have an opportunity to apply for their Native allotment. When P.L. 105-276 became law, many Alaska Native Vietnam veterans were encouraged with the belief that they would finally receive recognition for their military service to the United States. Many Alaska Native Vietnam veterans saw this as their last opportunity to obtain land which had been used by their families for generations for subsistence purposes. That opportunity was lost to 1,700 Alaska Native Vietnam veterans who were excluded by the terms of P.L. 150-276 (which was harshly enforced by the previous Administration).  P.L. 105-276 contains three major obstacles which prohibit Alaska Native Vietnam veterans an opportunity to select and obtain their Native allotment. These obstacles are so formidable that 48% of the total Alaska Native Vietnam veteran allotment applications which have been filed (as of September 27, 2001) have been rejected [according to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM)]. The BLM also reports that only 116 applications for Alaska Native Vietnam veterans' allotments have been filed and 56 of those applications have been rejected. The reasons for all but 16 of the rejections are for one of the following reasons: (1) the land applied for is not available; and/or (2) the dates that the Alaska Native Vietnam veteran served during the Vietnam conflict did not coincide with those required under P.L. 105-276.  P.L. 105-276's first obstacle is: Alaska Native Vietnam veterans can only apply for land that was vacant, unappropriated, and unreserved when their use of the land first began. Land that is available to Alaska Native Vietnam veterans for allotments is extremely limited or non-existent. For example, out of the 116 applications filed thus far, 36% have been rejected because the land applied for is not available under P.L. 105-276. Most land in Alaska is out of reach for Alaska Native Vietnam veteran allotments. Lands that are expressly not available for allotments are lands in a National Forest, selected by the State of Alaska or Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act Native Corporations or under a public land law, camping sites, designated wilderness, and acquired by the federal government through gift, purchase, or exchange.  The second obstacle is: Alaska Native Vietnam veterans can only apply if they served in active military duty from January 1, 1969 to December 31, 1971 (even though the Vietnam conflict began August 5, 1964 and ended May 7, 1975). The dates of January 1969 to December 1971 were adamantly required by the previous Administration because they did not want to give up any additional federal lands in Alaska. Approximately 1,700 Alaska Native Vietnam veterans who served during the Vietnam conflict are not eligible for an allotment under existing law because they do not meet the military service date's requirement. Many of those 1,700 veterans did not even apply, but those who did have been rejected. Of all of the applications rejected, 13% were rejected because the Alaska Native Vietnam veteran's military service dates did not meet the existing requirements.  The third obstacle is: Alaska Native Vietnam veterans must prove they used the land (applied for in their native allotment application) in a substantially continuous and independent manner, at least potentially exclusive of others, for five or more years. This requirement was not in the original Native Allotment Act, nor has it been required of other Alaska Native allotment applicants. This requirement further penalizes our Alaska Native Vietnam veterans and will certainly cause many applications to be rejected. Further, adjudication of use and occupancy issues will take years and will be very costly.  My proposed legislation will increase the available land by authorizing Alaska Native Vietnam veterans to apply for land that is federally owned and vacant. The lack of available land under existing law nullifies the very purpose of granting Alaska Native Vietnam veterans an allotment benefit. This is true because most land in Alaska is not available for Alaska Native Vietnam veteran allotment applications under existing laws. For example,there is no land available in southeast Alaska because it either is within the Tongass National Forest or has been selected or conveyed to the State of Alaska or ANCSA Native Corporations. In addition, vast areas of land in Alaska were withdrawn before most Alaska Native Vietnam veterans could have made qualifying use of the land. In contrast, federally owned ``vacant'' land is still available throughout Alaska and should be made available for Alaska Native Vietnam veteran allotments.  My legislation will also expand the military service dates to the dates that coincide with the entire Vietnam era conflict: beginning August 5, 1964 and ending on May 7, 1975. The expansion of military service dates to include all Alaska Natives Vietnam veterans who served in the military during the Vietnam conflict is consistent with the federal government's policy of providing benefits to all veterans of the Vietnam conflict and not just to some of those veterans. This provision also fulfills the trust obligation to Alaska Natives. The limited military service dates have excluded many Alaska Native Vietnam veterans who bravely served during the Vietnam conflict. Never before has the United States given veteran land benefits to only a portion of those who served their country. The federal government has given public land benefits to all veterans (or their widows or heirs) of every war beginning with the Indian Wars of 1790 and ending with the Korean conflict in 1955. As Members will recall, Alaska Native veterans were not eligible for these public land benefits until 1924 because the courts had determined Alaska Natives were not United States citizens.  My legislation will also replace existing use and occupancy requirements with legislative approval of allotment applications. The provision assures the legislative approval process affords due process protections of valid existing interests in the land a veteran claims. The use and occupancy requirements would be replaced with legislative approval for several reasons. First, Congress has made legislative approval available to all other allotment applicants under 43 U.S.C. Section 1634(a)(1)(A)--[Section 905 of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) which extends the legislative approval of Native allotments that were pending at the time of passage of ANILCA]. Second, legislative approvals of allotments prevent costly and lengthy adjudication of use and occupancy issues. Legislative approval also prevents lengthy delays that will impede many Alaska Native Vietnam veteran applicants from ever receiving land during their lifetime. Third, there are many Alaska Native Vietnam veterans that could not meet use and occupancy requirements as a result of their service to their country, One example that illustrates this point is that a deserving Alaska Native Vietnam veteran who was paralyzed during the Vietnam conflict would be rejected if that veteran was unable to complete the five years of use of the claimed land and had not used the land for five years before the Vietnam conflict.  My legislation addresses the formidable barriers that deserving Alaska Native Vietnam veterans face when applying for a Native allotment under P.L. 105-267. For many years, Alaska Natives have had a unique legal relationship with the United States. Because of this unique relationship, Alaska Natives have steadfastly answered a call to duty when the United States called during a conflict or an act of war. Alaska Natives did so in disproportionately high numbers during the Vietnam conflict. Those who answered the call during the entire Vietnam conflict should not be penalized for their service to their country.  My proposed legislation will correct those inequities imposed by the last Administration in allowing all of the Alaska Native Vietnam veterans to apply for their Native allotment under the Native Allotment Act. I urge America's support of this legislation and of the Alaska Native Vietnam veterans who bravely served this great country during the Vietnam conflict. Fulfill our promise to all Alaska Native Vietnam veterans and allow them to obtain their Native allotment under the Native Allotment Act.                          ____________________
