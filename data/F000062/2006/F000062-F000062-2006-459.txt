 President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Bay Area Council for Jewish Rescue and Renewal's Climate of Trust Program. The council's work in combating ethnic and religious hatred while strengthening tolerance and moderation in Russian society has made a great difference in the lives of all the program's participants.  In 1998, a wave of anti-Semitic activity terrorized the Jewish population in a provincial town in northwest Russia. In response, the Bay Area Council established the Climate of Trust Program, a collaborative partnership between American and Russian police officers, local officials, human rights activists, and ethnic and religious community representatives dedicated to resolving conflicts peacefully and establishing an atmosphere of tolerance and mutual respect in Russia.  It is fitting that the pilot program for the Climate of Trust began in one of the most diverse cities in the world, my hometown of San Francisco.  In 2000, representatives of the San Francisco Police Department, the District Attorney's Office, the California Superior Court, and the Anti-Defamation League went to Russia to join their counterparts in a seminar on religious tolerance. The participants continued the dialogue when the Russian delegates traveled to San Francisco later that year.  In total, seven of these exchanges have now taken place. During these meetings, attendees discuss a wide variety of issues including hate crime laws in the United States, how hate incidents are investigated, elements of a hate crime and its impact on the community, diversity in the police department, and community policing.  These interactions culminated in the establishment of four permanent regional tolerance centers in Russia. These centers design and implement activities that promote tolerance and effective communication between law enforcement and the community.  Organized and run by Russian police officers and community members alike, the centers sponsor hate crimes courses for police cadets to identify and handle ethnic or religious violence and produce a tolerance textbook for high school students.  From its modest beginning in 1998, the Climate of Trust has grown into a far-reaching and effective program. Thousands of Russians, from small town police officers to federal government officials, have attended Climate of Trust seminars and workshops.  The success of this program is due in no small part to the hard work of theBay Area Council, USAID, and, most importantly, the team of American volunteers and their Russian counterparts who have worked together to develop new models for promoting tolerance and diversity.  We have all witnessed the tragic consequences of ethnic hatred and religious intolerance. It is our solemn obligation to work together to ensure that tolerance and understanding prevails. I commend and congratulate the Climate of Trust Program of the Bay Area Council for Jewish Rescue and Renewal for their tireless efforts in these areas, and I look forward to working with them again in the future.                          ____________________[Pages S976-S977]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                      THE CLIMATE OF TRUST PROGRAM
