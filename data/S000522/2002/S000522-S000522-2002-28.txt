Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, let me note that the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter) has been very gracious. The time for the Committee on International Relations was supposed to end a half hour ago. We have had so many speakers, some of whom have waited. In the case of the gentleman from New York (Mr. Sweeney), he has been waiting for 2 hours; and he has been very kind. We want to thank the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter).  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Sweeney), a man who lost friends in the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center.
