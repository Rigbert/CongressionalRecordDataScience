 Chairman, I yield myself 1\1/2\ minutes.  Mr. Chairman, this tripartisan amendment is cosponsored by the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Gutknecht), the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Kucinich), the gentleman from New York (Mr. McHugh), the gentleman from New York (Mr. Hinchey), the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) and the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Barrett). It is also supported by the AARP, the Pension Rights Center, the Communication Workers of America and many other unions.  This amendment is simple and straightforward. It simply would prohibit the Internal Revenue Service from using any funding for activities that violate current pension age discrimination laws, laws that have been on the books since 1986.  Mr. Chairman, if a company reduced pension benefits based on race or religion or gender, the Federal Government would be sure to take appropriate action against the company. We can do no less when it comes to age discrimination in pension plans. The truth is that with regard to cash balance plans, the Federal Government has been asleep at the wheel and it is time to give them a wake-up call. That is what this amendment does.  Let me quote from a letter I received from the AARP today:  ``This issue has largely been brought into focus because of the most recent corporate pension trend of changing traditional pension plans to so-called cash balance plan formulas. Older workers face inequitable treatment under these plans, and AARP believes the cash balance plans violate current law prohibitions on age discrimination. Already, hundreds of charges of age discrimination have been filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In addition, the IRS, in consultation with other government agencies, has begun a process of review of the age discrimination issues involved in cash balance conversions. All this amendment requires is that the IRS not take any action in contravention of current age discrimination law. AARP hopes that this amendment will send a strong message that we value older workers and that we reaffirm that older workers should not be subject to age discrimination.''

Mr. Chairman, let me quote from a letter that I received today from the AARP:       This issue has largely been brought into focus because of      the most recent corporate pension trend of changing      traditional pension plans to so called ``cash balance'' plan      formulas.

AARP hopes that this amendment will send a strong message      that we value older workers and that we reaffirm that older      workers should not be subject to age discrimination.  A vote in support of this amendment is a vote to protect the pensions of older Americans and I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this amendment.  Why are we offering this amenmdent? Mr. Chairman, hundreds of profitable companies across the country, including IBM, AT, CBS and Bell Atlantic have converted their traditional defined benefit pension plan to a controversial cash balance plan. Cash balance schemes typically reduce the future pension benefits of older workers by as much as 50 percent. Not only is this immoral, it is also illegal because the reductions in benefits are directly tied to an employee's age.  What makes the conversions even more indefensible is the fact that many of these companies have pension fund surpluses in the billions of dollars. It is simply unacceptable that during a time of record breaking corporate profits, huge pension fund surpluses, massive compensation for CEOs (including very generous retirement benefits), that corporate America renege on the commitments that they have made to workers by slashing their pensions. Mr. Chairman, Congress must stand with older workers and insist that anti-age discrimination statutes are enforced.  Mr. Chairman, I have heard from hundreds of workers throughout the country who have expressed their anger, their disappointment and their feelings of betrayal by cash balance conversions. These employees had stuck with their company when times were tough, and there have been some tough times for American workers. Some of these people are salaried employees who worked 60 or 70 hours a week for their company with no additional compensation, and missed their kids' Little League games or family activities because they were determined to do their jobs well. These are employees who went to work for their company and stayed at their company precisely because of the pension program that the company offered.  And these are the same employees who woke up one day, to discover that all of the promises that their companies made to them were not worth the paper they were written on. Mr. Chairman, this is outrageous. We must provide protections for these workers that have been screaming out to Congress for help. We must pass this amendment.  Large, multinational companies with defined benefit pension plans receive $100 billion ayear in tax breaks from private pension plans alone according to the Office of Management and Budget. Mr. Chairman, the IRS should not be giving tax breaks to companies that willfully violate the pension age discrimination statutes.  To do so, not only violates public law and policy, it also provides taxpayer subsidies for illegal pension conversions. Mr. Chairman, there should be no tax breaks for companies that discriminate on the basis of age.  The fact that cash balance plan conversions violate current pension age discrimination laws is clear. According to Edward Zelinsky, law professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law,       As a matter of law, the typical cash balance plan violates      the statutory prohibition on age-based reductions in the rate      at which participants accrue their benefits . . . There is no      dispute about the underlying arithmetic: as cash balance      participants age, the contributions made for them decline in      value in annuity terms.  Mr. Chairman, if you are still wondering if cash balance schemes violate pension age discrimination laws, consider this:  Mr. Chairman, pension security is vital to the working men and women of America, and we must do all we can to ensure that employees of the most profitable companies in America do not lose their retirement benefits as a result of age discrimination. I urge my colleagues to stand up for American workers and vote for this amendment.                                                         AARP,                                    Washington, DC, July 20, 2000.     Hon. Bernie Sanders,     Rayburn HOB, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.     Hon. Gil Gutknecht,     Cannon HOB, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Representatives Sanders and Gutknecht: AARP supports      your amendment to the Treasury-Postal Appropriations Act to      ensure that the Internal Revenue Service does not use any      funds in contravention of current law prohibitions on age      discrimination in pension plans.       In 1986, on a bipartisan basis, Congress enacted a set of      parallel amendments to the Age Discrimination in Employment      Act (ADEA), the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), and the Employee      Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) to prohibit the      reduction of an employee's benefit accrual because of age.      These provisions highlight Congressional concern about      fairness to older workers in the operations of pension plans.      The overall objectives of the amendment were two-fold: to      assure that employee pension benefit plans do not      discriminate on the basis of age and to remove disincentives      to older employees to remain in the workforce. Prior to these      changes, many plans made older workers face a cruel choice--     retire, or watch the value of their retirement benefits erode      substantially.       Your amendment would not change current law, but would      simply require that IRS not use any funds that violate these      current law provisions.       This issue has largely been brought into focus because of      the most recent corporate pension trend of changing      traditional pension plans to so called ``cash balance'' plan      formulas. Older workers face inequitable treatment under      these plans, and AARP believes that cash balance plans      violate current law prohibitions on age discrimination.      Already, hundreds of charges of age discrimination have been      filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In      addition, the IRS (in consultation with other government      agencies) has begun a process of review of the age      discrimination issues involved in cash balance conversions.      However, IRS has yet to issue any definitive guidance in this      area.       All this amendment requires is that IRS not take any action      in contravention of current law. AARP hopes that this      amendment will send a strong message that we value older      workers and that we reaffirm that older workers should not be      subject to age discrimination in their pension plans.       If you have any further questions, feel free to call me, or      have your staff call David Certner of our Federal Affairs      Department at 202-434-3760.           Sincerely,     Horace B. Deets.                                  ____                                        Pension Rights Center,                                                   Washington, DC.     Hon. Bernard Sanders,     Rayburn House Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Congressman Sanders: The Pension Rights Center, the      nation's only consumer organization working solely to protect      the pension rights of workers, retires and their families,      strongly supports your amendment to the Treasury-     appropriations bill to prohibit the Internal Revenue Service      (IRS) from using any funding for activities that violate      current age discrimination laws. We believe that this      amendment will help protect older Americans' pensions.       This amendment will ensure that the IRS does not approve      cash balance conversions, a practice that clearly violates      age discrimination laws. These cash balance conversions have      received widespread attention because they significantly and      irreparably reduce older workers' pension benefits. Loyal      employees from some of the largest blue chip corporations--     IBM, Bell Atlantic, Citibank and SBC--have been bewildered,      angered and frustrated to learn that their companies have      broken the long-standing pension promises that they counted      on to make ends meet in retirement. Many of these employees      have come to the Pension Rights Center asking us to help them      protect their rights.       As you have noted, cash balance plans violate the age      discrimination provisions of the Internal Revenue code, ERISA      and the Age Discrimination Enforcement Act by reducing      benefit accruals of people as they age. Many cash balance      conversions also violate age discrimination rules by      effectively freezing the benefits of older workers while      providing new benefits only to younger workers through a      controversial practice called, ``wearaway.''       The argument that the prohibition of cash balance plans      will erode the defined benefit system is fallacious. The fact      is, employers are switching to cash balance plans to save      millions of dollars by reducing benefits of older workers.      Employers know that if they were to terminate their      overfunded defined benefit plans and set up a defined      contribution plan, they would be required to pay a      substantial excise tax. But by restructuring their plans into      a cash balance arrangement, employers have been able to avoid      paying taxes while essentially recapturing the ``surplus'' in      their pension plans for corporate purposes. In face, recent      articles in the Wall Street Journal, the New Times and      Business Week have exposed how companies have used this      practice to pump up the bottom line.       We have heard from thousands of employees who wonder how      profitable corporations with overfunded pension plans have      been able to unilaterally and unfairly break promises to      them. If Members of Congress are concerned about the long-     term viability of the private pension system, they should      support your amendment to help restore faith in the nation's      private pension system. Unless the IRS stops cash balance      conversions, taxpayers will rightly question why they are      being asked to foot the bill for $80 billion in tax breaks to      encourage pension plans if these plans are not serving their      interest.       We look forward to working with you as you continue your      efforts to champion legislation that fairly promotes the      interests of employees and their families.           Sincerely,     Karen W. Ferguson,                                                         Director.     Karen Friedman,                                         Pension Fairness Project.
