President, I say to those in the Senate, regardless of your position on gun control, I hope we all concede we need to get the resources to schools, parents, and families so they can do their best to protect their kids and try to eliminate a senseless tragedy such as we saw in Michigan this week and, sadly, we have seen repeated across America.  I yield the remainder of my time.
