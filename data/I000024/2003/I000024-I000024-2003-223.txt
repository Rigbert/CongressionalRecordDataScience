It is very important because I just got a phone call that I am going to be asked a question. First of all, I want to inform the Senator from Utah that in Oklahoma, our fastest growing population has been Hispanic for 25 years. I used to be a commercial pilot in Mexico. I know Hispanics.  When I was the mayor of Tulsa, we appointed the first Hispanic commission anywhere in the Southwest. It is still there today.  Now, the question is this, and I am going to be asked this question this weekend: Why was this Hispanic man, when nobody could question his qualifications, rejected? I have to answer this to the Hispanic commission of Oklahoma Saturday. What shall I say?
