 Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Georgia said that this health care was about one-sixth of the economy; he's right. This continuing resolution is about 100 percent of the economy.  Why are we here, Mr. Speaker? The American people are asking themselves: What is this debate about? We passed a budget in this House setting spending at $967 billion. The Senate passed a budget at $1.058 trillion. There's a $91 billion difference between the Senate and the House. This House, which talks about negotiations, has refused to go to conference.                              {time}  2215  So we have not reached an agreement on a number; that's why we are here. Nor have we passed two-thirds of the appropriations bills through this House. In fact, one was brought to the floor and pulled off the floor because at the $967 billion Republican budget, you cannot pass those appropriations bills if there were no Democrat in the House. My friend, Mr. Rogers, knows that.  My friend, Mr. Rogers, talked about responsibility. We ought to be responsible. I believe that on the Republican side of the aisle there are at least 150 Members who believe that we ought to be responsible, who believe this constant harping on the Affordable Care Act, which was the central part of the last election, and you want to deny the fact that elections make a difference.  One of the speakers got up and said this mandate is unconstitutional, so he also wants to deny the fact that the Supreme Court of the United States has specifically said it is constitutional. But it doesn't comport with your view; and, therefore, you reject it as you have rejected the results of the election.  Mr. Speaker, as the Representatives of 316 million Americans, we have a special obligation to see past the politics of the moment and embrace the spirit of cooperation for the sake of the public good, not our good, not our politics. Not a single one of us is here because we were thought to be the best at doing nothing or saying no. Each of us was sent here because our neighbors believe we have something positive to contribute, that we could do what is right for our country.
