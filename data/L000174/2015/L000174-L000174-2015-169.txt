President, it is with great appreciation and a touch of sadness that I note the pending retirement of Michael Schirling, who has served as police chief of the city of Burlington, VT, with great distinction for the last 7 years.  His youthful appearance belies the fact that Chief Schirling has been with the department for more than 25 years, first serving as an auxiliary officer while still attending the University of Vermont.  Chief Schirling has held many titles over those years: patrol officer, detective, investigator, director, commander, deputy chief, and finally chief. In other words, this Burlington native rose through the ranks. And throughout this impressive career, Chief Schirling has always sought a better way to do the job.  Earlier in his career, he co-founded the Vermont Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, which recognized the potential for abuse as the Internet came of age. The task force has been critical to the investigation and prosecution of high-technology crimes that target those who are most vulnerable.  After he took reins of the department, Chief Schirling grew concerned that officers were spending too much time on paperwork and data entry, taking precious time away from policing. In response he designed his own dispatch and records management software system. The Valcour system--named after an island with historical significance on Lake Champlain--was launched in 2011. Not only has it proven more efficient, it has resulted in enormous cost savings for his department and others throughout Vermont that have since adopted it.  But perhaps most important, Chief Schirling has been a leader in understanding the importance of community policing. He stepped up foot patrols around the neighborhoods, stressing the importance of public engagement. He hosted community outreach events, including barbeques and monthly coffee sessions. He developed data-driven policing efforts to track the hot spots for crime. He implemented a street outreach program in coordination with the local mental health agency. The list goes on, but it is fair to say that the work of Chief Schirling will leave its mark on our State's largest city for many years to come. Chief Schirling recognized the value of 21st century policing long before we heard the term. For these reasons, I have often called on Chief Schirling to share his experience and ideas in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. His guidance on issues of critical importance, including his support for the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Program, has been invaluable over these years.  Chief Schirling and the Burlington Police Department recently marked the 150th anniversary of the department, and I was grateful to be a part of that celebration. As he prepares for retirement, I have no doubt there is another chapter for Chief Schirling still to be written. I will eagerly await his next move.                          ____________________
