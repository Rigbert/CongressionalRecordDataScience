 Twenty minutes.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will not use that. I understand Senator Domenici is lurking and may be available to offer his amendment. And there is a little more debate on the Burma amendment. And we may well stack three votes for around 6 o'clock, or thereabouts, just to give an overview of where we are.  Let me say, Mr. President, with regard to the Dorgan amendment, the Clinton administration is strongly opposed to the amendment on the grounds that human rights and democracy are relevant criteria but not the only criteria about which arms sales should be evaluated. Regional security and stability may be overriding considerations in making a decision to proceed with a transaction. Arms transfers serve key foreign policy concerns and no single issue can be the only or primary consideration.  Let me give you an example, Mr. President. The amendment could well cut off the transfer of arms to key allies in the Middle East, for example, or in central Europe. And so the question arises, is this really in our best interest to make this kind of certification process a precondition for the transfer of arms to key allies?  So, Mr. President, I hope that the amendment will not be approved. Rarely do I find myself speaking on behalf of the Clinton administration, but my suspicion is that any administration would be opposed to this, that it would not be in our Nation's best interests.  I hope that the amendment will not be agreed to.  Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back the balance of my time, if I can locate Senator Domenici. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
