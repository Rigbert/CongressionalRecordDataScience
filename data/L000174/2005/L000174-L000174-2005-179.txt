President, I rise to express my strong concern regarding the political and economic situation in Haiti and the effect this will have on the upcoming elections in that country. The events of the last few months in Haiti have been dispiriting for those who have long sought stability and progress in that country. Due to the precarious political and security situation in Haiti, the question must be raised; can free and fair elections be carried out in Haiti on schedule? Or should they be postponed until we can guarantee a more favorable environment for legitimate elect to take place?  Nearly a year and a half has passed since President Aristide was removed from power and since then the country has continued to spiral downward into worsening poverty and political violence. The interim government of Prime Minister Gerard Latortue has failed to deliver stability and economic progress and for the fourth time this year, has postponed the date of the elections. Presently, elections are planned for December 15 and there is widespread concern that, if held, these elections will be anything but open, inclusive or fair.  Currently, the political and social climate in Haiti is not conducive for credible elections to take place. The Haitian people are largely ignorant about the electoral system and detached from the process. Out of a total of 4.5 million eligible voters approximately 870,000 people have actually registered, with supporters of the Lavalas Party--a large portion of the electorate--threatening to boycott. According to reports, voter registration stations have been placed in less than 500 locations in contrast with the 5,000 stations available under the Aristide administration.  Citizens are disenchanted over the lack of jobs, miserable government services, and rampant violence. As the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, four out of five Haitians live on less than $2 a day and nearly half of the children in the country are malnourished. In the last year, there have been almost 800 killings and criminal and political kidnappings by urban armed gangs have reached historic levels. Only recently, after a shaky start, theUnited Nations Stabilization Mission, MINUSTAH, has been making modest progress in preventing even greater levels of violence. But the security situation in Haiti remains volatile.  Equally as troubling is our own government's seeming indifference to the deteriorating situation in Haiti. Several weeks ago, Secretary of State Rice flew into Port-au-Prince for a 5 hour visit that amounted to little more than a photo op. The situation there is fragile and demands immediate action and will require a long-term international commitment.  Haiti's capacity to hold credible elections needs to be given serious consideration by the interim government, Bush administration and United Nations. While the Haitian constitution grants a new administration to be sworn in to office by February 7, 2006, the stakes are too great to push forward an election simply to adhere to an arbitrary date. If the consensus is that political and social conditions could be improved in the next 3 to 6 months, and there are serious problems that threaten the legitimacy of this election, we owe it to the people of Haiti to take the time necessary to work to address these problems so that the election is as fair as possible.  The next few weeks present a seminal period for the Haitian people and the future of Haiti. Enormous logistical, political, and security obstacles need to be overcome if Haiti is to have elections with any semblance of credibility. There are very few options left for a country that is already teetering on the brink of state failure and cannot afford to lose much more. We must keep the best interests of the Haitian people in mind and do everything in our power to create the conditions necessary for Haiti to take the next step in transitioning toward democratic stability.                          ____________________[Pages S11913-S11914]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                           ELECTIONS IN HAITI
