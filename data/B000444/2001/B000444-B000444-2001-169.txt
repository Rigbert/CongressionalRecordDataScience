 President, I thank the Senator. As usual, he is generous and gracious. He is, as everyone on both sides knows, one of the most gracious men who serves in this body. He is a gentleman with a backbone like a ramrod. I take his comments to heart because I believe he means them. It means a lot to me that he does.  There are few things I have done in my 28-year career in the Senate that I believe has been more worthwhile, and that I am more proud of, than working with the law enforcement agencies of this country, getting them from 500,000 to over 600,000 in local law enforcement agencies.  I appreciate the sentiments expressed by my friend. I add, he was there every step of the way, voting for it, adding amendments, pushing it. I know he will be with me as we try to, quite frankly, prevent the President of the United States from eliminating that program. I am sure the President cares deeply about the safety of law enforcement officers in the country. I hope we can get his attention, to convince him that cutting the COPS Program in this upcoming budget is a mistake. I think once he focuses on that, we have a shot of doing that.  But, again, I thank my friend from Nevada. He is a real gentleman and a good friend. And I thank the Presiding Officer for listening. One of the things--I should not say this--I like best about the present occupant of the chair is, whenever I stand to speak in this Chamber--I am sure he does it for everybody--he looks and listens and acts as if he is paying attention, and it makes a big difference. He is not signing his mail. I know I am not supposed to say that, but I am going to say it anyway because I appreciate his courtesy, speaking of a gentleman.  I thank you all and yield the floor.                                 ______                                       By
