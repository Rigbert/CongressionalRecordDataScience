 President, I would like to inform my colleagues that I have lodged an objection to the Senate proceeding to H.R. 3211 or any other legislation dealing with financial netting contracts inside and outside of bankruptcy. While I support these changes to financial netting, I strongly believe that these changes must be enacted as a part of the comprehensive bankruptcy reform bill. I would hate to see the opponents of bankruptcy reform our financial markets at risk solely to satisfy the ideological objections of some members of Congress.  My advice to those advocates of a netting-only bill is that if they would put as much effort into getting the entire bankruptcy bill passed as they have put into the separate netting bill, the netting provisions would have been law months ago.                          ____________________
