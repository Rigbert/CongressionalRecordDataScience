Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution. This routine concurrent resolution will create, as the chairman has said, the customary joint committee of this Congress to prepare for the inauguration of the 43rd President and the 46th Vice President of the United States on January 20, 2001.  The joint committee will consist of three Senators and three Representatives who will plan the ceremony transferring the highest office in the land to the person chosen as our next chief executive.  That simple but elegant, dignified ceremony is the grandest in our national life, and symbolizes our commitment to peaceful, democratic self-governance. The chairman correctly pointed out that ours is the longest-standing democracy in history. That transfer of power is a magnificent testimony to the people of the United States and our commitment to democracy.  I urge all Members to support the resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
