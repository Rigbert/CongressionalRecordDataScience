 I now understand that with the final resolution, I will not be able to vote for it, as I assume others in the Vermont delegation will not. I am afraid that it creates an impossible bargain. It averts a government shutdown at the expense of our overall national interests.  This year, Congress spent most of its time negotiating three rounds of deeper and deeper cuts in the current year's budget, an exercise in oftentimes misguided wheel-spinning which ignores the fact that discretionary spending is but a relative fraction of the overall budget while addressing some of the most pressing and urgent needs of ordinary Americans. Advocates paint this agreement in moral terms. I agree with them. Budgets are about our real priorities.  There is so much in this budget package that is inconsistent with basic Vermont and American values. Drastic cuts ending hunger programs for low-income women and children, elimination of Vermont's weatherization program, and cuts to economic development programs that grow jobs in my State of Vermont are not my idea of prudent sacrifices. There is no moral credit to Congress to cut vouchers for homeless Vermont veterans who served their country honorably, nor does Congress cover itself in glory by denying first-generation Vermonters help in going to college because of cuts to the TRIO Program. Is there moral good in eliminating housing counseling for low-income families facing foreclosure or slashing small stipends for seniors who are on Meals on Wheels? The estimates of these cuts in my little State range as high as $150 million--a tremendous burden at a time when we face the worst time since the Great Depression.  The reason we are here, as a column pointed out very well in our national papers yesterday, is because even though we had an agreement to pass an omnibus bill last December, at the last minute, those on the other side of the aisle who had agreed on that reneged, and of course we were not able to get the 60 votes necessary in the Senate.  I had supported that omnibus budget bill even though there were enormous cuts in it. It would have enacted tens of billions of dollars in carefully drawn, reasonable reductions below the White House budget proposal. The distinguished Senator from Hawaii had worked very hard and encouraged us to make cut after cut after cut. We all agreed with him. I agreed with him. It was in the omnibus. And if that had passed, we would not be here. But because those who had agreed to support it changed their minds at the last minute, it killed the omnibus bill and it forced the Congress into a series of stopgap funding bills and now into a slapdash continuing resolution.  In addition to the cuts in the omnibus bill, I also supported reductions of billions more, and I voted for billions of dollars in cuts and short-term reductions in the continuing resolutions earlier this year.  Now, some who tout this round of cuts as the most important and as the largest cuts in discretionary spending in history are the same ones who pushed through hundreds of billions of dollars of tax cuts to companies that ship jobs overseas--American jobs overseas--greatly adding to the profits of our oil companies that are now charging us $4 a gallon for gas and more; pushed through for multimillionaires, many of whom said they did not want the tax cuts--pushed it through nonetheless.  The correlation between those spending cuts and those unfunded tax cuts is direct. It is unflattering to the proponents of both initiatives.  Frankly, I am tired of being lectured on fiscal sanity from those who voted for an unnecessary war in Iraq, saying that is because of 9/11, even though, as we know from every single report that has come out, Iraq had absolutely nothing to do with 9/11. But we spent $1 trillion, thousands of American lives, tens of thousands of other peoples lives in Iraq, and then, for the first time in the history of this country, instead of paying for a war, as we always have in the past, we say: Oh, no, we will borrow the money. And by the way, we will give you a tax cut too.  So who paid for that war in Iraq? The men and women who valiantly fought there and their families who waited, wondering if they would come back alive, broken, or dead, and often were given the worst and grimmest news. They are the only ones who sacrificed. Everybody else got a tax cut, and we borrowed the money from China and everywhere else to pay for a war we should have never been in, and $1 trillion later, 10 years later, we are still spending tens of billions of dollars there.  Some corporations--some others made a lot of money; we did not. And then we spend another 8 or 9 years that we should not have been in Afghanistan doing the same thing--borrowing the money for that.  It seems that our soldiers paid a great burden, and the American people paid a great burden. But boy, somemade out like bandits. I don't want any lectures from those who gave the bandits their bag of gold.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
