 President, I rise to speak in strong support of S. 1103, the legislation before the Senate to extend the term of Robert Mueller, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  This is an important piece of legislation because without it, Director Mueller's term will end very soon, as he completes his 10 years in office.  That would leave the FBI, the Nation's leading law enforcement agency and the lead intelligence agency for domestic counterterrorism, without a Director as we approach the 10th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks.  This would be unacceptable in my view. Unfortunately, unanimous consent to pass this legislation, S. 1103, is being held up. I urge my colleagues to approve this bill quickly.  Earlier this year, the President conducted a search for a replacement for Director Mueller. He determined that the best choice for the nation, at this critical time, was not to replace him, but rather to seek a legislative extension to Director Mueller's term.  The Judiciary Committee held a hearing with Director Mueller on June 8, 2011, and has considered the text of this legislation, S. 1103. Under a proposed unanimous consent agreement circulated earlier this month, passage of this legislation would be followed by the President's formal nomination of Mr. Mueller for an additional 2 years, and the nomination will be placed directly on the Senate's Executive Calendar.  I do not know of any Senator who does not respect and support Director Mueller. Over the past 10 years that he has been in office, Robert Mueller has provided steady leadership and stability at the FBI. He has worked to transform the Bureau into an agency that can better detect and prevent terrorist attacks against the United States.  Under Mueller's direction, the FBI has played an essential role in more than 20 significant counterterrorism operations, while infiltrating and arresting groups of individuals charged with planning attacks against our country.  The FBI has also built its cyber investigation capability, focused on counterintelligence, investigated public corruption cases, and tracked and disrupted gang activity.  Despite the major setback of the September 11 attacks, the FBI is among our most respected government institutions, and it has changed dramatically to respond to the challenges of our time.  Let me talk about Director Mueller for a moment, who is, personally, a symbol of integrity and dedicated public service. I am very pleased to call him my friend, and thank him for his willingness to continue to serve for another 2 years.  I recognize that there were good reasons that Congress placed a term limit on the Director of the FBI. History has shown that the position, and the FBI, wield enormous powers and that the Bureau should not have a director for life.  The legislation before us recognizes that concern, and creates a one-time extension that would only apply to Director Mueller. Future FBI Directors would still be limited to a 10-year term.  Extending Director Mueller's term at the FBI for an additional 2 years will ensure the evolution of the FBI continues. It will provide important stability to the President's national security team during this sensitive and challenging time and while it is otherwise going through important leadership changes.  This summer Leon Panetta has succeeded Robert Gates as Secretary of Defense, and GEN David Petraeus has been confirmed to be the next Director of the CIA, but because he is transitioning out of Afghanistan, General Petraeus won't arrive at Headquarters in Langley until after Labor Day.  We are seeing changes in major military commands, and changes in the Joint Chiefs of Staff are coming soon. Also, the Senate Intelligence Committee, which I have the honor of chairing, is now considering the nomination of Matt Olsen to be the Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, NCTC, because Mike Leiter stepped down as the head of NCTC on July 8.  So in the midst of this change, Director Mueller will be an experienced, steady hand among the President's national security advisers. The American people will be well-served having him in place.  I support the legislation and urge its adoption. Now is not the time to keep it from passing.                          ____________________
