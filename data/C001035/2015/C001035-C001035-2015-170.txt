President, the question really comes down to this: Do we want provider services to homeless and runaway youth to be able to turn away at the door a 13-year-old girl simply because of her sexual orientation? That is what this comes down to, and I think the answer is no if that provider is receiving Federal funds. It shouldn't matter, and we should be willing to stand and say that we want to help all youth stay out of the clutches of these truly evil sex traffickers. That is what this is about.
