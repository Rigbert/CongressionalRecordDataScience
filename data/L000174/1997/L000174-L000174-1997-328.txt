President, the whole purpose of the independent counsel law--to get politics out of the process of investigating politically potent matters--has been severely undercut recently by partisan efforts to bully the Attorney General into appointing an independent counsel to investigate fundraising activities in the 1996 Presidential campaign. In fact, some Republicans in Congress have threatened that if Janet Reno refuses to do what they want, she will be investigated and her job will be at stake.  This marks a new low in the politicization of the independent counsel process. These threats demean our system of justice and, I fear, undermines public confidence in all branches of government.  Continued politicization of the independent counsel process will be the death knell for this law. The American people already have legitimate questions about how much independent counsels cost, how long they take, and how this law is working. By last count, independent counsels have cost taxpayers a total of over $125 million. Whitewater counsel Ken Starr alone has already spent over $22 million. We still have an independent counsel investigating matters from the Reagan administration.  Suspicions about the role of partisan politics in the selection of so-called independent counsels are already strong. A Reagan-appointed Chief Justice, who served in the Nixon administration, appointed a staunchly Republican judge to the selection panel that, after meeting in secret, appointed partisan Republican Kenneth Starr to investigate Whitewater.  If the results of independent counsel investigations cannot be trusted because they are tainted by partisan politics, we will not be able to justify the costs of this law.  That is why I am commending Senator Durbin for his work on this bill. It takes important steps to begin restoring public confidence in the process by which independent counsels are selected. Specifically, the bill sets term limits for the three judges who serve on the Special Division of the D.C. Circuit division that appoints the independent counsel. Under current law, these judges serve for 2-year terms. However, all of them are on at least their second 2-year term. The legislation would prohibit a judge, including the current panel, from serving more than 2-year terms.  In addition, the bill would allow sunshine on the selection of independent counsels and the results of independent counsel investigations. What criteria does the Special Division use to select independent counsels? Do they look for trial experience, prosecutorial experience or political experience? The bill places the Special Division that selects independent counsels under the authority of the Circuit Judicial Council and requires that the Council promulgate within 6 months rules of practice for the Division. These rules would specify the procedure for selection of an independent counsel. This is important so everyone will know what qualifications the Special Division uses to evaluate candidates. Public procedures should also open up the process so that appropriate candidates know how to apply for independent counsel positions when openings occur. This is too important a process to be decided by political cronies over lunch.  The bill would also require that the Court catalog and preserve independent counsel reports and make public versions available upon request.  This bill is not a cure-all for the problems we have seen with the independent counsel law. But this is a good start.  Mr. President, the whole purpose of the independent counsel law--to get politics out of the process of investigating politically potent matters--has been severely undercut recently by partisan efforts to bully the Attorney General into appointing an independent counsel to investigate fundraising activities in the 1996 Presidential campaign. In statement after statement by otherwise responsible Members of Congress, they tell her how she should use here discretion and how she should make up her mind, before she even has an opportunity to do so. Some Republicans in Congress have threatened that if Janet Reno refuses to do what they want, she will be investigated and her job will be at stake.  Basically, the American people were asked last night to make this choice: Would they let the Speaker of the House, Mr. Gingrich, determine what the ethics rules should be, or would they rather allow the Attorney General of the United States, Janet Reno to follow the law and investigate whether crimes have occurred?  Frankly, I am very confident in allowing Attorney General Reno to proceed. She has done a pretty darn good job so far. She calls them as she sees them and has been a very straightforward Attorney General.  I hope that everybody, whether in this body or the other body, will stop trying to substitute their ethical standards and political judgment as to what should be done and allow the Attorney General, who sticks to a very strong ethical standard, to follow and enforce the law. I believe the statements seeking to intimidate the Attorney General mark a new low in the politicization of the independent counsel process.                                 ______                                       By
