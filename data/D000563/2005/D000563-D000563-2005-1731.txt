President, I have offered this amendment before. It has passed the Senate twice. For some reason, as soon as it passes the Senate and goes to a conference committee, it disappears, it dies. I don't understand it. It seems that the Senate by overwhelming numbers supports the concept of this amendment, but somewhere, either in the executive branch of this Government or in the House of Representatives, there is opposition to this amendment.  When I explain the amendment and what it does, you may be as puzzled as I am. Here is what the amendment says in a few words: If you are a Federal employee who is activated to serve in either a Guard or Reserve unit, the Federal Government will make up the difference in pay while you serve.  That is it. You understand, I am sure, as we all do, that we have thousands of men and women across America who are members of Guard and Reserve units who are now being activated and deployed overseas for extended periodsof time, interrupting their daily lives and putting some hardship on their families and their businesses, but they serve their country. We find that many employers have decided to do not only the right thing but the patriotic thing and have said: We will stand behind our employees. If they are going to serve America, we will make up any loss of pay which they experience during the period of their service activation.  It is something we all applaud. In fact, the President has given speeches about it. There are not too many Senators who have not given speeches applauding those employers who stand behind these Guard families and Reserve families.  It turns out, when we look at all the employers across America, there is one notable omission. The U.S. Government does not make up the difference in pay between the guardsmen and reservists who are activated. So you find many Federal employees going off to serve our country are serving next to someone from the private sector who has the helping hand of their employer while those employees of our Federal Government are being disadvantaged.  America's Federal employees are a valuable asset to our Nation, not just in the public service they perform every day to keep America's Government going but today about 120,000 Federal employees serve America as well in the National Guard or Reserve--120,000. Indeed, about 17,000 have been mobilized and deployed overseas as I speak--17,000 Federal employees. Unfortunately, their employer, the U.S. Federal Government, lags behind leading businesses and States and local governments, which provide support to their workers who are activated. The Federal Government does not.  The amendment I propose is an opportunity to correct this shortcoming, update the Federal Government's support for these workers, and keep pace with the high standards set by other employers. For many years now every employer in America has had to consider how to respond to having workers activated in the Guard and Reserve. In times of peace, companies must accommodate staffing, schedule duties for the requirement for workers to be sent for training or drills. The law requires that they do this, and they follow the law.  In wartime, however, workers can be called away for duty for months, sometimes even years. It is a big challenge for employers.  How are they responding? What we have seen since 9/11 is that America's business communities and State and local governments not only provide the employment and reemployment protections required by law, but many of them go above and beyond requirement and patriotically provide even greater benefits and protections for their workers mobilized for duty in the Guard and Reserve. Many of these same businesses and State and local governments continue health insurance and fringe benefits for the families of those Guard and Reserve soldiers who are overseas. Some provide continued full salary for a few months, and more and more employers make up the difference in lost pay that the workers suffered during mobilization.  Covering the pay gap is an important benefit because some Reserve component members suffer a loss of income during mobilization. A recently released Department of Defense study in May of 2004 reveals that 51 percent of the members of our National Guard and Reserve suffer a loss of income when mobilized for long periods of active duty because military pay is less than pay in their civilian jobs. The average reservist loses $368 a month. That calculates out to about $4,300 a year in income. For many families, that $368 a month has a significant impact. Not only must they deal with the absence of someone they love but now on top of it must also tighten the family financial belt a notch or two and endure a decline in perhaps their standard of living, pressure on the family back home, and certainly more pressure on the soldier who worries about them as they serve our country overseas.  While the average monthly income loss was $368, the DOD Status of Forces Survey found that some reservists were losing a lot more. Eleven percent of all reservists report losing income of more than $2,500 a month, $30,000 a year for the year that they are activated and deployed. That is a huge sacrifice to make in the service of your country on top of risking your life every single day.  The Department of Defense operates a program called Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve--ESGR for short. Its purpose is to help employers understand and comply with the new law regarding protections for members of the Reserve. The program highlights and recognizes those employers who do more than the law requires, particularly those who are supportive of the Guard and Reserve.  To publicize these outstanding employers, ESGR lists them on their Web site. If you scroll down the Web site, you will see listed more than 1,000 companies across America, nonprofit organizations, State and local governments, all of which stand behind their Guard and Reserve while the Federal Government does not. Of those that are listed, more than 900 are saluted for providing pay differential. Think of it: 900 companies, 900 units of government that say, We will stand behind that soldier, we will make up the difference in pay.  On the first page, you will see 3M, A.G. Edwards, Abbot Laboratories, ADT Security Service, and Aetna. That is just the beginning. If you scroll down, you will see ICBM. I am proud to say you will see Sears & Roebuck from my State of Illinois, General Motors, United Parcel Service, and Ford Motor Company. In my State of Illinois, not only Sears but Boeing, State Farm Insurance, the State of Illinois, the city of Chicago, and many other Illinois companies, local governments, and institutions cover the pay differential for Reserve and Guard members called to active duty.  More and more American employers are providing a pay differential benefit to their workers who are mobilized for active duty. The number of ``outstanding employers'' recognized on the ESGR Web site for providing pay differential has been steadily growing. Even as the war goes on, more and more companies are stepping up for their people. They are stepping up in the private sector for their employees. How can we in the Federal Government do anything less? While the major employers in America are rushing to support the guardsmen and reservists, our Federal Government has not done so.  In a recently released DOD survey, they asked Reserve component members what factors they took into consideration before they decided to leave the National Guard and Reserve.  Let me show you that list. First, as I mentioned earlier, 51 percent of those in the Reserve who are activated lose income when they are mobilized, and 11 percent lose more than $2,500 per month.  I also mentioned this Web site. The employer-supported Guard and Reserve Web site based out of Arlington, VA, has a long list of over 1,000 employers who helped their activated Guard and soldiers, and 900 of them have provided pay differential for indefinite periods of time, some for 12 months and some for 6 months. But they are standing behind their Guard and Reserve units.  When you take a look at the number of outstanding employers who are making a greater sacrifice for their members of Guard and Reserve units, look at what happened since October of 2003. The number of employers making the pay differential for their employees called to Reserve duty has been increasing. But the U.S. Government is still not one of them. They ask the members of the Reserve and Guard: Why didn't you re-up, why didn't you reenlist? Here are the reasons they gave in a survey: 95 percent said it was too great a family burden, 91 percent said too many activations and deployments, 90 percent said activations-deployments are too long, and 78 percent said income lost.  This is a factor in retention and recruitment. It is a factor in the lifestyles of these families of Guard and Reserve unit members.  How can we come before this Congress asking for additional funds for the soldiers overseas and overlook the obvious? The Federal Government is not providing its share of helping these same soldiers. How can we throw bouquets, as we should, to all of these other employers who meet their responsibility and fail to meet our own?  With recruiting numbers falling short in virtually every branch of service, we need to do everything we can tolessen the burden. By ensuring Federal employees, if they are mobilized, that their families will not have to endure loss of income, we can help reduce one of the major factors that drive people away from the Guard and Reserve.  This measure is not only good employee support, it is not only in keeping with the standards established by other leading employers, it is not only the patriotic thing to do, it is prudent management of our Reserve component forces. Reserve component soldiers face different family and professional situations than Active-Duty soldiers. They must not only perform military duties in addition to their civilian career, they have to shift back and forth between these two responsibilities.  Additionally, these Reserve component soldiers bring to their military service something special: all of their accumulated civilian time and civilian career experience.  In Iraq, thanks to Guard and Reserve forces, we have experienced teachers, construction supervisors, civil administrators, engineers, professionals over a wide range of skills, skills particularly helpful in rebuilding that ravaged nation. This derives from the unique nature of the Reserve component service and its value to the nation we must protect.  This provision has already passed the Senate twice. In October 2003, it was agreed to by vote of 96 to 3 as an amendment to the supplemental for fiscal year 2004. In June of 2004, it was agreed to by a voice vote as an amendment to the national defense authorization bill. On both occasions, I watched as this measure went into the bipartisan conference committee and disappeared. Apparently someone is opposed to the Federal Government making up the difference in pay for activated Guard and Reserve soldiers. The same Government that is praising businesses for doing this is deep-sixing this provision when it comes time to consider it in the conference committees.  I have just been handed a letter from the Reserve Officers Association of the United States. I am happy to report it to my colleagues in the Senate.       The Reserve Officers Association, representing 75,000      Reserve component members, supports your amendment to the      emergency supplemental appropriation to provide an income      offset for mobilized Federal employees.  I might add that it goes on to quote an Army Times article dated March 7, 2005, entitled ``Compensating for lost pay a bad idea, reserve head says.'' It inferred in this article that a Reserve pay differential would be unfair to Active-Duty troops.  This retired Major General Mcintosh goes on to say:       It is a shame that it is considered OK for Reservists to      accept year-after-year pay losses during mobilization on top      of the losses from missed promotions, missed contributions to      a retirement account, missed incremental pay increases with      their civilian job.       Helping to maintain the financial health of our military      positively affects everyone by ensuring a strong economic      position for the country.  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                      Reserve Officers Association                                         of the United States,                                   Washington, DC, April 12, 2005.     Hon. Richard J. Durbin,     U.S. Senate,     Washington DC.       Dear Senator Durbin: The Reserve Officers Association,      representing 75,000 Reserve Component members, supports your      amendment to the emergency supplemental appropriation, SR      109-052, to provide an income offset for mobilized federal      employees.       The Guard and Reserve face financial challenges whenever      they are mobilized and ROA continues to hear stories of lost      businesses, increasing credit card debt, and families forced      to sell their homes. Many employees pay the difference      between the civilian and military salary for mobilized      Reservists; yet one of the largest employers, the federal      government, does not.       In the Army Times Article, ``Compensating for lost pay a      bad idea, reserve head says'', dated March 7, 2005, it was      inferred a reserve pay differential would be unfair to      active-duty troops. It is a shame that it is considered okay      for Reservists to accept year-after-year of pay losses during      mobilization on top of the losses from missed promotions,      missed contributions to a retirement account, missed      incremental pay increases with their civilian job.       Helping to maintain the financial health of our military,      positively affects everyone by ensuring a strong economic      position for the country. Congressional support for our      nation's military men and women in the Guard and Reserve is      and always will be appreciated.           Sincerely,                                           Robert A. McIntosh,                                       Major General (Ret), USAFR,                                               Executive Director.
