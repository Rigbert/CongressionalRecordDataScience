Mr. Chairman, it is impossible for me to support this legislation. It is not constitutional, it is not just, and it is not fair.  This bill would strip hundreds and thousands of Federal employees of their labor protections. It would deprive hundreds of millions of American citizens of their civil liberties and fundamental rights.  This bill is nothing less than a power grab by our President and this administration. It would be the largest consolidation of power in recent American history.  By denying our citizens their basic rights, but giving this administration overwhelming power, this bill would effectively declare Marshall law. It would violate the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.  Even the name--``Homeland Security'' conjures images of Banana Republics where individuals rights are a mere afterthought. This is America. Our government does not deny our citizens fundamental rights in the name of homeland security. We are greater than that. We are better than that.  As Thomas Jefferson said, ``the price of freedom is eternal vigilance.'' My Colleagues, let us heed the warning of the author of our Bill of Rights. It is time to be vigilant. Now is the time to stand up for all of our citizens. Now is the time to do what is right.  Do not deny our people their fundamental rights. Vote ``no'' on this ill-conceived bill.
