 President, I rise today on behalf of myself and Senator Boxer to introduce the Water Transfer Facilitation Act of 2009.  The measure should reduce unnecessary delays in water transfers at a time when Central Valley farmers have been hard hit by a 3-year drought. It would allow new water transfers of roughly 250,000 to 300,000 acre-feet of water per year, depending on the rainfall that year.  Here is how the bill would work: it would grant new authority to the Bureau of Reclamation to approve water transfers between sellers and buyers in the San Joaquin Valley. The measure also would streamline environmental reviews for Central Valley water transfers by ensuring that they occur on a programmatic basis, instead of project-by-project basis as is current practice.  Here is why we need this bill: this past water year, South of Delta agriculture users received 10 percent of their contractual allocation from the Central Valley Project. At the same time others in the San Joaquin Valley, such as the Friant Division and the exchange contractors, had a surplus of water and were willing to sell some of their water to Westlands Water District, where fields have been fallowed and communities have close to 40 percent unemployment--yet there were serious obstacles to making those transfers happen.  That is why I am introducing this bill. It will address those obstacles.  Specifically, the bill will do three things to ease the drought crisis:  First, it would authorize transfers within San Joaquin Valley between Divisions of the Central Valley Project and among contractors within a Division by removing two of the biggest obstacles to these transfers.  Water users tell me that the Bureau of Reclamation has not allowed transfers of water if the water could have been used for irrigation or stored, or if the total amount of water transferred was more than what had been received on average the 3 years prior to 1992. These two conditions previously prevented a whole host of potential transfers of water.  Neither of these restrictions is necessary for environmental reasons, and removal of these two obstacles alone could make up to 100,000 or 150,000 acre-feet of water available for transfer to the communities most in need, according to the Bureau of Reclamation.  So, this bill would explicitly grant the Bureau the authority to approve these types of East-West transfers, as long as they qualify under environmental regulations.  Second, the bill directs the Department of the Interior to facilitate transfers from the Sacramento Valley to the San Joaquin Valley by doing programmatic consideration of all the environmental concerns, rather than requiring individual review on each transfer as is current practice.  Water users and the Bureau of Reclamation estimate that this step could facilitate up to 150,000 or 200,000 acre-feet of transfers each year.  Third, the bill also requires the Bureau of Reclamation to prepare a report and recommendations on how to facilitate transfers more efficiently and expeditiously, including transfers in all directions and between the state and federal projects.  The bill is supported by a great number of water users across the Central Valley, including: Friant Water Users Authority; San Joaquin River Exchange Contractors Authority; Delta-Mendota Canal Authority; Westlands Water District; Metropolitan Water District; Glen Colusa Irrigation District; Northern California Water Association; Banta-Carbona Irrigation District; Tehama-Colusa Canal Authority; Association of California Water Agencies; Placer County Water Agency; Conaway Preservation Group; Reclamation District 2035; and San Luis Water District.  Companion legislation is also being introduced today by Representatives Costa and Cardoza in the House of Representatives.  There is no question that the drought and federal pumping restrictions have had huge impacts on Central Valley Agriculture.  Nearly 500,000 acres of fields have been fallowed. Fields of fruit and nut trees have been stumped and uprooted. Some farmers simply chose to forego planting their row crops at all.  The agricultural industry estimates that about $700 million in revenues have been lost.  About 21,000 agriculture jobs have been lost, nearly all in San Joaquin Valley.  For example, Mendota unemployment is currently 37.4 percent.  Workers who once tended America's ``bread basket'' are now standing in bread lines.  The impacts are not limited to agriculture:  Urban areas like Los Angeles are imposing rate hikes for non-conserving households, limiting lawn irrigation, and other conservation measures.  Municipal industrial users south of Delta are restricted to 60 percent of their contractual allocation.  The truth is that this crisis has been building for some time--and there are several causes to blame.  California's population is close to 40 million, but its water infrastructure hasn't been updated in three decades.  Due to groundwater pumping, the Central Valley lost 60 million acre-feet of groundwater since 1962.  This year, Federal agencies imposed pumping restrictions to protect endangered species--yet there is some misconception about the scope of these restrictions.  In 2009, roughly 25 percent of delivery shortages for farms and water users due to pumping restrictions, about 500,000 acre-feet.  The other 75 percent of the restrictions were due to lack of run-off, about 1.6 million acre-feet.  So, the drought is largely to blame for California's water shortages.  Invasive and non-native species are also a threat. The non-native striped bass, although a popular sport fish, are top predators on native fish like the smelt.  Pollution remains a problem, despite water quality standards. Ammonia discharge may be a problem from wastewater treatment discharge, and toxic insecticides accumulate and contribute to the deterioration of the ecosystem.  So, California's water crisis is a complicated issue that cannot be simply solved by saying ``Turn on the Pumps.''  It is clear that we need solutions for the Delta, both long-term and short-term.  I am working with my colleagues on both.  The bill we are introducing today will provide more flexibility in the system, allowing water to flow more freely around the Central Valley. Just this past water year, 600,000 acre feet were transferred around the Central Valley, and this bill will allow even more water to flow.  But transfers alone cannot provide the entire solution--they are costly, and they are still constrained by the pumping restrictions.  So this legislation is just one of several steps we are taking to provide timely relief to farmers in the San Joaquin Valley.  In the Energy and Water Appropriations bill, there is $10 million for the construction of short term projects that could provide more water supply or flexibility, including Two Gates and the Intertie.  We also provided funding for the science that will be relied on by the Bay Delta Conservation Plan--our best long-term option to restore the Delta and improve water supply.  We also included funding for water recycling projects, and are working to authorize more projects to help communities develop local water supplies based on groundwater and desalination.  Finally, there is $750,000 for the National Academy of Sciences review of the two biological opinions that currently govern water flows in the Central Valley. The independent scientific study, announced by Secretaries Salazar and Locke last week, should be completed within six months.  The National Academy study will assess whether there are other ways to provide the same protections for endangered species, while supplying more water to the drought-stricken Central Valley. And it will put to rest any lingering questions about whether pumping restrictions in the Delta are based on the best available science.  It is a critical step to moving forward with any near-term and long-term solutions for the Delta.  This bill we are introducing today is but one of several steps we are taking to address the water crisis in California.  We look forward to an early hearing on this bill, and working with others towards its passage and implementation. I thank Senator Bingaman for his commitment to hold an early hearing on the bill.  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the bill and the letters of support be printed in the Record.

Re ACWA support for Water Transfer Legislation.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.     Senator Barbara Boxer,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC       Dear Senators Feinstein and Boxer: Thank you for      introducing water transfer legislation for the Central Valley      Project (CVP) which ACWA is pleased to support. As      California's water supply challenges multiply, this      legislation can provide greater flexibility for management of      CVP water supplies. As you know, ACWA's 450 public agency      members are collectively responsible for 90 percent of the      water delivered in California for residential and      agricultural uses.       California's water supply situation is dire and worsening.      Three years of below average precipitation along with heavy      regulatory restrictions through the ESA and Biological      Opinions, have seriously diminished California's water      supplies. Under these conditions, it is essential that short      term actions, such as provided by your legislation to      flexibly enable water supplies to move across the San Joaquin      Valley, be pursued.       Again, thank you for introducing water transfer      legislation. ACWA looks forward to working with you to secure      its passage in an expedited manner.           Sincerely,                                                    Timothy Quinn,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                                 San Joaquin River                                              Water Authority,                                 San Joaquin, CA, October 5, 2009.     Re Support for Transfer Legislation for the Central Valley          Project.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the San Joaquin River      Exchange Contractors Water Authority (Exchange Contractors),      we thank you for introducing transfer legislation for the      Central Valley Project (CVP) and we support your efforts and      this legislation as a means of providing greater flexibility      for management of CVP water supplies.       The diminished water deliveries to the CVP as a result of      various regulatory restrictions, including the most recent      delta smelt and salmon Biological Opinions and three years of      below average precipitation statewide, have, as you know,      created a desperate situation in the San Joaquin Valley.       While long-term solutions are being sought, numerous short      term efforts are needed to help bridge the water supply gap      and great flexibility, as provided in your legislation, to      move water supplies within the San Joaquin Valley would be a      useful tool.       The Exchange Contractors consist of four member agencies      serving over 240,000 acres in the San Joaquin Valley in      Fresno, Madera, Merced, and Stanislaus Counties.       We look forward to engaging in this effort and working      closely with you and your staff in advancing this legislation      and addressing California water issues.           Sincerely,                                                  Steve Chedester,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                 Friant Water Users Authority,                                     Lindsay, CA, October 1, 2009.     Subject SUPPORT for Transfer legislation for the Central          Valley Project.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein, On behalf of Friant Water Users      Authority (Authority), we thank you for introducing transfer      legislation for the Central Valley Project (CVP) and we      support your efforts and this legislation as a means of      providing greater flexibility for management of CVP water      supplies.       The diminished water deliveries to the CVP as a result of      three years of below average precipitation amplified by      various regulatory restrictions, including the ESA and the      most recent delta smelt and salmon Biological Opinions, have,      as you know, created a desperate situation in the San Joaquin      Valley.       While long-term solutions are being sought, numerous short      term efforts are needed to help bridge the water supply gap      and greater flexibility, as provided in your legislation, to      move water supplies across the San Joaquin Valley would be a      useful tool: In addition, the legislation would help Friant      districts affected by the SJR Settlement improve management      of surface and groundwater supplies.       The Authority consists of nineteen member water, irrigation      and public utility districts. The Friant Service area      includes approximately one million acres and 15,000 mostly      small family farms on the east side of the southern San      Joaquin Valley (Madera, Fresno, Tulare and Kern County).      Friant Division water supplies are also relied upon by      several cities and towns, including the City of Fresno, as a      major portion of their municipal and industrial water      supplies.       We look forward to engaging in this effort and working      closely with you and your staff in advancing this legislation      and addressing California water issues.           Sincerely,                                               Ronald D.

Re Support for Central Valley Project water transfer          legislation.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of Placer County Water      Agency (PCWA), we thank you for introducing legislation      authorizing and establishing a programmatic approach to      promote and manage water transfers in California. We support      your efforts and this legislation as a means of providing      greater regulatory certainty for the management of Central      Valley Project (CVP) water supplies for water users.       As you may be aware, PCWA has participated in water      transfers in the past to help meet the needs of water users      within the CVP and is intimately aware of the impacts      diminished water deliveries cause to farmers and communities.      Because of PCWA's experience with previous water transfers,      we also would like an opportunity to meet you and your staff      to discuss additional regulatory improvements to Reclamation      law that would streamline future transfers.       Because of below average precipitation and regulatory      requirements placed upon the CVP and its water users through      the requirements established by the recent National Marine      Fisheries Service biological opinions for endangered smelt      and salmon, the impact to water users is severe. Your      legislation will provide much needed relief in the form of a      flexible and useful tool that will allow water to be      transferred from willing parties to those in need within the      State of California.       We look forward to working with you and your staff in the      coming months in this important legislative effort, and      appreciate your leadership in advancing this legislation and      addressing California water issues so important to our      collective future.           Sincerely,                                                  Graham L.

Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: The Metropolitan Water District of      Southern California is pleased to support the legislation you      are introducing related to water transfers for the Central      Valley Project (CVP). This legislation will help provide good      water management while providing flexibility for CVP      customers.       As a regional wholesale water provider, Metropolitan      provides water for nearly 19 million people throughout our      six-county service area in Southern California. As      Metropolitan and the entire state continue to address water      supply challenges throughout California, the vitality of our      economy and environment has been seriously affected. Your      proposed legislation will help address these critically      important issues.       Please let me know if we can be helpful in any way.           Sincerely,                                              Jeffrey Kightlinger,     General Manager.                                  ____                                               Northern California                                            Water Association,                                  Sacramento, CA, October 2, 2009.     Re support for water transfer legislation.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the Northern      California Water Association (NCWA), we thank you for      introducing legislation authorizing and establishing a      permanent long-term program to promote and manage water      transfers in the Central Valley of California. We support      your efforts and this legislation as a means of providing      greater flexibility in the management of Central Valley      Project (CVP) and other water supplies to help meet unmet      needs critical to the future of the State of California.       As you are aware, the devastating impacts of diminished      water deliveries to the CVP as a result of three years of      below average precipitation have been made even greater by      the various regulatory restrictions, including the      requirements established by the recent federal biological      opinions for endangered fish under the ESA. Your legislation      will provide immediate, much needed relief in the form of a      flexible and useful tool that will allow water to be      transferred from willing parties to those in need within the      CVP.       NCWA was formed in 1992 to present a unified voice working      to resolve California's water issues and protect the water      rights and supplies of the diverse Northern California      region, now and into the future. NCWA represents 54      agricultural water districts and agencies, private water      companies, and individual water rights holders with rights      and entitlements to the surface waters and groundwater      resources of the Sacramento Valley. Many of our members can      and will actively participate in this water transfer program.      The language in your legislation directing the Bureau of      Reclamation to work with other federal agencies to implement      the necessary long-term environmental processes addressing      impacts of a water transfer program on the ESA-listed Giant      Garter Snake will be imperative to its usefulness and      success.       We look forward to working with you and your staff in the      coming months in this important legislative effort, and      appreciate your leadership in advancing this legislation and      addressing California water issues so important to our      collective future.           Sincerely,                                                         Donn Zea,     President and CEO.                                  ____                                     Westlands Water District,                                      Fresno, CA, October 6, 2009.     Re Water Transfer Facilitation Act of 2009.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing on behalf of Westlands      Water District to express its support for your bill, the      Water Transfer Facilitation Act of 2009, authorizing certain      transfers of water in the Central Valley Project and other      purposes. Water transfers are a critical tool for providing      water supplies for areas that are faced with chronic water      supply shortages. However, the approval process for many      transfers often distract from their usefulness. Your      legislation will bring important reform to existing transfer      authorization thus increasing the efficacy of this essential      water management tool.       As you are keenly aware, the chronic water supply shortages      impacting the area of the San Joaquin Valley served by the      Central Valley Project demands that water users in the      affected area rely on water transfers. Moreover, the need to      transfer water is often urgent and in response to climactic      conditions that are frequently sporadic and ephemeral.      Regrettably, bureaucratic process can unnecessarily thwart      successful execution of a transfer. The clarity your      legislation brings to existing authorizations will only      improve the capability of water managers throughout the State      to effectively respond to the ongoing crisis and put our      scant water resources to use even more efficiently.       The westside of the San Joaquin Valley is inarguably the      most transfer dependent region of the State. Your efforts to      address this important matter are greatly appreciated. If      there is anything I can do to be of help in connection with      your efforts, please let me know.           Very truly yours,                                             Thomas W. Birmingham,     General Manager General Counsel.                                  ____                                        San Luis and Delta Mendota                                              Water Authority,                                   Los Banos, CA, October 5, 2009.

Dear Senator Feinstein, Senator Boxer, Mr. Cardoza, and Mr.      Costa: I am writing on behalf of the San Luis & Delta-Mendota      Water Authority to express our enthusiastic support for your      bill, the Water Transfer Facilitation Act of 2009,      authorizing certain transfers of water in the Central Valley      Project and other purposes. Water transfers are essential to      sound water management and often are time sensitive. Your      legislation will bring important reform to existing transfer      authorization thus increasing the efficacy of this essential      water management tool.       As you are keenly aware, coping with California's water      crisis and, in particular, the chronic water supply shortages      impacting the Central Valley Project demands utilization of      various best management practices including water transfers.      Moreover, the need to transfer water is often urgent and in      response to climactic conditions that are frequently sporadic      and ephemeral. Regrettably, bureaucratic process can      unnecessarily thwart successful execution of a transfer and      the best management of this all too precious resource. The      clarity your legislation brings to existing authorizations      will only improve the capability of water managers throughout      the State to effectively respond to the ongoing crisis and      put our scant water resources to use even more efficiently.       The Westside of the great San Joaquin Valley is inarguably      the most transfer dependent region of the State. Your efforts      to address this important matter as well as your vast      knowledge of and longstanding commitment to water resource      issues vital to the State are most deeply appreciated. If      there is anything I can do to be of further service to you in      this cause, please do not hesitate to call.           Very truly yours,                                                  Daniel G Nelson,                                               Executive Director.
