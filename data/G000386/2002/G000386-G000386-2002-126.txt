 Levin):  S. 2686. A bill to strengthen national security by providing whistleblower protections to certain employees at airports, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.  Mr. Grassley. Mr. President, I, along with Senator Levin, am pleased to introduce a bill, the Airport Employee Whistleblower Protection Act of 2002, that will enhance airport and air travel safety. It will do this by protecting all security screeners at all airports from reprisal for blowing the whistle on security violations, not just the select few who are currently protected. As my colleagues know, I have long believed that a good government is an accountable government, and whistleblower protection laws go a long way toward making government accountable.  This is particularly true when it involves our nation's security. Just recently we saw enlightening disclosures of massive systemic problems at the FBI by a whistleblower, Special Agent Rowley, that will no doubt lead to improvements and better security for Americans. Although Director Mueller has promised Special Agent Rowley that she will not be discriminated against because of her disclosures, whistleblower protection laws do not currently apply to the FBI, a problem that I'm trying to fix. Likewise, whistleblower protection laws do not currently protect many baggage screeners and x-ray technicians who witness security breaches.  In the Spring of 2000, Congress passed a law known as Air 21 that provided whistleblower protection to employees and contract employers to air carriers. At that time, when baggage screening was usually the responsibility of the airlines, screeners with whistleblower protection could alert their bosses or the Federal Aviation Administration about security violations. But that legislation didn't go far enough. That's because only employees of air carriers were protected from retribution under the law.  Under Air 21, security screeners employed by state or municipal governments, or regional airport authorities, had to rely on a patchwork of state whistleblower protection laws, or just the good sense of their employers, when they decided to blow the whistle on security breaches.  Worse still, when Congress passed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act last Fall, it specifically denied whistleblower protection to the new Federal baggage screeners. During the debates, I called for whistleblower protection for airport screeners because the best way to make an effective workforce is by creating an accountable government. But when Congress federalized the baggage screeners, it took Federal screeners out of the Air 21 air carrier whistleblower protections, and created a class of Federal contractors that perform security screening services, but are not covered by any whistleblower protections.  This legislation will fix these problems. First, the bill will ensure that until airport security screener personnel are fully federalized, all airport security screeners are given whistleblower protection, regardless of whether they're employed by air carriers, state or local governments, regional airport authorities, or contractors. Second, the bill will close the loophole in the law so that Federal baggage screeners receive protection under the same Whistleblower Protection Act that protects many other Federal employees, and so that contractors for the Federal government also will get whistleblower protection.  I note that the Secretary of the Department of Transportation has taken a good step toward supplying whistleblower protection to Federal screeners by signing a memorandum of understanding with the Office of Special Counsel, the office that enforces the Whistleblower Protection Act. The idea is that the OSC will agree to investigate cases of alleged whistleblower retaliation by the Transportation Safety Administration. But this agreement is not enough because it does not afford a right of appeal, so the TSA is free to ignore any OSC recommendation. Further, it does not provide whistleblower protection for contract screeners. Finally, unlike legislation, the agreement can be cancelled by either the TSA or the OSC on 90 day's notice. So the administration's agreement to provide whistleblower protection, though an admirable effort, is just not enough. We need statutory whistleblower protection for airport screeners.  In all my years of doing oversight, I have found that it's pretty rare for an agency to identify and fix its own problems, especially security problems. Most of the time, it takes a whistleblower or an Inspector General or a Congressional investigation to expose and fix security problems.  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to support the Airport Employee Whistleblower Protection Act of 2002 to improve security at our nation's airports. Let's close the loophole and give all security screeners whistleblower protection so that our nation's aviation system is more safe and secure.                                 ______                                       By.
