Chairman, where I come from, Midland Empire, which is where I have lived my whole life, is part of the South Coast Air Quality Basin, which has been a nonattainment ozone area for about as long as the Federal standard for ozone has existed. But it is not for a lack of trying, as the south coast has a long history--actually the longest history--of implementing some of the most stringent Air Pollution Control measures in the entire United States.  We have done about all we can to reduce emissions from stationary sources. Our issue is the amount of cars and trucks traveling through the region. So you will find no stronger advocate for clean air than myself, which is why this bill funds targeted Air Shed Grant Programs and DERA grants. States and communities need resources to help meet the overlapping 2008 and 2015 air quality standards.  To be clear, the language in the bill does not change ozone standards. It gives communities some administrative relief to allocate more resources to meeting the 2015 standard of 70 parts per billion.  Similar language, by the way, passed the House in July. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment to strike, and I reserve the balance of my time.
