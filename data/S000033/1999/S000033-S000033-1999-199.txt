 Speaker, I insert for the Record statements by high school students from my home State of Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people today. I am asking that you please insert these statements in the Congressional Record as I believe that the views of these young persons will benefit my colleagues.                          Financing Education(On behalf of James Lucas, Caitlin Stone-Bressor, Jesse Pixley and Kim                                 Junior)       Kim Junior: We are talking about financing our education.       Education is a paramount concern because it affects      everyone. Hilary Clinton said that it takes a village to      teach a child, and it does. Currently, the United States      educational system is going through a rebirth. Many states      are attempting to improve their education systems. Vermont      has recently shed itself of its old education system and has      donned a new, more equal method. This new educational plan,      led by Act 60, has helped equalize the percent a property      owner is taxed towards education.       Now that the state has money coming to the schools that are      in need of funding, the state, the school and the community      have to decide how they want to improve their school. The      consensus believes that better facilities will make better      schools. They think a new gym, arts center or a classroom      will make children more capable in that particular area. A      new building, however, does not change students.       Jesse Pixley: Teachers are needed to change students and      help them to become more educated. But to improve how      educators teach is difficult.       Many teachers feel that they are not competent. In a      January 29th New York Times article, William Honan said that      only one in five full-time public school teachers said they      felt qualified to teach in a modern classroom. This is a      scary revelation. There is a definite need to enhance the      qualifications of teachers and to help them gain sufficient      confidence to be able to teach.       The New York Times printed an article on April 23rd telling      of over 4,000 Washington teachers and educators who protested      because they are not being supported in their pursuit of      higher education. Deben Gruber, a special education teacher      in Highland School District, said ``I can't afford to have a      computer, the Internet or a newspaper anymore''. The teachers      in Washington were not given the opportunity, financially, to      attain a greater level of learning.       Caitlin Stone-Bressor: A recent addition for $75.9 million      is being added to the $159 million that is already promised      to school districts under the Education Reform Act. Of this      $76 million addition, only an eighth of it will be given to      teachers. The proposal also calls to give $4.2 million to      school nutrition programs. While school nutrition is      certainly important, America is setting its priorities in the      wrong position when it gives so much to food and so little to      educators.       Tenureship is also an important issue because it allows      unqualified teachers to keep teaching. Established because of      the frequent changes in the administration, it allowed      teachers to have faith that they would be able to keep their      jobs despite changes in authority. Yet the system is proven      to have flaws.       James Lukas: Many teachers who are granted tenureship are      not fully qualified. The school system then finds that it      would cost less to keep these teachers than to get rid of      them. The most prominent and meritorious suggestion to remedy      this problem is having teachers paid on the basis of skill      and quality, and not on seniority. The education system      should be run as a private enterprise, and if a teacher is      not making the standard, they should not be favored as well      as the teacher who excels in his or her area.       Reform is needed to improve our education system. The      current system needs to enhance teachers, special education,      advanced learning, sports, arts, and all the other aspects of      education to make sure Vermont's education system is as good      as it can be.                                       ____                  Freedom and Privacy Restoration Act (On behalf of Stacy Pelletier, Jessica Cole, Amy Clark, Sarah Kimball                          and Christine Miller)       Stacy Pelletier: Do you want the government of the U.S. to      be able to find out any information about you whenever they      want to? The proposed medical ID and the Know-Your-Customer      Act make your medical information open for their viewing and      allow banks and government to monitor your financial      transactions. Along with these two items, social security      numbers have become a huge violation of your privacy.      Luckily, the Freedom and Privacy Restoration Act of 1999      looks to make your private life private again.       Jessica Cole: We agree with the Freedom and Privacy      Restoration Act of 1999, which forbids the federal government      from making any identifiers which can be used in      investigating, monitoring, overseeing or regulating private      things, like sales or transactions between U.S. citizens. One      of these identifiers could be national ID cards.       If Congress doesn't take action, federal officials could      soon keep citizens from traveling, getting a job, opening a      bank account, or even getting medical treatment unless all      their papers are in order according to the federal      bureaucracy.       Amy Clark: One example of invasion of our privacy are      social security numbers. These identification numbers usually      have to be shown for anything from getting a job to getting a      fishing license. The Freedom and Privacy Restoration Act      prohibits the use of social security numbers as an      identifier. In order for parents to get a birth certificate      for their children and claim them as dependents, they are      forced to get a security number for them. We find that this      is abusing our right to privacy.       Sarah Kimball: In 1996, the Department of Health and Human      Services was told to come up with a unique health identifier.      Their proposed plan includes a giant database for the total      medical history of every American, and a medical ID card one      would have to show in order to fill a prescription, leave the      country, or even check into a hotel. The police could also      request to see this card at any time, and many fear that      hackers would break into the medical files, destroying      doctor-patient confidentiality.       Many of the problems presented are in violation of the      Fourth Amendment of the Constitution, but, thankfully, the      Freedom and Privacy Restoration Act would prohibit such an      act and identification tool from being put into action.       Christine Miller: In conclusion, we value our privacy,      which is violated by social security, medical cards, and      medical IDs, and the Know-Your-Customer Act.       Congressman Sanders, can we urge you to support the      legislation of the Freedom and Privacy Act in the future?                              Gay Marriage(On behalf of Vera Catherine Wade, Alex Hastings, Stephanie Ladd, John                         Nichols and Mark Boyle)       John Nichols: As Vera already said, we are all members of      the Gay-Straight Alliance at BFA. Namely, that is a group of      both gay and straight people, and our main purpose is to ease      some of the tensions that exist in high school life between      hetero and homosexual people that is sometimes the result of      perhaps ignorance and other such things that can easily be      mended.       However, the reason we are here today is, when we became      aware of the possibility of legislation in Vermont being      suggested that would ban gay marriage, we saw that as a great      concern, as infringing upon the rights of people of the      homosexual persuasion.       Vera Catherine Wade: The suggested antigay marriage bills      state that a valid marriage consists of a man and a woman. We      believe people should have the right to marry whomever they      choose. In the past, the question wasn't gender, it was race.      To deny anyone the right to marry is a step backwards in      equal rights to all peoples.       In addition, Who is to say what a good family is? A man and      a woman in an abusive relationship can bring a child into the      world without planning, and where is the child supposed to go      with that? A homosexual couple have no choice but to plan.       We aren't saying that everyone should get married, and we      aren't saying that it's the right thing for these people to      marry; we aren't encouraging anything but the right to marry      for everyone.       Mark Boyle: Another issue that's a really big problem for      homosexuals in many cases is the right to insure your      partner. Its okay for a man and a woman in a monogamous      relationship outside of wedlock to claim people on taxes or      their insurance, and yet it is not okay for homosexuals to      claim a partner as a person of their family, and it's not      allowed for them to get married so as to be able to include      them on any type of taxes or insurance.       The issue of having somebody choose what they want to do is      very at hand here. I think that a lot of people tend to stop      and think of this as a moral issue, when it is more of an      issue of just plain tolerance. You don't have to agree with      it or disagree with it or be part of it; all that you have to      do is to give people the opportunity to be Americans and to      be given the rights and privileges, and the expansion of      those privileges to any and all pursuits they choose, as long      as it is not infringing on the rights of other humans.                               ____________________
