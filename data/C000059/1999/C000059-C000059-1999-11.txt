Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise today to introduce the Shaw-Calvert-Gallegly amendment. It is a simple reform that would make candidates 100 percent accountable to the people they represent by controlling the source of campaign funds.  Unfortunately, some of our colleagues from Florida, including the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Shaw), have hurricane-force winds bearing down on their homes. Our prayers are with them and their constituents as they brace for Hurricane Floyd's impact.
