President, today Senator Barrasso and I are introducing legislation to reform the Minerals Management Service at the U.S. Department of Interior. Most Americans have probably never heard of the Minerals Management Service. At least they hadn't heard of it until the Inspector General of the Interior Department issued a report a couple of weeks ago documenting sordid details of MMS employees accepting gifts and dinners and drugs and sex from employees of the oil and gas companies they were supposed to be doing business with on behalf of American taxpayers.  The MMS is responsible for collecting over $10 billion a year in lease and royalty payments from companies that drill for oil and gas and mine coal and minerals on our Federal public lands, both onshore and offshore. MMS is also the agency that actually issues the leases for drilling to oil and gas companies off our coasts. And when you hear the call for more oil drilling just remember that it is MMS that's responsible for issuing those leases and making sure that oil and gas companies protect the environment and pay their fair share of royalties to the American people. And that should give everyone pause.  Two years ago, I stood here on the floor and spoke for several hours to draw the Senate's attention to the mismanagement of our offshore oil and gas leasing program involving MMS and the royalty relief program. The problem then was the failure of MMS to include a key clause in almost 1,000 leases that would have required oil and gas companies to pay the U.S. Treasury higher royalties if the price of oil and gas increased.  The law MMS was supposed to be implementing was originally written back in the mid-1990's when oil prices were low--around $15 a barrel, to encourage drilling by giving oil companies a break on paying royalties on new leases in the Gulf of Mexico. The royalties didn't kick in until the price of oil rose to a certain point where the companies would make a profit. Oil prices, as we now know, didn't stay low, but it turns out that ``royalty relief'' didn't phase out the way it should have. We learned that the MMS had bungled things so badly that they forgot to include provisions in their leases requiring any royalties on those particular leases.  At the time, the Government Accountability Office estimated that this single dereliction of duty--which covered leases issued between 1995 and 2000--would cost American taxpayers as much as $11.5 billion . . . and that was based on oil prices of between $50 and $70 dollars--half of what oil prices have been this year. GAO recently updated that amount to as much as $14.7 billion. We held hearings on this problem in the Energy Committee but the bottom line is that nothing has been done to fix this problem.  We have also learned from Inspector General and from agency whistleblowers that MMS has essentially stopped conducting audits of the billions of dollars of royalty payments it collects, and it has allowed oil and gas companies to improperly change the amount they owe by allowing them to self-report adjustments to their royalties affecting millions of dollars in payments.  Most recently, the Inspector General for the Department of Interior, Earl Devaney, has issued a report that details his office's criminal investigation into the Royalty-in-Kind program at the Minerals Management Service. Under the Royalty-in-Kind program, oil and gas companies are allowed to pay their royalties to the Federal Government not in dollars, but by physically delivering barrels of oil or cubic feet of gas to MMS. MMS, in turn, is responsible for selling that oil and gas and turning the proceeds over to the Treasury. The Inspector General found that instead of putting the American people first, employees of the RIK program put themselves first. Mr. Devaney's investigation, in his words, found ``a culture of ethical failure.''  I am not going to go through all of the sordid details of what the IG found, but I do ask unanimous consent to include his four page summary following my remarks.  The bottom line is that this is an agency that is broken and needs to be fixed. The legislation that Sen. Barrasso and I are introducing will start to fix it.  The legislation has five major components  It requires that the head of the MMS be appointed by the President and must be confirmed by the Senate. MMS is the only major bureau within the Interior Department that does not require its director to be confirmed by the Senate.  It requires MMS to implement a comprehensive audit program, including on-site financial audits of royalty payments.  It gives the Secretary of the Interior 60 days to implement all of the Inspector General's recommendations fromboth the May business practices report and the more recent September ethics report. If that deadline is not met, the Royalty-in-Kind (RIK) Program would be suspended.  It requires the Secretary to annually ``re-certify'' that the RIK program meets all Federal ethics and procurement laws and regulations. If that recertification is not completed, the RIK program would be suspended.  It directs the Inspector General to annually review the MMS program, including the RIK certification process.  I am pleased that Sen. Barrasso, the ranking Republican member of the Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests, which I chair, has agreed to be an original cosponsor of this bill. While it does not specifically address every single problem at MMS, it will begin to establish some basic accountability in an agency that has demonstrated that it has none.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a letter of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3556       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Devaney, Inspector General     Subject: OIG Investigations of MMS Employees       This memorandum conveys the final results of three separate      Office of Inspector General (OIG) investigations into      allegations against more than a dozen current and former      Minerals Management Service (MMS) employees. In the case of      one former employee, Jimmy Mayberry, he has already pled      guilty to a criminal charge. The cases against former      employees, Greg Smith and Lucy Querques Dennet, were referred      to the Public Integrity Section of the Department of Justice      (DOJ). However, that office declined to prosecute. The      remaining current employees await your discretion in imposing      corrective administrative action. Others have escaped      potential administrative action by departing from federal      service, with the usual celebratory send-offs that allegedly      highlighted the impeccable service these individuals had      given to the Federal Government. Our reports belie this      notion.       Collectively, our recent work in MMS has taken well over      two years, involved countless OIG human resources and an      expenditure of nearly $5.3 million of OIG funds. Two hundred      thirty-three witnesses and subjects were interviewed, many of      them multiple times, and roughly 470,000 pages of documents      and e-mails were obtained and reviewed as part of these      investigations.       I know you have shared my frustration with the length of      time these investigations have taken, primarily due to the      criminal nature of some of these allegations, protracted      discussions with DOJ and the ultimate refusal of one major      oil company--Chevron--to cooperate with our investigation.      Since you have already taken assertive steps to replace key      leadership and staff in the affected components of MMS, I am      confident that you will now act quickly to take the      appropriate administrative action to bring this disturbing      chapter of MMS history to a close.                      A Culture of Ethical Failure       The single-most serious problem our investigations revealed      is a pervasive culture of exclusivity, exempt from the rules      that govern all other employees of the Federal Government.       In the matter involving Ms. Dennet, Mr. Mayberry and Milton      Dial, the results of this investigation paint a disturbing      picture of three Senior Executives who were good friends, and      who remained calculatedly ignorant of the rules governing      post-employment restrictions, conflicts of interest and      Federal Acquisition Regulations to ensure that two lucrative      MMS contracts would be awarded to the company created by Mr.      Mayberry--Federal Business Solutions--and later joined by Mr.      Dial. Ms. Dennet manipulated the contracting process from the      start. She worked directly with the contracting officer,      personally participated on the evaluation team for both      contracts, asked for an increase to the first contract      amount, and had Mayberry prepare the justification for the      contract increase. Ms. Dennet also appears to have shared      with Mr. Mayberry the Key Qualification criteria upon which      bidders would be judged, two weeks before bid proposals on      the first contract were due.       In the other two cases, the results of our investigation      reveal a program tasked with implementing a ``business      model'' program. As such, Royalty in Kind (RIK) marketers      donned a private sector approach to essentially everything      they did. This included effectively opting themselves out of      the Ethics in Government Act, both in practice, and, at one      point, even explored doing so by policy or regulation.       Not only did those in RIK consider themselves special, they      were treated as special by their management. For reasons that      are not at all clear, the reporting hierarchy of RIK bypassed      the one supervisor whose integrity remained intact      throughout, Debra Gibbs-Tschudy, the Deputy Associate      Director in Denver, where RIK is located. Rather, RIK was      reporting directly to Associate Director Dennet, who was      located some 1500 miles away in Washington, DC, and to whom      the unbridled, unethical conduct of RIK employees was      apparently invisible (although the Associate Director had      been made aware of the plan by RIK to explore more formal      exemption from the ethics rules.)       More specifically, we discovered that between 2002 and      2006, nearly \1/3\ of the entire RIK staff socialized with,      and received a wide array of gifts and gratuities from, oil      and gas companies with whom RIK was conducting official      business. While the dollar amount of gifts and gratuities was      not enormous, these employees accepted gifts with prodigious      frequency. In particular, two RIK marketers received combined      gifts and gratuities on at least 135 occasions from four      major oil and gas companies with whom they were doing      business--a textbook example of improperly receiving gifts      from prohibited sources. When confronted by our      investigators, none of the employees involved displayed      remorse.       We also discovered a culture of substance abuse and      promiscuity in the RIK program--both within the program,      including a supervisor, Greg Smith, who engaged in illegal      drug use and had sexual relations with subordinates, and in      consort with industry. Internally, several staff admitted to      illegal     drug use as well as illicit sexual encounters. Alcohol abuse      appears to have been a problem when RIK staff socialized with      industry. For example, two RIK staff accepted lodging from      industry after industry events because they were too      intoxicated to drive home or to their hotel. These same RIK      marketers also engaged in brief sexual relationships with      industry contacts. Sexual relationships with prohibited      sources cannot, by definition, be arms-length.       Finally, we discovered that two of the RIK employees who      accepted gifts also held inappropriate outside employment and      failed to properly report the income they received from this      work on their financial disclosure forms. Smith, in      particular, deliberately secreted the true nature of his      outside employment--he pitched oil and gas companies that did      business with RIK to hire the outside consulting firm--to      prevent revealing what would otherwise, at a minimum, be a      clear conflict of interest.                               Conclusion       As you know, I have gone on record to say that I believe      that 99.9 percent of DOI employees are hard-working, ethical      and well-intentioned. Unfortunately, from the cases      highlighted here, the conduct of a few has cast a shadow on      an entire bureau.       In summary, our investigation revealed a relatively small      group of individuals wholly lacking in acceptance of or      adherence to government ethical standards; management that      through passive neglect, at best, or purposeful ignorance, at      worst, was blind to easily discernible misconduct; and a      program that had aggressive goals and admirable ideals, but      was launched without the necessary internal controls in place      to ensure conformity with one of its most important      principles: ``Maintain the highest ethical and professional      standards.'' This must be corrected.                            Recommendations       In conclusion, we offer the following Recommendations.       1. Take appropriate administrative corrective action.       Some very serious misconduct is identified in these      reports. While the OIG generally does not take a position      concerning what administrative corrective action might be      appropriate in any given matter, in this instance there may      be significant enough misconduct to warrant removal for some      individuals. Given the unwillingness of some to acknowledge      their conduct as improper, the subjects of our reports should      be carefully considered for a life-time ban from working in      the RIK program.       2. Develop an enhanced ethics program designed specifically      for the RIK program.       Given the RIK culture, an enhanced ethics program must be      designed for RIK, including, but not limited to, (1) an      explicit prohibition against acceptance of any gifts or      gratuities from industry, regardless of value; (2) a robust      training program to include written certification by      employees that they know and understand the ethics      requirements by which they are bound; and (3) an augmented      MMS Ethics Office.       3. Develop a clear, strict Code of Conduct for the RIK      program.       A fundamental Code of Conduct with clear obligations,      prohibitions, and consequences appears to be necessary to      repair the culture of misconduct in the RIK program. This      code should include a clear prohibition against outside      employment with the oil and gas industry or consultants to      that industry. Given the considerable financial      responsibilities involved, MMS should also consider      implementing a Random Drug Testing program specifically for      RIK.       4. Consider changing the reporting structure of RIK.       The management reporting structure of the RIK program must      be seriously reconsidered. Given the challenges that will be      faced in rebuilding this program, it seems imperative that      RIK have management oversight in immediate proximity, not      some 1,500 miles away in Washington, DC.
