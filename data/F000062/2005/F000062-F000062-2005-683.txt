 President, I rise today to join my good friend and colleague Senator Orrin Hatch, to introduce the ``Gang Prevention and Effective Deterrence Act of 2005.''  Gangs are spreading across our country, increasing in violence and power in every State. The growth and spread of these gangs illustrate the simple fact that they are no longer a local problem. They are a national problem, and require a national solution. This bill is designed to contribute to that solution by bringing together Federal, State and local law enforcement, equipping them with the right legal tools, and providing authorization for funds to make this partnership effective.  First, let me illustrate the scope of the problem we face: In 2002, there were approximately 731,500 gang members and 21,500 gangs in the United States. Additionally, the FBI report on national crime statistics found that youth-gang homicides had jumped to more than 1,100 in 2002, up from 692 in 1999. According to a report commissioned by a coalition of big city police chiefs, gang-related killings skyrocketed by 50 percent from 1999 to 2002. In 2002, there were a little more than 16,000 homicides in the United States--more than a thousand of those murders were gang-related. In Southern California alone there have been about 3,100 gang-related killings since 1999. 87 percent of U.S. cities with a population of more than 100,000 have reported gang problems, according to the Department of justice.  The bottom line is that this is a major problem.  This legislation before us today squarely addresses these serious issues. Its main point is to create a new type of crime, by defining and criminalizing ``Criminal Street Gangs.'' This recognizes the basic point of a street gang--it is more powerful, and more dangerous, than its individual members. Defeating gangs means recognizing what is so dangerous about them, and then making that conduct against the law.  This bill does exactly that. It makes illegal participation in a criminal street gang a federal crime. A ``criminal street gang'' is defined to mean a formal or informal group, club, organization or association of 3 or more persons who act together to commit gang crimes. This legislation makes it a crime for a member of a criminal street gang to commit, conspire or attempt to commit two or more predicate gang crimes; or to get another individual to commit a gang crime. The term ``gang crime'' is defined to include violent and other serious State and Federal felony crimes such as: murder, maiming, manslaughter, kidnapping, arson, robbery, assault with a dangerous weapon, obstruction of justice, carjacking, distribution of a controlled substance, certain firearms offenses and money laundering. And it criminalizes violent crimes in furtherance or in aid of criminal street gangs.  These two provisions are at the heart of this legislation. Armed with this new law, Federal prosecutors, working in tandem with State and local law enforcement, will be able to take on gangs in much the same way that traditional Mafia families have been systematically destroyed by effective RICO prosecutions. The legislation also recognizes that the core changes, standing alone, are not sufficient.  The Gang Prevention and Effective Deterrence Act is a comprehensive bill to increase gang prosecution and prevention efforts. The bill authorizes approximately $650 million over the next five years to support Federal, State and local law enforcement efforts against violent gangs including the funding of witness protection programs and for intervention and prevention programs for at-risk youth. In support of this effort, the bill increases funding for Federal prosecutors and FBI agents to increase coordinated enforcement efforts against violent gangs.  Witness protection is particularly important--as an example, recent press reports from Boston show that gang members are distributing what is, in essence, a witness intimidation media kit, complete with graphics and CDs that warn potential witnesses that they will be killed--one CD depicts three bodies on its covers. In another incident, a witnesses' grand jury testimony was taped to his home--soon afterward he was killed.  The Act also creates new criminal gang prosecution offenses, enhances existing gang and violent crime penalties to deter and punish illegal street gangs, proposes violent crime reforms needed to effectively prosecute gang members, and proposes a limited reform of the juvenile justice system to facilitate Federal prosecution of 16 and 17 year old gang members who commit serious acts of violence--specifically it:  Makes recruiting minors to join criminal street gangs a Federal crime and requires offenders to pay the costs associated with housing and treating any recruited minor who is prosecuted for their gang activity.  Makes murder and other violent crimes committed in connection with drug trafficking Federal crimes.  Creates a new offense of multiple interstate murders, where an individual crosses State lines and intends to cause the death of two or more people.  Allows for prosecution of gang members who cross State lines to obstruct justice, intimidate or retaliate against witnesses, jurors, informants, or victims.  Creates tougher laws for certain Federal crimes like assault, carjacking, manslaughter, conspiracy, and for specific types of crimes occurring in Indian country.  Requires that someone convicted of hiring another person to commit murder be punished with imprisonment, instead of a fine.  Makes sexual assault a predicate act under RICO and increases the maximum sentences for these RICO crimes.  Allows for detention of persons charged with firearms who have been previously convicted of prior crimes of violence or serious drug offenses. Current law does not allow a prosecutor toask that a person be held without bail even if the person has previously been convicted of a crime of violence or a serious drug offense. This bill would allow prosecutors to make that request of a judge but would allow a criminal defendant the right to argue why he or she should not be held.  Makes it clear that in a death penalty case, the case can be tried where the murder, or related conduct, occurred.  Extends the time within which a violent crime case can be charged and tried. For violent crime cases, the time is extended from 5 years to 10 years after the offense occurred or the continuing offense was completed, and from 5 years to 8 years after the date on which the violation was first discovered.  Permits wiretaps to be used for new gang crimes created by this bill.  Allows for a murdered witness's statements to be admitted at trial in cases where the defendant caused the witness's death.  Makes clear where a case can be tried involving retaliation against a witness--in either the district where the case is being tried, or where the intimidation took place.  Increases penalties for criminal use of firearms in crimes of violence and drug trafficking.  Includes modified juvenile provisions. This bill will allow prosecutors to more easily charge 16 and 17 year olds who are charged with serious violent felonies. A judge will review every decision a prosecutor makes to charge a juvenile as an adult.  Creates and provides assistance for ``High Intensity'' Interstate Gang Activity areas. This legislation requires the Attorney General to designate certain locations as ``high intensity interstate gang activity areas'' and provides assistance in the form of criminal street gang enforcement teams made up of local, State and Federal law enforcement authorities to investigate and prosecute criminal street gangs in each high intensity interstate gang activity area.  Authorizes funding of $500 million for 2004 through 2008 to meet the goals of suppression and intervention: $50 million a year will be used to support the criminal gang enforcement teams. $50 million a year will be used to make grants available for community-based programs to provide for crime prevention and intervention services for gang members and at-risk youth in areas designated as high intensity interstate gang activity areas.  Authorizes $150 million over five years to support anti-gang efforts including: Expanding the Project Safe Neighborhood program to require U.S. Attorneys to identify and prosecute significant gangs within their district; coordinating such prosecutions among all local, State, and Federal law enforcement; and coordinating criminal street gang enforcement teams in designated high intensity interstate gang activity areas. Supporting the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Safe Streets Program. Creating and expanding witness protection programs, the hiring of additional State and local prosecutors, funding gang prevention and community prosecution programs and purchasing equipment to increase the accurate identification and prosecution of violent offenders.  The bottom line is that this legislation would provide the tools and the resources to begin that national task of destroying criminal street gangs. It is designed to emphasize and encourage Federal, State and local cooperation. It combines enforcement with prevention. It is a tough, effective and fair approach.  This is not a new bill. I have been working on it for almost ten years. In 1996, I joined Senator Hatch and others to develop the Federal Gang Violence Act, which would have increased criminal penalties for gang members, made recruiting persons into a criminal street gang a crime, and enhanced penalties for transferring a gun to a minor. Many of the provisions of that bill were incorporated into the 1999 Juvenile Justice bill, which was approved overwhelmingly (73-25) by the Senate in the 106th Congress. However, the Juvenile Justice bill stalled in conference, and these provisions were never signed into law.  In the years that followed we kept up our efforts, with Republicans and Democrats working together on this critical issue. In the 108th Congress a version of this bill was introduced, and eventually was co-sponsored by Senators Hatch and others. That bill was the subject of much discussion and debate. Some of my colleagues raised some valuable suggestions and criticisms, many of which were incorporated in the bill last year. The result of that compromise was reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee last Fall, but was never considered by the full Senate.  The legislation today is the same as that which was approved by the Judiciary Committee, and I hope this year we will move quickly to pass it into law. That said, I understand that some of my colleagues are still concerned about certain aspects of the bill. My intention is to continue to negotiate in the weeks ahead. I am open to change, and welcome further discussion and analysis.  We all agree that gangs are a terrible and growing problem. We all agree that something needs to be done. I believe that this legislation is desperately needed, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take this bill and make it law.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 155       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Congress finds that--       (1) violent crime and drug trafficking are pervasive      problems at the national, State, and local level;       (2) the crime rate is exacerbated by the association of      persons in gangs to commit acts of violence and drug      offenses;       (3) according to the most recent National Drug Threat      Assessment, criminal street gangs are responsible for the      distribution of much of the cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin,      and other illegal drugs being distributed in rural and urban      communities throughout the United States;       (4) gangs commit acts of violence or drug offenses for      numerous motives, such as membership in or loyalty to the      gang, for protecting gang territory, and for profit;       (5) gang presence has a pernicious effect on the free flow      of commerce in local businesses and directly affects the      freedom and security of communities plagued by gang activity;       (6) gangs often recruit and utilize minors to engage in      acts of violence and other serious offenses out of a belief      that the criminal justice systems are more lenient on      juvenile offenders;       (7) gangs often intimidate and threaten witnesses to      prevent successful prosecutions;       (8) gang recruitment can be deterred through increased      vigilance, strong criminal penalties, equal partnerships with      State and local law enforcement, and proactive intervention      efforts, particularly targeted at juveniles, prior to gang      involvement;       (9) State and local prosecutors, in hearings before the      Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate, enlisted the help      of Congress in the prevention, investigation, and prosecution      of gang crimes and in the protection of witnesses and victims      of gang crimes; and       (10) because State and local prosecutors and law      enforcement have the expertise, experience, and connection to      the community that is needed to combat gang violence,      consultation and coordination between Federal, State, and      local law enforcement is critical to the successful      prosecutions of criminal street gangs.
