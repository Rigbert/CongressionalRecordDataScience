 Everybody in this country understands that our Nation faces a significant number of major crises--whether it is the disintegration of our health care system, the fact that 17 percent of our people are unemployed or underemployed, or the fact that one out of four of our children is living on food stamps. We have two wars, we have global warming, we have a $12 trillion national debt, and the best the Republicans can do is try to bring the U.S. Government to a halt by forcing a reading of a 700-page amendment. That is an outrage. People can have honest disagreements, but in this moment of crisis it is wrong to bring the U.S. Government to a halt.  I am very disturbed that I am unable to bring the amendment that I wanted to bring to the floor of the Senate. I thank Senator Reid for allowing me to try to bring it up before it was obstructed and delayed and prevented by the Republican leadership. My amendment, which was cosponsored by Senators Sherrod Brown and Roland Burris, would have instituted a Medicare-for-all single-payer program. I was more than aware and very proud that, were it not for the Republican's obstructionist tactics, this would have been the first time in American history that a Medicare-for-all single-payer bill was brought to a vote before the floor of the Senate. I was more than aware that this amendment would not win. I knew that. But I am absolutely convinced that this legislation or legislation like it will eventually become the law of the land.  The reason for my optimism that a Medicare-for-all single-payer bill will eventually prevail is that this type of system is and will be the only mechanism we have to provide comprehensive high-quality health care to all of our people in a cost-effective way. It is the only approach that eliminates the hundreds of billions of dollars in waste, administrative costs, bureaucracy, and profiteering by the private insurance companies, and we are not going to provide comprehensive, universal, cost-effective health care to all of our people without eliminating that waste. That is the simple truth.  The day will come, although I recognize it is not today, when the Congress will have the courage to stand up to the private insurance companies and the drug companies and the medical equipment suppliers and all of those who profit and make billions of dollars every single year off of human sickness. On that day, when it comes--and it will come--the U.S. Congress will finally proclaim that health care is a right of all people and not just a privilege. And that day will come, as surely as I stand here today.  There are those who think that Medicare-for-all is some kind of a fringe idea--that there are just a few leftwing folks out there who think this is the way to go. But let me assure you that this is absolutely not the case. The single-payer concept has widespread support from diverse groups from diverse regions throughout the United States. In fact, in a 2007 AP/Yahoo poll, 65 percent of respondents said that the United States should adopt a universal health insurance program in which everyone is covered under a program like Medicare that is run by the Government and financed by taxpayers.  There is also widespread support for a Medicare-for-all approach among those people who understand this issue the most, and that is the medical community. That support goes well beyond the 17,000 doctors in the Physicians for National Health Care Program, who are fighting every day for a single-payer system. It goes beyond the California Nurses Association, the largest nurses union in the country, who are also fighting for a Medicare-for-all, single-payer health care. In March of 2008,a survey of 2,000 American doctors published in the Annals of Internal Medicine concluded that 59 percent of physicians ``supported legislation to establish national health insurance.''  Madam President, you might be particularly interested to know that the New Hampshire Medical Society surveyed New Hampshire physicians and found that two-thirds of New Hampshire physicians, including 81 percent of primary care clinicians, indicated that they would favor a simplified payer system in which public funds, collected through taxes, were used to pay directly for services to meet the basic health care needs of all citizens. That is New Hampshire.  In 2007, Minnesota Medicine Magazine surveyed Minnesota physicians and found that 64 percent favored a single-payer system; 86 percent of physicians also agreed that it is the responsibility of society, through the Government, to ensure that everyone has access to good medical care.  But it is not just doctors, it is not just nurses, it is not just millions of ordinary Americans. What we are seeing now is that national, State, and local organizations representing a wide variety of interests and regions support single payer. These include the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the American Medical Students Association, the AFL/CIO, the United Church of Christ, the UAW, the International Association of Machinists, the United Steelworkers, the United Electrical Workers, the Older Women's League, and so many others that I do not have the time to list them.  I ask unanimous consent to insert a list in the Record of all the organizations representing millions and millions of Americans who are sick and tired of the current system and want to move toward a Medicare-for-all single-payer system.
