 President, further on behalf of the majority leader, I ask unanimous consent that at 10 a.m. on Friday, March 24, the Senate begin consideration of calendar No. 34, H.R. 831, the self-employed health insurance bill, and that it be considered under the following agreement: 5 hours on the bill, to be equally divided in the usual form; that no amendments be in order other than the committee-reported substitute.  I further ask that following the conclusion or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to a vote on the committee substitute, to be followed by third reading and final passage, all without intervening action or debate.
