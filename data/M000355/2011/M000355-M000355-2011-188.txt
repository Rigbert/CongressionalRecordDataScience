 President, I rise today to recognize one of Kentucky's most successful educational institutions, Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College, SKCTC. Beginning last year, SKCTC celebrated its 50th anniversary of providing higher education in southeastern Kentucky across five full-service campuses. To commemorate the event, SKCTC's Pineville campus held an open house for over 500 high school students from the area. To highlight the school's success over the years, President Dr. W. Bruce Ayers gave a presentation of SKCTC's history to all who attended.  SKCTC's Pineville campus was originally launched in the early 1960s as a nursing school. Over the years, the school expanded its buildings and curriculum and has become the main location for many of SKCTC's medical programs.  The campus is home to about 50 percent of the school's allied health students, who are enrolled in programs such as respiratory therapy, radiologic technology, surgical technology, clinical lab technology, or one of several nursing programs to become a licensed practical nurse or a registered nurse. As a whole, SKCTC holds a remarkably high pass rate on licensing exams for graduated students--some of the medical programs maintain a pass rate of 100 percent. As a result, the majority of SKCTC students leave the school with a medical license of some kind.  The people of southeastern Kentucky are privileged to have such a reputable institution that continues to provide future generations of Kentuckians with a quality education year after year. To help celebrate this landmark occasion, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article describing the anniversary celebration at SKCTC--Pineville be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Middlesboro Daily News, Mar. 22, 2011]            SKCTC Anniversary Celebrated at Pineville Campus                           (By Lorie Settles)       Pineville.--The fiftieth anniversary of Southeast Kentucky      Community and Technical College (SKCTC) was commemorated at      the Pineville campus on Friday with an open house for area      high-school students.       Members of the faculty and staff of SKCTC Pineville      welcomed nearly 500 teens on Thursday and Friday, reported      Kim Ayers, the college's recruiter. The guests hailed from      high schools including Jellico, Harlan Independent,      Cumberland Gap, and Knox Central.       Students enjoyed guided tours of the campus on Thursday and      Friday, and were presented with facts and demonstrations      about the programs available at the Pineville Campus.       ``We are delighted to be able to celebrate the fiftieth      anniversary on the Pineville Campus and we are equally      delighted to have so many folks visit us,'' said Dr. W. Bruce      Ayers, President of SKCTC. ``This campus has meant so much to      the area and so much to the college for a number of years.''       The southeast division of the University of Kentucky was      launched in 1960, and has been an important facet of the Bell      County community since the birth of the Pineville and      Middlesboro branches of the college.       At the open house, Dr. Ayers shared some of the history of      the institution. The Pineville campus, he explained, joined      the SKCTC family in 1998, but had been in the area for some      time.       ``This particular campus actually began as an LPN nursing      school down in Pineville, and moved here after they were      flooded out in the 1970s. They moved up here, got a new      building and expanded the curriculum. They've been doing a      splendid job here in allied health since that time,'' said      Dr. Ayers.       Although the building situated on Log Mountain is      relatively small compared with many other campuses, it is      able to house a number of programs in the medical field. Each      year, students begin programs in Respiratory Therapy,      Radiologic Technology, Surgical Technology, Clinical Lab      Technology, or enroll in a nursing program to become a      Licensed Practical Nurse or Registered Nurse.       The Pineville campus is a vital part of the SKCTC family,      serving as a main location for many medical programs.       ``We train probably about 50 percent of our allied health      students for the entire college here,'' remarked Dr. Ayers of      SKCTC Pineville.       The majority of those students leave the school with a      medical license. Ayers reported that the campus boasts      ``remarkably high pass rates'' on licensing exams, and that      several programs maintain a pass rate of 100 percent.       Those numbers serve as proof, he says, that students in the      area are as bright and capable of success as students      anywhere in the country.       SKCTC's anniversary was celebrated in Middlesboro in      December.                          ____________________
