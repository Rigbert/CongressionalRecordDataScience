 My letter to Senator Inhofe is dated April 8, 1999, and I have that letter here as No. 13 document.  I ask unanimous consent to have document No. 13 printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                    Washington, DC, April 8, 1999.     Hon. James M. Inhofe,     Chairman, Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support,          Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Jim: In view of your upcoming hearing on financial      management at the Department of Defense (DOD) along with my      continuing interest in these matters, I am submitting several      questions bearing on internal control issues for your      consideration.       Back on January 19, 1999, I wrote a letter to DOD's Chief      Financial Officer (CFO), Mr. Bill Lynn, to verify certain      facts pertaining to a policy known as ``straight pay.'' The      facts in question were provided anonymously by an employee at      the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS). In a      nutshell, this policy authorizes DFAS to make payments up to      $500,000.00 when no corresponding obligation or contract      could be located in the database or otherwise identified.      When bills are paid in the absence of contracts, how does      DFAS know how much money, if any, is owed? As I understand      it, this policy was personally approved by Mr. Lynn.       In my mind, this is a very dangerous policy. But it is not      only dangerous. It is also misguided, and it may violate the      law. It is certainly helping to erode one of the last visible      traces of internal controls at DOD, and its continued use      will undermine any hope of a ``clean'' audit opinion on the      department's annual financial statements--as required by the      Chief Financial Officers Act.       Last year, during my investigation of the breakdown of      internal controls at DOD, I learned that Air Force Staff      Sergeant (SSGT) Robert L. Miller, Jr. had pursued his own      version of ``straight pay'' while Chief of Vendor Pay at      DFAS' Dayton center during 1995-1997. With full access to the      Integrated Accounts Payable System, SSGT Miller was able to      create obligations, where none existed, and generate nearly a      $1,000,000.00 in fraudulent payments to his mother and      girlfriend. Now, Mr. Lynn's ``straight pay'' policy      authorizes DFAS technicians to do exactly what SSGT Miller      did--create false bookkeeping entries to cover large payments      in the absence of supporting contracts. This policy leaves      the door wide open to fraud and mismanagement.       I am attaching a copy of my letter to Mr. Lynn on      ``straight pay'' dated January 19, 1999. Since Mr. Lynn never      answered this letter, I had to verify the facts on my own in      consultation with the General Accounting Office. According to      a March 8, 1999 DFAS memorandum, Mr. Lynn's ``straight pay''      policy is still in place today, though its name has been      changed to avoid any negative connotations. DFAS is concerned      that the term ``straight pay'' may suggest a permissive      ``environment for fraudulent payments.''       I would very much appreciate it if you would place a copy      of my letter in the hearing record and raise my enclosed      questions on DOD's ``straight pay'' policy. My questions      should be directed to Mr. Lynn.       Again, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to      submit questions for your upcoming hearing on DOD Financial      Management problems.       In addition, in the very near future, I expect to be      submitting ``a legislative reform package'' to you and other      colleagues for consideration. The rationale for this draft      legislation is outlined under the heading ``The Need for DOD      Financial Reforms'' on pages 25 to 29 of the Budget      Committee's report on the Concurrent Resolution on the     Budget for FY 2000 (Senate Report No. 106-27).       I look forward to having Mr. Lynn's responses to my      questions on ``straight pay'' and working with you in the      future on these matters.           Sincerely,                                              Charles E. Grassley,                                                     U.S. Senator.
