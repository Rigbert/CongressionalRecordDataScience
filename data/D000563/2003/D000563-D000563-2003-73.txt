President, and I thank the minority whip.  First, for those who are following this debate, if it can be characterized as such, you should understand we had an opportunity to finish the appropriations bill for the Veterans' Administration, a $62 billion bill to fund veterans hospitals, clinics, and health care across the United States. We tried.  Senator Byrd of West Virginia came to the floor and said: Can we postpone what we are doing tonight here to finish this important appropriations bill so we can go to conference and get ready to adjourn this session in a timely fashion? Sadly, the Republican side objected to finishing the appropriations bill for the Veterans' Administration. It is their belief what we are doing now took precedence, is more important. It will be up to the voters and the public to make a judgment as to whether they were right.  I would also say that instead of addressing some issues families across America might tune in to follow, such as the unemployment in this country, and what we are doing about it, we are here debating a situation where 4 judges have been held out of 172 submitted by President Bush.  I would think, frankly, we ought to spend a little time really addressing the problem of unemployment in this country. This President has witnessed, in his administration, a loss of more than 3 million private-sector jobs. That is a record. Unless something changes dramatically, this President will be the first President since Herbert Hoover to have lost jobs during the course of his administration. Over 3 million Americans unemployed. Sadly, we have 9 million unemployed across the country today and their unemployment benefits are running out.                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1853  In the interest of at least trying to do something constructive and legislative this evening, rather than just exchanging our comments back and forth, I am about to make a unanimous consent request that the Senate proceed to legislative session, and the Finance Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. 1853, a bill to extend unemployment insurance benefits for displaced workers, that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration, and that this bill be read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.
