Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Thompson). He has been a real force in helping to move this legislation forward, and particularly in making certain that his State and his district are included within the scope of the legislation. Without his perseverance, that would not have happened.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to thank a few staff who helped with the issue. Although this would seem kind of like a no-brainer since it is good for fish, the farmers, the economy and the Federal taxpayers, it was not easy working with the numerous agencies of jurisdiction and potential jurisdiction, and it took a while to wend our way through this maze. So Cynthia Suchman, Ben Grumbles, Bob Faber, Steve Lanich, and Kathie Eastman of my staff were all key with helping move this bill forward.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
