Speaker, I stand today in strong support of this important legislation. In 1994, during my first term in Congress I introduced a bill to create a system now known as the Basic Pilot Program. Representing a district very close to the U.S./Mexico border, I heard from many INS agents dissatisfied with the tools they were given to track illegal immigrants and from employers who wanted a way to verify the employment eligibility of prospective employees. As we discussed the means to develop such a system, one idea that kept cropping up was a simple 1-800 telephone number that businesses could use to verify the Social Security numbers of people they had hired.  In 1996, I was successful in getting the Basic Pilot Program included in the Immigration Reform Act and I am pleased that companies across the country are now using the toll free verification line. I applaud my friend from Iowa for moving to extend the program. Now, more than ever, it is clear that we need to provide tools that will help the INS track people in this country illegally.  Even while this program continues, we will be working together to ensure that the INS meets the requirements of the 1996 law. I have asked INS to complete their report on the Basic Pilot Program and will work with the Service, the gentleman from Iowa and the Chairman of the Committee on ways to improve and expand the program to all fifty states.  Again, I would like to thank the gentleman from Iowa for introducing this key legislation and would urge all my colleagues to vote for its passage.
