President, I rise to offer my support to legislation introduced by Senator McCain, S. 1578, to make Congressional Research Service Reports, Issue Briefs, and Authorization and Appropriations products available over the Internet to the general public.  I applaud the goal of this legislation to allow every citizen the same access to the wealth of information at the Congressional Research Service (CRS) as a Member of Congress enjoys today. CRS performs invaluable research and produces first-rate reports on hundreds of topics. The taxpayers of this country, who pay CRS's annual budget of $60 million, deserve speedy access to these wonderful resources.  I understand that the staff at CRS has raised some questions about how this bill may affect their charter mandate to provide ``confidential analysis and information exclusively for Congressional clients.'' I want to work with Senator McCain, the other cosponsors of this bill and the Senate Rules Committee to ensure that Members who request confidential research have control over the release of that research. But we can do both--protect truly confidential research and give our citizens electronic access to non-confidential CRS products.  I want to commend the Senior Senator from Arizona for his leadership on opening public access to Congressional documents. I share his desire for the American people to have electronic access to many more Congressional resources. I look forward to working with him in the days to come on harnessing the power of the information age to open up the halls of Congress to all our citizens.                          ____________________
