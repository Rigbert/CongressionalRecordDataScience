Speaker, through rain, sleet, and snow George Gould has been a Voice of reason in a complex and significant area of American life--the delivery of our mail.  George's professionalism, integrity, and expertise have been real assets to both the National Association of Letter Carriers and the United States Postal Service. It is no coincidence that in the 27 years George has served NALC, relations between the 300,000 employees represented by NALC and the USPS have been harmonious. George's contributions to making the USPS the most efficient and reliable public postal service in the world have been significant.  In fact, George is the longest-serving lobbyist in NALC's history, and served two NALC presidents as Assistant for Legislative and Political Affairs. Before joining the union in 1979, he worked for 15 years on Capitol Hill, the last three as the staff director of the House Subcommittee on Postal Operations and Services.  Over the years, George served as chairman of the FAIR Coalition (the Fund for Assuring an Independent Retirement), a postal-federal employee grouping that fought to protect and enhance federal employee pensions and other benefits.  George's work for NALC helped bring about greater political freedom for federal workers through the reform of the Hatch Act in 1993 and has advanced the cause of postal reform legislation. Indeed, it is a fitting tribute to George that Congress on this very day stands ready to complete its work on this critical legislation.  ``America's letter carriers have benefitted tremendously from George's many years of service as NALC's chief lobbyist on Capitol Hill,'' said NALC President William H. Young.  I wish George, my friend for almost three decades, and his wife Diane, nothing but happiness and success a they enter the next chapter of their lives.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E2225]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]               TRIBUTE ON THE RETIREMENT OF GEORGE GOULD                                 ______                                                           HON.
