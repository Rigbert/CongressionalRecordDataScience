 How does the Democratic budget spend on such high levels over the next ten years? Two words: tax increases. The budget includes a complicated cap-and-trade energy tax that will cost the average American household up to $3,128 annually, a new tax on charitable giving that will cost American charities as much as $16 billion per year, increased taxes on businesses and families that make over $250,000 per year, and the resurrection of the death tax which will punish family-owned businesses and farms.  The theme seems to be that the government knows best and the people should fall in line.  Fortunately, there are some of us on Capitol Hill who will not fall in line. Republicans have offered an alternative that reflects common-sense economics: when in debt, stop spending.  The Republican alternative places a priority on national defense and veterans' health and temporarily freezes other discretionary spending for five years. It would halve the President's deficit projection for 2019.  It would make the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent, cap the capital gains and dividends tax at 15 percent and give families and individuals options for a simplified tax code. To foster entrepreneurship and small businesses, it would cut the corporate tax rate--the second highest in the world--from 35 percent to 25 percent.  Unlike my friends on the other side of the aisle, I do not think the way forward is through increased government interference, funded by our wallets and our children's piggybanks. I urge members to reject the proposed Democrat budget and vote for the Ryan Budget.
