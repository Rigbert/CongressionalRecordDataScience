 I know the Senator from New York has been waiting patiently.  The debate we just had has been an effort--toward the end of it--to shift it in a different direction. We are going to come back to this over and over again for the next 3 or 4 days.  We are not just talking about the appearance of corruption. What the Senator from Arizona has repeatedly said is things such as, ``corrupts our political ideals,'' ``we are all corrupted,'' ``the corruption of Congress,'' ``soft money is corrupting the process.''  These have been allegations of corruption, which is a violation of Senate rules and a violation of Federal bribery statutes.  I would suggest to all of our colleagues, in our exuberance to pursue our different points of view on this issue, do not suggest corruption unless you have evidence of corruption. It demeans the Senate, and in the instances of Senators Bennett and Gorton, it demeans a specific Senator. It is clear from this debate, there is no evidence--none whatsoever--of corruption.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
