 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by a high school student from Brattleboro High School in Vermont, who was speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       Mr. Crispe. Hello, Congressman Sanders. On February 6th the      state Supreme Court ruled on the Brigham vs State of Vermont      case claiming there is a statistically significant      relationship between the wealth of a school district and its      spending per student. They decided that there is a great      disparity in the quality of education that a student in      Vermont receives. It depends on where he or she resides; thus      they ruled the current property tax for funding education is      unconstitutional and it is up to the legislature to overhaul      this unjust system.       The House Ways and Means Committee set to work and on March      19th of this year the legislature passed the controversial      House Bill, 527 for property tax reform. I am a concerned      Vermonter and so I want to see this new bill equalize      educational opportunity.       The bill which the Senate is currently reviewing I believe      to be better. I also understand that property tax reform is a      tedious, confusing, and almost insurmountable task that      legislatures have faced, and for me to try to understand how      to make the bill better is even more difficult. However, I do      believe there are some important additions that could be      made.       There is a large, non-residential tax rate for second      homeowners and large businesses of $1.32 per $100 value of      property. Under this progressive tax formula people will pay      based on their ability. Places like ski areas and second      homowners in Vermont will pay more while residential property      taxes will be cut by two-thirds. I believe the higher income      earners should pay more; however, in Vermont the highest      income earners are already paying the highest rates in the      country.       The high non-residential tax could drive out businesses and      hurt Vermont's largest industry, tourism. For a hypothetical      example, Mt. Snow Ski Area has lots of money, but if it is      taxed a lot more the ticket prices could go up and tourists      refusing to pay the exorbitant amount will to Maine or New      Hampshire to ski. All in all, it could create a cyclical      domino effect that would end up hurting Vermont's economy and      stunt its growth.       Furthermore, second homeowners in Vermont will be hit hard      under the non-residential tax. I feel they should pay more,      but we should keep in mind that many of them are already      paying for their own children's education in their respective      states. We should not place a burden so high that they move      away or our state is less attractive to stay in. It is      important that income earners at all levels pay their fair      share, but the non-residential range should not be so high as      to end up damaging Vermont's economy by making it unreachable      to outsiders.       Also in the bill is the net residential tax of two acres of      land. Basically any resident will pay the residential rate of      39 cents per $100 property value on up to two acres of land.      After that two acres, they pay the large non-residential rate      of $1.32 per hundred dollar value. This is unfair to      Vermonters because two acres is a meager amount of land to      only be able to afford. If people have to get rid of their      land over two acres because they cannot afford the non-     residential rate, we will not be using our land effectively      and it is simply unfair.       Another last thing to think about is the local income tax.      This would be the third tax Vermonters pay: State, federal,      local. We want to equalize education but we are doing it at      the local level with the presumption that the towns are going      to tax themselves to raise money above the state block grant.      This may be a poor presumption because honestly people care      about education but gag when they hear anything about more      taxes. If this presumption fails and the towns do     not tax themselves as planned, we could end up with the same      educational disparities as the present system.       House Bill 537 is generally good, but some of the      aforementioned taxes could be eased by a couple of things: I      propose to fix some of the problems of the bill by taxing      heavily products totally unnecessary to Vermonters. We could      put a larger tax on tobacco products, all lottery tickets and      games, alcoholic beverages and even candy. I understand that      in 537 there is going to be broad-based taxes on things like      rooms, meals and gasoline, but a heavy tax on the mentioned      products ought to generate a lot of additional revenue to      ease the other taxes.       Also for revenue a higher tax should be put on inheritances      and trust funds, but not for inherited agricultural land.      With the revenue from these taxes we could put forth the      money to fixing some of the problems with the bill. We could      allow a residential tax for maybe up to six acres of land and      reduce the monetary need for the local income tax by pouring      some of the revenue into the state pool for block grants.       Other revenue could go to reducing the non-residential tax      so businesses and non-residents won't move out or be      discouraged from coming here. This can make our state      attractive to prospective businesses which if they moved in      could stimulate our economy.       Lawmakers need to move slowly and do this reform correctly.      We definitely do not want as equally a poor system that will      just have to be overhauled again in another couple of years.      We should run statistic tests and implement the reform      gradually to see how it evolves and works--I know the revenue      from alcohol, tobacco and other products fluctuates--to      examine the amount of the income the proposed taxes do indeed      generate.       Lastly, politics should be left out of this bill. It is      important to remember that the bill is for the kids and      justice in funding education and remember that a good      education makes for the best economic climate.       I think that everyone has made this bill so complicated, I      didn't touch on a lot of the nitty-gritty complications of it      and I think they get lost in all those complications, so if      you just think about it sensibly and make it simple. As I      mentioned in my presentation that people who earn more should      pay more. The progressive tax format I believe works for      property but I think and I do like House 527, I just think      there are things that might be made better partly because      they made it so complicated.       You can get into a whole other topic because sure, the      federal government subsidizes or whatever education and you      get into issues like how much--I mean if you look at the pie      chart of what they spend each year, they spend five to ten      percent on education and then you get into issues of how much      they spend on defense and the military as opposed to      education.       The present system basically there was a lawsuit that      stemmed out of this whole thing and it is actually been a      problem for a number of years. Matter of fact, in 1987      Madaline Kunin said years ago that the quality of education      that a child in Vermont receives depends on where he or she      resides, she just said it straight out, and people all the      way back to the 70's and before. The problem--but it is being      forced that the legislature has to do something and something      has to be done because of the Supreme Court decision stemming      from a lawsuit or whatever, the case of Amanda Brigham, and      they ruled last February that it was unconstitutional and      that they should totally--that it is going to be totally      overhauled and the legislature should do it as fast as they      can.       Some property-rich towns were spending twice as much, say      between eight and $11,000 for people for education while      other property-poor towns under the present and all funding      systems were paying half that, 3,000, 4,000, $5,000 for      people.       Thank you for your time, Congressman Sanders.                                 ____________________
