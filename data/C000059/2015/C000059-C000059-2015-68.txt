Chairman, I thank the gentleman for offering the amendment and yielding me time.  I appreciate the concerns that he brings to us today. It is troubling that the Bureau of Land Management has proposed land use plans that appear to contradict its multiple-use mandate. So with that, I would happily accept his amendment.
