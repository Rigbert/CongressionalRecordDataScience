President, I would like to take a moment to recognize the courageous actions of six brave Oklahomans. On August 25, 2009, in the evening hours of the day, these six men, Daniel Richards, David Cox, Nick Niemann, Cody Click, Luck Tucker, and Casey Johnson, saved a life. That evening a call came in about a man having severe chest pains and possibly a heart attack at a residence in a rural area east of the town of Roland, OK. Roland Fire Department first responders were paged to respond, and upon their arrival they found a male subject lying on the ground not breathing. The six first responders immediately started CPR and hooked the individual up to an automated external defibrillator and delivered a resuscitating shock from the AED. The first responders continued CPR and working with the patient for 12 minutes until an EMS unit arrived on scene. When the patient was placed in the ambulance he was breathing and had a pulse. The patient was transported to Spark's Medical Center in Fort Smith, AR, where theemergency room doctor stated that the ``firefighters saved this man's life.'' The patient needed to have a stint placed in the main artery of the heart and suffered some-short term memory loss, but he recovered and went home from the hospital in about 7 days. These men are true heroes. The town of Roland, the State of Oklahoma, and I are extremely thankful to them for their service and honored to have them serving one of Oklahoma's finest communities.                          ____________________
