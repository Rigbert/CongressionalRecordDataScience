I buy dozens and dozens of gifts. And I find locally made items because I know the money will go right in the pockets of local people. And why is it these craft shows, they hold them in churches, and they hold them in auditoriums, why don't some of these big shopping center complexes invite them in? What's the problem with trying to help local innovation, local development? We find so many restrictions that make it hard.  One of the reasons we can't grow jobs fast enough is because certain interests in our society have such a lock on who can get in the door. There ought to be a section for local. We shouldn't haveto pass a Federal law for that. People should be smart enough out there to do it. It creates more customers all ways around, and a lot of us want to support local.
