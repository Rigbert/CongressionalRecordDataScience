 President, in regard to the statement just made by the Senator from Nevada, I voted for the amendment that he speaks about in committee. It lost by a 1-vote margin. I don't know whether Members have had a chance to give it the thorough thought it ought to have when it is brought up on the floor. I hope Members will take a good look at it. If there is evidence to back up what has been said about the amendment bringing money home, it is something that would give a shot in the arm to the economy. It ought to be something we look at. I think there has been some talk about it, but not enough at this point. I am not suggesting the amendment should not be voted for tomorrow. I am just suggesting it is something I am taking a very good look at.
