Chairman, I would like to thank my good friend from California for shepherding this important piece of legislation through the House.  In the last Congress I was privileged to be a member of the Task Force on Campaign Finance Reform.  One provision I fought for in particular was that 51 percent of total contributions come from within a candidate's congressional district.  This creates stronger ties to a Member's constituents and will help reduce the influence of narrow special interests. No longer will this House operate under the image that we are beholden to PAC's or individuals based thousands of miles from the people we represent.  In my past two elections I have promised to raise a majority of my money from within my district. Indeed, I have raised an average of over 60 percent of my funds from the people of the 43d District of California.  Not only does this indicate my support from my constituents, but more importantly it allows me to better represent their views.  They are the citizens who have made my congressional career possible. They are the people whom I represent.
