President, I ask that a copy of a letter from myself and Senator Nickles to GAO dated 20 June 1996 be printed in the Record at this point.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                    Washington, DC, June 20, 1996.     Mr. Richard Davis,     Director, National Security Analysis, National Security and          International Affairs Divisions, U.S. General Accounting          Office, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Davis: The 1995 Defense Base Closure and      Realignment Commission's (BRAC) recommendations to close Ft.      McClellan, AL and move its Military Police (MP) and Chemical      Schools to Ft. Leonard Wood, MO, was based on the Defense      Department's recommendation that basic training activities at      Ft. Leonard Wood be moved elsewhere in order to make room for      the additional personnel and activities associated with MP      and Chemical training.       Subsequent to the adoption of the BRAC 95 recommendations,      the Army changed its position and has now opted to keep basic      training at Ft. Leonard Wood. Specifically, at the time of      the BRAC decision, it was the Army's stated intention to      close out basic training at Ft. Leonard Wood and divide that      basic training among Forts Jackson, Knox, and Sill, each      receiving one basic training battalion of 1,400 to 1,500      soldiers.       We are concerned that the FY97 Defense Authorization bill      contains $58 million in BRAC IV military construction funds      for ``unaccompanied enlisted housing'' at Fort Leonard Wood.      It is our understanding that this $58 million project is      being undertaken partly to enable Ft. Leonard Wood to keep      its basic training mission, even though the three posts      referred to above have existing capacity to accommodate Ft.      Leonard Wood's basic training student load. We ask that you      review this project against other alternatives available to      the Army at lower cost. Specifically, we ask that you:       Review a complete list of the military construction      projects approved for or anticipated at Ft. Leonard Wood      during the five fiscal years beginning with FY97.       Identify the current shortfall in unaccompanied enlisted      housing at Ft. Leonard Wood.       Identify the current basic training student load at Ft.      Leonard Wood.       Identify the number of unaccompanied enlisted housing      spaces that would become available at Ft. Leonard Wood if its      current basic training student load were to be relocated, in      whole or in part as originally proposed by the Department of      Defense.       Review the number of personnel to be transferred from Ft.      McClellan to Ft. Leonard Wood in accordance with the BRAC 95      recommendations.       Compare the number of unaccompanied enlisted personnel to      be transferred pursuant to such recommendations with the      number of unaccompanied enlisted housing spaces to be      constructed at Fort Leonard Wood using the $58 million      presently authorized by the FY97 Defense Authorization bill.       Evaluate the availability of unaccompanied enlisted housing      at each of the posts identified by BRAC 95 as potential      locations for basic training currently being conducted at Ft.      Leonard Wood.       Identify any military construction costs, if any,      associated with the transfer of a basic training battalion to      Forts Knox, Jackson, and Sill, respectively.       Because the Joint Conference on the FY97 DOD Authorization      is likely to conclude by the end of next month, we need to      receive your report not later than July 20, 1996. Please      direct any questions to John Luddy of Senator Inhofe's staff,      at 202-224-1390. Thank you very much for your prompt      consideration of this matter.           Sincerely,                                                  James M. Inhofe,                                                     U.S. Senator.                                                      Don Nickles,                                                     U.S. Senator.
