 First, I would like to congratulate Mr. Serrano. This is his first bill that he has brought to the floor and handled, and he has done it very well. I want to thank him.  I also want to congratulate my good friend, Ralph Regula. I had the great honor of serving for 6 years under his chairmanship of the Labor Health Committee of which I had the honor of serving. He did an outstanding job, he's done a good job with this bell as well. I thank him for facilitating consideration of this bill.
