President, on my time, if we are going to go by rating, I say to my friend from Maryland, let's see how we would rate. I think probably one way of rating is our deficit as a share of GDP. I say this because we do it for ourselves. We talk about having our household budgets in line. As a U.S. Senator, I own a home, of course. But my real home is in Vermont. But I have a home to use when I am down in the Senate. Now, I do as almost all Vermonters, unless they have a lot more money than I do. I buy that with a mortgage. I could not pay for those homes all in 1 year. I am in deficit.
