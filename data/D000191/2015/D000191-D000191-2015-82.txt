Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, we are still in the process of implementing environmental streamlining from MAP-21, and yet this bill contains additional environmental streamlining that Ithink will yield great results. We already have an accountability section at DOT with the Dashboard, and I would argue, given the fact that another section of this bill does further environmental streamlining on top of that which is still pending to be implemented, that it is unnecessary and, in fact, would be perhaps contradictory to the intent of the gentleman because of the time involved. It would essentially be like a billing in the private sector where every 15 minutes you are writing down that you had to call this agency to talk about this or you had to review this letter or this document, and that is attributable to the environmental review versus some other part of the review. I think it would be problematic.  I would urge Members to oppose this amendment and to support the bill because of the environmental streamlining that is in there. Let that environmental streamlining take effect; and a year or two down the road, if we feel that there are unaccountable delays, then we can look at ways to track that better.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
