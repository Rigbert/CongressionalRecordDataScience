 President, today the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing entitled ``Helping State and Local Law Enforcement During an Economic Downturn.'' Today Senator Kyl and I are introducing a bill that will do just that. The SCAAP Reimbursement Protection Act of 2009 will help to alleviate the costs of illegal immigration to State and local governments by broadening the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, SCAAP, to ensure that States and localities are eligible for reimbursement of the costs associated with incarcerating criminal aliens.  We are joined today by Senators Boxer, Hutchinson, Schumer, Cornyn, Durbin, Crapo, Bingaman, Specter, Cantwell, and McCain.  The burden of incarcerating criminal aliens weighs heavily on States, especially during this time of economic uncertainty. California is home to approximately 32 percent of the Nation's illegal immigrants and spent over $950 million in 2008 alone to house these criminal aliens.  Understanding the expenses that States and localities bear, Congress enacted SCAAP in 1994 to help reimburse States and localities for the costs of incarcerating criminal aliens. Prior to 2003, the Department of Justice interpreted the SCAAP statute to include reimbursement to States and localities that are incurring costs of incarcerating undocumented criminal aliens who have been accused or convicted of State and local offenses and have been incarcerated for a minimum of 72 hours. After 2003, DOJ limited reimbursement to the amount States and localities spend incarcerating convicted criminal aliens for at least 4 consecutive days.  Reimbursing States and localities only for the costs when a criminal alien is convicted and incarcerated for 4 consecutive days significantly undermines the goal of SCAAP that States and localities should not bear the burden of a broken Federal immigration system. The actual costs of this failed Federal system begin when these aliens are charged with a crime, transported, and incarcerated for any length of time.  This narrow interpretation is even more devastating because SCAAP is consistently under-funded. The President has zeroed out SCAAP funding in his budget proposals for the past 7 years. Through bipartisan support, Congress was only able to partially fund the program.  As a result, SCAAP only reimburses States for a fraction of the costs of incarcerating criminal aliens. In 2008, the California State government will receive approximately $118 million in SCAAP funding. However, it is estimated to cost the State approximately $960 million each year for the incarceration of criminal aliens in California--$842 million above the reimbursement amount. The State of California is therefore only being reimbursed for approximately 12 percent of its actual costs to incarcerate illegal criminal aliens.  This cut has had a domino effect on public safety funding. For every dollar less that SCAAP reimburses States, a dollar less is available for critical public safety services. For example, after the SCAAP funding cuts in 2003, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department implemented an ``early release'' policy for prisoners convicted of misdemeanors.  I believe it is the Federal Government's responsibility to control illegal immigration. The funding cuts imposed by the Bush administration have let our local public safety services down, and have made our communities less safe.  The SCAAP Reimbursement Protection Act of 2009 is good federal policy to fix a failed Federal one--so that States are reimbursed for the full costs of incarcerating aliens who are either charged with or convicted of a felony or two misdemeanors.  This policy has the support of the National Sheriffs' Association, California State Association of Counties, the U.S./Mexico Border Counties Coalition, the Virginia Sheriffs' Association, the Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca, and the Sheriffs' Association of Texas, who have all endorsed the bill I am reintroducing today.  Our colleagues in the House unanimously passed this companion bill last Congress and I urge my colleagues in this chamber to join me in supporting this much needed amendment to the SCAAP statute.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 168       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
