Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, it is hard to think of an issue that the gentleman from New York (Mr. Towns) and I when we have tried to lead on an issue have not reached out to each other and sought some partisan support. And I again appreciate that friendship and hard work.  At the end of the day, at the end of this day, this Congress is going to follow through with what the Senate did and make sure that, in fact, these poison control centers are in place and that they are going to be funded.  There is an old movie that I remember, ``Ghostbusters.'' Remember that? ``Who are you going to call? Ghostbusters.'' I am not going to sing it. But when a parent has a problem, particularly a parent, but it could be anybody, there has got to be a number that they can call, whether it is their cell phone in their pocket or the phone in their kitchen. And this bill does that. Because they do not have time, they do not have a lot of time to react when someone might be writhing on the floor with some substance that they might have ingested and they have no idea what to do, particularly as a non-physician, as most of us in this body are.  This bill is going to save lives; and at the end of the day, it is going to save money too. I cannot think of a better promise to the American taxpayer, to the folks that we serve, as we have visited our day-care centers and we see those wonderful little kids that are playing. They cannot distinguish between a box of detergent and a box of cereal. They just know that it usually has got a pretty color.  We have got to make sure that, in fact, their lives are going to be saved when they do something that they really should not do if they had had some parental involvement during that tragic moment.  So again, Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this legislation. I would hope that we can pass it without any objections at all.
