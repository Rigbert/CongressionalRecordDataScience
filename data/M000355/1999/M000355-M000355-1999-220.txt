 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes all action on S. 1234, it not be engrossed and be held at the desk. I further ask that when the House of Representatives' companion measure is received in the Senate, the Senate immediately proceed to its consideration, all after the enacting clause of the House bill be stricken and the text of S. 1234, as passed, be inserted in lieu thereof, the House bill, as amended, be read for the third time and passed, the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses thereon, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, and the foregoing occur without any intervening action or debate.  I further ask unanimous consent that upon passage by the Senate of the House companion measure, as amended, the passage of S. 1234 be vitiated, and the bill be indefinitely postponed.
