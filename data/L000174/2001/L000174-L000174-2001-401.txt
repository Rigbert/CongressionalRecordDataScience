President, I am pleased to join with my friend from Nebraska, Senator Hagel, in submitting this resolution, entitled ``Hunger to Harvest: A Decade of Support for sub-Saharan Africa.'' The Resolution speaks for itself, but I want to make a couple of brief points.  Sub-Saharan Africa today is a region suffering from immense problems, and none more catastrophic than AIDS. Over 25 million people are infected with the AIDS virus, and almost 4 million more people are infected each year. The disease is destroying whole societies in a region that was already the poorest in the world.  Another million people, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and mostly children, die from malaria each year. Many of these deaths could be prevented with mosquito bed nets that cost a few dollars a piece.  An estimated 2 million people have died from hunger and disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the civil war there, and hardly anyone noticed. There is similar suffering in southern Sudan.  Hunger and poverty are endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, as are violence and corruption. It is beyond tragic that a region with such great potential has been so devastated by corrupt leaders who have robbed their countries' wealth, and fought wars for no other reason than to amass riches and power, wars that have spanned decades and wreaked havoc on their own people.  Yet despite this terrible legacy there are signs of hope. Some countries have emerged from chaos and are beginning to recover. Nigeria is an example. Namibia is another. Still others, like the Democratic Republic of the Congo, are showing tentative but encouraging signs. It is also noteworthy that American companies are increasingly investing in sub-Saharan Africa, investments which today total some $12.8 billion.  These are positive changes that deserve our support, but United States assistance to sub-Saharan Africa is a mere $2 per person per year. We cannot solve Africa's problems, but Bread for the World Institute calculates that great progress could be made in reducing hunger and poverty in Africa with relatively modest increases in international assistance.  This Resolution seeks to focus attention on the urgent needs in sub-Saharan Africa. But it goes further, by requesting the Administration to develop five and ten year strategies for helping to address those needs, in health, education and agriculture, and for promoting free market economies, trade and investment, democracy and the rule of law. With clear strategies, specific goals, the resources to implement them, and benchmarks for measuring results, we can make a difference. We also request the Administration to report on progress in implementing these strategies.  It is my hope that this resolution will lead to a new U.S. approach toward sub-Saharan Africa. As the world's richest, most powerful Nation I believe we can and should do far more to assist the world's poor. But the leaders of the sub-Saharan countries also have a responsibility to support policies that benefit and provide incentives to their people. Those who do, deserve our support.  Finally, I want to thank Bread for the World for its help on the Resolution, and for its life-saving work in sub-Saharan Africa and around the world.                          ____________________
