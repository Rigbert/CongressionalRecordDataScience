Speaker, as we have heard over 2 days, the Corps' budget is tight--a $2.4 billion backlog in operations and maintenance and, after today, a $74 billion backlog in authorized projects. Now, deep in this bill is a line item that provides an authorization for an $810 million lavish waterfront development project in Fort Worth, Texas. My amendment simply guarantees fiscal discipline and regular order in two parts.  First, it guarantees that no Corps of Engineers funds will be used to build soccer fields, baseball fields, basketball courts, or splash parks as part of the project. Second, it requires the Secretary of the Army to determine that the project is economically justified. That is it. That is all this does.  The proponents of this will say there are no funds that are going to be used for soccer fields, baseball fields, basketball courts, or splash parks. However, this has been extracted from the Web site of the developer of the project. This is the official Web site. These are all included.  They say: We are going to use local funds.  There is a little gimmick here. Corps projects that have been authorized and have been found to be economically beneficial have to have local cost sharing. In this case, big parts of the local cost share are these things which are not qualified for a Corps project.  They say: Those aren't going to be Federal funds.  This is going to reduce the burden on the local people to match, and it is going to increase the burden on the taxpayers. In fact, if this does not authorize these things, all the Secretary has to do is to say they are not going to be constructed with Federal funds. If Members don't want to take my word for it, listen to the Taxpayers for Common Sense and National Taxpayers Union.  ``The legislation authorizes funding for a project in Fort Worth, Texas, costing more than $800 million. The Upper Trinity River project is portrayed as a flood damage reduction effort, but is really a massive economic development initiative that would divert precious Corps resources to construct soccer and baseball fields, basketball courts, and even a splash park. Money spent on a splash park in Fort Worth is money that cannot be spent to further the Corps' core mission areas. At the least, we urge you to remove or limit the funds. . . . `' If I am wrong and the National Taxpayers Union is wrong, the Secretary only has to confirm that.  Secondly, we are going to require the Secretary to determine the project as economically justified. Why would Congress insist on economically justifying a $510 million Federal project? A better question might be: Why wouldn't you insist on this?  Every other chief's report in this bill had to go through an economic analysis by the Corps of Engineers and be found to be a net benefit to the taxpayers of the United States. This project did not. Yes, there was a private analysis done that said this is a great project, but there was no study done by the chief's office, and it has not been economically justified.  This project started out as an earmark in 2004 at a cost of $220 million. In this bill, it is a renewed earmark at $810 million, and the Federal share has gone from $110 million to $527 million. Anybody out there who has a need for a port or a harbor or anything else, think about that as you are in a very long line, and $527 million is going to get ahead of you with an earmarked project which includes these sorts of features.  I urge Members to observe regular order, not to do an earmark by any other name, and require this project to be economically justified and not to construct sports facilities.                                               September 27, 2016.       Dear Representative: While less expensive and problematic      than the Senate version of the Water Resources Development      Act (S. 2848), we urge you to oppose H.R. 5303, the ``Water      Resources Development Act of 2016.'' Instead of much needed      reform, this legislation piles billions of dollars in      additional water projects on the U.S. Army Corps of      Engineers' plate. The legislation also makes policy changes      that will be costly to taxpayers.       The largest challenge facing the Corps of Engineers water      resources program is the lack of a prioritization system for      allocating the limited available tax dollars. The legislation      directs the executive branch to better explain its budgeting      decisions, but this should not serve as an abdication of      congressional authority. Congress should develop the criteria      and metrics to prioritize Corps projects in the three primary      mission areas (navigation, flood/storm damage reduction, and      environmental restoration). The executive branch should be      required to allocate funds in the budget request in a      transparent manner through merit, competitive, or formula      systems developed by Congress. Lawmakers could then conduct      oversight, hold the administration accountable, and adjust      the systems, criteria, and metrics as needed.       H.R. 5303 fails to include such a prioritization system. It      does many other things, however. Between committee      consideration and the floor, the bill grew by over $6      billion. A provision from the Water Resources Reform and      Development Act of 2014 dedicating maintenance dredging funds      to emerging ports is made permanent. It doesn't make sense to      invest in a port that is continually ``emerging.'' It also      extends set-asides for ``donor'' and ``energy'' ports without      reforming the massive cross-subsidies in the existing      maintenance dredging program. The legislation authorizes      funding for a project in Fort Worth, Texas, costing more than      $800 million. The Upper Trinity River project is portrayed as      a flood damage reduction effort, but is really a massive      economic development initiative that would divert precious      Corps resources to construct soccer and baseball fields,      basketball courts, and even a splash park. Money spent on a      splash park in Fort Worth is money that cannot be spent to      further the Corps' core mission areas. At the least, we urge      you to remove or limit the funds for this project.       Again, we urge you to oppose H.R. 5303 the ``Water      Resources Development Act of 2016.''           Sincerely,     Ryan Alexander,       Taxpayers for Common Sense.     Pete Sepp,       National Taxpayers Union.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
