Speaker, I am submitting a letter from Colin Taylor Mays, a 12-year-old school kid in Oregon. He is very worried about the future of his education. The drive by some to make deep cuts in our education system is jeopardizing his education and the future competitiveness of our Nation.  While it is critical that we must not further burden our children and grandchildren with a mountain of debt, we also must make investments in their future. With limited resources we must make smart investments that put people back to work by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure system. While we focus on creating jobs now we cannot forget about our youth and what future will lie ahead for them. We must invest in education to make sure that our children will be prepared for the workforce of tomorrow. It is possible to balance our budget and provide for the most critical needs of our Nation. We must look both at raising revenues and reducing spending in areas where appropriate. If we do not make these choices now we will continue to let our children suffer in an education system that is falling apart at the seams. I hope that my colleagues will heed this message and work with me on making the right choices for our youth by investing in their education and giving them the same if not greater opportunities than we had growing up.                         (By Colin Taylor Mays)       I am age 12 and a boy scout of America. I'm writing this      letter as a view not a complaint. I haven't been learning      enough in school, because of all the budget cut days. It's      hard to keep track of what I'm learning. We need to put more      money towards schooling and education. I probably have only      12 full weeks of school and I have so many weeks that only      have 4 or 3 days in them. Unlike very few children I want to      learn and possibly get a very good job that I want. Please      consider this letter.                          ____________________
