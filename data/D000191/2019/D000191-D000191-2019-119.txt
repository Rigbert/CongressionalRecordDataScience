This AmeriCorps program is administered through the University of Oregon's Institute for Policy Research and Engagement and is dedicated to improving economic, social, and environmental conditions in rural Oregon communities.  Since its inception in 1994, more than 600 RARE members have served all 36 counties and more than half of the cities in Oregon, providing much needed capacity and expertise to rural communities. In the past 25 years, RARE members have completed more than 2,000 assessments, plans, and reports for local communities, written more than 700 grants, raised over $6 million for communities, and recruited more than 10,000 community volunteers who served more than 8.6 million hours. In the last five years alone, communities in my congressional district have benefitted from 37 projects and partnerships coordinated by the RARE AmeriCorps Program.  This year, 31 RARE members are working across the State of Oregon to develop and implement community planning, community and economic development, natural resource planning, and community food security/food systems projects. Current projects in my district include a RARE member working with the City of Florence Public Art Committee to select and install two large-scale public art pieces in the Urban Renewal District. There is also a two-year project with the Oregon Coast Visitors Association focused on community-driven initiatives for outdoor recreation, signature events, and culinary and agritourism-related opportunities on the southern Oregon coast.  I am proud to note that RARE AmeriCorps Program partnerships include federal and state agencies and notable non-profit foundations and organizations. The key partners are the Corporation for National & Community Service (AmeriCorps), the University of Oregon, the Ford Family Foundation, the Oregon Food Bank, Travel Oregon, Oregon Main Street, Energy Trust of Oregon, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the Oregon Department of Transportation.  It is my pleasure to congratulate the RARE AmeriCorps Program on 25 years of service to rural communities in Oregon and to thank RARE for its many vital contributions. I have no doubt these first 25 years of success will serve as the inspiration for the next twenty-five.                          ____________________
