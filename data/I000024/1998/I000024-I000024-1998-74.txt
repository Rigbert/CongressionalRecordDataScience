President, I agree with the very letter of what the Senator from Michigan said. He is right. It does make it more difficult for the Secretary of Defense to close the realigned bases without coming to Congress or without going through the BRAC process.  I have to say, respectfully, to my colleague from Virginia that the letter he read from was referring to a previous version--a much stronger bill. We have moderated this language quite a bit. I also say that is the same individual that put this into law 20 years ago himself.  Third, this doesn't stop the 2001 BRAC process. It does not stop. We can still do it. It just says we don't need to decide in this bill whether or not we are going to have a 2001, and it could just as well be done next year.  Lastly, the comment that was made that this would draw a veto, this is used every year. I have very serious doubts that the President of the United States, on the defense authorization bill, is going to veto it on the basis of an amendment that is supported by both the majority leader, Trent Lott, and the minority leader, Tom Daschle.  I yield the remainder of my time.
