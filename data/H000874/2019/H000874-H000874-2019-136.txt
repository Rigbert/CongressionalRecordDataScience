There are no requirements for any committee to undertake any investigation that you have to have a rule passed by this House.  And the gentleman apparently thinks that, by having an investigation and an inquiry, somehow that is an impeachment; it is not. He is absolutely right.  To impeach would have to have a vote of this House. Clearly, that is correct. That is consistent with the Constitution and the laws of this country. There is nothing that says--other than the Republicans who repeat it ad nauseam because they are hopeful that some people will believe what they say, that somehow it is unfair that Democrats and Republicans are sitting together as the constituted Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence looking at this matter.  Everybody has a right to ask a question in that room. All Members have a right to review the materials.  What he doesn't like is the rule that they put in place, Madam Speaker, about who can call witnesses.                              {time}  1145  They said the minority could not call witnesses unless the chairman and the committee approved of it. That is their rule, not our rule. We adopted our rule. We kept that rule in.  I asked the gentleman, Madam Speaker, a question. Does he believe it is right for a President of the United States to seek foreign interference in our elections? He has not answered that question.  Here is the--it is not a transcript. It is a report of the conversation, which came from the White House. I would hope we could count on its accuracy.  President: ``I would like you to do us a favor, though.''  What do you think ``though'' means?  Yes, I know you want something, but I would like to you do a favor, ``though.''  Mulvaney: Aid withheld to press Ukraine.  Now, he doesn't say what it was for. I get that. But you don't think President Zelensky had any doubt: I would like you to do a favor.  Now, the whip, Madam Speaker, has not answered my question whether he thinks it is appropriate for a President to ask a foreign leader for help in the elections, whether it was the 2016 or the 2020 elections. I happen to believe it was the 2020 elections.  He talks about Hunter Biden; he talks about Joe Biden all the time. So it would not be an unreasonable conclusion that that is what he was talking about.  Let me ask you another question.
