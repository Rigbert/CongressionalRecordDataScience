 President, I ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the Brown amendment, which we were just discussing, No. 994, the next amendments in order be the following and that the Senate vote on the amendments in the order listed with no second-degree amendments in order prior to the votes: Vitter No. 811, Warren No. 1094, Lee No. 855, Cardin No. 367, Rubio No. 552, and Kaine No. 1047, as modified.  I further ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes equally divided between the managers or their designees prior to each vote and that all votes after the first in this series be 10 minutes in length.  Let me just say parenthetically that if everyone will stay in their seat--the clerk tells me it takes 7 minutes to call the roll. So if everyone will stay in their seat, we will go straight through. They tell me it takes 7 minutes to do it. This should take us about an hour if we get started.  Further, I ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the listed amendments and any cleared amendments agreed to by both managers and both leaders, the remaining pending amendments be withdrawn and the Senate proceed to vote on adoption of the resolution, as amended.
