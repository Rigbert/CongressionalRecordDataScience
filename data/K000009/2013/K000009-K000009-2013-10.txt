 It is simply the same old trade model since 1975 that has caused this country to rack up over $9 trillion of trade deficit--more imports coming in here than exports going out. An incredible debt.  We talk about the budget deficit. The reason we have a budget deficit is because we have a trade deficit and the outsourcing of jobs from coast to coast.  There is simply no reason to bring up a deal under the fast track procedure which will not permit amendment on this floor--a deal negotiated in secret by yet another Presidential administration.  Americans know how the middle class has been shrinking, how incomes have been shrinking, how production from coast to coast has been outsourced.  I associate myself with the remarks with the Special Order this evening that calls on the administration to rebalance our trade accounts. They could take up a bill that I have authored to rebalance America's trade accounts and take a look at all of these nations with which we have amassed these huge, huge deficits while our production is being outsourced.  Madam Speaker, let's table the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal. Let's table fast track and develop a brand-new trade model that benefits the United States of America and its people again so their incomes can rise.                          ____________________
