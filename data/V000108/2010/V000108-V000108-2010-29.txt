Taft Middle School, located in Indiana's First Congressional District. After undergoing a very selective application and interview process, Robert A. Taft Middle School received the distinct honor of being named one of the ``Schools to Watch'' by the National Forum to Accelerate Middle-Grades Reform. For accomplishing an extraordinary feat and exerting remarkable efforts, Robert A. Taft Middle School will receive recognition at a gala dinner during the Schools to Watch Annual Conference. This prestigious event will take place in Washington, D.C. on Thursday, June 24, 2010.  The ``Schools to Watch'' program honors middle schools that exemplify exceptional performance in education. This rigorous program was developed in 1999 by the National Forum to Accelerate Middle-Grades Reform. To date, there are eighteen States that participate in this national initiative. Candidates for the ``Schools to Watch'' program must demonstrate four main criteria: academic excellence, developmental responsiveness, social equity, and organizational structure. The middle schools that are chosen for the ``Schools to Watch'' program exceed these standards.  Robert A. Taft Middle School provides education to 6th, 7th, and 8th grade students in the Crown Point, Cedar Lake, and Winfield communities in Indiana. In recent years, Robert A. Taft Middle School implemented a program involving innovative educational techniques which made significant contributions to the school's success. Important factors of the new program include interdisciplinary teams that allow staff to create personalized environments, flexible schedules to ensure comprehension, and team planning and preparation periods that provide students with high-quality teachers and learning opportunities. Additionally, the implementation of the ``Creating a Safe School'' anti-bullying effort made Robert A. Taft Middle School an even stronger candidate for this prestigious honor.  Madam Speaker, I would like to once again extend my most heartfelt congratulations to Robert A. Taft Middle School faculty, staff, and students, as well as Principal Michael Hazen, on being named one of the ``Schools to Watch'' for 2010. The dedication exhibited by the school and the community serves to inspire us and to encourage other schools across the Nation. It is my honor to have been given this opportunity to recognize such a supreme middle school, and I am honored to have Robert A. Taft Middle School in my district.                          ____________________
