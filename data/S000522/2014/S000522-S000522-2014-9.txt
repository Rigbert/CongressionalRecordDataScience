Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank my colleagues Ms. Ros-Lehtinen and Mr. Deutch who worked on the House version of this much-needed and timely bill.  This substantive bill expands our relationship with our closest ally by formally declaring Israel a ``major strategic partner'' of the U.S. It provides for increased cooperation in many spheres, including homeland security, cyber security, defense and intelligence, as well as water, energy, agriculture, and alternative fuels. This will send a signal to Israel's enemies that, despite their manipulative and dishonest global campaign against Israel, the U.S.-Israel relationship continues to deepen--as it should. It is right and good for both of our countries.  Mr. Speaker, this bill is largely a response to anti-Semitism--to militant, military and terroristic, and profoundly evil expressions of anti-Semitism. That's what poisons the hearts and minds of those who launch rockets at Israel and tunnel under its borders.  As we see on a sickeningly regular basis, many governments in the Middle East (and elsewhere) propagate anti-Semitic incitement as an official or quasi-official state ideology--the hate that still kills. They do this in order to distract people from their own authoritarian rule and human rights abuses. This constant incitement is a major factor in the security situation in the Middle East. In February of last year I chaired a hearing at which we heard important testimony from Dr. Zuhdi Jasser on this subject. He made the point that it is not only Jews who suffer from this incitement, but that Muslims suffer too, as Middle-Eastern despots deploy anti-Semitism as one of their principal tools in the subjugation and impoverishment of entire Muslim peoples.  Mr. Speaker, this bill fights the evil effects of anti-Semitism. I urge my colleagues to support this outstanding bill.
