 President, I would like to propound a unanimous consent request for speakers on our side.  I ask unanimous consent that the following Republican speakers be recognized for up to 7 minutes each: Chambliss, Graham, Ensign, Alexander, Shelby, Hatch, McCain, Sessions, and that Senator Coburn be recognized for up to 30 minutes.
