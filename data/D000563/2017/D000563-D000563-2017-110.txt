President, I join my colleague and friend Senator Duckworth to recognize the 100th anniversary of Chicago's Navy Pier, one of the most visited attractions in Illinois and the Midwest.  Navy Pier, originally named Municipal Pier, was the first of its kind. The pier was created to bring revenue into the city by supporting industry and tourism. The pier opened in 1916 and served as a port for commercial shipping and provided the entertainment and recreation needed to transform Chicago's lakefront into a popular tourist attraction.  During World War I and World War II, the pier was used as a naval training center for over 60,000 Navy recruits and was later named Navy Pier to honor the Navy personnel who served and contributed to the national war effort.  Throughout its history, Navy Pier was home to several Chicago institutions and traditions.  Navy Pier was also the former home to the University of Illinois at Chicago from 1946 to 1965, nicknamed ``Harvard on the Rocks,'' and served more than 100,000 students.  Navy Pier originally held the famous Taste of Chicago in 1978 and today continues to host a variety of festivals, conferences, trade shows, and live entertainment.  Navy Pier opens its doors to locals and visitors to experience Chicago's rich historical and cultural history while enjoying activities and the city's lakefront. Its popular attractions, including the iconic ferris wheel, have attracted more than 9 million visitors a year, generated millions of dollars in revenue, and created thousands of jobs for the region.  It is no surprise that Navy Pier has been labeled a Chicago historic landmark with its significant contributions to the city of Chicago and the Nation.  Navy Pier continues to promote tourism and support economic growth in Chicago and the Midwest, while improving its facilities and core missions to better provide services to visitors. It is with great pride that I join Senator Duckworth in honoring Navy Pier and its many accomplishments.
