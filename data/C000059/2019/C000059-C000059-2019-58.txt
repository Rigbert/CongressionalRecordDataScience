She also provides direction to the Reserve force and represents their interests at all levels of government to other military branches and in joint strategic and operational war-fighting environments.  Chief Master Sergeant Kelly came from exceptionally humble beginnings in Guatemala and overcame extreme adversity to achieve her American dream. Immigrating to the United States at the age of 12, she had to work full-time to help support her family before finishing high school at night to earn her diploma. Knowing from a young age she wanted to serve in our nation's military, her dogged determination is the epitome of personal resilience.  Chief Kelly's career began in the medical field as a medical services specialist. Recognizing her talents, the Air Force challenged her through increased responsibilities and she continued to grow and excel as an aeromedical evacuation crew member with over 1,400 flight hours on various airframes. Chief Kelly has deployed numerous times in support of contingency operations around the world including Restore Hope and Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom.  In addition to her military service, Chief Kelly has more than 20 years of government, management and law enforcement experience. She has served as a field agent and criminal investigator for the Department of Justice in numerous agencies including the Office of Professional Responsibility. She is also a John Maxwell certified speaker, coach and trainer.  Throughout her tenure, Chief Kelly has been instrumental in advocating for Reservists across the globe and strengthening the total force team. She has ensured Air Force Reserve interests and total force solutions were highlighted and incorporated into decisions made at the highest levels of the Air Force guaranteeing Air Force Reserve Airmen were ready to answer our nation's call.  Due to Chief Master Sergeant Ericka Kelly's visionary leadership, foresight and ceaseless efforts, the Air Force, the Department of Defense, and the Nation will long reap the benefits of her many years of service. It is experienced, dedicated, professional Citizen Airmen like Chief Master Sergeant Kelly who make the Department of Defense and the Air Force Reserve the outstanding institutions that they are today.  Madam Speaker, on behalf of the United States Congress and a grateful Nation, I extend our deepest appreciation to Chief Master Sergeant Ericka E. Kelly for her many years of dedicated service. There is no question the Air Force, Department of Defense, and the United States benefited greatly from Chief Kelly's visionary leadership, planning and foresight, and we wish her the very best.                          ____________________
