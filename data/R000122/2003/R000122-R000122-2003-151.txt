President, I join my colleagues in supporting the Kennedy amendment. We are trying to help over 1.1 million Americans who exhausted their benefits. These are hard-working Americans who paid into the unemployment trust fund. Now is our opportunity to help them. I believe it is our obligation. Here is an interesting point on this recession. In the 20th century, the average bottoming out of unemployment comes within 15 months of the beginning of the recession, but we have seen 25 months of continuing unemployment. This, indeed, is the longest in terms of the persistence of long-term unemployment that we have seen since the 1930s.  These people need our help. The trust fund has the resources. We should vote today to give these people benefits. As Senator Kennedy pointed out, in every other recession every other President has done it. There should be no exception today. If we want to help 1.1 million Americans, just as we helped lots of fortunate Americans today, we should support this amendment.
