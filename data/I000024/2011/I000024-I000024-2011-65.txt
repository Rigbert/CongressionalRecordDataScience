First, I will support the FAA amendment. I think Senator Paul has a good idea.  I would only say this: I want my Republican conservatives to listen carefully. This is totally different than any other bill because what this is--there is adequate money right now in the highway trust fund to carry out the existing spending until 2013. So I would only say that money is dedicated for that purpose, and it is going to be spent for that purpose. Anything that came from a source other than a gas tax was merely paid back from money borrowed out of the trust fund. So from a moral standpoint, this should be spent on infrastructure on the highway bill--on the extension. Then we will be able to talk about something more important, which is the bill coming up, and that will be the permanent one.  So I think it is not going to make any difference. I will oppose it on concept because that money is dedicated for a purpose and paid for by people who believe we are going to improve our highways.
