My colleague makes a good point that clearly last night in the President's speech, and further today, he made it clear he was interested in trying to mobilize world opinion, and I think all of that is extremely constructive.  At the same time, the letter to Senator Graham that now has been declassified--I sit on the Senate Intelligence Committee--makes it clear the CIA does not believe, as of October 7 of this year, the threat is imminent. That is why I think we have now reached the point where we are debating whether there is a continuing threat, which clearly Saddam Hussein is, or whether there is an imminent threat. It was the imminent threat I really set out as one of the thresholds I thought was relevant for supporting this resolution.  As the Senator could hear from my speech, A, I do not doubt the President's sincerity; B, I thought what he said last night was clearly a step in the right direction, and he elaborated on that further today.  On this matter with respect to the nature of the threat, for me what has been dispositive has been the now-declassified letter from the CIA where the CIA did not believe, as of October 7, the threat was imminent. I thank my distinguished colleague because he makes a number of good points, and always does.
