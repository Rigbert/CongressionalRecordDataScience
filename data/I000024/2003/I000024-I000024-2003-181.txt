President, I am pleased to introduce, by request, President Bush's proposed ``Safe, Accountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2003,'' SAFETEA, which reauthorizes the Federal-aid surface transportation program. Joining me are Senators Jeffords and Bond.  Although I am not in complete agreement with the President on this proposal, I believe the President deserves the courtesy of getting his proposal introduced.  I do agree with the President's desire to build upon the achievements of the Transportation Equity Act of the 21st Century, TEA-21, of 1998 and the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, ISTEA, of 1991. In the hearings conducted by the Environment and Public Works Committee over the last 12 months, we consistently heard that TEA-21 works.  SAFETEA focuses on reducing highway fatalities and injuries, reducing congestion, protecting the environment, increasing funding flexibility for State and local governments, and providing economic stimulus to the Nation's economy. All very worthy goals. Unfortunately, the funding proposed in the President's bill is woefully inadequate.  As Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I am looking forward to working with the President and my Congressional colleagues to develop a Senate bill that strengthens the national transportation system.
