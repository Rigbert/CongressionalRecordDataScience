  Over the past few months, as we have worked through important legislation like the NDAA, we have been reminded of one glaring reality: The forces that seek to harm the United States and our interests are ever-changing, and they demand the full attention of a fully equipped, modern, and ready military.  Since President Trump took office, Republicans in Congress have made remarkable progress. Working together, we have begun rolling back the damage caused by the previous administration's neglect, atrophy, and misguided approach. We have begun to rebuild and restore our military. We have taken important steps toward modernization, so we aren't just rebuilding the capabilities we need today but investing in those we will sorely need tomorrow.  I trust none of my colleagues are under the illusion that our work is finished. As our adversaries grow stronger, critical gaps remain in our ability to counter expansion, influence campaigns, and direct acts of violence toward America and our allies around the world.  The bipartisan funding deal is the opportunity--the only opportunity on the table--to continue filling in these gaps before it is too late. So make no mistake, Russia is not waiting idly by as we sort out whether to deliver full funding to missile defense or uphold our support of partner forces in Europe. China will not scale back its own aggressive ambitions and military investments if Americans decide to take a breather ourselves. Iran's financing of terrorist organizations and regional troublemaking is not going to stop if we stop investing in our own ability to check their efforts and project power.  So if we say we are serious about countering threats to our homeland, our allies, and our men and women deployed overseas, then we have to actually deliver on our promise to equip our forces for the job.  We have to invest in improved readiness to help our military commanders plan for emerging challenges--in research and development to support the U.S. military of the future--and in rock-solid support for our alliance commitments, which help preserve the peace and extend the reach of our values.  This deal is an opportunity to do exactly that. This is the agreement the administration has negotiated. This is the deal the House has passed. This is the deal President Trump is waiting and eager to sign into law. This is the deal that every Member of this body should support when we vote later this morning.                          ____________________
