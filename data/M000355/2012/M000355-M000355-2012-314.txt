 Mr. Gervis Singleton of Laurel County, KY, has been established in the funeral and mortuary services business for over 50 years. He has treated each and every family who has had the unfortunate need for his services as if they were his own.  Mr. Singleton owns Cumberland Memorial Gardens and Mausoleum and is a partner, along with his son, Craig Singleton, of Singleton Embalming Service. Gervis has experienced first-hand the grief process thousands of families have gone through during the death of their loved ones; his father passed away when he was only 11 years old. He believes that mourning is a very important part of the grieving process, and he takes pride in knowing that he is doing what he can to help them through such difficult circumstances. As someone who is experienced in an area that is new to many of us, he is more than happy to assist the deceased's loved ones in whatever way he can.  Gervis knows that his job is very much linked to emotion, but as a mortician, he understands that he must block out his own emotions while working on the important process of restoring the deceased individual to more closely resemble how their loved ones remember them in life. He feels that if he can assist the family during their time of mourning, that they will more likely gain closure on the loss.  During his half century working in the business, he has seen fads come and go. Mr. Singleton remembers the day when it was almost a requirement to wear all black to a funeral, a custom that he has seen almost completely go away. He has also seen families transition to more cremations in the past few decades. Cremation is a cheaper, sometimes more convenient alternative. The increase in number of cremations sparked an idea for Mr. Singleton, and in 1995 he built a signature addition to the Cumberland Memorial Gardens. The result was a 360-crypt mausoleum along with accommodations for 48 cremains.  Mr. Singleton takes a walk through his 16-acre cemetery every day, and reflects on the lives of the many who have passed away and are buried there. It is inspiring to see someone who is so involved and compassionate in an industry that is an uncomfortable topic for some, but still a vital service. Although the passing of loved ones is something we may prefer not to think about, it will most assuredly befall upon each of us at some point in time, which is why knowing there are those like Gervis to help is a comforting thought. There is a need for individuals like Gervis Singleton, who are so deeply convicted to lend a helping hand in whatever way they can.  I would like to ask my Senate colleagues to join me in commemorating Mr. Gervis Singleton. He is a fine Kentuckian who has made many a family feel comforted at a difficult time thanks to his deep respect for those who have passed away.  Recently, an article appeared in the Laurel County-area publication, the Sentinel Echo, that illustrated the contributions of Mr. Singleton to the people of Laurel County, KY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Sentinel Echo, Sept. 5, 2011]               Singleton Takes Pride in Helping Families                          (By Magen McCrarey)       Cemeteries are citadels for those who mourn the death of a      lost loved one, and treating them with the ultimate respect      is Gervis Singleton's calling.       Singleton is the owner of Cumberland Memorial Gardens and      Mausoleum, and is partner in Singleton Embalming Service with      his son, Craig Singleton. He was the second born of seven      children. His father passed away when he was only 11 years      old.       ``I don't know if it has something to do with my father      passing away,'' Singleton     said about his start in the funeral business. ``(But) I grew      fascinated.''       To embalm a body, Singleton said emotions should never play      a part. In order to do his job, he must turn off parts of his      limbic system, the primarily emotional core of his brain.      After 50 years of being in the funeral and embalming      business, he still struggles with the emotions of his job.       ``There are certain things you don't let in your mind. You      close them out,'' he said. Although, emotions play a large      part in one of the reasons he still finds zeal within his      career, comfort.       ``I take great pride in being able to do something that      makes it easier for families during those times. It's not      that you're going to grieve with them, although you may, to      some extent,'' he said. ``You are trying to help them through      their grief.''       Singleton's embalming business handles roughly 1,500 bodies      a year. A single body takes about three hours to embalm. In a      way, it's an art, he said. His team of five provides services      for funeral homes in northeastern Tennessee and southeastern      Kentucky.       Families may furnish Singleton with a photograph to      preserve the body to its original state, and they may not.      It's up to the embalmer to transform the unknown deceased      into who they were remembered as. Singleton found that some      facial features after death need to be improved on, and he      brings them back to life, visually.       But appearance isn't everything, especially when it comes      to funeral attire, he said. It's not customary anymore to      wear all black. Another uncustomary practice that's become      popular in the past 30 years is cremation, he said. ``It's a      growing thing, becoming more popular, and cheaper,'' he      added.       Singleton said mourning the deceased is important to gain      closure, not only for children but adults, too. So in 1995,      he built a mausoleum to accommodate 360 bodies and 48      cremation ashes.       A Laurel County Medal of Honor recipient is buried at      Cumberland Memorial Gardens. There is a flag flown above the      grave of Carl H. Dodd, a veteran of World War II and the      Korean War.       ``It's the only site I'll allow a flag to fly,'' Singleton      said.       Every day, Singleton walks through the 16-acre cemetery      behind his office on south U.S. 25. About 80 individuals a      year are buried on the grounds that offer three reflection      stations and feature Little Laurel River and a wooded area      from behind.                          ____________________
