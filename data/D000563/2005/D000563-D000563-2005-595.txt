Senator Landrieu of Louisiana was on the floor last night. As I left, I said that she has shown such a passion and commitment to the poor people of her State of Louisiana who have been through this hurricane. I know she has tried to work within the system, she has tried to work within the Senate, and she has tried to move things along in a peaceful, bipartisan way. I sensed in her appearance last night and her appearance on the floor now that she is reaching a level of frustration and concern that this Senate is going to go home tonight or tomorrow and be gone for 10 days having done nothing to address the important issues she is raising.  What the Senator has brought to our attention is the fact that we have a bipartisan proposal. Senator Grassley, a Republican of Iowa, and Senator Baucus, a Democrat of Montana, on the Finance Committee, have come up with a proposal to provide basic health care for the evacuees and survivors of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita, basic health care.
