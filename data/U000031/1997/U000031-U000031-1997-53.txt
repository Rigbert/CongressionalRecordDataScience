Speaker, I know we just heard that the Speaker of the House was unable to come this afternoon, but he intends to do a 1-minute on her behalf next week, because he was also very close to J.L.  I want to say a few things before we end our time here this afternoon. Particularly as I look at the gallery and think about the people listening this afternoon, there is an element of Washington that a lot of folks do not understand.  There are very powerful parts of this institution. One is the Committee on Rules, which meets behind those doors to my left. The Committee on Rules really runs this place in lots of ways. Every bill that comes to this House floor has a procedural vote first, and the Committee on Rules dissects those bills. They are the ones that decide what amendments, who will offer them, how long we will debate things, what is the procedure of each piece of major legislation as it hits the House floor.                              {time}  1415  J.L., through her role working for then Chairman Colmer, got to know those rules of the House, which are this thick. She knew every I and every T in those rules, and she was one that tried to figure out where the votes were going to come. Because of her expertise, a young man who probably learned a lot of the ropes from her, one of my predecessors, David Stockman, hailed as probably one of the greatest directors of the Office of Management and Budget and who helped run the think tank, the executive branch, for President Reagan, selected her to run that Office of Legislative Affairs.  Again, for people outside of the beltway in many respects, at least until 1981, not a lot of people knew what OMB did, either, sort of like the Committee on Rules, though it is a very intricate part of the way things work; because the Office of Management and Budget decides the battles between all of the different agencies within the executive branch on where the administration stands. They are the ones that give the final recommendation to the President as to whether he should sign a bill or veto a bill. They are the ones that decide whether they support an amendment or oppose an amendment. They are the ones at the table, whether it is the budget agreement which was adopted this week and determining where the President's policy was.  Because of J.L.'s experience of running this House and knowing where all the things were, she was a perfect selection to run that Office of Management and Budget legislative office. And really through her skills, Ronald Reagan, who is certainly going to be hailed as one of the greatest Presidents this country has ever seen, who marshaled an agenda through this House, particularly in the early years of his Presidency when he did not control the House. Republicans were 80, 90 votes down, yet he saw victory after victory after victory. She was the one that helped work the strategy, engineer those votes so that President Reagan could get the credit and see his program come through.  We look at the people that she worked with, Ken Duberstein, later chief of staff, she taught Ken a lot of things in terms of what went on. Look at some of the Members that are here. I think there are about 50 some Members at least on the Republican side today that were here in 1981 when she left, but as the gentleman from California [Mr. Thomas] said, if you wanted to know what was going on, you sidled back with J.L., back at the back rail, and she knew everything that was going on.  We look at some of the former staff people that have served in this House and some that serve today: Ron Lasch, Bill Pitts, Martha Morrison, Keith Kennedy in the Senate, Sheila Burke, Jim Whittinghill. Those are the names that Members of Congress often go to to find out what is going on and how they can work an amendment or a bill, and they are the ones we go to when we want some straight advice, to be a straight shooter.  J.L., I think it was the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Livingston] talked about her red wig. Some of us have seen that red wig before. She has tried to battle this chemotherapy and has worn this cheerful red wig. I can remember that same wig a decade or so ago when she came out to Michigan and dressed up as a Raggedy Andy, waving a little sign, ``Vote for Fred,'' standing on street corners and getting people's attention.  She is a great painter. Magnolias. She has a terrific sense of humor. Lots of jokes. And it kept everyone going when we worked sometimes 15, 18, 20 hours a day when I worked with her, when I also worked at the Office of Management and Budget. She got things done and she still is, and that is why so many of us here wish her the best.                          ____________________
