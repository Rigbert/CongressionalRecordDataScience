 President, I rise in support of the legislation being introduced by my colleague from California the Sacramento Public Safety Act.  This Bill would authorize flood control protection and ecosystem restoration through a Mini-Raise of the Folsom Dam as well as authorize the design and construction of a permanent bridge to replace the road that currently runs on top of the Dam.  Providing Sacramento with flood protection is a critical public safety need. Further delays only serve to expand opportunities for a catastrophic flood.  No urban area in the United States is at higher risk of flooding than Sacramento, CA.  Located at the confluence of two major rivers, the American and Sacramento, the floodplain is home to half-a-million residents, $40 billion in property, 5,000 businesses and the necessary supporting infrastructure, all of which has less than 100-year flood protection.  With more than $30 billion in damageable property in the floodplain, the Corps of Engineers has estimated the damage from a flood would range from a minimum of $7 billion to as much as $15 billion.  As one of the largest economic engines in the world, a flood in California's capital city would effectively shut down the State's government and seriously disrupt regional commerce and transportation.  The Mini-Raise will provide Sacramento with a 213-year level of protection. It will allow the system to safely handle a storm 50 percent larger than anything ever recorded in the 3,000-year history of the American River Watershed; it will add 95,000 acre-feet of new emergency flood storage capacity to allow operators to control dam outflows in accordance to what the downstream levees can safely carry; it will bring Folsom Dam into compliance with Federal Dam safety standards; it will restore wildlife habitat along the Lower American River; and it will improve conditions for naturally spawning Steelhead and Salmon by mechanizing temperature control shutters.  The project has wide support at Federal, State, and local level. It is supported by the Army Corp of Engineers and funded in the Bush administration's budget request.  The project has bi-partisan support in Congress including Republican Congressman Pombo, as well as Democrats: Robert Matsui, George Miller, Mike Thompson, and Ellen Tauscher.  It has the local support of Heather Fargo, Mayor of Sacramento; Deborah Ortiz, California State Senator; Darrell Steinberg, California Assemblyman; Illa Collin, Chairman of the Sacramento County Board of Supervisors; Butch Hodkins, Executive Director of the Sacramento Area Flood Control Agency; Karolyn W. Simon, President of American River Flood Control Alliance; Donald Gerth, California State University, Sacramento; and Vicki Lee, Conservation Chair of the Sierra Club.  The bill also calls for a permanent bridge to replace the road that currently runs atop Folsom Dam. Given the recent announcement by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Department of the Interior to close the road over the Dam, the need for such a bridge has become doubly important. This bridge will serve the needs of nearly 20,000 commuters who use the Folsom Dam Road every day.  I want to thank my colleague from California for introducing this critical piece of legislation and I ask for support from the rest of the Senate.                                 ______                                       By
