President, on behalf of the 29 members of the Northeast-Midwest Senate Coalition, I commend Richard Munson for his distinguished service as the director of the Northeast-Midwest Institute. For more than two decades through four Presidential administrations, 10 Congresses, and dramatic changes in our Nation's political landscape--Mr. Munson's leadership has kept the institute at the forefront of policy innovations to benefit our region.  Formed in the mid-1970s, the institute works with the bipartisan Northeast-Midwest Senate and Congressional Coalitions to develop and implement policies that promote the economic vitality and environmental quality of the region's 18 States. As the institute's lead strategist, Mr. Munson has collaborated with the coalitions' leaders and task forces to identify the region's pressing concerns, deliver high quality research about policies to address them, and provide information that made a compelling case for legislation.  Mr. Munson brought to the institute an unparalleled grasp of the internal workings of Congress. In 1993, he authored the Cardinals of Capitol Hill, a story about the men and women who control government spending which former House Budget Committee Chairman James Jones said ``should be required reading for those who want to understand our government.'' Mr. Munson also provided expertise in energy efficiency and utility regulation, demonstrated in his book, ``The Power Makers,'' and more recently, ``From Edison to Enron: The Business of Power and What It Means for the Future of Electricity.''  To complement his own skills and knowledge, Mr. Munson enlisted a staff of seasoned policy entrepreneurs, affording them the flexibility and latitude to launch groundbreaking initiatives from Great Lakes restoration to brownfields revitalization to community-based agriculture. Much of the institute's success has been rooted in Mr.Munson's conviction that economic progress and environmental enhancement are inextricably linked.  His extensive legacy includes the institute's work to help craft the Nation's first pollution prevention law instituting the paradigm shift to acknowledge that waste generation not only pollutes the environment but also exacts economic costs. In 1991 the Institute held the first national conference on salvaging the Nation's abandoned and underused brownfield sites. The conference spurred a decade of research and education that paved the way for passage of the Brownfield Revitalization and Environmental Restoration Act in 2002.  Under Mr. Munson's leadership, the institute also concentrated relentlessly on Great Lakes restoration, leading to passage of the Great Lakes Legacy Act. He was instrumental in launching the Great Lakes Cities Initiative, enabling the region's mayors to share best practices and obtain a seat at the policymaking table. And in direct response to the critical threat of invasive species to the Great Lakes, the Institute created the Great Ships Initiative to engage ports, shipping companies, and shippers in combating the problem.  With the 2002 farm bill, the institute began collaborating with states and policy partners to promote entrepreneurial agriculture, private lands conservation, and community-based approaches to reducing hunger and improving public health. The institute continues advancing these principles by facilitating the Farm and Food Policy Project, a collaborative effort working toward a more sustainable food and agricultural system for the United States.  In addition to advancing policy initiatives, Mr. Munson has helped the coalitions resist pressure from other regions to cut funding for programs that are most important to the Northeast and Midwest--and oversaw the institute's hallmark reports that reveal the flow of Federal funds to States. His leadership in the perennial fight for the Low--Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, helped the coalitions sustain funding for the program and add an extra $1 billion for LIHEAP in 2006. Working with the coalitions and Senate and House manufacturing task forces, the institute helped rescue the Manufacturing Extension Partnership from elimination preserving a program that boosts manufacturing capacity throughout our region.  Mr. Munson came to the institute from the Center for Renewable Resources and Solar Lobby, where he served as executive director from 1979 to 1983. With his departure from the institute, I wish him luck on his new endeavor as a cofounder of a new company--Recycled Energy Development--that seeks to bring to fruition many of the ideas that have been his passion for 30 years.                          ____________________
