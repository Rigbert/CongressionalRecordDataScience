Speaker, I rise today to recognize ``Navy Day,'' observed on October 27th, and to pay tribute to the impressive work done at the naval bases in my district, Patuxent River Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian Head Surface Warfare Center and St. Inigoes. The Fifth Congressional District's naval bases are critical facilities that help our nation meet the threats and challenges of a new century, and their geographic proximity to the nation's capital also makes them valuable homeland security assets as well. I would like to take the observation of ``Navy Day'' to salute their efforts and to acknowledge the vital roles and important military capabilities performed at these three facilities.  Navy Day was established on October 27, 1922 by the Navy League of the United States. October 27 was suggested by the Navy League to recognize Theodore Roosevelt's birthday. Roosevelt had been an Assistant Secretary of the Navy and supported a strong Navy as well as the idea of Navy Day. In addition, October 27 was the anniversary of a 1775 report issued by a special committee of the Continental Congress favoring the purchase of merchant ships as the foundation of an American Navy.  As a community, we owe special thanks to the members of the naval family that sacrifice their own safety to protect our nation. They define the spirit of public service and we are grateful for their past and present services. Over the past several months, in Iraq and around the world, their purpose has been the protection and security of our people, and the promotion of peace, stability and the rule of law in Iraq, the Middle East and the international community, and they should know that a grateful nation supports their service and sacrifice.  We celebrate Navy Day in commemoration of past and present servicemen and women of the Navy as they have fought the enemies of freedom and prevailed. Their courage and resolve is fundamental to our security and way of life. Navy Day gives us the opportunity to appreciate their achievements and gain inspiration from their bravery. They succeed because they are dedicated to the values of this country and to its national security in the face of global terrorism.  The Navy plays a key role in the lives of thousands of Maryland residents, and thus I continue to place the future of the Navy in Maryland as one of my highest priorities. As the Department of Defense, the White House and Congress prepare for the next round of base closings in 2005, I am certain that the overwhelming support of the community, the important three-way partnership between federal, state, and local officials necessary to protect this powerful economic engine for the state, and the valuable homeland security assets of these bases prove the important contributions to our nation's defense and prosperity of Southern Maryland's defense installations.  May God continue to bless our country and may God continue to bless the men and women of the fifth districts Naval bases.                          ____________________
