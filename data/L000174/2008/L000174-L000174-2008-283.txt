President, as I listened yesterday to the partisan rhetoric we continue to hear from Senate Republicans on nominations, I am disappointed that the Republican leader is ignoring the majority leader's statement from last May 10.  Today is April Fools' Day. I do not think the American people are fooled or amused by continued partisan bickering over nominations. Indeed, with a massive subprime mortgage crisis that has left so many Americans in dire straights, fearful of losing their homes, the Republican efforts to create an issue over judicial nominees is misplaced. In fact, I have been working hard to make progress and have treated this President's nominees more fairly than Republicans treated those of President Clinton. Judicial nominations are not the most pressing problem facing the country. Indeed, we have worked hard to lower vacancies to the lowest levels in decades. We have cut circuit vacancies in half.  It should be no surprise that the administration would rather focus on having a partisan political fight than the news that, in February, the United States lost 63,000 jobs. To make up for those and other job losses in recent months thanks to this President's policies, this country would need to create 200,000 jobs every month. This administration is apparently more worried about the jobs of a handful of controversial nominees, many without the necessary support of their home State senators, than the loss of jobs by thousands of American workers.  Unemployment is up over 20 percent, the price of gas has more than doubled and is now at a record high average of over $3.20, trillions of dollars in budget surplus have been turned into trillions of dollars of debt with an annual budget deficit of hundreds of millions of dollars, and the trade deficit has nearly doubled to almost $1 trillion. Indeed, just to pay down the interest on the national debt and the massive costs generated by the disastrous war in Iraq--the fifth anniversary of which we tragically marked 2 weeks ago--costs more than $1 billion a day. That is $365 billion each year that would be better spent on priorities like health care for all Americans, better schools, and fighting crime and treating diseases at home and abroad.  Perhaps the only thing that has gone down during the Bush Presidency is judicial vacancies. After the Republican Senate chose to stall consideration of circuit nominees and maintain vacancies during the Clinton administration in anticipation of a Republican Presidency, judicial vacancies rose to over 100. Circuit vacancies doubled during the Clinton years. Since I became Judiciary chairman in 2001, we have worked to cut those vacancies in half.  In the Clinton years, Senator Hatch justified the slow progress by pointing to the judicial vacancy rate. When the vacancy rate stood at 7.2 percent, Senator Hatch declared that ``there is and has been no judicial vacancy crisis'' and that this was a ``rather low percentage of vacancies that shows the judiciary is not suffering from an overwhelming number of vacancies.'' Because of Republican inaction, the vacancy rate continued to rise, reaching nearly 10 percent at the end of President Clinton's term. The number of circuit court vacancies rose to 32 with retirements of Republican appointed circuit judges immediately after President Bush took office.  Then, as soon as a Republican President was elected they sought to turn the tables and take full advantage of the vacancies they prevented from being filled during the Clinton Presidency. They have been extraordinarily successful over the past dozen years. Currently, more than 60 percent of active judges on the Federal circuit courts were appointed by Republican Presidents, and more than 35 percent have been appointed by this President. The Senate has already confirmed three-quarters of this President's circuit court nominees, compared to only half of President Clinton's.  I was here in 1999 when the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee would not hold a hearing for a single judicial nominee until June. In contrast, we have scheduled 3 hearings on 11 nominees so far this year. We have a circuit nominee from Texas listed on the Judiciary Committee agenda this week. I wrote to the President during the last recess commending him for nominating someone for a Virginia vacancy to the Fourth Circuit who is supported by Senator Warner and Senator Webb, a Republican and a Democrat, and indicated that I would use my best efforts to proceed to that nomination as soon as the paperwork is submitted. I will ask that a copy of that letter be printed in the Record at the end of my statement. In that letter, I also informed the President that an anonymous Republican hold had prevented Senate confirmation of the President's nominees to be the Associate Attorney General, the No. 3 position at DOJ, and the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division.  Since the resignations of the entire top leadership at the Department of Justice last year in the wake of the scandals of the Gonzales era, I have made restoring the leadership ranks at the Department a priority. Since September, the committee has held seven hearings on executive nominations, including a 2-day hearing for the Attorney General. The Attorney General and the new Deputy Attorney General have been confirmed. But for Republican delays in refusing to cooperate and make a quorum in February, and now the anonymous hold, the Senate would have confirmed two more high-level DOJ nominees.  The partisan rhetoric on nominations rings especially hollow in light of the progress we have made. Last year, the Senate confirmed 40 judges, including 6 circuit judges. The 40 confirmations were more than during any of the 3 preceding years with Republicans in charge. The Senate has now confirmed 140 judges in the almost 3 years it has been run by Democrats and only 158 judges in the more than 4 years it was run by Republicans.  We continue to make progress. Four district court nominations are pending on the Senate's Executive Calendar. I have mentioned the nomination to the Fifth Circuit that is pending on the Judiciary Committee's agenda this week. I have already announced and noticed another hearing this Thursday for four more judicial nominees, two from Virginia and two from Missouri, and for the nominee to be the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Policy. This will be the Judiciary Committee's fifth confirmation hearing this year.  With respect to the recent nomination of Steven Agee to a Virginia seat in the Fourth Circuit, it is regrettable that Justice Agee's nomination only comes after months of delay when the White House insisted on sending to the Senate the nomination of Duncan Getchell. That nomination did not have the support of either of the Virginia Senators and was withdrawn after the Virginia Senators objected publicly. In fact, the delay in filling that vacancy has lasted years because this President insisted on sending forward highly controversial nominations like William Haynes, Claude Allen, and Duncan Getchell.  In my letter to the President, I wrote that I expect the Judiciary Committee and the Senate to proceed promptly to consider and confirm Justice Agee's nomination with the support of Senator Warner and Senator Webb, just as we proceeded last year to confirm the nomination of Judge Randy Smith to the Ninth Circuit, once the President had withdrawn his nomination for a California seat and resubmitted it for a vacancy from Idaho. I urged the President to use the Agee nomination as a model for working with home State senators and Senators from both sides of the aisle. Time is running short.  Senate Democrats should not and have not acted the way Republicans did by pocket filibustering more than 60 ofPresident Clinton's nominees. I would rather see us work with the President on the selection of nominees that the Senate can proceed to confirm than waste precious time fighting about controversial nominees who he selects in order to score political points. I would also rather see the Senate focus on addressing the real priorities of the country rather than catering only to an extreme wing of the Republican base with controversial nominees.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter to which I referred be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                   Washington, DC, March 20, 2008.     Hon. George W. Bush,     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: I write again, as I did last November,      to demonstrate my willingness to work constructively with you      in accordance with the Senate's important role in the      consideration of your nominees to high-ranking positions in      the executive branch and to lifetime appointments on our      Federal courts.       Since last September, the Senate Judiciary Committee has      been hard at work seeking to help restore the Department of      Justice. The leadership ranks at the Department of Justice      were decimated by the scandals of the Gonzales era. The      Judiciary Committee's hearing last week was the seventh      hearing we have held since September on executive      nominations. The Senate has proceeded to confirm a new      Attorney General, a new Deputy Attorney General, and numerous      other nominations to fill high-ranking positions at the      Justice Department.       I regret to inform you that we were stalled last week in      our efforts to fill two other critical positions at the      Department, when an anonymous Republican hold blocked      confirmation of Kevin O'Connor to be the Associate Attorney      General, and Gregory Katsas to be the Assistant Attorney      General in charge of the Civil Division. I was particularly      disappointed with this unexpected development. We had worked      hard to expedite these nominations, holding a hearing on the      first day of this session of Congress. After a nearly month-     long delay, when Republican Members of the Judiciary      Committee effectively boycotted our business meetings in      February, we were able to report these nominations to the      Senate in early March. They were set for confirmation before      the Easter recess, until the last-minute Republican objection      stalled them. They join your nomination of Michael Sullivan      to be the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,      Firearms and Explosives as among those stymied by Republican      objections. I trust at any future White House event on the      status of nominations you will point out that several of your      high-level executive nominations are being stalled by      Republican objections.       With respect to judicial nominations, I want to commend you      for working with Senators Warner and Webb to identify a      nominee from those they recommended to you to fill a Virginia      Fourth Circuit vacancy.       Your previous nominations from Virginia, William Haynes,      Claude Allen and Duncan Getchell, were controversial and did      not proceed. Following your withdrawal of the Getchell      nomination earlier this year, I urged you to work with the      Virginia Senators. I now thank you for doing so.       I expect your nomination of Steven Agee to be considered      promptly following completion of the necessary paperwork. I      want to encourage meaningful consultation with Senators of      both parties. Just as we proceeded last year to confirm your      nomination of Judge Randy Smith to the Ninth Circuit, once      you had withdrawn his nomination for a California seat and      resubmitted it for a vacancy from Idaho, I expect the      Judiciary Committee and the Senate to proceed to confirm      Justice Agee with the support of Senator Warner and Senator      Webb. I urge you to work with Senators from other states, as      well, so that we might make progress before time runs out on      your Presidency and the Thurmond Rule precludes additional      confirmations.       Your judicial nominations have fared far better than those      of your Democratic predecessor. Nearly 90 percent of your      nominations have been confirmed to lifetime appointments.      Approximately three-quarters of your circuit nominations,      compared to little more than half of President Clinton's      circuit court nominations, have been confirmed. We have      succeeded in reducing overall vacancies and circuit court      vacancies to as few as half as many as during President      Clinton's term. With four more judicial nominations on the      Senate's Executive Calendar and another pending on the Senate      Judiciary agenda, I am proceeding to notice another hearing      for judicial nominees for the week immediately following the      Easter recess. That will be our fifth nominations hearing so      far this year.           Respectfully,                                                    Patrick Leahy,     Chairman.                          ____________________
