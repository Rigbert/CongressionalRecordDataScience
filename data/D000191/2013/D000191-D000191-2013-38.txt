Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  As someone who represents rural, forested communities that depend on our national forests, this is an issue I care deeply about. I know my colleagues on the other side care deeply about this, too. We have many common concerns in terms of forest health, in terms of fuel reduction, in terms of dealing with bug infestations and other things.  There is, I think, a common interest in finding solutions to better manage our Federal forests. Millions of acres are in need of restoration to address disease, bugs, climate change, and fire, which was made painfully clear again this summer.  We need a long-term plan to provide for our rural forested counties. Right now, many of these counties are struggling to stay afloat. Counties in my district, for example, are near bankruptcy. Critical county services like public health, education, roads, and, most importantly, law enforcement have been slashed to the point where some counties have no rural sheriff's patrols and prisoners have been let out of jail, prisoners who should not be let out of jail.  The Federal Government made a commitment to these counties 100 years ago. Congress should honor that commitment. I think there are bipartisan ways to honor that commitment.  The inclusion of 1 year of county payments at fiscal year 2010 levels--substantially more than those proposed in recent legislation in the Senate--will provide a lifeline to more than 600 forested counties in 41 States.  I want to thank the chairman for his hard work on this provision in the bill. Any long-term solution on forest management will require bridge payments to counties. This bill provides a bridge payment.  This bill includes an extension of stewardship contracting authority and allows our Federal agencies to offer contracts up to 20 years. Stewardship contracts can help reduce the cost of restoration to our Federal agencies--and, thus, the U.S. taxpayer--to help treat large landscapes to prevent catastrophic wildfires we saw in the West this summer and provide predictability to local businesses and industry that incentivizes investment and creates jobs.  I met with a gentleman who is going to open a 2.5 megawatt biomass plant in Colorado in November. He is doing that with a 10-year stewardship contract on dead bug kill in the vicinity of his plant. It was done through a collaborative process. The result is the Forest Service will be able to do fuel reduction on twice as much acreage as if they had to appropriate taxpayer money to do it. He told me if that was extended to 20 years, which this bill does, that the cost would come down even more. So we would create electricity and make these forests more healthy by utilizing that biomass.  I particularly want to thank the chairman for working with Representative Walden, Representative Schrader, and myself to include our balanced, bipartisan solution for the statutorily unique O&C lands. These lands exist nowhere else in the country. They are historically, statutorily, and geographically unique.  The solution we came up with for these unique lands would not be appropriate for other land included in the larger bill. I spent many hours with Representative Walden and Representative Schrader and with you, Mr. Chairman, to work out a reasonable and fair solution to an incredibly complex and longstanding controversy in western Oregon. I admit it's not a perfect solution. There are things I would change. There are things that Representative Walden would change. There are things that Representative Schrader would change, and, Mr. Chairman, I'm certain there are things that you would have done differently. But that's the legislative process at its best. We did the best we could do and came up with a strong proposal. It's an Oregon solution to an Oregon problem, and I am pleased to see it included in this legislation.  That doesn't mean that I don't have strong concerns about other provisions in the underlying bill. I do. Members should know that H.R. 1526 would dramatically alter the way we manage our national forest system and would threaten the multiuse mission on our public lands.  The bill would establish ``timber production zones'' in every national forest and more than double timber harvest levels nationwide. In order to meet these targets, Federal forest managers would be required to allow logging and road building in current roadless areas and sharply curtail public review of proposed logging projects.  The bill would close the courthouse door to citizens concerned about their communities and quality of life in the neighboring forests by requiring plaintiffs to post bonds, a new precedent, in order to challenge Federal management decisions.  I have had communities in my district litigate against the Forest Service over timber projects that they felt threaten their drinking water supply. I have had the timber industry litigate, as we have had environmental groups. It doesn't mean it is not frustrating, but we can work on streamlining that process without shutting the door to the courthouse, as we did in the HFRA legislation, a bipartisan bill a number of years ago.  This bill would also devolve national forest management currently under the stewardship of the Forest Service to State boards and exempt these areas from major national environmental laws.  The practical impact would be to reverse 100 years of national forest precedent and undermine--or in some cases, eliminate--multiple use of the national forests over substantial parts of our forest, harming recreation, hunting, fishing, and tourism.                              {time}  1830  H.R. 1526 represents the largest proposed change to the modern Forest Service since it was created by Gifford Pinchot and Theodore Roosevelt in 1905.  I want to reiterate that the Democrats stand ready to work with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle on forest management. There is common ground. There is bipartisan agreement on some issues. Hopefully, this bill is the beginning of that conversation, not the end, as we attempt to have a real legislative process with the Senate on these issues.  With that, Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                                     Wasco County,                               Board of County, Commissioners,                            The Dalles, Oregon, September 4, 2013.     Congressman Doc Hastings,     Chairman Natural Resources Committee,     Washington, DC.     Congressman Peter DeFazio,     Ranking Member, Natural Resources Committee, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Hastings and Ranking Member DeFazio: In      America's national forests money and jobs do grow on trees. A      failed Federal Forest management system has led to the loss      of thousands of family wage jobs and has left our rural      forested counties with a host of preventable social and      economic problems that need to be addressed; action is long      overdue. For most Oregon counties the only solution is to      return to a sustainable harvest level that provides reliable      family-wage jobs and provides a solid tax base to support      crucial services.       There are three main recurring themes choking sustainable      forest management:       1. Litigation that stalls or prevents much of the harvest      necessary for responsible, sustainable forest management.       2. Funding to prepare sales.       3. The environmental analysis and review time for      management activities.       An increase in sustainable forest management is essential      if we are to ever create and support the healthy forests      envisioned by President Theodore Roosevelt. The Forest      mortality we are facing destroys wildlife habitat and creates      a platform for catastrophic wildfires that leave millions of      forest acres bare and susceptible to erosion and extensive      insect infestation.       H.R. 1526 provides a common sense approach for returning to      sustainable forest management where planned harvests occur at      a reasonable pace. While we appreciate legislation that      allows for a temporary extension of the Secure Rural Schools      and Community Self Determination Act, the long term social      and financial health of rural forested communities depends on      family-wage jobs that stem from a healthy forest products      industry. Wasco County fully supports H.R. 1526 and will      contact our House members to speak in support of and vote for      the bill.     Rod Runyon,       Chair.

Myers and County Commissioners      Boyd Britton and Chris Labhart; and       Whereas, the Grant County Court recognizes that Oregonians      in our forested communities are facing extreme poverty,      systemic unemployment, and thousands of children on free and      reduced lunch; and       Whereas, Grant County, Oregon currently faces 12.20%      unemployment; and       Whereas, 51.6% of school children in Grant County are      eligible for free or reduced lunch programs; and       Whereas, Grant County's poverty rate is 15.8%; and       Whereas, these negative economic conditions can be      attributed to the reduction in timber harvests in our      National forests (93.78% reduction over the past 30 years)      and corresponding mill closures; and       Whereas, Grant County cannot afford for any more mills to      close and desire to recover our lost mill capacity; and       Whereas, H.R. 1526 is a bipartisan effort that aims to put      people back to work in the woods, reduce litigation, provide      certainty for counties so that they can provide essential      services, lift families out of poverty, and prevent      catastrophic wildfires that we have been experiencing,       Now therefore, be it Resolved, the Grant County Court      hereby resolves to support H.R. 1526, Restoring Healthy      Forests for Healthy Communities Act, and urge all member of      the U.S. House of Representatives to support the passage and      implementation of this important legislation.       Done and dated this 18th day of September, 2013.     Scott W. Myers,       County Judge.     Chris B. Labhart,       County Commissioner.

Hon. Greg Walden,     House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Representative Walden: I am writing this letter in      support of HR1526. HR1526 aims to put people back to work in      the woods, reduce litigation, and provide certainty for      counties so that they can provide essential services, lift      families out of poverty, and prevent catastrophic wildfires      that we have been experiencing. Last year, 10 times as many      Forest Service acres burned as were harvested. 2.8 million      acres--a size equivalent to all of Grant County.       One thing is clear. The status quo in our federal forest      policy is not working for our forests, and it is certainly      not working for the families in our rural communities.       Even though we are a county without any Federal Forest      Service Land, we recognize the benefits that can be realized      here by the success of our neighbors Wheeler and Morrow      Counties.           Sincerely,                                                    Steve Shaffer,                                             Gilliam County Judge.                                       ____                                                     Curry County,                                       Board of Commissioners,                           Gold Beach, Oregon, September 16, 2013.       Dear Members of Oregon's House of Representatives: We are      writing to request your support for HR 1526, the Restoring      Healthy Forests for Healthy Communities Act, and ask that you      vote in favor of this bill when the opportunity arises. HR      1526 would renew the commitment to manage federal forests for      the benefit of counties impacted by federal forestland,      improve forest health and help prevent catastrophic      wildfires.       Oregon continues to lose infrastructure and jobs due to      federal policies that have strangled sustainable management      of a renewable resource. We are harvesting less than five      percent of the annual growth in federal forests, resulting in      overstocked stands and conditions ripe for wildfire. HR 1526      would permit responsible, limited timber production on Forest      Service lands, would allow significant state and local      involvement, and would separately address management of the      unique O&C Lands by incorporating the bipartisan solution      crafted by Representatives DeFazio, Schrader and Walden. The      bill also would allow cooperative state and federal fire      mitigation projects in areas that cross ownership boundaries.       The expiration of the Secure Rural Schools (SRS) program in      2012 has resulted in drastic budget shortfalls in our      Counties. HR 1526 provides one year of bridge funding at the      SRS 2010 level, allowing transition to more active forest      management and a return to shared revenues from forest      management. These revenues would provide schools with      substantial funding and support public safety, road      maintenance, and social service programs. Improved management      and restoration of the nation's forests will generate      tremendous environmental and social benefits and create      desperately needed jobs and revenue for rural economies.       Thank you for your support of Oregon counties and schools      and for your consideration of this request.           Sincerely,     David Itzen,       Commissioner.
