 President, I commend the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. DeMint, for his amendment dealing with travel and spending. If we can save millions of dollars by people not flying first class, and so forth, and abusing the system, we ought to do it. The spirit of this amendment is good and I hope we can all vote on that at 12 noon, when we have agreed to do so. I commend him for offering the amendment. It will be good law for us to follow.
