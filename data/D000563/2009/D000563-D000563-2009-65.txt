President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business, it adjourn until 11 a.m., Friday, December 18; that the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate resume consideration of the House message with respect to H.R. 3326, the Department of Defense appropriations bill, postcloture, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each; that following any leader remarks, the time until 12 o'clock be equally divided between the two leaders or their designees, and with the time from 12 o'clock until 4 p.m. equally divided and controlled in 30-minute alternating blocks of time, with the Republicans controlling the first block and the majority controlling the next block.  Further, I ask that the time until 4 p.m. count postcloture.
