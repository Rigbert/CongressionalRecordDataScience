Mr. Speaker, I want to add my voice to those who commemorate the 20'' anniversary of the founding of Solidarity and join as a co-sponsor of this resolution, H. Con. Res 416. Significantly, one of the original 21 demands of the Gdansk workers was a call for the implementation of the Helsinki Final Act. As Chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I therefore take special satisfaction in hailing one of the success stories of the Helsinki process.  Stalin is reputed to have once said that trying to impose communism on Poland was like trying to put a saddle on a cow. Certainly, there were few places in Central Europe where communism was more unwelcome and unnatural. The peaceful dismantlement of a totalitarian system imposed by force is testimony to the heroism, ingenuity, and integrity of Solidarity activists and the millions of Solidarity's supporters throughout the country.  Of course, the events at the Gdansk shipyard in the summer of 1980 were the continuation--and elevation--of the opposition to communism that was the inevitable by-product of communism itself in Poland, from the workers' strikes in Poznan in 1956, to the university dissent in 1968, to the Gdansk riots of 1970. But Solidarity was unique in two critical ways. First, it established an unprecedented union between workers and intellectuals, making the whole more than the sum of the parts. Second, it evolved into a mass movement, drawing support from all segments of society. With the critical support of the Catholic Church, Solidarity came to embody the hopes and aspirations not only of the people of Poland, but of dissidents and democrats throughout the region. When Lech Walesa was awarded the Nobel Peace prize, that award rightly recognized the achievements of an extraordinary individual as well as the historic role of the Solidarity movement itself and the people who comprised it.  Indeed, there are many well known heroes of this movement, in addition to Lech Walesa:Bronislaw Geremek, Adam Michnik, Wladislaw Frasyniuk, Bogdan Lis, Jacek Kuron, Anna Walentynowicz, Janusz Onyszkiewicz, to name but a few of the legions of Solidarity's activists. There were also martyrs, including Father Jerzy Popieluszko, and the miners and others who died when martial law was imposed in 1981. Millions of other Poles, in small ways and large, contributed to world freedom through their support of freedom in Poland.  Mr. Speaker, the resolution we support today seeks to honor them and their movement.                          ____________________
