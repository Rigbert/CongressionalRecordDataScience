Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, when the term ``genocide'' was created in 1944 to describe the systematic destruction of an entire people. Its author, Raphael Lemkin, explained the term by saying: ``It's the sort of thing Hitler did to the Jews and the Turks did to the Armenians.''  When he ordered the invasion of Poland in 1939, Adolf Hitler said: ``Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?''  Mr. Speaker, in the year 2000, and again in the year 2015, I chaired two congressional hearings on the Armenian genocide. In 2000, the House was moving to pass a bipartisan resolution by Congressmen Radanovich and Bonior, H. Res. 398.  After hearing fact-based, eloquent testimony from Congressmen James Rogan and David Bonior, followed by the State Department, history professors, and then witnesses from both the Armenian and the Turkish side, my subcommittee successfully marked up H. Res. 398 for consideration by the full committee.  Ambassador Marc Grossman, however, testified at the hearing that President Bill Clinton was against the Armenian genocide resolution. That opposition proved to be very significant, and as we were moving with the highest expectations toward passage, President Clinton's National Security Advisor, Sandy Berger, took the extraordinary step of admonishing Speaker Hastert not to bring it to the floor. And he caved. The resolution never even got a vote.  In 2007, Chairman Tom Lantos, like Chairman Henry Hyde before him, reported the resolution out of committee, sponsored by Congressmen Schiff and Radanovich; although it never got out of the committee in 2000, but he wanted it to. That was H. Res. 106. That too never made to the floor.  Mr. Speaker, that changes today. The Affirming the United States Record on the Armenian Genocide, H. Res. 296, is a sense of Congress resolution that commemorates the Armenian genocide through official recognition and remembrance.  The resolution wisely notes that the United States has officially recognized the Armenian genocide through the U.S. Government's May 1951 written statement to the International Court of Justice regarding the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide through President Ronald Reagan's proclamation, Number 4838, on April 22, 1981, and by H.J. Res. 148, adopted in 1975, and H.J. Res. 247, adopted in September of 1984.  The resolution also points out that the U.S. played a major role in the humanitarian relief efforts and, of course, the Near East Relief agency saved tens of thousands of Armenians and others. As a matter of fact, the historian, Howard Sachar, noted it ``quite literally kept an entire nation alive,'' and that is reflected in the resolution.  Yet, today, the Armenian genocide is the only genocide of the 20th century where survivors, family, and all those who care about this important issue, have been subjected to the ongoing outrage of a massive, well-funded, aggressive campaign of genocide denial, openly sustained and lavishly funded by the State authority, in this case, the Government of Turkey.  The Turkish Government underwrites a disgraceful disinformation campaign to confuse the historicalrecord. It often employs lobbyists in this town to carry that message forward.  Mr. Speaker, my 2015 hearing marked the 100th year since the beginning of the genocide; and I appropriately entitled it: A Century of Denial: The Armenian Genocide and the Ongoing Quest For Justice.  As Pope Francis said at his Mass marking the 100th year of genocide: ``Concealing or denying evil is like allowing a wound to keep bleeding without bandaging it.''  Mr. Speaker, the facts of the genocide were reported throughout the world as they were happening, corroborated immediately afterward by survivors and even some of the perpetrators, and have been amply documented by the historians, and in one particular book that I have read, by Ambassador Morgenthau, who was our U.S. Ambassador contemporaneously, at the time, to the Ottoman Empire.  In 1915, as we know, there were about 2 million Armenians living in what was then the Ottoman Empire, now Turkey. They were living in the region that they had inhabited for 2,500 years or more.  By 1923, however, over 90 percent of these Armenians had disappeared. Most of them, an estimated 1.5 million, were slaughtered. Most of them were death-marched into the desert, or shot, and many of the women were raped. The remainder, the remnant was forced into exile.  U.S. Ambassador Morgenthau wrote: ``When the Turkish authorities gave the orders for these deportations, they were merely giving the death warrant to a whole race; they understood this well, and, in their conversations with me, they made no particular attempt to conceal the fact.''  The Encyclopedia for the Armenian Genocide states: ``During the march, many Armenians were killed indiscriminately by Ottoman forces, which left a trail of corpses along the route of the march. To break the will of the marchers, the killings were performed with swords, resulting in great bloodshed.'' And as they continued the march, they were marched into the Syrian desert where they died from starvation.  At the Center for Holocaust, Human Rights & Genocide Education exhibit at Brookdale Community College, which my good friend and colleague from New Jersey, Mr. Pallone, knows so well as well, they have many remembrances of people in our State and elsewhere who were survivors.  Well, one of those survivors put it this way, and I quote her: ``Life was a matter of trying to survive. Every morning a cart would come around and take away the sick and the dead to be dumped into a common grave. They had taken my brother because he was a little sick. My crying and weeping were of no avail, especially because I was sick and petrified of being put on the cart.''  She was one of the lucky ones who survived.  Let me remind my colleagues that the Genocide Convention of 1950, which the Turkish Government has ratified, makes clear--here is what the Genocide Convention says, and the Armenian genocide fits this to a T.  The definition says this: ``Genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group, as such:  Killing members of the group;  Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of that group;  Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part. . . . `'                              {time}  1430  In the case of the Armenians, it wasn't in part. It was in whole. They wanted the Armenians eviscerated from the face of the Earth.  Let me just point out to my colleagues, despite Turkish Government threats--and they do make threats. At my hearing, the Ambassador made threats in the year 2000. Frank remembers that. It was outrageous.  Well, 28 countries and 49 U.S. States, including my own State of New Jersey, have passed a law, resolution, or declaration recognizing the Armenian genocide.  I ask Members to support this resolution. It is bipartisan, and it needs to be done.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
