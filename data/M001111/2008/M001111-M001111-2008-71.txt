 I have been paying these increased gas prices like my constituents. It is shocking. Last weekend I paid $4.45 a gallon to fill up my tank in my car. This is impacting absolutely everybody in my State, my region, just as it is the rest of the Nation.  My constituents say to me: I have been hearing all this talk about drilling. Please tell me that will bring my gas prices down.  I have told my constituents, as we all know--in fact, not just me but the Bush administration's Energy Information Office, this is the Bush administration: The impact on wellhead prices from opening the Pacific, the Atlantic, and the gulf waters to drilling ``is expected to be insignificant.'' I have not said that. This administration, the Bush administration's Energy Information Administration Office, has said that.  I say to my constituents, the drill, drill, drill or, as the Senator from North Dakota called it, ``the forever yesterday policy of drill, drill, drill,'' is not going to have a significant impact at all on their gas prices.  I thank the majority leader for coming forward with a package that we do believe will have an impact on gas prices and deal with the excessive speculation that is in the market today.  We met last week with a number of experts in this field. We have listened to our Republican counterparts as well who agree that speculation is an issue that we can all come together on and on which we can have an immediate impact in passing a bill.  I come to the Senate floor today to thank the majority leader and to ask him, as he puts this bill together, to deal with excessive speculation with the hope that it will, as the experts have told us, begin to reduce gas prices, that we as a caucus, and I hope as a Senate, will begin to look also at the longer term issues affecting energy and investing in alternative energy so we do not continue to be so dependent on oil.  I ask the majority leader his comments on that.
