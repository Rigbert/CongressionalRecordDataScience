Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I would just like to reference the kind remarks by my friend, the gentlewoman from Colorado. This is the start of the next Congress. We are certainly looking forward to governing in a bipartisan way. That is what our committee has done for hundreds of bills in the last number of years. I look forward to that continued partnership. I know Chairman Walden on the full committee looks forward to doing that as well.  This is just the first step, literally one of the first days, obviously, in the new Trump administration, but we look forward to working with the Senate to get this bill to the new administration and get it signed into law, showing, again, the bipartisan support.  I want to compliment my friend, my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), for his good work on this. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''  I yield back the balance of my time.
