President, I enjoyed very much the remarks of the Senator from Florida. He is very much concerned about this, very much plugged into the situation of what is happening in Ukraine, but I would like to make a couple of comments about that from a slightly different perspective, one that is from my current position as the ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee.  I would like to look at just one part of this proposal; that is, the money that would be coming out of the military to take care of a problem the military should not have to take care of at a time when things are very serious. The IMF has all the authority it needs to meet all of Ukraine's borrowing needs--that is the $35 billion--with its existing commitments from the global community. The IMF does not need additional U.S. funds to help Ukraine. It does not make sense to double the size of the IMF by ratifying a 2010 agreement, paying for it with money that could be used by DOD to address the shortfalls which I am going to talk about.  By the way, there is another option out there because the House has a bill. Chairman Royce of the House Foreign Affairs Committee is marking up a bill today as we are speaking that I believe addresses our response to Ukraine in a more responsible way. The House bill is likely to provide $68 billion in Ukraine aid that does not expand the IMF and removes it from the bans on LNG. This does not contain IMF reform. It does not take money from the DOD. I think that is good.  The Senator from Florida commented that we wouldn't be in the position we are in right now with the Europeans afraid to come to the aid of Ukraine if it weren't for the fact they are reliant upon Russia for their ability to produce LNG. We in this country have had a real boom in getting in the tight formations of the LNG. Right now we need to be exporting more of it to get the price up so it can be produced for ourselves in this country. No better way than to start exporting this to countries such as Ukraine. If we are doing this, the Western European countries would not be reliant upon Russia for that ability.  I think we have an opportunity there to do something with this bill, and hopefully we will be able to satisfy the needs of Ukraine and at the same time not provide further damage to our military.  I recognize that out of the $315 million pricetag in total aid for the package, it rightly cuts $150 million from the State Department. That is true. That is where it should come from. But it also then takes an equal amount--$150 million--away from the Department of Defense to double the size of IMF in order to give authority that isn't actually required for the IMF to adequately loan to Ukraine, and should not be included as part of this bill.  The unnecessary proposed $157 million of defense rescission to pay for this aid has already been used by OMB, the Office of Management and Budget, and by the DOD, Department of Defense, to build the current defense budget. These funds have already been spent and we cannot get any more out of the military right now. If Defense is forced to pay for this aid, then the services will likely have to reduce their readiness accounts.  Readiness accounts mean lives because we talk about risk. If we are not ready, to the degree we are not ready, we incur more risk, and risk is translated into lives. Our national security funding can't be treated like an ATM. Mr. President, $157 million can be used to support critical defense readiness needs, such as an Army brigade combat team for 6 months, 1,000 Marine embassy security personnel for 1\1/2\ years, about 2 months of the O&M for a second carrier air wing or almost two F-16 squadrons for 1 year.  What has happened to the military, if only people out there would understand, and they do not--there are a lot of Republicans and Democrats both out there not talking about this, the most serious problem we are facing in this country--is what the Obama administration has done to our military.  I remember so well 5 years ago going to Afghanistan so I could respond to the President's budget, which was at that time talking about what he was going to be doing to the military. I knew he would begin 5 years ago to start disarming America, and what did he do. He did away with our only fifth-generation fighter, the F-22; he did away with our carrier capability, the C-17; did away with our future combat system; and he did away with our ground-based interceptor in Poland. Of course, we are desperately looking for something to protect the Eastern part of the United States as a result of that. That was all in the first year, the first step in disarming America.  Since that time, the President in his budget has taken out of the military some $487 billion. If he goes through with his sequestration, it will be another one-half billion dollars.  People don't realize where this all started. They will say: Wait a minute. It is just entitlements. Entitlements are a problem, because 60 percent of the total budget goes to entitlements. But keep in mind, there is also discretionary spending which is nondefense discretionary spending. When this President took office, the first thing done was to take $800 billion for a stimulus, none of which was used for the military. That obligated us on nondefense discretionary spending for the rest of the time at the expense of defense. So now we are in a situation which is so serious in this country that even our military leaders have come out and made statements. People have to understand how critical this situation is and how we have disarmed this country.  Secretary Hagel 2 weeks ago said:       American dominance on the seas, in the skies, and in space      can no longer be taken for granted.  Is this America? We have taken this for granted since World War II, and all of a sudden--because of what has happened through this administration to the military in the last 5 years--we can no longer do this.  General Amos, head of the Marines, agrees with me on increased risk:       We will have fewer forces arriving less-trained, arriving      later to the fight. . . . This is a formula for more American      casualties.  We just said when the risk increases, then our very brave troops die.  Under Secretary Frank Kendall of this administration, on January 3, said:       We're cutting our budget substantially while some of the      people we worry about are going in the opposite direction.      We've had 20 years since the end of the cold war [and sort]      of a presumption in the United States that we are      technologically superior militarily.  That is not the case now.  The top military person, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Dempsey, was appointed to the position by President Obama. He said to our committee, the Armed Services Committee, that we are putting our military on a path where the ``force is so degraded and so unready'' that it would be ``immoral to use the force.''  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff: Immoral to use the force. This is supposed to be America. We are supposed to be a superior country. What has happened to us?  Admiral Winnefeld, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the second highest position, stated:       [t]here could be for the first time in my career instances      where we may be asked to respond to a crisis and we will have      to say that we cannot.  Unfortunately, this is something which not many people are aware of in terms of what we are doing.  Yes, we want to do what we can for Ukraine, and we believe the State Department certainly has an obligation. But the other half of the amount, the $157 million, cannot come from the military because we are so unready today.  When we are considering this, we have to consider we have a real serious problem with our military. Unfortunately, people are not aware of this, and a lot of politicians don't talk about it because they are uncomfortable talking about it.                        Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby
