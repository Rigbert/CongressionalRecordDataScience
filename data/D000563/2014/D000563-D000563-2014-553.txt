President, on February 28, 2014, August Schaefer, better known as Gus, stepped down from his post as chief safety officer of Underwriters Laboratories, after dedicating 41 years to the company.  Underwriters Laboratories is an independent safety certification organization that tests products, conducts factory inspections, and writes standards for safety. Gus has served in many leadership roles during his time at UL, but in all capacities he has been dedicated to promoting public safety.  Under his leadership, UL launched the Firefighter Safety Research Institute which works to provide first responders and firefighters with additional information on burning buildings and the behavior of specific materials in fires.  In 2012, Mr. Schaefer shared his expertise on the safety and effectiveness of flame retardant chemicals as he testified before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government. His testimony on the effectiveness of flame retardant chemicals and furniture flammability standards was a significant contribution to the hearing.  Mr. Schaefer also worked to have UL, as part of a partnership with Disney, bring safety education campaigns to children all over the world through the Safety Smart Ambassador Program. The program's video campaign educates children on fire safety, personal safety, water safety, health, environmental protection, and online safety.  UL, under his guidance, expanded its operations overseas. In response to a growing number of imports, UL has increased its presence in Asia, where it tests products intended for consumers in the United States. UL also has expanded its safety outreach to India, establishing an annual Road Safety Council where fire officials work to solve challenges in a developing nation.  Mr. Schaefer's service in Illinois is felt well beyond product safety and testing. Under his leadership, UL established annual Living the Mission Celebrations, which encourage UL staff to spend a day volunteering in the community.  Gus Schaefer's leadership at UL has made the world a better--and safer-- place. When we use products approved by Underwriters Labs, we thank Gus Schaefer. I thank him for his many years of service and wish him the best in his retirement.                          ____________________
