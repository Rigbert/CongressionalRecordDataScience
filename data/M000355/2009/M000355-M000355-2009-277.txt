 President, I wish to take a moment to congratulate the senior Senator from Oregon for his extraordinary contribution to this most important topic. He has been open. He has been convinced of the need for bipartisanship and has been entirely constructive throughout this process, and we look forward to continuing our conversations in the weeks and months to come.
