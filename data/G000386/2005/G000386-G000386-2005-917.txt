 President, I rise today to honor a fallen Army soldier, SGT Javier Marin, Jr., of the A Company, 2nd Battalion, 2nd Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division. Sergeant Marin died on the 24th of January, 2005, in Mohammed Sacran, Iraq, when his military vehicle overturned into a nearby canal. He had just turned 29 years old on the 21st of January. Sergeant Marin is survived by his mother, Leslie Marin, and his sister, Evalina Marin, who live in Storm Lake, IA, as well as his father, Javier Marin, Sr., and many more family members and friends.  This simple tribute does not do justice to the immense courage and patriotism exemplified by SGT Javier Marin, Jr. In times of war and conflict such as this, it is often difficult to appreciate the gravity of a single loss in the midst of the increasing numbers of those who have given their lives. However, it is important that we take the time to reflect upon the lives of each of the men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice for the peace and freedom of the United States and the world. Today we honor the life of Sergeant Marin as we contemplate the ideals of liberty and democracy for which he fought and sacrificed. SGT Javier Marin, Jr., and all the men and women who have lost their lives in service to their country will have our eternal gratitude. My prayers are with Javier's family and friends and my most heart-felt appreciation goes to the late SGT Javier Marin, Jr.                          ____________________
