Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the language found on page 26, beginning on line 9 and continuing to line 10 which states ``That notwithstanding any other provision of law'' and also against the language found on page 26, beginning on line 15 and continuing to line 16 which states ``together with $50 million transferred from ``Federal Transit Administration, Formula grants''; this clause ``notwithstanding any other provision of law'' explicitly supersedes existing law and clearly constitutes legislation on appropriations bill in violation of clause 2 of rule XXI of the rules of the House of Representatives.  This language on lines 15 and 16 transferring $50 million provided by TEA-21 for Clean Fuels Bus formula grants program to the transit bus discretionary capitol investment grant program affects the total transit program outlays for fiscal year 2002, which violates section 8101 of Public Law 105-178 and supersedes existing law.  This language clearly constitutes legislation on an appropriations bill in violation of rule XXI of the rules of the House of Representatives.
