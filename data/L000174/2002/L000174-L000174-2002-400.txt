I say to the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma that while he was off the floor attending to other duties, I laid out some plans and intentions for the handling of judicial nominees, including those for the courts of appeals--I believe those are some of those mentioned--including Mr. Estrada and others were referenced. With adequate cooperation, we will be able to move forward. We held hearings yesterday on another court of appeals nominee, Michael Melloy, of Iowa; as well as hearings on Robert Blackburn, to be U.S. district judge for the District of Colorado; and James Gritzner, to be U.S. district court judge for the Southern District of Iowa; and Cindy K. Jorgenson, to be U.S. district judge for the District of Arizona; and Richard J. Leon, to be U.S. district judge for the District of Columbia; and Jay C. Zainey, to be U.S. district judge for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Those hearings were held within 28 hours of coming back into session.
