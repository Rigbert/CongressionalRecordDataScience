 President, let me add to the majority leader's observation that with regard to the U.S. attorneys bill this morning, we have copies of a couple of amendments that will be offered to that bill. That should allow us to go forward with the unanimous consent agreement, as I indicated to the majority leader yesterday, which may allow us to vitiate cloture on that measure.
