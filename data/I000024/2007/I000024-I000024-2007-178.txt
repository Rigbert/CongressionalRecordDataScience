It is a part that we have, subtitle A, about 4 pages, talking about trying to make the permitting process more streamlined. And that is where I used the statement from Senator Feinstein, who certainly agrees when she says: I can see where a cumbersome permitting process with uncertain outcomes would make it difficult to plan and implement projects.  Well, that is just one of the many things that we are trying to correct with this bill. Again, I have responded to all of the other statements that were made. I would repeat in terms of the environment, I am going to go ahead and submit for the Record at this point, along with the letter on the EDAs, a letter from the Environmental Council of the States, when they state very specifically: The bill does not weaken the standards and allows each State to choose its best course for most matters.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                             Environmental Council                                                of the States,                                 Washington, DC, October 25, 2005.     Re S. 1772 Gas PRICE Act.     Hon. James M. Inhofe,     Chairman, Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works,          Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. James M. Jeffords,     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Environment and Public          Works, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Inhofe and Senator Jeffords: I am writing to      provide comments on behalf of the Environmental Council of      the States (ECOS) on the above bill. ECOS is the national,      non-partisan association of the States' environmental agency      leadership.       We appreciate the Senate's desire to address the      shortcomings of the nation's refinery processes exposed by      the recent hurricanes and hope our comments assist you.       States implement most of the federal environmental statutes      on behalf of the federal government, including most programs      that regulate the nation's refmeries. These include the Clean      Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation      and Recovery Act. States issue most of the environmental      permits pursuant to these Acts, as well as conducting the      inspections, monitoring and enforcement.       While each State's opinions may vary over the details of      the bill, we can agree that the bill takes an approach that      we would like to see in more legislation. I speak here of the      ``opt-in'' feature.       In this approach, the Governor of each State decides      whether the benefits the bill provides are appropriate for      the State. This includes the streamlined permits approach,      the judicial review of such arrangements (Title II), and the      fuels waiver (Title IV). Some concern remains about the      special fuels provisions. We appreciate that within Title IV      a state would be held harmless under section 110 to account      for the emissions from a waiver granted by the Administrator      at the request of that State. We would not expect such      emissions to significantly contribute to another state's air      quality issues, but would note that the protection afforded      should be limited to that extent.       ECOS has long emphasized the need for the flexibility that      allows each State to tailor its environmental programs      according to its needs. This bill does not weaken the      standards and allows each State to choose its best course on      most of the matters detailed in the bill.       Our primary reservation is that the bill, if passed, not be      conferenced with the recent Gasoline Security Act of 2005,      passed by the House.           Sincerely,                                                Stephanie Hallock,                                                        President.
