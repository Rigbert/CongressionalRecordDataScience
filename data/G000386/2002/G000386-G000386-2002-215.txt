 President, I have sent a second-degree amendment to the desk in place of the Dayton amendment. I am going to debate that in just a little while, but I want everybody to know the situation.  Also, Senator Baucus and I are going to visit with various people to see if there is a smooth way of handling both the substitute as well as the original amendment. We may not be successful, but that is our desire. We are going to be talking while this debate is ongoing, and I will be back to give the specifics of my amendment in just a short period of time.  I yield the floor.
