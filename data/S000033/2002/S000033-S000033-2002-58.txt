 Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I hereby submit for the Record a letter sent to the Speaker of the House, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hastert), by every large multinational corporate trade organization in the country, people who contribute hundreds of millions of dollars into the political process, because they are opposed to the amendment.         Aerospace Industries Association, American Business            Council of the Gulf Countries, AMT--The Association for            Manufacturing Technology, Bankers Association for            Finance and Trade, Coalition for Employment Through            Exports, Emergency Committee for American Trade,            International Energy Development Council, National            Association of Manufacturers, National Foreign Trade            Council, Small Business Exporters Association, U.S.            Chamber of Commerce, U.S.-China Business Council, U.S            Council for International Business,                                                   April 16, 2002.     Hon. Dennis Hastert,     Speaker of the House,     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Speaker: As the House Republican leadership      considers scheduling floor action on H.R. 2871, to      reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, we write to reiterate our      strong support for the Bank. Our collective members include      many of the U.S. exporters and financial institutions that      rely on the Bank as the lender of last resort in meeting the      fierce competition for export opportunities in world markets.      In FY 2001 alone, the Bank financed some 2,300 export      transactions, 90 percent of which were for small and medium-     sized firms.       Ex-Im Bank plays a crucial role in supporting the export of      American-made goods and American-provided services in markets      where commercial financing is difficult to obtain and when      foreign competitors have the active support of their      governments' export credit agencies. In 2000 alone, the most-     active export credit agencies worldwide financed more than      $500 billion in exports. Ex-Im Bank financed $15.5 billion in      U.S. exports that year.       To deal with this increasingly aggressive foreign      competition, H.R. 2871 would authorize the Bank to respond to      new export financing programs offered by foreign governments,      including so-called ``market windows''. The bill also      provides the Bank with clear authority to use the tied-aid      war chest to respond aggressively to foreign governments' use      of foreign assistance to supplement their export credit      activities (so-called ``tied-aid'').       It is important to note that Ex-Im charges risk-based      interest, premiums and other fees for its loans, loan      guarantees and insurance. These fees are paid by exporters,      banks and overseas customers. Last year, the Bank's revenues      generated a $1 billion net income for the U.S. government.      Moreover, the Bank maintains some $10 billion in reserves to      protect against the risk of loss. The Bank's conservative      lending policies and aggressively loss-recovery efforts have      resulted in a very low 1.9 percent historical loss rate.                         Amendments of Concern       Two amendments may be offered which, in our judgment, would      impede the ability of U.S. exporters to effectively utilize      the Bank, thus weakening the Bank's programs and causing a      loss of U.S. exports and the jobs of American workers. We      urge you to oppose these amendments if offered during House      floor action:       (1) Rep. Sanders may offer an amendment to deny Ex-Im Bank      financing for U.S. companies that are growing      internationally. It would make the Bank completely unusable      for any U.S. exporter that is succeeding in world markets.      The proposal runs contrary to U.S. trade policy and market-     based economic growth. It would make no sense for the      Congress to seek open world markets, but then deny U.S. firms      access to one of the key tools to take advantage of these new      opportunities. Since Ex-Im Bank only finances U.S.-origin      goods and services, shutting off the Bank would only result      in making the Bank less effective in creating and keeping      U.S. jobs here at home.       Rep. Schakowsky may offer an amendment to require a human      rights assessment of about 600 export transactions supported      by the Bank annually. This proposal is unnecessary because      the Export-Import Bank Act already includes a procedure under      which the Bank relies on the U.S. State Department for human      rights analysis. The amendment would require the Bank to      establish an unnecessary new bureaucracy that would duplicate      the long-established State Department human rights office.      The amendment would require U.S. exporters to submit any      proposed transaction over $10 million to a costly and time-     consuming notice and comment period, which inevitably would      lead to the loss of export sales to our foreign competitors.      The current, long-established, process works well to ensure      that human rights issues are analyzed by the State      Department's experts and included in the Bank's consideration      of export transactions.       We urge the House to approve H.R. 2871 and to oppose      amendments that would weaken the Bank and impede U.S.      exports.           Sincerely,         Don Carlson, President, AMT-The Association For            Manufacturing Technology; Calman J. Cohen, President,            Emergency Committee For American Trade; Timothy E.            Deal, Senior Vice President, U.S. Council for            International Business; John W.

Vargo, Vice President, National Association            of Manufacturers; Willard A. Workman, Senior Vice            President, U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  Mr. Chairman, these gentlemen, representing the largest multinational corporations in this country, are opposed to this amendment. And why not? They are receiving huge amounts of corporate welfare. They think it is a good deal. So, yes, they will be opposed to the amendment. And I would hope that gives Members a good reason why they should think about voting for this amendment.  I am very proud that this amendment is cosponsored by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Paul) and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), and we are united, along with many other Members here, to protect American workers and to fight corporate welfare.  Mr. Chairman, some of my colleagues will say that the Ex-Im Bank has helped businesses and workers throughout the United States. They are right. But that should not be a great surprise for an agency that has a budget of some $1 billion and has the capabilityof guaranteeing some $15 billion in loans a year. If we stood outside on street corners all over America and gave out money, we would do some good. We would help people. We would create jobs.  The question that we want to ask is: Given the amount of money that we are spending, are American taxpayers and are American workers getting good value for their dollars? And I think any objective analysis of Ex-Im would suggest that we are not.  At the present moment, Ex-Im is wasteful, it is inefficient, and it is a major example of corporate welfare. If we cannot make fundamental changes in the way that program is run, it should be killed.  Mr. Chairman, let us be clear about who the major beneficiaries of Ex-Im are. My colleagues have heard a lot about how small businesses are benefiting. The reality, however, is that 80 percent of the real dollars goes to the Fortune 500, some of the largest corporations in America. Now, let us hear who those tiny small businesses are who receive this corporate welfare from the American people.  Well, they are Boeing, General Electric, Caterpillar, and Mobile Oil. They are a struggling small company. Westinghouse and AT Another little tiny mom and pop company. Motorola, Lucent Technologies, Enron, IBM, FedEx, General Motors, Haliburton, Siemens, Raytheon, and United Technologies. The list goes on and on.  Workers in this country, working 50, 60 hours a week to keep their heads above water, veterans not getting the benefits they are entitled to, but, hey, all these little tiny companies they are on the welfare line. Name the largest multinational corporation in America, many of whom make substantial campaign contributions, and there they are getting their money from Ex-Im.  Further, many of these companies pay exorbitant salaries and benefits to their CEOs. One example, which I have experience with, IBM, on the welfare line, gave their former CEO Lou Gerstner, over $260 million in stock options, while they cut back on pensions and retirement health benefits of their workers and retirees and they are opening plants in China. No doubt, no doubt that the American taxpayers should be giving them their welfare check.  Now, even more importantly, what else do these companies have in common? What they have in common is that company after company that receive Ex-Im money are some of the largest job cutters in America. In the name of job creation, we are giving huge amounts of money to large corporations who are laying off hundreds of thousands of American workers, and they are moving their plants to China, where they are paying desperate people there 20 cents an hour; moving to Mexico, moving to Vietnam, moving anyplace in the world where they can get cheap labor. Well, that is a smart public-policy move on our part.  Let me give a couple of examples. General Electric has received over $2.5 billion in direct loans and loan guarantees from Ex-Im Bank. And what was the result? From 1985 to 1995, GE reduced its workforce from 243,000 to 150,000. A real success story for the Ex-Im Bank.  General Motors. They received $500 million in direct loans and loan guarantees from Ex-Im. The result, GM has shrunk its U.S. workforce from 559,000 to 314,000. Congratulations Ex-Im.  Motorola. They have reduced their workforce; only 56 percent of their workers are from the United States.  Now, if a company wants to receive taxpayer support, fine. But what that company has got to do is say we pledge to protect American jobs. And the amendment that I am offering is very, very simple. What it says is that if a company is going to lay off workers, then they cannot lay off more American workers than they lay off people abroad. Now, I do not think that is too much to ask for companies that receive subsidies from the American taxpayer.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
