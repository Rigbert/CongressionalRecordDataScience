 President, the first responsibility I have this morning is to announce for the leader what our potential points of business are for this morning.  This morning, there will be a period for the transaction of morning business until the hour of 10 a.m. Following morning business, the majority leader has stated that it would be his intention to appoint conferees to S. 652, the telecommunications bill. It is possible that a Senator will make a motion in regard to the appointment of those conferees. Therefore, it may be necessary to have a rollcall vote today if such a motion is made.  The majority leader has also indicated that it is hoped that the Senate will be able to appoint conferees to H.R. 4, the welfare reform bill, and to do that during today's session.  Mr. President, do I have time allocated for morning business?                          ____________________
