President, the Administration finally released its National Energy Policy last month. As I noted at the time, I have serious concerns about several of its recommendations, not the least of which was its proposal to build 1,300 to 1,900 new electric power plants many of them burning relatively dirty fossil fuels, while, at same time, questioning the enforcement of clean air laws that protect the public from excess power plant emissions.  Today, fossil fuel-fired power plants constitute the largest source of air pollution in the United States. Every year, they collectively emit approximately 2.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide, 13 million tons of acid rain-producing sulfur dioxide, 7 million tons of acid rain- and smog-producing nitrogen oxides, and 43 tons of highly toxic mercury.  How could pollutants still be dumped into our atmosphere at this scale? One reason that cannot be ignored is that more than 75 percent of the fossil-fuel fired power plants in the United States are still ``grandfathered,'' or exempt from modern Clean Air Act standards. When the Clean Air Act and its amendments were passed, Congress assumed that old, 1950's era power plants would be retired over time and replaced by newer, cleaner plants within 30 years. They were not. Unfortunately, utilities have kept these inefficient, pollution-prone power plants on line because they are inexpensive. Those grandfathered plants continue to burn cheap fuel and refuse to invest in emissions control technologies that protect air quality.  The continuing harm to our atmosphere, lands, waters, State economies, and public health by excess power plant emissions is well documented. In my home state of Vermont, acid deposition caused by emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide has scarred our forests and poisoned our streams. Emissions of mercury have contaminated our rivers and lakes to the point that statewide advisories against fish consumption are necessary to protect citizens. Emissions of greenhouse gas threaten to negatively change the climate for Vermont maple trees the source of Vermont maple syrup and other economic Vermont crops. And despite Vermont's tough air laws and small population, out-of-state particulates and smog lower our air quality, endanger our health, and ruin views of our Green Mountains.  Earlier this year, I cosponsored bipartisan legislation, the ``Clean Power Act of 2001,'' that strictly capped national power plant emissions and ended ``grandfather'' loophole exemptions. To promote rapid and reliable changes in the utility industry, that legislation also gave utilities the regulatory tools needed to make those changes with incentives for free market trading of emissions credits, a so-called ``cap-and-trade'' mechanism. I remain a supporter of the Clean Power Act of 2001 and hope it becomes key to energy policy negotiations in Congress. However, I believe we can do even more.  So today I am introducing a second piece of legislation covering power plant emissions that I also intend to promote during the energy debate. The ``Clean Power Plant and Modernization Act of 2001'' again strictly caps emissions and ends the ``grandfather'' loophole on old plants. Instead of providing utilities the incentive of free market trading, however, my bill creates strong financial incentives, in the form of accelerated tax depreciation, for older utilities that cut emissions and upgrade their plants to 45 percent to 50 percent efficiency. With current average energy efficiency of U.S. power plants at only 33 percent, this bill is another proposal that protects the environment and public health while providing the energy industry with a comprehensive and predictable set of long-term regulatory requirements.  Under this bill, mercury emissions would be cut by 90 percent, annual emissions of sulfur dioxide would be cut by more than 6 million tons beyond Phase II Clean Air Act Amendments requirements, and nitrogen oxide emissions would be cut by more than 3 million tons per year beyond Phase II requirements. This bill would also prevent at least 650 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year.  And this bill goes beyond emissions caps and transition incentives to recognize the emergence of energy technologies that are more environmentally sustainable. It provides substantial funding for research, development, and commercial demonstrations of renewable and clean energy technologies such as solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, and fuel cells. It also authorizes expenditures for implementing known ways of biologically sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere such as planting trees, preserving wetlands, and soil restoration.  The bill emphasizes the importance of immediately capping, if not totally eliminating, the release of mercury from power plants. In December, the EPA finally determined to regulate mercury emissions from electric utility power plants, an action I strongly commended. However, such regulations are years away, and it is uncertain what form they will take. Yet, just last year, 41 states issued more than 2,200 fish consumption advisories because of mercury contamination. Eleven states, including Vermont, issued statewide advisories. In 2000, the National Academy of Sciences confirmed the health risks of mercury, emphasizing the special vulnerability of unborn and young children. I believe we need to do something now.  As the energy landscape of our nation changes, this bill also recognizes the need to train a new national energy work force. As U.S. power plants become more efficient and more power is produced by renewable technologies, less fossil fuel will be consumed. This will have an impact on the workers and communities that produce fossil fuels. These effects are likely to be greatest for coal, even with significant deployment of clean coal technology. The bill provides funding for programs to help workers and communities during the period of transition. I am eager to work with organized labor to ensure that these provisions address the needs of workers, particularly those who may not fully benefit from retraining programs.  Finally, this bill holds the electric power industry, and Congress, accountable for any and all taxpayer dollars used to aid the transition to cleaner electric generation facilities. To assess how well clean air laws and emissions reductions are working, our nation must have robust, nationwide monitoring networks capable of generating reliable, consistent, long-term data about natural ecosystems. Networks such as the National Atmospheric Deposition Program currently provide the national data needed by scientists and Federal agencies to accurately assess the trends in pollutant deposition. Yet, over the past 30 years, these networks have struggled to survive with ever-decreasing funding. My bill provides modest appropriations for both operational support and modernization of scientific sites that are so critical to understanding of our ecosystems and our public health.  The American public overwhelmingly supports the environmental commitments that we have made since the early 1970s. It is our responsibility to preserve the environment for our children and grandchildren, and it is our duty to protect their health as well. The proposed energy policy of this administration needs to be less about drilling and more about energy efficiency and protection of air quality. This bill will, I hope, add another wayin which we can ensure reliable, affordable electric power while modernizing energy efficiency and protecting our national resources.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, and the section-by-section overview of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1131       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) the United States is relying increasingly on old,      needlessly inefficient, and highly polluting power plants to      provide electricity;       (2) the pollution from those power plants causes a wide      range of health and environmental damage, including--       (A) fine particulate matter that is associated with the      deaths of approximately 50,000 Americans annually;       (B) urban ozone, commonly known as ``smog'', that impairs      normal respiratory functions and is of special concern to      individuals afflicted with asthma, emphysema, and other      respiratory ailments;       (C) rural ozone that obscures visibility and damages      forests and wildlife;       (D) acid deposition that damages estuaries, lakes, rivers,      and streams (and the plants and animals that depend on them      for survival) and leaches heavy metals from the soil;       (E) mercury and heavy metal contamination that renders fish      unsafe to eat, with especially serious consequences for      pregnant women and their fetuses;       (F) eutrophication of estuaries, lakes, rivers, and      streams; and       (G) global climate change that may fundamentally and      irreversibly alter human, animal, and plant life;       (3) tax laws and environmental laws--       (A) provide a very strong incentive for electric utilities      to keep old, dirty, and inefficient generating units in      operation; and       (B) provide a strong disincentive to investing in new,      clean, and efficient generating technologies;       (4) fossil fuel-fired power plants, consisting of plants      fueled by coal, fuel oil, and natural gas, produce more than      two-thirds of the electricity generated in the United States;       (5) since, according to the Department of Energy, the      average combustion heat rate efficiency of fossil fuel-fired      power plants in the United States is 33 percent, 67 percent      of the heat generated by burning the fuel is wasted;       (6) technology exists to increase the combustion heat rate      efficiency of coal combustion from 35 percent to 50 percent      above current levels, and technological advances are possible      that would boost the net combustion heat rate efficiency even      more;       (7) coal-fired power plants are the leading source of      mercury emissions in the United States, releasing more than      43 tons of this potent neurotoxin each year;       (8) in 1999, fossil fuel-fired power plants in the United      States produced nearly 2,200,000,000 tons of carbon dioxide,      the primary greenhouse gas;       (9) on average, fossil fuel-fired power plants emit      approximately 2,000 pounds of carbon dioxide for every      megawatt hour of electricity produced;       (10) the average fossil fuel-fired generating unit in the      United States commenced operation in 1964, 6 years before the      Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) was amended to      establish requirements for stationary sources;       (11)(A) according to the Department of Energy, only 23      percent of the 1,000 largest emitting units are subject to      stringent new source performance standards under section 111      of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7411); and       (B) the remaining 77 percent, commonly referred to as      ``grandfathered'' power plants, are subject to much less      stringent requirements;       (12) according to available scientific and medical      evidence, exposure to mercury and mercury compounds is of      concern to human health and the environment;       (13) according to the report entitled ``Toxicological      Effects of Methylmercury'' and submitted to Congress by the      National Academy of Sciences in 2000, and other scientific      and medical evidence, pregnant women and their developing      fetuses, women of childbearing age, children, and individuals      who subsist primarily on fish are most at risk for mercury-     related health impacts such as neurotoxicity;       (14) although exposure to mercury and mercury compounds      occurs most frequently through consumption of mercury-     contaminated fish, such exposure can also occur through--       (A) ingestion of breast milk;       (B) ingestion of drinking water, and foods other than fish,      that are contaminated with methylmercury; and       (C) dermal uptake through contact with soil and water;       (15) the report entitled ``Mercury Study Report to      Congress'' and submitted by the Environmental Protection      Agency under section 112(n)(1)(B) of the Clean Air Act (42      U.S.C. 7412(n)(1)(B)), in conjunction with other scientific      knowledge, supports a plausible link between mercury      emissions from combustion of coal and other fossil fuels and      mercury concentrations in air, soil, water, and sediments;       (16)(A) the Environmental Protection Agency report      described in paragraph (15) supports a plausible link between      mercury emissions from combustion of coal and other fossil      fuels and methylmercury concentrations in freshwater fish;       (B) in 2000, 41 States issued health advisories that warned      the public about consuming mercury-tainted fish, as compared      to 27 States that issued such advisories in 1993; and       (C) the number of mercury advisories nationwide increased      from 899 in 1993 to 2,242 in 2000, an increase of 149      percent;       (17) pollution from power plants can be reduced through      adoption of modern technologies and practices, including--       (A) methods of combusting coal that are intrinsically more      efficient and less polluting, such as pressurized fluidized      bed combustion and an integrated gasification combined cycle      system;       (B) methods of combusting cleaner fuels, such as gases from      fossil and biological resources and combined cycle turbines;       (C) treating flue gases through application of pollution      controls;       (D) methods of extracting energy from natural, renewable      resources of energy, such as solar and wind sources;       (E) methods of producing electricity and thermal energy      from fuels without conventional combustion, such as fuel      cells; and       (F) combined heat and power methods of extracting and using      heat that would otherwise be wasted, for the purpose of      heating or cooling office buildings, providing steam to      processing facilities, or otherwise increasing total      efficiency;       (18) adopting the technologies and practices described in      paragraph (17) would increase competitiveness and      productivity, secure employment, save lives, and preserve the      future; and       (19) accurate, long-term, nationwide monitoring of      atmospheric acid and mercury deposition is essential for--       (A) determining deposition trends;       (B) evaluating the local and regional transport of      emissions; and       (C) assessing the impact of emission reductions.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to protect and preserve the environment while      safeguarding health by ensuring that each fossil fuel-fired      generating unit minimizes air pollution to levels that are      technologically feasible through modernization and      application of pollution controls;       (2) to greatly reduce the quantities of mercury, carbon      dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides entering the      environment from combustion of fossil fuels;       (3) to permanently reduce emissions of those pollutants by      increasing the combustion heat rate efficiency of fossil      fuel-fired generating units to levels achievable through--       (A) use of commercially available combustion technology,      including clean coal technologies such as pressurized      fluidized bed combustion and an integrated gasification      combined cycle system;       (B) installation of pollution controls;       (C) expanded use of renewable and clean energy sources such      as biomass, geothermal, solar, wind, and fuel cells; and       (D) promotion of application of combined heat and power      technologies;       (4)(A) to create financial and regulatory incentives to      retire thermally inefficient generating units and replace      them with new units that employ high-thermal-efficiency      combustion technology; and       (B) to increase use of renewable and clean energy sources      such as biomass, geothermal, solar, wind, and fuel cells;       (5) to establish the Clean Air Trust Fund to fund the      training, economic development, carbon sequestration, and      research, development, and demonstration programs established      under this Act;       (6) to eliminate the ``grandfather'' loophole in the Clean      Air Act relating to sources in operation before the      promulgation of standards under section 111 of that Act (42      U.S.C. 7411);       (7) to express the sense of Congress that permanent      reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases that are      accomplished through the retirement of old units and      replacement by new units that meet the combustion heat rate      efficiency and emission standards specified in this Act      should be credited to the utility sector and the owner or      operator in any climate change implementation program;       (8) to promote permanent and safe disposal of mercury      recovered through coal cleaning, flue gas control systems,      and other methods of mercury pollution control;       (9) to increase public knowledge of the sources of mercury      exposure and the threat to public health from mercury,      particularly the threat to the health of pregnant women and      their fetuses, women of childbearing age, and children;       (10) to decrease significantly the threat to human health      and the environment posed by mercury;       (11) to provide worker retraining for workers adversely      affected by reduced consumption of coal;       (12) to provide economic development incentives for      communities adversely affected by reduced consumption of      coal;       (13) to promote research concerning renewable energy      sources, clean power generation technologies, and carbon      sequestration; and       (14) to promote government accountability for compliance      with the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) and other      emission reduction laws by ensuring accurate, long-term,      nationwide monitoring of atmospheric acid and mercury      deposition.

The Clean Power Plant and Modernization Act of 2001 lays      out an ambitious, achievable, and balanced set of financial      incentives and regulatory requirements designed to increase      power plant efficiency, reduce emissions, and encourage the      use of renewable energy and clean power generation methods.      The bill encourages innovation, entrepreneurship, and risk-     taking. In the long term, the bill will reduce acid      precipitation, decrease mercury contamination, help mitigate      climate change, improve visibility, and safeguard human      health.     Section 4. Combustion Heat Rate Efficiency Standards for          Fossil Fuel-Fired Generating Units       Fossil fuel-fired power plants in the United States operate      at an average combustion efficiency of 33%. This means that,      on average, 67% of the heat generated by burning the fuel is      wasted. Without changing fuels, increasing combustion      efficiency is the best way to reduce carbon dioxide      emissions. Section 4 lays out a phased two-stage process for      increasing efficiency. In the first stage, by 10 years after      enactment, all units in operation must achieve a combustion      heat rate efficiency of not less than 45%. In the second      stage, with expected advances in combustion technology, units      commencing operation more than 10 years after enactment must      achieve a combustion heat rate efficiency of not less than      50%. Carbon dioxide emission reductions on the order of 650      millions tons per year are expected, and the potential exists      for even larger reductions.       If, for some unforeseen reason, technological advances do      not achieve the 50% efficiency level, Section 4 contains a      waiver provision that allows the owners of new units to      offset any shortfall in carbon dioxide emission reductions      through implementation of carbon sequestration projects.     Section 5. Air Emission Standards for Fossil Fuel-Fired          Generating Units       Subsection (a) eliminates the ``grandfather'' loophole in      the Clean Air Act and requires all units, regardless of when      they were constructed or began operation, to comply with      existing new source review requirements under Section 111 of      the Clean Air Act.       Subsection (b) sets mercury, carbon dioxide, sulfur      dioxide, and nitrogen oxide emission standards for units that      are subject to the 45% thermal efficiency standard set forth      in Section 4. For mercury, 90% of the mercury contained in      the fuel must be removed. For carbon dioxide, the emission      limits are set by fuel type (i.e., natural gas = 0.9 pounds      per kilowatt-hour of output; fuel oil = 1.3 pounds per      kilowatt-hour of output; coal = 1.55 pounds per kilowatt-hour      of output). 95% of sulfur dioxide emissions and 90% of      nitrogen oxide emissions are to be removed, and emissions may      not exceed 0.3 pounds of sulfur dioxide and 0.15 pounds of      nitrogen oxides per million BTUs of fuel consumed.       Subsection (c) sets emission standards for units that are      subject to the 50% thermal efficiency standard set forth in      Section 4. Standards for mercury, sulfur dioxide, and      nitrogen oxides are the same as those in Subsection (b).      Greater combustion efficiency results in lower emissions of      carbon dioxide, and the fuel-specific emission limits are      lowered accordingly (i.e., natural gas = 0.8 pounds per      kilowatt-hour of output; fuel oil = 1.2 pounds per kilowatt-     hour of output; coal = 1.4 pounds per kilowatt-hour of      output).     Section 6. Extension of Renewable Energy Production Credit       Section 45(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is      amended to include solar power and geothermal power and to      extend the renewable energy production credit through 2015.      (This credit is currently set to expire in 2001.)     Section 7. Megawatt-Hour Generation Fees and Section 8. Clean          Air Trust Fund       To offset the impact to the Treasury of the incentives in      Sections 9 and 10, the bill establishes the Clean Air Trust      Fund. The Trust Fund is similar to the Highway Trust Fund or      the Superfund. The revenue for the Trust Fund will be      provided by assessing a fee of 30 cents per megawatt-hour of      electricity produced by covered electric generating units.       The Trust Fund will also be used to pay for assistance to      workers and communities adversely affected by reduced      consumption of coal, research and development for renewable      power generation technologies (e.g., wind, solar, and      biomass), and carbon sequestration projects.     Section 9. Accelerated Depreciation for Investor-Owned          Generating Units       Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, utilities can      depreciate their generating equipment over a 20 year period.      Section 9 amends Section 168 of the Internal Revenue Code of      1986 to allow for depreciation over a 15 year period for      units meeting the 45% efficiency level and the emission      standards in Section 5(b). Section 9 also amends Section 168      to allow for depreciation over a 12 year period for units      meeting the 50% efficiency level and the emission standards      in Section 5(c).     Section 10. Grants for Publicly Owned Generating Units       No federal taxes are paid on publicly-owned generating      units. To provide publicly-owned utilities with comparable      incentives to modernize, Section 10 provides for annual      grants in an amount equal to the monetary value of the      depreciation deduction that would be realized by a similarly      situated investor-owned generating unit under Section 9.      Units meeting the 45% efficiency level and the emission      standards in Section 5(b) would receive annual grants over a      15 year period, and units meeting the 50% efficiency level      and the emission standards in Section 5(c) would receive      annual grants over a 12 year period.     Section 11. Recognition of Permanent Emission Reductions in          Future Climate Change Implementation Programs       This section expresses the sense of Congress that permanent      reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides      that are accomplished through the retirement of old      generating units and replacement by new generating units that      meet the efficiency and emission standards in the bill, or      through replacement with non-polluting renewable power      generation technologies, should be credited to the utility      sector and to the owner/operator in any climate change      implementation program enacted by Congress.     Section 12. Renewable and Clean Power Generation Technologies       This section provides a total of $750 million over 10 years      to fund research and development programs and commercial      demonstration projects and partnerships to demonstrate the      commercial viability and environmental benefits of electric      power generation from biomass, geothermal, solar, and wind      technologies. Types of projects may include solar power tower      plants, solar dishes and engines, co-firing biomass with      coal, biomass modular systems, next-generation wind turbines      and wind verification projects, and geothermal energy      conversion.     Section 13. Clean Coal, Advanced Gas Turbine, and Combined          Heat and Power Demonstration Program       This section provides a total of $750 million over 10 years      to fund research and development programs and commercial      demonstration projects and partnerships to demonstrate the      commercial viability and environmental benefits of electric      power generation from clean coal technologies, advanced gas      turbine technologies, and combined heat and power      technologies.     Section 14. Evaluation of Implementation of This Act and          Other Statutes       Not later than 2 years after enactment, DOE, in      consultation with EPA and FERC, shall report to Congress on      the implementation of the Clean Power Plant and Modernization      Act. The report shall identify any provisions of other laws      that conflict with the efficient implementation of the Clean      Power Plant and Modernization Act. The report shall include      recommendations for legislative or administrative measures to      harmonize and streamline these other statutes.     Section 15. Assistance for Workers Adversely Affected by          Reduced Consumption of Coal       Beginning 3 years after enactment, this section provides a      total of $975 million over 13 years to provide assistance to      coal industry workers who are adversely affected as a result      of reduced consumption of coal by the electric power      generation industry. The funds will be administered under the      economic dislocation and worker adjustment assistance program      of the Department of Labor authorized by Title III of the Job      Training Partnership Act.     Section 16. Community Economic Development Incentives for          Communities Adversely Affected by Reduced Consumption of          Coal       Beginning 3 years after enactment, this section provides a      total of $975 million over 13 years to provide assistance to      communities adversely affected as a result of reduced      consumption of coal by the electric power generation      industry. The funds will be administered under the economic      adjustment program of the Department of Commerce authorized      by the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965.     Section 17. Carbon Sequestration       This section authorizes $45 million over 3 years for DOE to      conduct research and development in support of a national      carbon sequestration strategy. This section also authorizes      $300 million over 10 years for EPA and USDA to fund carbon      sequestration projects such as soil restoration, tree      planting, wetlands protection, and other ways of biologically      sequestering carbon.     Section 18. Atmospheric Monitoring       This section authorizes $13.6 million over 10 years to      support the operation of existing instrument networks that      monitor the deposition of sulfates, nitrates, mercury, and      other pollutants, as well as the effects of these pollutants      of ecosystem health. This section also authorizes a one-time      expenditure of $13.6 million for equipment modernization for      these instrument networks.                                 ______                                       By
