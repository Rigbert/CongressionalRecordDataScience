SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Highway Funding Restoration      Act''.     SEC. 2. FEDERAL-AID HIGHWAY PROGRAM OBLIGATION CEILING.       Section 1102 of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st      Century (23 U.S.C. 104 note; 112 Stat. 115, 113 Stat. 1753)      is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``(k) Restoration of Obligation Limitation for Fiscal Year      2003.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for fiscal      year 2003, the obligations for Federal-aid highway and      highway safety construction programs that are subject to the      obligation limitation set forth in subsection (a)(6)--       ``(1) shall be not less than $27,746,000,000; and       ``(2) shall be distributed in accordance with this      section.''.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all adjustments      made pursuant to section 251(b)(1)(B) of the Balanced Budget      and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to the highway      category and to section 8103(a)(5) of the Transportation      Equity Act for the 21st Century for fiscal year 2003 shall be      deemed to be zero.

It is the sense of Congress that the revenue aligned budget      authority provision in section 251(b)(1)(B) of the Balanced      Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 should be      amended in the future to more accurately align highway      spending with highway revenues while maintaining      predictability and stability in highway funding levels.     SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION FOR HIGHWAY PROJECTS.       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, projects and      activities designated on pages 82 through 92 of House Report      107-308 shall be eligible for fiscal year 2002 funds made      available for the program for which each project or activity      is so designated.
