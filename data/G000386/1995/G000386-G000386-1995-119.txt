 I think in this whole process of moving from categorical programs administered from Washington to more flexible programs, you can also call block grants to the States. I think we have an appropriate responsibility to the Federal taxpayers to make sure that money is not eaten up in excess administrative costs.  I think the Brown amendment is a step in the right   direction. I do not think very many States would exceed that anyway, and probably very few States exceed that presently. But we are moving into a program of what we think is of considerable length. And I have always said that to meet the Federal responsibilities on block grants it is legitimate to put limits on administrative expenses, to have some national goals that ought to be met, and to have a targeted population described by the Federal taxpayers.  It seems to me that this solves one of those major, legitimate issues that we ought to deal with here, albeit at the same time we are going to give the maximum discretion to the States on the administering of the welfare program. So I compliment the Senator from Colorado for his amendment.  I yield the floor.
