Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to a man that is considered one of the greatest athletes ever to come out of the Inland Empire. Bobby Bonds, a 14-year major league baseball player from Riverside, California, passed away on Sunday, August 24, 2003. His legacy, however, lives on.  Bobby Bonds was born with the talent and followed a dream. He began his baseball career in the Patterson Park Little League in Riverside's eastside neighborhood. Even then, crowds would gather to watch him play.  In high school, Bobby excelled in more than one sport. He could be spotted being shuttled from the baseball field to the track field in order to compete; his love of sports was unparalleled. He also played basketball and football. Bobby was the 1964 state long jump champion and later graduated high school in 1965. He was immediately signed by the San Francisco Giants and worked his way up through the minor leagues. He was leading the Pacific Coast League in hitting when he joined the major leagues in 1968.  In his first season, Bobby hit 32 home runs and stole 45 bases, becoming the fourth and, at 23 years old, youngest member of baseball's 30-30 club.  In 1971, Bonds was selected to the All-Star team, and later played in three All Star games. He won three Gold Gloves for fielding excellence as an outfielder. In 1973 he hit a career-high 39 home runs, was named Most Valuable Player. Four years later he would have another career-high of 115 runs.  After retiring from baseball in 1982, Bobby became a first-base coach for the Cleveland Indians and joined the Giants coaching staff in 1993 when his son joined the team. After his role as the first-base coach, he became a special assistant for the Giants.  Bobby is survived by his wife, Pat; a daughter, Cheryl Dugan; three sons, Barry, Ricky, and Bobby Jr., his mother, Elizabeth; a brother, Robert; and a sister Rosie.  Although Bobby moved away from Riverside many years ago his influence remains. A park in Riverside was renamed the Bobby Bonds Park and the Bobby Bonds Head Start/State Preschool opened last November.  Bobby's tireless passion for the game of baseball and his love of his hometown of Riverside, California will long be remembered by the residents of Riverside that grew up next door to him and the kids everywhere who grew up inspired by his life.                          ____________________
