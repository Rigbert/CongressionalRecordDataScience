If I am not mistaken, the Senator from Utah, Mr. Bennett, came to the floor with a positive and constructive suggestion. He said that this nominee, Miguel Estrada, should produce the written documents from his experience working for the Department of Justice, working for the Supreme Court. In fact, he even suggested at one point they be produced so they can be reviewed carefully by both the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee and then a determination be made as to whether there should be followup hearings or questions and ultimately a vote so there would be disclosure. This suggestion did not come from a Democratic Senator; it came from a Republican Senator, Mr. Bennett of Utah.  I thought it was a fair suggestion to break the logjam, to resolve this nomination up or down, and to move on to the people's business.  Can the Senator from South Dakota, our minority leader, tell me whether that suggestion of producing those documents really is consistent with what we are trying to achieve so we can once and for all give Mr. Estrada his fair hearing and final determination? Is that what this is about?
