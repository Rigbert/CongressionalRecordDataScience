Speaker, as a member and former Chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I have followed Yugoslavia's violent demise this past decade very closely, by traveling there, by meeting officials from there here in Washington, by participating in dozens of Commission hearings on various aspects of the conflict.  Throughout this period, it has been obvious that, whatever ethnic animosities might have existed beforehand, the horrific aggression against innocent populations and, yes, genocide, was instigated by Slobodan Milosevic, deliberately, in order to maintain and enhance his power in Serbia. As his nationalist agenda was belatedly but forcefully rejected by the international community under U.S. leadership, Milosevic increasingly resorted to repression at home, against the people of Serbia. There has been opposition to Milosevic for a long time, but only this month did the people, the political opposition and independent forces join together and say ``enough is enough.'' I congratulate those brave Serbs who stood up to a regime that has lied to them, cheated them and denied them their rights for over a decade.  The changes taking place in Serbia are, however, good not only for Serbs but for all people in the region. Other problems exist, but, with Milosevic out of the way, the stage is set for long-term stability an economic recovery in southeastern Europe. It is now possible to make the progress we all want so that our troops, doing critical work there, can come home with mission accomplished. Whatever we felt about the deployment in the first place, we should all be able to agree on that.  For this reason, I support the decision of the President to provide quick support to the new Yugoslav President, Vojislav Kostunica, and his colleagues. The Conference Report on Foreign Operations Appropriations for fiscal year 2001 similarly reflects the general consensus that assistance needs to be provided to Yugoslavia quickly in order to solidify the gains being made by the Democratic Opposition of Serbia. The country is in a state of transition, and there is no question about the need to send a positive message.  Such a message, however, does not preclude a cautionary message. I believe there is a need to place some conditionality on assistance. Cooperation with the Tribunal in The Hague prosecuting war crimes, ending the support for nationalists in neighboring Bosnia and promoting the rule of law and tolerance  I agree that we should be flexible, and the conference report reflects a good compromise on the application of conditions. That said, I would like to make the following points. First, the large amount now allocated for Serbia should not come at the expense of ongoing funding for Croatia, Macedonia, Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria and others in the region who have worked with the international community all along, undertook major burdens themselvesand need this assistance. Second, the five month window which exists before the conditions are applied should not lead to throwing all of this money at Belgrade rapidly beforehand, because the conditions may not be met. I could see this happening next February, in the event that insufficient progress has been achieved by that time. Let's hope that progress will take place allowing for certification in accordance with this bill. Third, progress in the rule of law must include addressing the hundreds of ethnic Albanians currently in Serbian prisons and encouraging president Kostunica to continue to look for ways to resolve this issue.  In conclusion, I believe a case can be made that the reformists coming into power at this time may not be able to surrender Slobodan Milosevic to the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague. Sooner or later, however, they will need to do so. To do otherwise would not only be an injustice to the literally millions of victims in the former Yugoslavia. It would send the absolutely wrong message to Croatia, Bosnia and Montenegro all of whom are cooperating with the Tribunal. It would delay the time by which the people of Serbia will have to reckon with the hideous atrocities committed in their name this past decade, a reckoning which will be absolutely necessary for Serbia to make significant progress in building a society in which the rule of law is respected and tolerance of others is embedded.  It is important when discussing these issues to recall that there are also indictees beyond Milosevic living in Serbia. Let us recall exactly what these people are alleged to have done. Three individuals living now in Serbia were directly responsible for pulling over 200 people out of a hospital in Vukovar, Croatia, after the city had been surrendered and guarantees of safety were made, beating them severely and then executing them en masse in a field in late 1991. Another individual, the well known Ratko Mladic, was at the scene when as many as 7,000 Bosnians were similarly executed after being taken from the so-called ``safe haven'' of Srebrenica in 1995. Even if one could find some way to justify the conflicts surrounding these incidents--which I personally cannot do, but maybe some can--these acts were nevertheless heinous crimes, and we cannot put accountability for them at risk.  Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to read the indictments issued by the Tribunal, particularly the indictments of those responsible for the massacres in Vukovar and Srebrenica. They are available at . It is too easy to put the issue of the Tribunal to the side in light of foreign policy objectives, but, if you read what happened, I believe you will agree that justice must remain a pillar of our policy in the Balkans.                          ____________________
