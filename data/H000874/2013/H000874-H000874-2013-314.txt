 Mr. Speaker, Congressman Nolan, who was in this body before I was and before you were and before Mr. Barletta was, he has been in public service for a very long period of time. Therefore, I appreciate the remarks he made in support of this resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, which I am proud to have sponsored for the last 22 years.                              {time}  1720  It allows the Greater Washington Soap Box Derby Association to hold its 72nd annual competition on June 15 on the grounds of this Capitol. This is a longstanding tradition which brings young people ages 8 to 17 and their families from around the D.C. metro area to the Capitol for a fun and educational experience.  Since 1938, the derby has inspired thousands of the region's young people to learn the physics behind gravity racing and the engineering used to design soap box racers. America's Soap Box Derbies have been called ``the greatest amateur racing event in the world,'' and on June 15, it will continue to make history.  The derby teaches sportsmanship, hard work, and pride of accomplishment, and it imbues its young participants with that same spirit of innovation that has long fueled America's greatness. The young people who participate in these derbies are often sponsored by community groups, police departments, fire departments, and others who want to invest in our country's future in a very direct and meaningful way.  Every year, I am incredibly proud of my constituents from Maryland's Fifth District who participate. A number of Soap Box Derby champions have come from the Fifth District, including the winners of 2007, 2008, 2009, and last year. The winners in 2007 and 2008, Kacie Rader and Courtney Rayle, respectively, went on to win the national Soap Box Derby championship.  As an aside, Mr. Speaker, I was hoping to be able to say that about the Maryland Terrapins this year, but that, apparently, will not be the case, although I do expect them to win the NIT. Last year's winners from the Fifth District were Brittany Sorli and Brandon Sorli of Waldorf, who won the Masters and Super Stock divisions.  I want to thank the Members who are cosponsoring this resolution: Representatives Gerry Connolly, Donna Edwards, Jim Moran, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Chris Van Hollen, John Delaney, and my classmate who came with me to Congress in the 97th Congress, my dear friend, Frank Wolf. I would urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution, and I thank Mr. Nolan and Mr. Barletta for bringing this resolution to the floor.
