President, I have cosponsored Senator Vitter's legislation, The REAL, Resources from Energy for America's Liberty, Stimulus Act of 2009. It is crucial that this Nation realize the need to develop our oil and natural gas resources from the Outer Continental Shelf and ANWR, enact the kind of responsible streamlining of government to not hinder that development, and provide important regulatory relief.  I have consistently highlighted the amounts of U.S. reserves, and I think it is important to continue to point out the amount of reserves in the United States. The OCS holds 14 billion barrelsof oil and 55 trillion cubic feet of gas, which is equivalent to 25 years worth of imports from Saudi Arabia. ANWR holds 10 billion barrels or 15 years worth of imports from Saudi Arabia. Today we would have 1 million additional barrels of oil a day coming from ANWR had President Clinton not vetoed legislation in 1995 to authorize that production. Production from ANWR is entirely responsible. Compared to the size of Alaska, ANWR's 19 million acres is about the same size of South Carolina, and of that area, we propose opening about 1.5 million acres to exploration which is roughly 6 percent of ANWR. Of those 1.5 million acres, only 2,000--an area the size of Washington's Dulles International Airport--would be devoted to drilling. This is only one example of new production which can occur in an environmentally exacting manner.  The legislation also includes important regulatory reforms which outside the energy production components of this bill would be referred to the Environment and Public Works Committee for consideration. Some of the EPW related provisions include streamlining environmental considerations in the leasing of the OCS and ANWR and streamlining reviews for new nuclear power plant licensing. The bill includes language meant to ensure that Federal projects and actions are not needlessly delayed, and therefore made more costly, by required environmental reviews. Too often the NEPA mandated environmental review process is used as the means to slow or stop projects, not based on substantive environmental grounds but, rather, simply because selected individuals oppose the projects. We need to reduce the ability of these not-in-my-backyard interests to continue to manipulate Federal law this way. Too many jobs and economic resources are at stake.  The bill importantly excludes greenhouse gases from the definition of pollutant and prohibits the EPA Administrator from granting waivers to enforce their own tail pipe emission standards. Granting these States a waiver will only result in a patchwork of State regulations and compliance will vary greatly depending on product demand in each State. The U.S. auto industry, already on life support, faces a $47 billion burden this year due to increased national fuel economy standards, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association.  Finally, the bill keeps activists from using the Endangered Species Act from hindering crucial energy exploration and production. Activists' efforts to list species and restrict human activities based on climate change are backdoor attempts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Endangered Species Act. Directly linking species threats to climate change under ESA means that any increase in carbon dioxide or greenhouse gas emissions anywhere in the country could be subject to legal challenges due to arguments that those activities are harming any species that is in decline. It allows endless litigation on major activities that are funded, carried out, or authorized by the Federal Government. The economic impacts of regulating greenhouse gases under ESA are enormous. For example, any permit for a powerplant, refinery, or road project in the United States could be subject to litigation if it contributes to total carbon emissions. ESA prompted lawsuits and bureaucratic delays could even extend to past fossil fuel-linked Federal projects if they could increase greenhouse gas emissions or reduce natural carbon dioxide uptake. The ESA is over 30 years old. Its only real success has been to provide full time employment for the radical activists and the trial bar. Most importantly, despite billions of Federal dollars spent, millions of acres of property rights restricted, and the years of red tape delays, barely 1 percent of listed species have actually recovered. If that is not justification to restructure an outdated, ineffective law, I don't know what is--there has to be a better way.  I have long said America is not running out of oil and gas or running out of places to look for oil and gas. America is running out of places where we are allowed to look for oil and gas. The American public has got to demand that the Democrats in Congress allow us to produce from our own resources without unnecessary and burdensome Government regulation.                          ____________________
