Speaker, I am pleased to announce that the Twenty-First Annual Tri-City Special Olympics Track and Field meet was held on Saturday, May 16, 1998, at the Central High School football field in East Chicago, Indiana. Approximately 350 children from East Chicago, Hammond, and Whiting participated in the track and field meet, which has become one of the most outstanding events of the year in the Tri-City area.  Saturday's ceremonies began with the traditional passing of the torch. Adam Stiles of Hammond carried the Olympic torch into the stadium and past the reviewing stand, where he then passed it to Denise Pickford of the Lake County Association for the Retarded (LCAR), who relayed the torch to Jerrid Orange of East Chicago, the anchor runner responsible for lighting the Olympic flame. All three runners returned to their groups for the ceremonies, which included the posting of the colors near the American Legion Posts, the singing of The National Anthem to the accompaniment of the Central High School marching band, and the recitation of the Special Olympic Oath before each event, which was led by Rita Jurik of LCAR. This year's oath is ``Let Me Win, but if I Cannot Win, Let Me Be Brave in the Attempt.''  The Special Olympics ended with the release of balloons out of the stadium and the distribution of awards to all of the participants. All Special Olympians received an award because the courage to strive and dare is tantamount to winning over adversity.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating all of the participants in the Tri-City Special Olympics for their determination and will to succeed. Also, I would like to commend all of those involved in making the Special Olympics a success. Their hard work and dedication helped to create a sense of pride and accomplishment in all of the children who participated in the event.                          ____________________
