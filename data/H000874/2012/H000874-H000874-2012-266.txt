 Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me say that Mr. Cantor and I had the opportunity to speak on the floor today. We spoke on behalf of a resolution that was passed overwhelmingly, unanimously, that spoke to commemorating the march that both the majority leader and I have participated in in the past, and I'll be participating in again this weekend, a march commemorating the march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge from Selma to Montgomery.                              {time}  1110  Today was a day of unity on the floor of this House in which Mr. Lungren and Mr. Lewis and others expressed their thoughts, as did so many of the rest of us, about how this is a great lesson on the fact that we have not always been where we promised to be as a Nation, but that we've made progress, and a reminder that there is still progress yet to be done.  I want to thank the majority leader for his comments that he made on the floor today and for his focus on this issue.  I yield to the gentleman.
