Speaker, I rise today to speak on behalf of my constituents who have no voice but who have a very large stake in the outcome of the debate over the GOP buget--the children of Rhode Island.  The Republican budget will eliminate Medicaid coverage for almost 40,000 children in Rhode Island, many whom are disabled. The Republican budget will cut nutrition assistance for almost 50,000 children in Rhode Island. The Republican budget jeopardizes immunizations for children in Rhode Island. The Republican budget will deny 14,000 children in Rhode Island child care assistance. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, the list goes on and on.  I say to my Republican colleagues--we must work toward a balanced budget for our children, not balance the budget on the backs of our children. When it comes to public investment in children's health and education, denying a dollar today actually costs more in the future.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this short-sighted and mean spirited budget reconciliation bill.                          ____________________
