Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Hoeffel) for championing this very important resolution to put our Nation and the Congress on record in highest hopes that the elections this year in the Ukraine will ensure a democratic, transparent, and fair election process leading up to March 31. Their parliamentary elections will be held on that date. Of course the chairman of the full committee, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Hoeffel) have traveled together to that part of the world and have made such a difference in carrying the banner of freedom's institutions into regions of our world where heretofore people had not been able to exercise their full democratic rights.  Having just returned from the Ukraine myself and having had the really historic opportunity to meet with nearly 300 of their younger citizens, and people representing nongovernmental organizations that are monitoring the elections and trying to produce information so people know what they are voting about, we can see a change, a glacial change occurring there for the better. But without question, people of that nation must feel free and unintimidated as they go to the polls, and they must understand what the various candidates' platforms are; and it is safe to say that that kind of transparency and information has not been easily available.  Sometimes it is hard here, but there the systems are just not robust. It is not easy to understand how a party slate or individuals on it might actually support a certain program, and it is hard to distinguish among the major blocs and the people in those blocs. I would add an encouraging word for passage of this resolution and a great hope that the Government of Ukraine will ensure that the election process is open. Let flourish those who are attempting to help people understand the issues and understand what those who are running actually will champion in their own programs once elected to RADA or local office. This kind of information should be more broadly available. The Internet should be allowed to function so people will share information across regions and become more informed about what their vote actually means.  The task before the Ukrainian people of building a more open and free society is enormous. That is true in Russia also and many of the former republics of the Soviet Union.                              {time}  1700  I know that I detected, especially among the young, such a great hope, such a feeling that they had the future of the country in their hands. They are looking for us to pass this resolution to give a signal that our country stands and walks alongside those who are trying to build more open and free societies. In fact many young people who are 21 years of age are running for office in some of the towns, or are trying to run for parliament, to try to change the laws in order to make property traded freely with a mortgage system. They are fighting for laws so loans can be made by a regular bank and have a free credit system established. They want an educational system that is available to all so students are able to learn critical thinking methods. All of these challenges lie ahead of those young leaders.  And so to the young people in our country, I encourage them to pay attention to Ukraine, the most important nation in Central Europe. As it goes, so will the nations around it. I rise in very strong support of House Resolution 339 and want to thank so very much the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Hoeffel) for bringing this to the attention of the entire world, indeed. We respectfully say to the people of Ukraine, vote, vote wisely, monitor the elections, help to move your country forward, as I know the hearts of your people tell you they want.  I express my fullest support for this resolution.
