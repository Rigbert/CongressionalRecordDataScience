 President, a distinguished Iowan once wrote: ``I prefer to think of Iowa as I saw it through the eyes of a 10-year-old boy. Those were eyes filled with the wonders of Iowa's streams and woods, of the mystery of growing crops. They saw days filled with adventure and great undertakings, with participation in good and comforting things. They saw days of stern but kindly discipline.'' That 10-year-old Iowa boy later became the 31st President of the United States. Herbert Clark Hoover was the first U.S. President to be born west of the Mississippi River.  President Hoover's home until he was 11 years old was in West Branch, IA. And the Hoover Presidential Library in West Branch is the place where he returned upon his death in 1964. Born into a Quaker family in 1874, he was raised in the Quaker tradition by his parents until their untimely deaths. Then, he was raised by other family members. During his formative years, he was taught the principles of honesty, hard work, simplicity, and generosity.  Herbert Hoover's life was one of great undertakings. An accomplished and successful engineer, he put his organizational skills to work during the First World War. In England at the outbreak of the war he helped, often with his own money, to get his fellow Americans back home. When Belgium was invaded and the Belgian people were in need of food, Herbert Hoover responded. He instituted food relief efforts as the head of the Belgian Relief Campaign. He organized the acquisition, delivery, and distribution of tens of thousands of tons of food. Thousands were saved from a horrible death by starvation. Herbert Clark Hoover proved himself to be one of the great humanitarians of the world.  President Woodrow Wilson subsequently appointed Herbert Hoover as Food Administrator of the United States. From this position he oversaw the Government's food conservation program for the duration of the war.  During the terms of Presidents Harding and Coolidge, Hoover served as the Secretary of Commerce. Then in the election of 1928, the people of this great country honored him by electing him their 31st President. It is important to note that during his public service, Herbert Clark Hoover did not accept a salary from the people. His reward was in his service to his fellow Americans. I wonder how many of us today are prepared to do the same.  Honesty, hard work, simplicity, and generosity--the principles that Herbert Hoover learned as a boy and practiced all of his adult life. These are principles which all of us try to teach our children. Once learned and once practiced, they can change the world.  Lou Henry Hoover, a Waterloo, IA native, was active alongside her husband. She was the first Iowan to be First Lady. Such a splendid couple they made together.  Lou Hoover received eight honorary degrees in recognition of her public service. Twice she was president of the Girl Scouts of America. While in that position, she began the Girl Scouts cookie sales program, which has become an American tradition.  Lou also promoted women's athletics, helping to found the National Amateur Athletic Federation. She served as president of the Women's Division from 1922 to 1940.  Significantly, in 1929, First Lady Lou Henry Hoover broke the White House racial barrier by entertaining the wife of Oscar DePriest, a black Congressman from Chicago.  Many Americans are cynical of those of us in public life today. They think of us as being self-serving. This is unfortunate. This is not healthy for our country. Perhaps if we look closely at the lives of men and women like Herbert and Lou Hoover and try to follow more closely in their footsteps of humanitarianism, dedication to public service, and the spirit of giving freely of themselves, we could begin to regain more of the public's trust.  Iowans proudly gave up the Hoovers to the world. And when the Hoovers gave up this world, Iowans were deeply honored that they chose to return home to Iowa. Herbert and Lou Hoover--great humanitarians of the world--exemplify the Iowa spirit.                          ____________________
