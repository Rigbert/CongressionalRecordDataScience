 The amendment, in my opinion, is constitutionally questionable because it impinges on the President's ability to set U.S. nuclear weapons policy and usurp's the President's ability to retire, dismantle, or eliminate non-deployed nuclear weapons.                              {time}  1845  This amendment restricts the President's constitutional authority to negotiate international agreements, including sole executive agreements for arms reductions; and it impinges on the President's authority to determine the number of strategic delivery vehicles needed to meet national security requirements and implement changes in those forces, as appropriate. And it limits the President's authority to determine appropriate force structure to meet nuclear deterrence requirements and to set nuclear employment policy, an authority exercised by every President in the nuclear age. Frankly, it is bad policy.  Blocking nuclear weapons reduction is out of step with post-Cold War and post-9/11 security environment. Secretary Schultz, Secretary Kissinger, Secretary Nunn, and Secretary Perry all have encouraged further nuclear weapons reductions stating in 2007:       Unless urgent new actions are taken, the United States soon      will be compelled to enter a new nuclear era that will be      more precarious and psychologically disorienting, and      economically even more costly than was Cold War deterrence.  The amendment disregards potential military requirements, including potential Strategic Command recommendations, and instead imposes congressional requirements.  It seems to restrict any reductions below the New START to bilateral negotiated reductions with Russia. So in effect it outsources decisions on U.S. nuclear force structure to Russia, and it requires maintenance of nuclear weapons levels that might be costly and unnecessary in an era of budget constraints.  I think the amendment is poorly written and will not achieve its objectives. It fails to ban unilateral reductions by referencing the ACA section 303(b) of the Arms Control and Disarmament Act.  It fails to keep deployed forces at 1,550. And, as written, it allows the whole stockpile to decline to that level since that's the limit in New START. This would entail retaining a total stockpile of 1,550 with a deployed force of 1,550, which simply does not make sense. Neither the active nor the inactive stockpile is limited by New START. The treaty limits the number of operationally deployed warheads and delivery vehicles. While operationally deployed warheads are part of the active stockpile, the size of the stockpile itself is not limited. Supporting 1,550 deployed warheads would require the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy to maintain an active stockpile in excess of 1,550 warheads. New START also does not count nonstrategic warheads, so it is unclear whether the amendment intends to count the nonstrategic warheads under the New START limit.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to submit some additional comments for the Record. Obviously, I disagree with the gentleman's amendment and urge my colleagues to oppose his amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.    Talking Points Against the Turner Amendment on Nuclear Weapons                                Reductions  Turner Amendment language: Sec._. None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to reduce the number of nuclear weapons in the active and inactive stockpiles of the United States below that required by the New START treaty (as defined in __) in contravention of section 303(b) of the Arms Control and Disarmament Act (22 USC 2573(b)).                              Unnecessary  There are no funds in FY14 bill that are allocated to be used for nuclear weapons reductions below New START levels.

Ineffective  The amendment is poorly written and will not achieve its objectives.  It fails to ban unilateral reductions by referencing the ACA Section 303(b) of the Arms Control and Disarmament Act.  ACDA does not prevent the President from making unilateral reductions in U.S. nuclear weapons. It says that the President cannot obligate the United States to reduce its forces in a militarily significant way without seeking the approval of Congress. ``Obligate'' usually means signing a legally-binding treaty or executive agreement. A handshake, or joint statement of political intent would not be an ``obligation'' under the terms of this legislation.  It fails to keep deployed forces at 1,550.  As written, it allows the whole stockpile to decline to 1,550, since that's the limit in New START. This would entail retaining a total stockpile of 1,550, with a deployed force of 1,550, which does not make sense. Neither the active nor the inactive stockpile are limited by New START. The Treaty limits the number of operationally deployed warheads and delivery vehicles. While operationally deployedwarheads are part of the active stockpile, the size of the stockpile itself is not limited. Supporting 1,550 deployed warheads would require DOD and DOE to maintain an active stockpile in excess of 1,550 warheads. New START also does not count nonstrategic warheads so it is unclear whether the amendment intends to count the nonstrategic warheads under the new START limit.  Quote by Gen Kehler, in response to question by Mr. Turner at STRATCOM policy hearing on March 5, 2013 (noting that you do not necessarily need an operational pit production infrastructure is needed before we reduce non-deployed nuclear weapons):  Mr. Turner. Great. Because you would agree that our ability to have a long-term ability for production, in a production infrastructure should be a basis for us considering whether or not we reduce any of our hedge in case there isn't an issue with the weapons that we have.  General Kehler. Sir, I think that is one consideration. I don't think that is the only consideration. And I think that there are some scenarios that you can unfold where an interim strategy will serve us even under some technical issues. So I--but I think for the United States of America in the long term that we want a permanent solution to the nuclear enterprise that includes a permanent solution to the plutonium.
