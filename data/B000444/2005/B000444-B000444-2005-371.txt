 President, I rise today to introduce legislation to address the problem of substance abuse in our country.  The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has called substance abuse America's No. 1 health problem. I don't think that overstates it.  Most of us knows someone--a family member, maybe a neighbor, a colleague, or a friend--who is addicted to drugs or alcohol. In fact, nearly 15 million people in this country abuse alcohol or are alcoholics. More than 19 million use drugs, and an estimated 4 million are in need of treatment but not receiving it.  Drug and alcohol abuse has far-reaching consequences. It exacerbates social ills. It is a public safety problem. It is a public health problem. It is a public expenditure problem. There is an undeniable correlation between substance abuse and crime. Eighty percent of the 2 million men and women behind bars today have a history of drug and alcohol abuse or addiction or were arrested for a drug-related crime. Illegal drugs are responsible for thousands of deaths each year. They fuel the spread of AIDS and hepatitis C. They contribute to child abuse, domestic violence, and sexual assault. And we all pay the price.  It costs this Nation almost $275 billion in law enforcement, criminal justice expenses, medical bills, and lost earnings each year. That means that preventing and treating substance abuse makes sense. It makes good criminal justice sense. It makes public health sense. It makes budgetary sense. Not to mention the fact that it is the right thing to do.  Yet there remains a reluctance to recognize substance abuse as a health issue. There is a reluctance to accept addiction as a disease. It is a reluctance that has kept public policy from asserting that addicts should be in treatment. Whether addicts are in prison or out, it seems to me, treatment is the only legitimate choice.  But it is not only about increasing access to treatment. It is also about moving treatment into the medical mainstream. Unless family doctors, nurses, physician assistants, and social workers can identify addiction when they see it, unless they know how to intervene, we will never make any real progress.  That aspect of the challenge came into sharp focus for me when I read a report a few years ago by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, CASA.  That report said that fewer than 1 percent of doctors presented with the classic profile of an alcoholic older woman could diagnose it properly. Eighty-two percent misdiagnosed it as depression, some treatments for which are dangerous when taken with alcohol. A follow-up study showed that 94 percent of primary care physicians fail to diagnose substance abuse when presented with the classic symptoms, and 41 percent of pediatricians fail to diagnose illegal drug use in teenage patients.  No one recognizes this problem better than the doctors themselves. Fewer than one in five--only 19 percent--feel confident about diagnosing alcoholism. And only 17 percent feel qualified to identify illegal drug use. Having said that, even if they diagnose it, most doctors don't believe that treatment works.  Among practitioners, as well as policymakers, we need to get the message out loud and clear: Addiction is a chronic relapsing disease, and as with other such diseases, while there may not be a cure, medical treatment can help control it.  The medical professionals have to be educated to recognize the signs of substance abuse and to pursue the effective therapies that are available. That is why I am introducing legislation to help train medical professionals to prevent and recognize addiction and refer patients to treatment if they need it. Representative Patrick Kennedy will introduce companion legislation in the House of Representatives.  Like treatment, training works. According to a study published in the Brown University Digest of Addiction Theory and Application, 91 percent of health professionals who took part in training on addiction at Boston University were using the techniques they learned 1 to 5 years later.  Every family doctor does not need to be an addiction specialist, but they do need to be able to recognize the signs. And they need to know what help is available.  My legislation does the following three things: authorizes $9 million in grants to train medical generalists to recognize substance abuse in their patients and their families and know how to properly refer them for treatment; authorizes $6 million to fund substance abuse faculty fellows at educational institutions to teach courses on substance abuse, incorporate substance abuse issues into to required courses at the institution, and educate health professionals about issues related to non-therapeutic uses of prescription medications; and establishes centers of excellence at medical centers or universities across the United States to (1) initiate, promote and implement training, research and clinical activities related to special areas of substance abuse and (2) provide opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration in curriculum development, clinical practice, research and policy analysis. The bill authorizes $6 million for this purpose.  These are additional steps--and, in my view, crucial ones to help bridge the divide between research and practice. They will help chip away at the incredible substance abuse-related costs we face each year in human as well as monetary terms.  I hope my colleagues will join me to support this important legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 538       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Health Professionals      Substance Abuse Education Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Illegal drugs and alcohol are responsible for thousands      of deaths each year, and they fuel the spread of a number of      communicable diseases, including AIDS and Hepatitis C, as      well as some of the worst social problems in the United      States, including child abuse, domestic violence, and sexual      assault.       (2) There are an estimated 19,500,000 current drug users in      America, nearly 4,000,000 of whom are addicts. An estimated      14,800,000 Americans abuse alcohol or are alcoholic.       (3) There are nearly 27,000,000 children of alcoholics in      America, almost 11,000,000 of whom are under 18 years of age.      Countless other children are affected by substance abusing      parents or other caretakers. Health professionals are      uniquely positioned to help reduce or prevent alcohol and      other drug-related impairment by identifying affected      families and youth and by providing early intervention.       (5) Drug addiction is a chronic relapsing disease. As with      other chronic relapsing diseases (such as diabetes,      hypertension and asthma), there is no cure, although a number      of treatments can effectively control the disease. According      to an article published in the Journal of the American      Medical Association, treatment for addiction works as well as      treatment for other chronic relapsing diseases.       (6) Drug treatment is cost effective, even when compared      with residential treatment, the most expensive type of      treatment. Residential treatment for cocaine addiction costs      between $15,000 and $20,000 a year, a substantial savings      compared to incarceration (costing nearly $40,000 a year), or      untreated addiction (costing more than $43,000 a year). Also,      in 1998, substance abuse and addiction accounted for      approximately $10,000,000,000 in Federal, State, and local      government spending simply to maintain the child welfare      system. The economic costs associated with fetal alcohol      syndrome were estimated at $54,000,000,000 in 2003.       (7) Many doctors and other health professionals are      unprepared to recognize substance abuse in their patients or      their families and intervene in an appropriate manner. Only      56 percent of residency programs have a required curriculum      in preventing or treating substance abuse.       (8) Fewer than 1 in 5 doctors (only 19 percent) feel      confident about diagnosing alcoholism, and only 17 percent      feel qualified to identify illegal drug use.       (9) Most doctors who are in a position to make a diagnosis      of alcoholism or drug addiction do not believe that treatment      works (less than 4 percent for alcoholism and only 2 percent      for drugs).       (10) According to a survey by the National Center on      Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University      (referred to in this section as ``CASA''), 94 percent of      primary care physicians and 40 percent of pediatricians      presented with a classic description of an alcoholic or drug      addict, respectively, failed to properly recognize the      problem.       (11) Another CASA report revealed that fewer than 1 percent      of doctors presented with the classic profile of an alcoholic      older woman could diagnose it properly. Eighty-two percent      misdiagnosed it as depression, some treatments for which are      dangerous when taken with alcohol.       (12) Training can greatly increase the degree to which      medical and other health professionals screen patients for      substance abuse. It can also increase the manner by which      such professionals screen children and youth who may be      impacted by the addiction of a parent or other primary      caretaker. Boston University Medical School researchers      designed and conducted a seminar on detection and brief      intervention of substance abuse for doctors, nurses,      physician's assistants, social workers and psychologists.      Follow-up studies reveal that 91 percent of those who      participated in the seminar report that they are still      using the techniques up to 5 years later.       (13) The total economic costs of untreated addiction is      estimated to be $274,800,000,000. Arming health care      professionals with the information they need in order to      intervene and prevent further substance abuse could lead to a      significant cost savings.       (14) A study conducted by doctors at the University of      Wisconsin found a $947 net savings per patient in health      care, accident, and criminal justice costs for each      individual screened and, if appropriate, for whom      intervention was made, with respect to alcohol problems.       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to--       (1) improve the ability of health care professionals to      identify and assist their patients in obtaining appropriate      treatment for substance abuse;       (2) improve the ability of health care professionals to      identify and refer children and youth affected by substance      abuse in their families for effective treatment; and       (3) help establish an infrastructure to train health care      professionals about substance abuse issues and the impact on      families.
