Chairman, I thank my friend for yielding me the time to close.  I talked about, in the first 3 minutes, a comprehensive energy policy. I want to tell my friend, the chairman of the committee, I know he and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell) worked closely together on this bill. I think it is very unfortunate on a matter of such great importance to our country, to our national security, and to our people that we do not have a bill on the floor that both the gentleman from Louisiana and the gentleman from Michigan could have supported.  Some amendments have been made in order. I would hope that perhaps the gentleman from Louisiana would support some of those amendments. I think they will improve the bill.
