Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, in closing this afternoon, let me say that oil ministers of the Middle East should not be put in charge of setting energy prices in the United States of America. We should have that control inside of our border.  This amendment would merely replace one one-hundredth of the nearly $70 billion that we send to the Middle East oil ministers every year for petroleum imported here, and replace it with investments we make in ourselves for the future. It gives the Secretary of Agriculture very flexible authority in order to spend these dollars in order to make agriculture an equal pillar along with other old fossil fuels.
