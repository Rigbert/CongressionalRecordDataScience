Speaker, 31 years ago, Kitty Genovese cried out for help as she was raped in New York. Thirty-eight neighbors heard her cries, but out of fear or irresponsibility, not one went to her aid. The next morning, she was found dead.  Today, Bosnia cries out for help. She asks only that her neighbors allow her to defend herself.  Her women have been raped, her children orphaned, her homes stolen, and her men massacred. All this by men branded by our country and the international community as war criminals.  And she wonders why the mighty, moral West watches, and waits, and debates.  Kitty Genovese is not in Bosnia.  But, genocide resides there now.  Let us act today to lift the arms embargo to give beleaguered Bosnia a chance.                          ____________________
