Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.  I just want to say that as I learn more and more about this legislation, part of it was because of the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Kirk) and the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Bean). We share a media market together, me in southwest Michigan, they, of course, in Chicago, and the concern by so many in talk radio and the news is really something else.  I have to say that just a couple years no one knew about the online predators like we do today, and that is why we have had a number of hearings in the Oversight Subcommittee chaired by Mr. Whitfield.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to one of the coauthors of the bill, along with Mr. Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Mr. Kirk of Illinois.
