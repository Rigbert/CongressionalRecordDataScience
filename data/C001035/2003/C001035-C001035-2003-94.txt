He has been an advocate for attacking this problem for some time and it has been a pleasure to work with him.  One woman business owner really summed up what this is all about. She said, bundling is a shield that keeps large companies from having to compete with smaller firms.  Such a state of affairs is ultimately unhealthy for the Federal procurement system. We rely on a vigorous competition to keep prices low and to ensure we are purchasing high quality goods and services. This amendment is going to make a difference in our procurement system and a difference for small businesses. For that reason, it has been strongly endorsed by the National Federation of Independent Businesses and the National Black Chamber of Commerce.  I end my remarks by thanking the distinguished chairman of the committee and the ranking member for their cooperation and assistance. I ask for the adoption of the amendment.
