 I fully intend to resist the House provisions he referred to and we are in complete agreement on what should be the nature of sound U.S. policy toward this region. I will support the Senate position in conference, and I am sure that I will have the support of the ranking member and all of our conferees on this matter. I thank the Senator for his interest in this important matter and in the fate of that region and U.S. interests there, which are vital.
