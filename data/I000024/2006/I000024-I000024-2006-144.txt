President, right now we are waiting for Senator McCain to return and call up his legislation in conjunction with the unanimous consent agreement.  I would like also to say the same thing. It has been great working with Senator Jeffords and his staff, as well as other staff members, and of course my staff. Angie, here, has been the primary driver with Steve Aaron and Blu Hulsey, David Lungren, our staff director, and Ruth Van Mark, who has done so much work on the transportation end.  On Senator Bond's staff, Letmon Lee; of course, JoEllen Darcey with Senator Jeffords, Catharine Ransom, Alison Taylor, and I guess I would have to mention Ken Connolly, too, as someone who hangs around and gets things done, and Paul Wilkins with Senator Baucus.  There is a lot of truth to this. This is more of a nonpartisan committee. We have a lot of issues on which we disagree, but when it gets down to the big authorization we recognize that what we deal with are some of the most significant aspects of government--those that have to get done.  It is the only way to do that when we are dealing with many areas--is cooperate. I appreciate all the staff working together.  I yield the floor.                           Amendment No. 4684  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I call up my amendment which is at the desk.
