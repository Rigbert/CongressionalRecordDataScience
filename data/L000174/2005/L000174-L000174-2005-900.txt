5 still unduly limits the right of individuals to seek redress for corporate wrongdoing in their State courts.''  Again, they are saying: What gives you such wisdom in the U.S. Senate that you can completely throw out 50 States and say, We know far better than they could ever know in their years and decades of experience? The letter urges passage of amendments to be offered by Senators Bingaman, Pryor, and Kennedy. This letter is signed by the Attorneys General from New York, Oklahoma, California, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Vermont, and West Virginia. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         State of New York, Office of the Attorney General, the            Capitol,                                     Albany, NY, February 7, 2005.     Hon. Bill Frist,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Majority Leader and Mr. Minority Leader: On behalf      of the Attorneys General of California, Illinois, Iowa,      Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New      Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Vermont and      West Virginia, we are writing in opposition to S. 5, the so-     called ``Class Action Fairness Act,'' which will be debated      today and is scheduled to be voted on this week. Despite      improvements over similar legislation considered in     prior years, we believe S. 5 still unduly limits the right of      individuals to seek redress for corporate wrongdoing in their      state courts. We therefore strongly recommend that this      legislation not be enacted in its present form.       As you know, under S. 5, almost all class actions brought      by private individuals in state court based on state law      claims would be removed to federal court, and, as explained      below, many of these cases may not be able to continue as      class actions. We are concerned with such a limitation on the      availability of the class action device because, particularly      in these times of tightening state budgets, class actions      provide an important ``private attorney general'' supplement      to the efforts of state Attorneys General to prosecute      violations of state consumer protection, civil rights, labor,      public health and environmental laws.       We recognize that some class action lawsuits in both state      and federal courts have resulted in only minimal benefits to      class members, despite the award of substantial attorneys'      fees. While we support targeted efforts to prevent such      abuses and preserve the integrity of the class action      mechanism, we believe S. 5 goes too far. By fundamentally      altering the basic principles of federalism, S. 5, if enacted      in its present form, would result in far greater harm than      good. It therefore is not surprising that organizations such      as AARP, AFL-CIO, Consumer Federation of America, Consumers      Union, Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, NAACP and      Public Citizen all oppose this legislation in its present      form.     1. Class actions should not be ``federalized''       S. 5 would vastly expand federal diversity jurisdiction,      and thereby would result in most class actions being filed in      or removed to federal court. This transfer of jurisdiction in      cases raising questions of state law will inappropriately      usurp the primary role of state courts in developing their      own state tort and contract laws, and will impair their      ability to establish consistent interpretations of those      laws. There is no compelling need or empirical support for      such a sweeping change in our long-established system for      adjudicating state law issues. In fact, by transferring most      state court class actions to an already overburdened federal      court system, this bill will delay (if not deny) justice to      substantial numbers of injured citizens. Moreover, S. 5 is      fundamentally flawed because under this legislation, most      class actions brought against a defendant who is not a      ``citizen'' of the state will be removed to federal court, no      matter how substantial a presence the defendant has in the      state or how much harm the defendant has caused in the state.     2. Clarification is needed that S. 5 does not apply to state          Attorney General actions       State Attorneys General frequently investigate and bring      actions against defendants who have caused harm to our      citizens, usually pursuant to the Attorney General's parens      patriae authority under our respective state consumer      protection and antitrust statutes. In some instances, such      actions have been brought with the Attorney General acting as      the class representative for the consumers of the state. We      are concerned that certain provisions of S. 5 might be      misinterpreted to impede the ability of the Attorneys General      to bring such actions, thereby interfering with one means of      protecting our citizens from unlawful activity and its      resulting harm. That Attorney General enforcement actions      should proceed unimpeded is important to all our      constituents, but most significantly to our senior citizens      living on fixed incomes and the working poor. S. 5 therefore      should be amended to clarify that it does not apply to      actions brought by any State Attorney General on behalf of      his or her respective state or its citizens. We understand      that Senator Pryor will be offering an amendment on this      issue, and we urge that it be adopted.     3. Many multi-State class actions cannot be brought in          federal court       Another significant problem with S. 5 is that many federal      courts have refused to certify multi-state class actions      because the court would be required to apply the laws of      different jurisdictions to different plaintiffs--even if the      laws of those jurisdictions are very similar. Thus, cases      commenced as state class actions and then removed to federal      court may not be able to be continued as class actions in      federal court.       In theory, injured plaintiffs in each state could bring a      separate class action lawsuit in federal court, but that      defeats one of the main purposes of class actions, which is      to conserve judicial resources. Moreover, while the      population of some states may be large enough to warrant a      separate class action involving only residents of those      states, it is very unlikely that similar lawsuits will be      brought on behalf of the residents of many smaller states.      This problem should be addressed by allowing federal courts      to certify nationwide class actions to the full extent of      their constitutional power--either by applying one state's      law with sufficient ties to the underlying claims in the      case, or by ensuring that a federal judge does not deny      certification on the sole ground that the laws of more      than one state would apply to the action. We understand      that Senator Jeff Bingaman will be proposing an amendment      to address this problem, and that amendment should be      adopted.     4. Civil rights and labor cases should be exempted       Proponents of S. 5 point to allegedly ``collusive''      consumer class action settlements in which plaintiffs'      attorneys received substantial fee awards, while the class      members merely received ``coupons'' towards the purchase of      other goods sold by defendants. Accordingly, this ``reform''      should apply only to consumer class actions. Class action      treatment provides a particularly important mechanism for      adjudicating the claims of low-wage workers and victims of      discrimination, and there is no apparent need to place      limitations on these types of actions. Senator Kennedy      reportedly will offer an amendment on this issue, which also      should be adopted.     5. The notification provisions are misguided       S. 5 requires that federal and state regulators, and in      many cases state Attorneys General, be notified of proposed      class action settlements, and be provided with copies of the      complaint, class notice, proposed settlement and other      materials. Apparently this provision is intended to protect      against ``collusive'' settlements between defendants and      plaintiffs' counsel, but those materials would be unlikely to      reveal evidence of collusion, and thus would provide little      or no basis for objecting to the settlement. Without clear      authority in the legislation to more closely examine      defendants on issues bearing on the fairness of the proposed      settlement (particularly out-of-state defendants over whom      subpoena authority may in some circumstances be limited), the      notification provision lacks meaning. Class members could be      misled into believing that their interests are being      protected by their government representatives, simply because      the notice was sent to the Attorney General of the United      States, State Attorneys General and other federal and state      regulators.       Equal access to the American system of justice is a      foundation of our democracy.     S. 5 would effect a sweeping reordering of our nation's      system of justice that will disenfranchise individual      citizens from obtaining redress for harm, and thereby impede      efforts against egregious corporate wrongdoing. Although we      fully support the goal of preventing abusive class action      settlements, and would be willing to provide assistance in      your effort to implement necessary reforms, we are likewise      committed to maintaining our federal system of justice and      safeguarding the interests of the public. For these      reasons, we oppose S. 5 in its present form.           Sincerely,         Eliot Spitzer, Attorney General of the State of New York;            W.A.
