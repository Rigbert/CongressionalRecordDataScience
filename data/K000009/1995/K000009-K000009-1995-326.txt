Those sound like big numbers. We want to know which banks, which corporations, if it is part of the Eurodollar market, to whom is this money owed? If it is investment banks, speculators in the market, which ones are they? This is not just owed in general. This is owed in specific, and there are huge banking profits this year and last year. They have been doing real, real well. Why do they not have the capacity to eat their own losses? What about these big investment banking houses? The speculators? And I appreciate risk-takers. But that is what risk is. Risk is taking the loss if it does not go your way, and you take the gain if it does go your way.                              {time}  1830  So which investment houses? I want to know specifically, before we vote here on this floor, who is this $26 billion owed to? And there is another $89 billion that Mexico owes payments on for their full public debt. To whom is that owed? You are talking about $40 billion, Congressman Klink. There is the first $18 billion from the currency swap and the line of credit last week. Then there is this $40 billion. Then there is the $89 billion that they still owe. Now, to whom is that owed? And why should our taxpayers be propping up those corporations, those megabanks, those multinationals that moved jobs out of this country. I mean, what is the sense of it? If they are making profits and if they have cash, why don't they pay it off themselves? That is what you do, you write off losses.
