I say to the Senator from Louisiana, a lot of people are not aware of it. They think we have already done these things. We make these proposals on the floor of the Senate. Some of them pass the Senate, then they disappear in conference committees. We all pat ourselves on the back and say we are standing up for the men and women in uniform. At the end of the day, there is no law for the President to sign.  A lot of our colleagues, myself included, will be at Veterans Day events this week. I will be traveling all over Illinois. We are going to stand there. We may be holding the flag. We will say we are for our soldiers and our veterans. But the real proof is in our votes. That is a good one to say to employers: If you are willing to stand behind that man or woman in uniform who is leaving your employment for a short period to do their duty for our country, why shouldn't we stand behind you with the Tax Code?
