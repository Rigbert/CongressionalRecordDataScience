President, as we head into the twenty-first century, computer-related crime is one of the greatest challenges facing law enforcement. Many of our critical infrastructures and our government depend upon the reliability and security of complex computer systems. We need to make sure that these essential systems are protected from all forms of attack. The legislation I am introducing today will help law enforcement investigate and prosecute those who jeopardize the integrity of our computer systems and the Internet.  Whether we work in the private sector or in government, we negotiate daily through a variety of security checkpoints designed to protect ourselves from being victimized by crime or targeted by terrorists. For instance, congressional buildings like this one use cement pillars placed at entrances, photo identification cards, metal detectors, x-ray scanners, and security guards to protect the physical space. These security steps and others have become ubiquitous in the private sector as well.  Yet all these physical barriers can be circumvented using the wires that run into every building to support the computers and computer networks that are the mainstay of how we communicate and do business. This plain fact was amply demonstrated by the recent hacker attacks on E-Trade, ZDNet, Datek, Yahoo, eBay, Amazon.com and other Internet sites. These attacks raise serious questions about Internet security--questions that we need to answer to ensure the long-term stability of electronic commerce. More importantly, a well-focused and more malign cyber-attack on computer networks that support telecommunications, transportation, water supply, banking, electrical power and other critical infrastructure systems could wreak havoc on our national economy or even jeopardize our national defense. We have learned that even law enforcement is not immune. Just recently we learned of a denial of service attack successfully perpetrated against a FBI web site, shutting down that site for several hours.  The cybercrime problem is growing. The reports of the CERT Coordination Center (formerly called the ``Computer Emergency Response Team''), which was established in 1988 to help the Internet community detect and resolve computer security incidents, provide chilling statistics on the vulnerabilities of the Internet and the scope of the problem. Over the last decade, the number of reported computer security incidents grew from 6 in 1988 to more than 8,000 in 1999. But that alone does not reveal the scope of the problem. According to CERT's most recent annual report, more than four million computer hosts were affected by the computer security incidents in 1999 alone by damaging computer viruses, with names like ``Melissa,'' ``Chernobyl,'' ``ExploreZip,'' and by the other ways that remote intruders have found to exploit system vulnerabilities. Even before the recent headline-grabbing ``denial-of-service'' attacks, CERT documented that such incidents ``grew at rate around 50% per year'' which was ``greater than the  rate of growth of Internet hosts.''  CERT has tracked recent trends in severe hacking incidents on the Internet and made the following observations, First, hacking techniques are getting more sophisticated. That means law enforcement is going to have to get smarter too, and we need to give them the resources to do this. Second, hackers have ``become increasingly difficult to locate and identify.'' These criminals are operating in many different locations and are using techniques that allow them to operate in ``nearly total obscurity.''  We have been aware of the vulnerabilities to terrorist attacks of our computer networks for more than a decade. It became clear to me, when I chaired a series of hearings in 1988 and 1989 by the Subcommittee on Technology and the Law in the Senate Judiciary Committee on the subject of high-tech terrorism and the threat of computer viruses, that merely ``hardening'' our physical space from potential attack would only prompt committed criminals and terrorists to switch tactics and use new technologies to reach vulnerable softer targets, such as our computer systems and other critical infrastructures. The government has a responsibility to work with those in the private sector to assess those vulnerabilities and defend them. That means making sure our law enforcement agencies have the tools they need, but also that the government does not stand in the way of smart technical solutions to defend our computer systems.  Targeting cybercrime with up-to-date criminal laws and tougher law enforcement is only part of the solution. While criminal penalties may deter some computer criminals, these laws usually come into play too late, after the crime has been committed and the injury inflicted. We should keep in mind the adage that the best defense is a good offense. Americans and American firms must be encouraged to take preventive measures to protect their computer information and systems. Just recently, internet providers and companies such as Yahoo! and Amazon.com Inc., and computer hardware companies such a Cisco Systems Inc., proved successful at stemming attacks within hours thereby limiting losses.  That is why, for years, I have advocated and sponsored legislation to encourage the widespread use of strong encryption. Encryption is an important tool in our arsenal to protect the security of our computer information and networks. The Administration made enormous progress earlier this year when it issued new regulations relaxing export controls on strong encryption. Of course, encryption technology cannot be the sole source of protection for our critical computer networks and computer-based infrastructure, but we need to make sure the government is encouraging--and not restraining--the use of strong encryption and other technical solutions to protecting our computer systems.  Congress has responded again and again to help our law enforcement agencies keep up with the challenges of new crimes being executed over computer networks. In 1984, we passed the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and  its amendments, to criminalize conduct when carried out by means of unauthorized access to a computer. In 1986, we passed the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), which I was proud to sponsor, to criminalize tampering with electronic mail systems and remote data processing systems and to protect the privacy of computer users. In the 104th Congress, Senators Kyl, Grassley, and I worked together to enact the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act to increase protection under federal criminal law for both government and private computers, and to address an emerging problem of computer-age blackmail in which a criminal threatens to harm or shut down a computer system unless their extortion demands are met.  In this Congress, I have introduced a bill with Senator DeWine, the Computer Crime Enforcement Act, S. 1314, to set up a $25 million grant program within the U.S. Department of Justice for states to tap for improved education, training, enforcement and prosecution of computer crimes. All 50 states have now enacted tough computer crime control laws. These state laws establish a firm groundwork for electronic commerce and Internet security. Unfortunately, too many state and local law enforcement agencies are struggling to afford the high cost of training and equipment necessary for effective enforcement of their state computer crime statutes. Our legislation, the Computer Crime Enforcement Act, would help state and local law enforcement join the fight to combat the worsening threats we face from computer crime.  Computer crime is a problem nationwide and in Vermont. I recently released a survey on computer crime in Vermont. My office surveyed 54 law enforcement agencies in Vermont--43 police departments and 11 State's attorney offices--on their experience investigating and prosecuting computer crimes. The survey found that more than half of these Vermont law enforcement agencies encounter computer crime, with many police departments and state's attorney offices handling 2 to 5 computer crimes per month.  Despite this documented need, far too many law enforcement agencies in Vermont cannot afford the cost of policing against computer crimes. Indeed, my survey found that 98% of the responding Vermont law enforcement agencies do not have funds dedicated for use in computer crime enforcement.  My survey also found that few law enforcement officers in Vermont are properly trained in investigating computer crimes and analyzing cyber-evidence. According to my survey, 83% of responding law enforcement agencies in Vermont do not employ officers properly trained in computer crime investigative techniques. Moreover, my survey found that 52% of the law enforcement agencies that handle one or more computer crimes per month cited their lack of training as a problem encountered during investigations. Proper training is critical to ensuring success in the fight against computer crime.  This bill will help our computer crime laws up to date as an important backstop and deterrent. I believe that our current computer crime laws can be enhanced and that the time to act is now. We should pass legislation designed to improve our law enforcement efforts while at the same time protecting the privacy rights of American citizens.  The bill I offer today will make it more efficient for law enforcement to use tools that are already available--such as pen registers and trap and trace devices--to track down computer criminals expeditiously. It will ensure that law enforcement can investigate and prosecute hacker attacks even when perpetrators use foreign-based computers to facilitate their crimes. It will implement criminal forfeiture provisions to ensure that cybercriminals are forced to relinquish the tools of their trade upon conviction. It will also close a current loophole in our wiretap laws that prevents a law enforcement officer from monitoring an innocent-host computer with the consent of the computer's owner and without a wiretap order to track down the source of denial-of-service attacks. Finally, this legislation will assist state and local police departments in their parallel efforts to combat cybercrime, in recognition of the fact that this fight is not just at the federal level.  The key provisions of the bill are:  Jurisdictional and Definitional Changes to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act: The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1030, is the primary federal criminal statute prohibiting computer frauds and hacking. This bill would amend the statute to clarify the appropriate scope of federal jurisdiction. First, the bill adds a broad definition of ``loss'' to the definitional section. Calculation of loss is important both in determining whether the $5,000 jurisdictional hurdle in the statute is met, and, at sentencing, in calculating the appropriate guideline range and restitution amount.  Second, the bill amends the definition of ``protected computer,'' to expressly include qualified computers even when they are physically located outside of the United States. This clarification will preserve the ability of the United States to assist in international hacking cases. A ``Sense of Congress'' provision specifies that federal jurisdiction is justified by the ``interconnected and interdependent nature of computers used in interstate or foreign commerce.''  Finally, the bill expands the jurisdiction of the United States Secret Service to encompass investigations of all violations of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1030. Prior to the 1996 amendments to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Secret Service was authorized to investigate any and all violations of section 1030, pursuant to an agreement between the Secretary of Treasury and the Attorney General. The 1996 amendments, however, concentrated Secret Service jurisdiction on certain specified subsections of section 1030. The current amendment would return full jurisdiction to the Secret Service and would allow the Justice and Treasury Departments to decide on the appropriate work-sharing balance between the two.  Elimination of Mandatory Minimum Sentence for Certain Violations of Computer Fraud and Abuse Act: Currently, a directive to the Sentencing Commission requires that all violations, including misdemeanor violations, of  certain provisions of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act be punished with a term of imprisonment of at least six months. The bill would change this directive to the Sentencing Commission so that no such mandatory minimum would be required.  Additional Criminal Forfeiture Provisions: The bill adds a criminal forfeiture provision to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, requiring forfeiture of physical property used in or to facilitate the offense as well as property derived from proceeds of the offense. It also supplements the current forfeiture provision in 18 U.S.C. 2318, which prohibits trafficking in, among other things, counterfeit computer program documentation and packaging, to require the forfeiture of replicators and other devices used in the production of such counterfeit items.  Pen Registers and Trap and Trace Devices: The bill makes it easier for law enforcement to use these investigative techniques in the area of cybercrime, and institutes corresponding privacy protections. On the law enforcement side, the bill gives nationwide effect to pen register and trap and trace orders obtained by Government attorneys, thus obviating the need to obtain identical orders in multiple federal jurisdictions. It also clarifies that such devices can be used on all electronic communication lines, not just telephone lines. On the privacy side, the bill provides for greater judicial review of applications for pen registers and trap and trace devices and institutes a minimization requirement for the use of such devices. The bill also amends the reporting requirements for applications for such devices by specifying the information to be reported.  Denial of Service Investigations: Currently, a person whose computer is accessed by a hacker as a means for the hacker to reach a third computer cannot simply consent to law enforcement monitoring of his computer. Instead, because this person is not technically a party to the communication, law enforcement needs wiretap authorization under Title III to conduct such monitoring. The bill will close this loophole by explicitly permitting such monitoring without a wiretap if prior consent is obtained from the person whose computer is being hacked through and used to send ``harmful interference to a lawfully operating computer system.''  Encryption Reporting: The bill directs the Attorney General to report the number of wiretap orders in which encryption was encountered and whether such encryption precluded law enforcement from obtaining the plaintext of intercepted communications.  State and Local Computer Crime Enforcement: The bill directs the Office of Federal Programs to make grants to assist State and local law enforcement in the investigation and prosecution of computer crime.  Legislation must be balanced to protect our privacy and other constitutional rights. I am a strong proponentof the Internet and a defender of our constitutional rights to speak freely and to keep private our confidential affairs from either private sector snoops or unreasonable government searches. These principles can be respected at the same time we hold accountable those malicious mischief makers and digital graffiti sprayers, who use computers to damage or destroy the property of others. I have seen Congress react reflexively in the past to address concerns over anti-social behavior on the Internet with legislative proposals that would do more harm than good. A good example of this is the Communications Decency Act, which the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional. We must make sure that our legislative efforts are precisely targeted on stopping destructive acts and that we avoid scattershot proposals that would threaten, rather than foster, electronic commerce and sacrifice, rather than promote, our constitutional rights.  Technology has ushered in a new age filled with unlimited potential for commerce and communications. But the Internet age has also ushered in new challenges for federal, state and local law enforcement officials. Congress and the Administration need to work together to meet these new challenges while preserving the benefits of our new era. The legislation I offer today is a step in that direction.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2430       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
