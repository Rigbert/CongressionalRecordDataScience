 He described his childhood as being like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting, but as we all know, his life was anything but ordinary. This smalltown boy from New Concord, OH, came a long way and lived a full life, one that touched many and will not soon be forgotten.  Elaine and I send our condolences to his wife Annie and the rest of the Glenn family.                          ____________________
