 Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. This legislation is an important step forward, and I support it; but it should be clear that if we are serious about tackling corporate greed, much more needs to be done.  We have seen in recent years that the heads of the largest corporations in this country have lied about their financial statements, they have cheated on their taxes, moved their companies abroad, and they have thrown loyal American workers out on the street as they move companies to China. They have cut the pensions and health care benefits of their workers. Now is the time for us to address that overall question of corporate greed.  The most important thing that we can do is to pass real campaign finance reform, public funding of elections. So once and for all we end the scourge of big money dominating the White House and the United States Congress, and once and for all we begin to represent all Americans rather than the rich and the powerful.
