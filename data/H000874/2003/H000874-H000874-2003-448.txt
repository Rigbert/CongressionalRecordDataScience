Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.  I would say to the distinguished majority leader, having talked to the ranking member and former chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey), I think if we can reach a bipartisan agreement, we too want to make sure that we provide the appropriate resources for our men and women in harm's way to assure them that there is going to be no reluctance on our part to accomplish that effort. But I emphasize that my belief is that if we can reach a bipartisan agreement, and I am hopeful, I know the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young) and the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) can accomplish that; and if the leadership would help in accomplishing that objective, I think that would be a worthy objective for our country and for this House.  The budget conference and conferees, does the gentleman know when they will be appointed? I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding.  We are hoping to go to conference and name conferees on Monday, if we can get the papers from the Senate. Right now we could have done it today, but we are waiting for the papers to come over from the other body, and they tell us it will be very difficult to get those papers to us by Monday. But if we can get everything straight, then we will go to conference on Monday. If not, we will have to wait until Tuesday.
