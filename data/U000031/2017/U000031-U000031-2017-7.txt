Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 2872, was introduced by Energy and Commerce Committee member Larry Bucshon in June of this year. The legislation went through regular order and was reported by the full committee with a bipartisan amendment by a voice vote.  This bill promotes hydropower by development at existing nonpowered dams by establishing an expedited licensing process that will result in a final decision on an application in 2 years or less. We know hydropower is a clean, renewable, and reliable source of energy that provides low-cost electricity to millions of Americans.  As we have learned through hearings at the Energy and Commerce Committee, the current regulatory process places new hydropower projects at existing nonpowered dams at a significant disadvantage. The current process takes way too long and it creates too much uncertainty, burdening consumers with additional unnecessary costs and preventing jobs and economic opportunities.  This bill, H.R. 2872, makes important changes to the process to enable FERC to issue a decision in 2 years or less. The legislation also requires that FERC, as well as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of theInterior, to develop a list of existing nonpowered Federal dams that have the greatest potential for non-Federal hydropower development.  This is a good bipartisan bill. I thank Dr. Bucshon for his hard work on this important issue and for working with our colleagues across the aisle to bring the bill to the floor.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.         Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of            Representatives,                                Washington, DC, December 12, 2017.     Hon. Greg Walden,     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Walden: I write concerning H.R. 2872, the      Promoting Hydropower Development at Existing Nonpowered Dams      Act. This legislation includes matters that fall within the      Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and      Infrastructure.       I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this      legislation before the House of Representatives in an      expeditious manner, and accordingly, the Committee on      Transportation and Infrastructure will forego action on the      bill. However, this is conditional on our mutual      understanding that foregoing consideration of the bill does      not prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment      of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the      subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation      that fall within the Committee's Rule X jurisdiction. Lastly,      should a conference on the bill be necessary, I request your      support for the appointment of conferees from the Committee      on Transportation and Infrastructure during any House-Senate      conference convened on this or related legislation.       I would ask that a copy of this letter and your response      acknowledging our jurisdictional interest be included in the      Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on      the House floor, to memorialize our understanding.       I look forward to working with the Committee on Energy and      Commerce as the bill moves through the legislative process.           Sincerely,                                                     Bill Shuster,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                             Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                Washington, DC, December 12, 2017.
