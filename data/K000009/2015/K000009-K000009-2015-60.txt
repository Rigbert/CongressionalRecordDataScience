Speaker, I rise tonight to bring light to the secretive, job-killing global trade pact called the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the TPP. Supporters want to rush it through Congress using a procedure called fast-track authority, which forces a vote with no opportunity to amend the deal. This should alarm all Americans.  In its current form, this deal would outsource even more of America's good jobs out from under our working families, degrade global environmental and working standards, and cause investor rights to override worker rights. It propels a global race to the bottom.  The trade ambassador and the administration assert that the TPP has strong and enforceable labor standards and environmental commitments. The TPP includes four nations--Mexico, Brunei, Vietnam, and Malaysia--that are notorious labor and human rights violators.  They are already out of compliance with the standards supposedly in TPP. Frankly, our U.S. Trade Representative has had a bad habit of sweeping trade violations right under the rug.  Our history of trade agreements in Guatemala, Honduras, and Colombia show the need for stronger obligations and a rigorous plan for implementing and overseeing them.  Including commitments in the final agreement is not enough. These nations have to change their laws and practices, and we have to enforce them.  Mr. Speaker, we should vote against TPP because what is going to happen is more American workers will be cashed out, and exploited workers around the world will find life gets harder.                          ____________________
