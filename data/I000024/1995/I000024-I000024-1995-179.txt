But when you say there is pain involved, look at the pain that is associated with continuing on the road we are on right now. The Senator from Pennsylvania just had a young child, and I congratulate him. I hope people realize this young man just had a brand-new baby boy. During that baby boy's lifetime, if we do not change the pattern that we are on right now, according to all of those who are prognosticators of the future, he will have to pay 82 percent of his lifetime income just to support Government.  I remember the other day during our national prayer breakfast we had somebody from one of the Communist countries prior to the time they got their freedom. He bragged and said they only have to give the Government--he said, ``We get to keep 20 percent.'' I said, ``What do you mean?'' He said, ``Every month or so, we have to give the Government 80 percent of everything we make.'' And he is celebrating that. I thought about that. Senator Santorum's newborn baby is going to have to pay 2 percent more than that to support Government if we do not make a change. He is too young to be able to come in and lobby and say do not do that to us.  So we hear from all these people saying they are going to cut these social programs. Here we are with a defense system right now that is going to be down below what it was in 1980 when we could not afford spare parts. Those things we really need Government for are being neglected by this administration, and I think the people have awakened.
