President, today I am introducing legislation to clarify the application of the Federal Tort Claims Act and how it applies to free medical clinics. In my home State of Vermont, free clinics provide important health care, and in these tough economic times they provide an essential safety net for many people. Free clinics in Vermont and around the country are struggling to pay medical malpractice insurance premiums, due to an ambiguity in the Federal law. Current law provides for physicians who volunteer in free clinics to receive medical malpractice coverage under the Federal Torts Claims Act, FTCA, but it is unclear whether other professionals serving the community in free clinics are also covered. Existing Federal law explicitly provides more comprehensive FTCA coverage to community health centers, including coverage for their boards, employees, contractors and officers. But free clinics currently must purchase malpractice insurance for their board members, employees, contractors and officers. Purchasing this coverage diverts thousands of dollars annually from each of the free clinics in the country. These are funds that could be directed to providing necessary healthcare to the uninsured. This is especially true in States like Vermont, where free clinics make a significant impact serving those in rural areas. Additionally, by removing this financial burden for free clinics, the impact of organizations like Volunteers in Medicine, which assists in setting up and staffing free clinics, will be that much greater. In clarifying current law, and at minimal expense to the Federal Government, we can increase the effectiveness of free clinics that serve and care for so many Americans.  This legislation would make it clear that FTCA coverage should be the same for community health centers and free clinics. Both of these institutions deserve our help and play a fundamental role in our communities. It is my understanding that this clarification would not dramatically raise medical malpractice defense costs of the Federal Government because free clinics do not perform high risk procedures like surgeries or births. I urge my fellow Senators to join me in supporting the important work that free clinics provide our communities.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1578       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
