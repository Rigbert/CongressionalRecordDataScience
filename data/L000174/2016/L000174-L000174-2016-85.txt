President, today the Senate confirmed Dr. Carla Hayden to be the 14th Librarian of Congress. This is an historic moment, as Dr. Hayden becomes the first woman and the first African American to serve in this important capacity. I congratulate Dr. Hayden and look forward to working with her to help the Library of Congress continue building its legacy as a great American institution.  As she assumes her new office, Dr. Hayden will be able to draw on her years of experience leading the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore. Through her leadership, the library has become more accessible to members of the community through expanded after school programs and career mentoring. As she powerfully testified during her confirmation hearing before the Rules Committee, the Enoch Pratt Free Library also served as a safe haven last summer when the city of Baltimore experienced painful unrest following the death of Freddie Gray. Her leadership has shown the transformative power of libraries, and I am optimistic that she will use that knowledge and expertise at the Library of Congress to the benefit of all Americans.  Since I received my first library card at the Kellogg-Hubbard Library in Montpelier, VT, I have loved libraries. A library is a place where everyone fits in and the possibilities are limitless. The Library of Congress occupies a special place within our country. It is our Nation's treasured repository for millions of books, photos, movies, oral histories, and music. But it should also lead by example, working to ensure that libraries keep their important place in our society and help Americans of all ages and backgrounds access information in engaging ways.  Dr. Hayden faces numerous challenges as she begins her tenure as Librarian of Congress. She must find ways to improve the Library's efforts to digitize its materials and preserve digital content. And she must find ways to improve the public's access to the Library's incredible collection through effective and responsible changes. I am committed to helping her achieve those goals.  I also encourage Dr. Hayden to work with me to promote access to government-funded research and information prepared by the Congressional Research Service, CRS. I have introduced bipartisan legislation to make CRS reports available online while respecting the important advisory role that CRS provides to Congress. The status quo--where the public can only access these reports by paying hefty subscription fees to third parties--is bad policy, and I look forward to working with Dr. Hayden to find solutions to make this meaningful resource available more broadly to schools and individual citizens.  The Library also needs Congress's assistance to reauthorize its film and sound recording preservation programs, which preserve important materials that would otherwise disappear or be destroyed through the passage of time. I have introduced bipartisan legislation to reauthorize these programs that I hope members of the Rules Committee and the Congress will strongly support. The Library's work on digitization and preservation can and should be a model for the world.  Finally, during her confirmation hearing and in follow-up questions asked of Dr. Hayden, much attention has been paid to the relationship between the Library of Congress and the Copyright Office, which has long been housed within the Library. Diverse stakeholders have called to modernize the functioning of the Copyright Office, to ensure that it, much like the Library, can best serve the public in the digital age. I hope that Dr. Hayden will serve as a helpful collaborator as I and other Members of Congress consider how to accomplish that goal. Among the most pressing issues is how best the Library's and Copyright Office's information technology, IT, systems can be improved to address widely recognized shortcomings. As Dr. Hayden takes office, I encourage her to carefully consider how to solve these problems, knowing that the two entities' IT needs may be vastly different and a solution that works for the Library's collection management may be ill-suited for the particular issues facing the Copyright Office. It is far more important that these IT issues be resolved correctly, particularly in light of thefast-changing nature of technology, than that they be resolved quickly.  Dr. Hayden will serve as the Librarian for a 10-year term, and I am optimistic that she can accomplish great things during that time. I look forward to working together with her and once again congratulate her on this historic accomplishment.                          ____________________
