 Speaker, we have heard a lot about family values lately, but what kind of family values are contained in the Contract With America, which proposes massive tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this country, billions of dollar increases on military spending, including the discredited Star Wars Program, and at the same time cutbacks on programs desperately needed by the weakest and most vulnerable people in our society?  I was especially outraged yesterday by a subcommittee's elimination of the LIHEAP Program, which provides low-income people, including many senior citizens, heating subsidies in the wintertime. In my State of Vermont, over 20,000 households, including many senior citizens, take advantage of that desperately needed program.  Tax breaks for the rich, increases in military spending, and cutbacks on heating programs for the elderly and the poor. What family values.                          ____________________
