Speaker, it is my great honor to pay tribute to Vice Adm. Michael Kalleres, who will be honored on April 28, 1996 by the Parish Council and the entire Cathedral Community of the Saints Constantine and Helen Greek Orthodox Cathedral. This distinguished citizen of Indiana's First Congressional District will address the congregation during the Liturgy and again during a formal luncheon to be held in his honor. This event will take place at Saints Constantine and Helen Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Merrillville, IN of which he and his wife, Georgia, have been longtime pioneer members.  Admiral Kalleres retired from active duty in September 1994 after 32 years of distinguished service as a naval officer. During this time, he led eight commands in combat and in peacetime, including two Financial Management Directorates. In addition, he led surface ships, squadrons, and two Joint Fleet Organizations.  Admiral Kalleres earned a bachelor of science degree in Industrial Management and Engineering from Purdue University and a master of science degree in Political and International Affairs from George Washington University. He is also a distinguished graduate of the U.S. Naval War College and the National War College.  Admiral Kalleres has received 18 military awards and decorations including the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, and the 1990 Son of Indiana Award for Military Service. Admiral Kalleres' dedication and involvement in the community has been recognized by several other organizations. In 1988, he was awarded the Saint Andrew's Medal for public service by the Greek Orthodox Church. Moreover, Admiral Kalleres received the 1993 Leadership Award from the American Hellenic Institute, and, in March of that same year, he was vested into the International Service Order of Saint Andrew as an Archon. He receive the AXIOs (Worthiness) Medal from the State of California, the 1992 State of Illinois Distinguished Citizen Award, and he was recognized as a Sagamore of the Wabash in 1994. Admiral Kalleres has also been cited in the Marquis Who's Who since 1990.  This past January, Admiral Kalleres was elected to the National Board of the Salvation Army, where he serves on the Disaster Relief and Communications Committee. Furthermore, he is a member of the Dean's Advisory Board at Purdue University, and he currently serves as a member of the Defense Science Board for Strategic Mobility.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in honoring this fine citizen for his dedication to the United States, as well as his community in northwest Indiana. Admiral Kalleres' loyalty and dedication to his country should serve as a model for the citizens of Indiana's First Congressional District and all Americans.                          ____________________
