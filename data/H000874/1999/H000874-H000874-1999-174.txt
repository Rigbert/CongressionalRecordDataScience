Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) for raising this very important issue. I agree with the gentleman from Arizona. I want to say to my friend from Illinois that Commissioner Kelley is vigorously pursuing this and is very concerned. He agrees with the gentleman that incidents of this type have no place with respect to the Customs Service or in this country.  So I am very pleased that the gentleman has introduced this. It is my understanding he is going to withdraw it, but I know that the chairman and I both committed to the gentleman that we are going to vigorously pursue this and work with him to make sure that we know exactly what is going on and that corrective action is taken that is effective and precludes these kind of incidents from happening at any time in the future.  I will say to the gentleman once again that I think the gentleman from Arizona is right. Commissioner Kelley shares our concern and is going to, I think, therefore be an ally of ours in pursuing this very strongly; and I thank the gentleman for raising this important issue, Mr. Chairman.
