President, I would like to take a moment to pay tribute to Major General Michael Dubie, the Adjutant General of the Vermont National Guard. Throughout his career, General Dubie has demonstrated selfless dedication and service to our State and our country. I was very pleased to learn that Vermont's largest newspaper, the Burlington Free Press, recently named General Dubie the Vermonter of the Year. He certainly deserves the honor.  Earlier this year, when Tropical Storm Irene devastated much of Vermont, General Dubie led the Vermont National Guard in confronting one of the most serious crises our State has ever faced. The Guard acted immediately to deliver emergency supplies to victims cut off by the storm's destruction. Helicopters airdropped food and water. When it became apparent that Vermont needed more airlift because some of theVermont Guard's helicopters were in Iraq, General Dubie coordinated with other State Guards to get the help Vermont needed.  The Guard's intensive rescue and aid mission eventually evolved into a longer-term recovery and rebuilding mission. Skillfully and tirelessly, Vermont citizen-soldiers set to work removing debris and rebuilding roads and infrastructure.  General Dubie commanded some 500 activated Guard members in the wake of Irene. But that does not account for other ongoing missions in 2011, or the substantial contribution the Vermont Guard has made to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq--including a major activation to Afghanistan in 2010. In honoring General Dubie as Vermonter of the Year, we pay tribute to the tremendous sacrifice made both in State and overseas by Vermont National Guard members and their families.  True to form, General Dubie, despite his extensive experience with dangerous overseas missions, has called the Irene deployment the proudest mission of his career because he was able to directly help so many of his fellow Vermonters.  MG Michael Dubie is a proven leader and he embodies the best of Vermont. I am proud to recognize his hard work and I wish him continued success in his career.  I ask unanimous consent that the Burlington Free Press article entitled ``Maj. Gen. Dubie is Vermonter of the Year'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Burlington Free Press, Jan. 1, 2012]                Maj. Gen. Dubie Is Vermonter of the Year       As the Vermonter of the Year, we select Maj. Gen. Michael      Dubie, adjutant general of the Vermont National Guard, as the      representative of the team of men and women of the Guard and      the many civilians who worked together to help Vermont      recover from Tropical Storm Irene.       In our lifetime, Tropical Storm Irene is arguably the      biggest and most dominant local news story. Three people lost      their lives during the storm. Vermont National Guard 1st Sgt.      Shawn Stocker lost his life working to respond. Thousands      lost their homes, their businesses and many of their      possessions. Thousands more suffered property damage. Irene      washed away some roads, damaged many others and rendered      useless the state office complex in Waterbury.       Who would have thought that our state could recover so well      in less than 90 days!       Vermonters owe this recovery to so many. State and local      government leaders have done their jobs well. In every      community impacted by the storm, there were at least a few      civilians who devoted most of their time and energy for many      weeks helping their community respond and recover. Hundreds      of volunteers from all over our state and beyond stepped up      to do extraordinary things. They collectively demonstrated      both the indomitable spirit of Vermonters and our love for      community.       Approximately 500 Vermont National Guard members were      activated as well. We are especially mindful that this      activation is in addition to Air Guard deployments to Norway      and Korea, ongoing Vermont National Guard missions in      Djibouti, Kosovo, Macedonia and Senegal, helicopter rescues      in Iraq--all in 2011--and following the major activation to      Afghanistan in 2010. Let us also remember, as the Iraq War      officially comes to its end, the tremendous sacrifice made by      Vermont National Guard members and their families while      serving our country during these past nine years.       As Dubie said in nominating the men and women of the      Vermont National Guard, ``As you know, we are a team. It is      what makes us so strong.'' In responding to Tropical Storm      Irene, the Vermont ``team'' also included many civilians.      Together, the Vermont National Guard and the community      members searched and rescued and then delivered supplies to      people in otherwise unreachable locations. Then they began      reconstruction. In addition to the National Guard, all of      these volunteers should be commended and thanked for their      efforts.       We can choose only one person, however, as Vermonter of the      Year. Because so many people did so much, the selection      committee found it hard to identify a single individual to      recognize. So we choose Maj. Gen. Michael Dubie to honor them      all.                          ____________________
