Speaker, the real outsourcing motion is the one which has been made by the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro). If this motion is adopted and this bill is enacted into law, it will cost American jobs. Anytime the cost of doing business in the United States goes up, the number of Americans with jobs will go down. This motion to recommit would increase the cost of doing business in this country and in the process lose American jobs.  I do not want to hear anybody who has argued in favor of this motion ever to come back and complain about the outsourcing of American jobs to foreign countries if this motion passes because this is the type of thing that will absolutely do that.  The motion to recommit defines the covered entities as those that have substantial business activities in this country, and hurting substantial business in American substantially hurts American workers. Stand up for American workers; vote down this motion to recommit. Stop the outsourcing of jobs by last-minute motions made on the floor with red herring arguments. Vote ``no'' on the motion to recommit.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
