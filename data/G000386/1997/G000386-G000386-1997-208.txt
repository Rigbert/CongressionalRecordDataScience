 President, I come before you today to submit a resolution which would designate the week beginning November 23, 1997, and the week beginning November 22, 1998, as ``National Family Week.'' This legislation has been passed in each Congress and signed into public law every year since 1976. I am pleased to be able to contribute to this longstanding tradition, of recognizing the importance of family, by again introducing this legislation.  As we all know, the family is the most basic element of our society, and the tie that binds us to one another. It is the strength of any free and orderly society and it is appropriate to honorthis unit as being essential to the well-being of the United States.  Since Thanksgiving falls during both of these weeks, we will be paying homage to what we as a nation already know--the strength of the family provides the support through which we as individuals and a nation thrive. Therefore it is particularly suitable to pause during this special week in recognition of the celebrations and activities of the family which bring us closer together. I hope my colleagues will join me in this effort.                          ____________________
