Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank our distinguished chairman for his leadership in authoring this bill and working it through the committee hearings and markup, and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Reyes) as well, the ranking member, and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans), the ranking member of the full committee.  It has been, again, an effort made by so many. I want to thank a few other people on the staff again. Pat Ryan and Kingston Smith, Jeannie McNally, Summer Larson, Darryl Kehrer, who has done yeoman's work on this, Paige McManus, Devon Siebert, Jerry Tan, Mary McDermott, Mary Ellen McCarthy and Beth Kilker.  Again, so much has gone into this. The distinguished chairman talked about the 2-year effort, and that the previous chairman of the subcommittee worked on this as well. This bill, we hope, will be very seriously and quickly considered by the Senate side. This has to be enacted into law as soon as humanly possible. Again, I thank him for his leadership.                             General Leave
