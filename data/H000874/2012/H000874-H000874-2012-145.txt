I think that's a shame, Mr. Majority Leader.  Mr. Boehner said that we were going to be an open House, that we were going to consider matters, and that everybody would have their opportunity to have their input.  Usually, tax bills are brought to the floor, not subject to amendment. You have just said, as I understand what you said, this bill, our way or the highway. If you don't like the bill the way we brought it to the floor, you're out of luck. You don't have an option. You can't put any of your ideas into this bill.  If that's the way you intend to consider this bill, Mr. Leader, I think that's unfortunate.  I yield to my friend.
