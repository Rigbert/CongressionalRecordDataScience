President, I rise today to introduce a bill to make the Impact Aid Program a Federal entitlement.  Impact Aid is one of the oldest Federal education programs, dating from the 1950's, and is meant to compensate a local school district for financial losses resulting from Federal properties or lands in that district. Congress met its obligation of fully funding Impact Aid until the 1970's. When the funding was cut in 1971, many districts that greatly depend on Impact Aid began to suffer. In the past few years, the Impact Aid payment formula has become increasingly complex, causing great funding disparities for the same types of students in different districts.  I have consistently supported increased appropriations for Impact Aid because it not only provides an essential revenue source for impacted districts, but it is also a Federal obligation. Often, close to 90 percent of a local school's funding is comprised of the local tax base. When the presence of the Federal Government in a community takes away from this tax base, we must compensate for this loss. When we do not fulfill our obligation by adequately funding Impact Aid, our children suffer the consequence such as lower test scores, lower attendance rates, crowded classrooms, and fewer and older facilities.  Although funding for Impact Aid has increased over the past few years, it still remains under-funded. Today, I am taking the first step to correct this inequity. My bill will require Congress to meet its duty to these children and schools that have been under-funded for so long. I urge my colleagues to join me in fulfilling our obligation by permanently fully funding the Impact Aid program.
