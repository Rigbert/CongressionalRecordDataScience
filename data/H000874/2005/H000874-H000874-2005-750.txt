Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his response. And I think the gentleman is correct. There were a substantial number of amendments. I would hope that those Members on either side of the aisle who have substantive amendments to offer, in light of the fact that we have been waiting on this bill for some time, would have ample opportunity on either side of the aisle, and I appreciate the leader's focus on that.  Mr. Speaker, lastly, if I can, can the majority leader tell us what his thoughts are in terms of scheduling, we have 2 weeks left before the Easter work period, with reference to either the supplemental appropriation and/or the budget?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's yielding to me.  It is our anticipation, or I have been notified by the respective committees, that we will be considering the supplemental from the President and the budget that both committees expect to hold markups on those two bills next week, which would prepare us and give us plenty of time to have both of those bills on the floor the week prior to the Easter recess.
