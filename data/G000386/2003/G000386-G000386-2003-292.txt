 We are working within a $400 billion package. I wish we could eliminate the gap, as well. What we are trying to do is help the most people who have the most need with the money we have. Most seniors will not be affected by the gap in coverage. Most seniors will not have drug spending in a year that exceeds the benefit limit.  According to the CBO, about 88 percent of the seniors will not even have prescription drug spending that exceeds the $4,500 limit.  The Senator from Florida calls the benefit limit a ``sick tax'' because he believes that seniors should not pay a premium for coverage for catastrophic costs. This is as if to say you should not pay for fire insurance if your house is not going to be on fire. Of course, that is not how insurance works. People purchase insurance to protect them against an unfortunate accident.
