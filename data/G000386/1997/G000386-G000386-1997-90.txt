 President, on behalf of Senator Lott, the majority leader, I will make this announcement.  We announce that this morning, following morning business, at 10:30 a.m., the Senate will begin consideration of S. 39. That is the tuna-dolphin bill. Under a previous agreement, there will be 30 minutes for debate. It will be on that measure. Then it will be followed by a vote on the passage of S. 39.  Also under the order, a vote on the passage of S. 1048, the Transportation appropriations bill, will follow the tuna-dolphin vote. Therefore, Senators can anticipate two rollcall votes this morning. Hopefully that would be around 11 a.m.  As Members are aware, the House did file H.R. 2015, the conference report to accompanying the Balanced Budget Act of 1997; therefore, the Senate will hopefully begin consideration of that measure today at noon. Under the statute, there are 10 hours for debate on that conference report. And as always, Members will be notified as to when that rollcall vote can be expected.  Senator Lott thanks our colleagues for their attention.                          ____________________
