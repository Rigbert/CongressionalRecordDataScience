 President, for the information of all Senators, we are hoping to get a vote in the next 15 minutes, about 2 o'clock, so we can continue to move this bill forward.  I note that there is a Senator here who wishes to speak in morning business. I am happy to accommodate him, but hopefully we will have this agreement and be able to move forward on that very shortly.  I wanted to advise all Senators.
