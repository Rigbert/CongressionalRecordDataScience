 Perhaps it is summed up. I have located the cartoon. It is as I described before--a group of soldiers in a humvee, and the caption is:       I move we adjourn for 5 weeks and take up this contentious      issue after the summer recess.  Frankly, no one in our military has the option of adjourning for 5 weeks to take up contentious issues after that time.
