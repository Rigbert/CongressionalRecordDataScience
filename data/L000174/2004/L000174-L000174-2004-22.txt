President, I would like to commend the work of Bob and Beth Kennett. The Kennett's own the Liberty Hill Farm in Rochester, VT, where Beth runs a bed and breakfast on the farm, and Bob oversees the dairy operation of 70 cows. The Kennett's demonstrate to their guests that dairy farming in Vermont is more than a job or an industry; it's a way of life. Vermont's landscape is defined by the green pastures and silos that dot the hills. Our agricultural economy depends on the hundreds of millions of dollars dairy farmers bring to the State every year. Through the Kennett's combination of agri-tourism and dairying they are helping to ensure farming is not only a part of Vermont's past, but a vital part of Vermont's future.  I ask that a recent article about the Kennett's be printed in the Record.  The article follows:                    [From the Burlington Free Press]                         Just Asking To Survive                            (By Erin Kelly)       Twenty-five years after they bought their small dairy farm      in Vermont's picturesque White River valley, Bob and Beth      Kennett find themselves alone.       ``When we moved here, there were 11 farms shipping milk,''      said Beth Kennett, who helps her husband run a farm of 70      milk cows in Rochester, VT. ``We are now the last dairy farm      in our valley.''       Small dairy farms like the Kennetts' are disappearing      throughout America. In the last half-century, the percentage      of U.S. farms with milk cows has plunged from nearly 62      percent in 1954 to 4 percent in 2002, according to the      Department of Agriculture.       Farmers say that number will keep dropping if a federal      dairy subsidy expires as scheduled in October 2005.       At stake for the farmers is a way of life that in many      cases dates back generations. Suburbanites and urban dwellers      also have something to lose, farmers warn.       If the farms go, their green pastures will be replaced with      shopping malls and housing tracts. Fresh milk produced      locally could be replaced by milk shipped by tanker truck      thousands of miles from mega-dairy farms in the West.       ``The consumer is not going to benefit if all the milk is      produced in just a few places,'' Beth Kennett said. ``Why not      have local milk for local markets?''       Small dairy farmers won a victory last month when the      Senate Appropriations Committee approved a plan to extend the      federal dairy subsidy to at least 2007, when it could      be renewed again as part of a new farm bill. The plan,      pushed by Sens. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.; Herb Kohl, D-Wis.;      and Arlen Specter, R-Pa., still must be approved by the      full Congress.       An effort to attach the subsidy to a Homeland Security bill      failed this past weekend, but lawmakers vowed to try again      this year.       The subsidy, which has cost taxpayers about $2 billion      since its passage in 2002, sends payments to dairy farmers      whenever the price of milk drops below a certain level,      basically guaranteeing farmers a minimum price. Small      farmers, those with about 130 cows or fewer, benefit most.       While some are pushing for the short-term extension of a      tax subsidy for dairy farmers, other dairy state lawmakers      want a different, long-term solution one that could raise the      price of a gallon of milk for consumers.       Instead of a taxpayer subsidy, the National Dairy Equity      Act would require milk processors to pay farmers a minimum      price for their milk.       If the proposal becomes law, consumers could pay as much as      20 cents more per gallon of whole milk, warns the      International Dairy Foods Association, which represents     processors. Sen. Jim Jeffords, I-Vt., says the group is      grossly exaggerating the cost as a scare tactic.       Ken Bailey, associate professor of dairy markets at      Pennsylvania State University, said even an increase of a few      cents could hurt sales of milk, which has dropped in      popularity. The percentage of raw milk being turned into milk      to drink declined from 40 percent in 1980 to 28 percent in      2000, with the rest used to make cheese or other dairy      products.       When the retail price of milk went up in May and June,      sales fell 3 percent, Bailey said.       ``It doesn't make sense to design a whole federal policy      around a small and declining segment of the dairy market,''      Bailey said. ``What the federal government should be doing is      getting out the way and encouraging innovation and the      creation of new dairy products. In Europe, liquid yogurt      beverages are very popular. Our thinking is still stuck back      in the 1950s when everybody had a glass of milk with      dinner.''       Carl Greene, a sixth generation dairy farmer in Berlin,      N.Y., said that with a little help from Washington, he is      optimistic that the farm he works with his brother and father      will survive for a long time to come.       ``Any help we get will make us more competitive,'' he said.      ``We'll reinvest it back into the farm.''       Beth Kennett, who runs a bed and breakfast out of her      Rochester farmhouse to help make ends meet, said the city      folks who visit seem willing to help once they see what's at      stake. People need to realize that retail milk prices which      have stayed fairly steady at $2.62 to $2.76 a gallon over the      last eight years are a bargain and don't reflect the farmers'      true cost, Kennett said.       ``Our guests, once they see the hard work that goes into      it, say they'd be more than happy to pay an extra nickel for      milk to keep Farmer Bob going,'' Kennett said. ``We're not      asking to make huge profits. We're just asking to      survive.''                          ____________________
