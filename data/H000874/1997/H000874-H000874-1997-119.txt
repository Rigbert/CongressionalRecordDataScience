Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise today in support of H.R. 29, a bill designating a Federal building in New York City as the ``Ronald H. Brown Federal Building.'' I want to recognize the efforts of Representative Rangel who introduced this legislation in January with 25 cosponsors.  Mr. Speaker, as you know, in April 1996, 33 Americans including Secretary Ron Brown, employees of the Department of Commerce, business leaders, and military personnel died in a plane crash in Croatia. Ron Brown spent his entire life as a consensus builder working hard for his family and his Nation, constantly striving to bring people together. He was a man who was always in the arena striving for greatness and truly embodied what is right in America. With his death, America lost a tremendous leader.  Having served as the first African-American Secretary of Commerce, Ron Brown was always seeking to bridge the racial divide in our country and worked hard to create and protect American jobs. He brought a sense of energy and creativity to the Commerce Department which allowed him to successfully rally labor and management, Republicans and Democrats, and foreign governments with American interests. This was most evident in the strong support that the private sector had shown for the Department.  Today, the House will pass this legislation which represents a small, yet meaningful, gesture of our admiration and appreciation for a man whom many considered the best Secretary of Commerce ever. I am sure that Alma and the entire Brown family is proud to see this building named in honor of Ron Brown. I applaud the leadership in bringing this legislation to the floor and join with my colleagues in supporting H.R. 29 and allowing the legacy of Ron Brown to live on in the Federal building located at 290 Broadway in New York City.
