President, as regents to the Smithsonian, Senator Leahy, Senator Cochran, and I would like to pay tribute to an individual who has provided exceptional leadership to the Smithsonian Institution as a citizen regent, Patricia Stonesifer.  Ms. Stonesifer was appointed to the Smithsonian Board of Regents on December 21, 2001. During her tenure, which included 3 years of service as chair of the Board of Regents, Ms. Stonesifer helped lead the Smithsonian's governance reform efforts.
