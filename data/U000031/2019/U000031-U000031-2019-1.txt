 Just this last week, we witnessed real advancements, we think, in pancreatic cancer stage III, stage IV. SMA, spinal muscular atrophy, a disease that is often fatal by the year 9 or 10; we saw a woman who had been on a new drug for 15 days, and for the first time she could actually move her neck after more than 10 years literally trapped in a wheelchair.  If we want to find the advancements and cures for these diseases, we need to pass H.R. 19.  I urge my colleagues to vote for that substitute and get a bill to the President that he will actually sign, and we can get something done.
