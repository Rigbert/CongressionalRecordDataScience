I would really appreciate his cosponsorship, but I don't want to ask his name be added until we are certain. If there are any difficulties on this amendment, I stand ready to change it. We want to find a good bipartisan response. There are just a few elements we are still working on.  I don't know if the Senator from Oklahoma thinks this is the time for us to move for passage of the amendment or whether we should wait?
