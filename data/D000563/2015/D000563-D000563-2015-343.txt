President, this Memorial Day weekend, as our country remembers and honors those who have served America, a national cemetery in Elwood, IL, will make a distinguished mark on our Nation's history. Lincoln National Cemetery will become home to the Nation's first monument honoring fallen Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender, LGBT, veterans.  A recognition of our fallen LGBT service members is long overdue. This monument serves as a testament to those members of our military who have shown devotion to their country in the eyes of discrimination. It is in their memory that we move toward a more just and equal future.  The monument comes nearly 4 years after the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell. With repeal, our country took a step to move past the prejudices of the past and toward a day when all Americans can serve the country with honesty and pride. This monument recognizes that service with a fitting dedication that reads:       Gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people have served      honorably and admirably in America's Armed Forces. In their      memory and appreciation of their selfless service and      sacrifice this monument was dedicated.  This monument serves as a reminder to all of us that it is our job to envision and create a more just and equal nation where there are no prerequisites to serve your country. All of our servicemembers join the military to serve America and make the world a better place. We must honor that service by making sure we continue to uphold those values of equality and justice at home that they have fought for abroad.                          ____________________
