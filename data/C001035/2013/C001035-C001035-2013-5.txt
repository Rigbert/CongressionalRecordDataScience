President, I rise today with Senator McCaskill and Senator Manchin to introduce the Securing Job Corps Centers Act, a bill that seeks to address the Job Corps' recent management challenges.  Job Corps is an educational and vocational training program administered by the Department of Labor, DOL, that helps at-risk young people ages 16 through 24 by giving them the tools they need to succeed. Job Corps has been training young adults for meaningful careers for nearly 50 years and is committed to offering its students a safe, drug-free environment where they can train and learn.  Job Corps' mission is to attract eligible young people, teach them the skills they need to become employable and independent, and help them find meaningful jobs or further their education. This mission has been threatened, however, by the Department of Labor's mismanagement.  Earlier this year, the DOL ordered a temporary suspension of new student enrollments as its way to address a significant Job Corps program shortfall of $61.5 million. This was in addition to the $39 million shortfall in the previousprogram year. The suspension of enrollments decimated the program, setting it back for years to come, which is especially upsetting considering Job Corps has compiled an impressive record over five decades in preparing at-risk youth for the workforce or higher education.  According to DOL, several factors contributed to Job Corps' financial problems, but the most significant was unchecked growth in expenditures due to serious weaknesses in the financial management processes. I wrote to DOL officials for clarification, and they responded with the following:       Job Corps lacked appropriate program monitoring tools and      control protocols, including those to sufficiently analyze      contractual spending trends. In turn, this led to inadequate      spending projections for the Operations account.  It is clear that the Department of Labor has mismanaged this program, and the students suffered the consequences. There are two Job Corps centers in Maine that do excellent work to help these young adults become productive members of society. The Penobscot Job Corps Academy and the Loring Job Corps Center have the capability to serve nearly 800 at-risk youth on a daily basis. These centers put these young men and women on a path to earning their high school diploma and to gaining the necessary skills to enter the workforce or the military or go on to college.  However, the shortfall caused by DOL mismanagement forced these centers to furlough and lay off staff to reduce costs--jeopardizing the long-term sustainability of these centers and their important work.  Studies have found Job Corps to be among the most effective of all federally supported programs that serve youth between the ages of 16 and 24 who are disconnected from both school and work. Even in the face of unprecedented budget shortfalls and enrollment freezes, Job Corps has continued to produce impressive results--85 percent of graduates obtain a job, enroll in higher education, or enlist in the military.  To ensure recent management challenges are addressed as transparently and effectively as possible, our bill would create an advisory board responsible for working with the DOL to develop policy and programmatic recommendations related to Job Corps' administration. The advisory panel will provide a series of reports directly to the U.S. Secretary of Labor and Congress on budget and financial management protocols, cost efficiencies, and maximizing the number of youth served. Our bill will also require earlier notifications of management decisions at DOL that could affect student enrollments.  Job Corps' recent management challenges have had ripple effects throughout the communities served by Job Corps centers and continue to have an impact on center operations. The fact that every Job Corps center continues to operate at 21 to 25 percent below full capacity is the result of a management structure that forced operational decisions to be made in haste and without proper consideration of alternatives. An advisory board of experienced Job Corps operations experts can help the program and its new leadership to emerge from the crises of the last year and ensure that, in the future, Job Corps policy decisions are always guided by what is in the best interests of Job Corps students and communities.  Job Corps' value remains clear. Studies suggest that leaving behind the youth served by this program could cost our states and our economy hundreds of thousands of dollars per youth. I urge my colleagues to support our bill to ensure that Job Corps returns to the operational efficiency that characterized its first 50 years and remains among the nation's most successful workforce programs.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              Department of Labor,                                      Employment and Training,                                Washington, DC, February 21, 2013.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: Thank you for your letter to Acting      Secretary of Labor Seth D. Harris regarding the U.S.      Department of Labor's (Department) oversight and      administration of the Job Corps program. Job Corps is part of      the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) and the      Acting Secretary referred your letter to me for response.      Although we are not placing a moratorium on suspension of      enrollments at this time, I hope you will find the following      information to be helpful.       The Employment and Training Administration administers Job      Corps through 147 contracts for the program's 125 centers and      educational and vocational programs. Private contractors      operate 97 centers and the U.S. Department of Agriculture      (USDA) runs the remaining 28 centers. This letter discusses      the financial problems experienced by Job Corps in Program      Year (PY) 2011 and PY 2012, their causes, what we should have      done better, corrective actions we have taken, and the steps      we will take to ensure that the Job Corps program can      continue to provide high-quality programming to some of our      nation's most disadvantaged youth. We would welcome the      opportunity to provide you and your colleagues with a more      in-depth briefing at your earliest convenience. We are      continuing to analyze the matters discussed in this letter.      The description we have set forth below reflects our current      understanding.       Several factors contributed to the financial problems with      Job Corps in PY 2011, including growth in expenditures (such      as student-related expenditures and those associated with the      opening of three new Job Corps centers in PY 2010 and PY      2011) and serious weaknesses in ETA's and Job Corps'      financial management processes that led to a failure to      identify and adjust for rising costs in a timely manner. In      PY 2012, Job Corps again experienced financial problems      because the cost-savings measures taken by ETA and Job Corps      management were not aggressive enough to allow the program to      stay within budget.       For example, Job Corps opened three new centers in PY 2010      and PY 2011 on a delayed schedule. Funding that had been      provided to Job Corps to cover the costs of operating these      centers in prior years was no longer dedicated to these sites      as a result of the delays, and we did not appropriately plan      for the increased costs resulting from the opening of these      centers.       While these and other costs escalated during the course of      PY 2011, the extent of the financial problems went      unrecognized. This is largely because Job Corps lacked      appropriate program monitoring tools and control protocols,      including those to sufficiently analyze contractual spending      trends. In turn, this led to inadequate spending projections      for the Operations account.       As you know, Congress provided ETA with authority in PY      2011 to transfer up to $26.2 million in funds from the Job      Corps Construction, Rehabilitation and Acquisition (CRA)      account to the Operations account. In April 2012, I concluded      that Job Corps would need to transfer this full amount. At      the end of May 2012, I notified the Secretary of the need to      transfer the funds. It also became apparent that this      transfer would not be sufficient to meet PY 2011 operating      needs.       Thus, ETA obtained approval from the Office of Management      and Budget (OMB) in June 2012 to transfer up to an additional      $5.37 million from the Training and Employment Services (TES)      and State Unemployment Insurance and Employment Service      Operations (SUIESO) accounts to the Job Corps Operations      account. The Department notified the Appropriations      Committees of its intent to transfer these funds. In the end,      only $2.2 million of this initial request was transferred to      Job Corps' Operations account.       In addition to the fund transfers for PY 2011, ETA      implemented a variety of programmatic changes to control      costs. These changes focused on non-mission critical      administrative expenses to ensure that student academic,      career technical training, and post-graduation placement      activities were not affected. These included negotiating      across-the-board cost-savings targets with each Job Corps      center to deobligate PY 2011 funds and suspending enrollment      for new students in the month of June, except for homeless      youth. ETA also conducted additional oversight on travel by      requiring center operators to report all bus and airfare      travel directly to the national office prior to arranging      travel with ticketing agencies, thus allowing for real-time      accounting of June's travel costs. We also required Job Corps      center operators to submit their financial reports every      three days during the month of June.       Concurrently, ETA implemented several initiatives to      strengthen and coordinate existing controls and created new      controls where appropriate to track contractor expenditures,      and certify adequate funding throughout the rest of PY 2011.      On May 22, 2012, the Department established a Job Corps      working group within DOL to provide weekly oversight of the      remediation efforts during the end of PY 2011. In addition,      in June 2012, Secretary Solis requested that the Inspector      General (IG) perform a comprehensive review of the Job Corps      financial control system.       We understood at the outset of PY 2012 that we needed to      take measures to ensure that program obligations remained      within Job Corps' appropriated levels. Even before the      program year started, we began to develop a comprehensive      plan for cost-cutting measures, which was updated throughout      the Program Year. In addition, the improvements made to Job      Corps' financial management allowed us to make projections      earlier in the program year about the overall budget      situation.       Given our strong interest in not reducing student services      and minimizing disruption to the Job Corps Program, we      proceeded cautiously in evaluating and implementing cost      saving measures in PY 2012. In retrospect, it is clear that      we did not act as quickly or decisively as circumstances      required. As the Assistant Secretary, I take full      responsibility for our failure to manage these issues more      aggressively.       Although they ultimately were insufficient, we did take      several significant steps throughout PY 2012 to gain better      control of Job Corps' expenses. For example, in August a      newly-created Office of Financial Administration (OFA) within      ETA, headed by a Senior Executive Service-level Comptroller,      began operating. OFA oversees the now-centralized budget and      financial operations of Job Corps. After OFA began operating,      we developed initial targets for both savings and what we      believed would be a sufficient reserve for the Job Corps      program. We also eliminated a contract for accounting      services within the Job Corps Operations account, reduced      USDA costs, and negotiated with contractors to identify      additional cost-savings measures.       In September 2012, the Secretary approved several      additional measures for PY 2012: a reduction in new student      biweekly stipend and transition pay to graduates, suspension      of enrollments in late November and December, centralizing      student transportation costs, and reducing the national      academic support contract and career technical support      contract. In October 2012, we issued guidance informing the      Job Corps community that we would be suspending enrollment      from November 26 through December 31, 2012. We also announced      that, effective November 1, 2012, Job Corps would reduce the      stipends and transition pay for new enrollees.       Despite these cost-cutting measures, our analysis of data      in November showed that Job Corps would need to implement      additional savings because costs were again exceeding      budgeted amounts. Therefore, in December, we took additional      steps, including eliminating the student stipend for days      when a Job Corps student is not present for duty, which took      effect immediately, and reducing the student clothing      stipend, effective January 1, 2013. We reduced Job Corps'      national media buy by $4 million for PY 2012. In mid-     December, we increased the student to teacher ratio from 15:1      to 18:1 in order to save costs, while properly accounting for      the special academic needs of at-risk youth.       In January 2013, we also issued guidance to reduce health      care-related costs, including by modifying the current health      staffing requirements, adjusting the hours for center      physicians, dentists and Training Employee Assistance Program      specialists based on center usage, and requiring applicants      to provide a current record of immunizations in order to      eliminate duplicative care. We also continued our work to cut      administrative costs. Among other things, we have issued a      solicitation that we anticipate will help Job Corps right-     size its career technical training and academic programs and      we are exploring the best way to centralize utility and other      procurements.       Notwithstanding these efforts to reduce costs for PY 2012,      as of the beginning of January 2013 we continued to project      insufficient cost savings to remain within budgeted levels      for the program year. On January 18, 2013, Job Corps      instructed all centers to temporarily suspend outreach and      admission activities, effective January 28, except for      runaway, homeless and foster care candidates. The length of      the suspension will be determined by the time it takes to      achieve the necessary savings, but we do not expect it to      last past June 30, 2013.       The decision to temporarily freeze Job Corps enrollment      nationwide was extremely difficult. It came after we      implemented many alternative cost-savings measures, albeit      insufficient ones. We also considered other alternatives      before deciding to implement the temporary enrollment freeze.       Some of the options we considered include an abbreviated      program year, slot reductions at a specified number of      centers, cutting student stipends and transition pay to      current students, and adopting a student leave policy in lieu      of scheduled holiday and other school breaks. Ultimately, we      rejected these and other options because of their more      harmful effect on the Job Corps program and the students that      it serves as well as the insufficient savings we would have      obtained. Our conclusion was that the most certain and least      detrimental savings Job Corps could achieve for the remainder      of PY 2012 was from the temporary suspension. This will      result in reduced center operating expenses, lower Outreach/     Admissions contract costs, as well as savings in student      stipend and transportation costs.       Notwithstanding the temporary enrollment suspension, on      January 28, 2013, Job Corps continued to serve 44,268      students as of that date. With the suspension of new      enrollments, Job Corps will be able to keep its commitment to      students who are already in the program.       In closing, the Department deeply regrets the current      situation facing the Job Corps program. I personally take      responsibility for not acting more quickly to ensure that the      program was operating within its appropriated levels. The      decision to temporarily suspend enrollment at all centers is      the most balanced, efficient way to achieve the savings now      in order to avoid a shortfall in PY 2012. However, we clearly      recognize that a comprehensive review and assessment of the      Job Corps program, contracting, budget, and management is      needed to ensure that we do not face this situation again. We      will keep your office updated. Please contact Michelle Rose      in the Department's Office of Congressional and      Intergovernmental Affairs with any questions.
