Speaker, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 3484, the Prompt Utilization of Wireless Spectrum Act of 2001. The bill's title aptly describes the critical need for this legislation to turn wireless spectrum, which has been tied up in litigation for years, into a useful, performing asset for the American people.  For some five years, these personal communication services spectrum licenses have been the subject of a contentious dispute between the original licensee, an entity known as NextWave, and the Federal Communications Commission, regarding their rightful ownership.  In 1993, the Communications Act of 1934 was amended to permit the FCC to sell licenses and construction permits through acompetitive bidding process and allow the successful bidders to pay for their licenses in installments. Pursuant to this authorization, auctions of certain licenses were held in 1996. NextWave successfully bid approximately $4.7 billion for a substantial block of these licenses.  Subsequently, however, the market value of these licenses became depressed in response to various events, which in turn, adversely impacted the ability of some licensees to obtain funding for their purchases and operations. After making an initial payment of approximately $500 million, NextWave failed to obtain financing for the balance it owed to the government and filed for bankruptcy relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in 1998. It thereafter made no other payments to the FCC for the licenses. Eventually, 20 other licensees also filed for bankruptcy relief under Chapter 11.  Extensive litigation over NextWave's licenses dragged on for several years. The FCC ultimately canceled the licenses and reauctioned them in January of this year, with winning bids of nearly $16 billion. Nevertheless, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia subsequently found the FCC's cancellation of the licenses violated the Bankruptcy Code and thereby rendering their reauction null and void.  In an effort to resolve the various issues presented by the disputed ownership of these licenses, the FCC, NextWave and certain other interested parties have entered into a comprehensive settlement agreement late last month. The agreement provides, in essence, for the transfer of the licenses by NextWave to the FCC, which in turn will convey them to the successful reauction bidders. In exchange for agreeing to transfer the licenses, NextWave will receive a cash payment from the United States government (in addition to which the government will make a cash payment directly to the IRS on behalf of NextWave). As the result of these transactions and certain related payments, the United States will receive approximately $10 billion as net proceeds from the settlement.  In response to certain concerns expressed with regard to the settlement agreement, the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law and the Subcommittee on the Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property of the Committee on the Judiciary held a Joint hearing last week on this matter. Over the course of that hearing, various issues presented by the settlement agreement and proposed legislation were closely scrutinized, particularly those provisions requiring expedited judicial review and limiting the venue of certain appeals.  Largely as a result of that hearing and extensive consultations with the interested parties, I am now confident that the settlement agreement is in the best interest of the public and the national fisc, under the circumstances.  H.R. 3484, the Prompt Utilization of Wireless Spectrum Act of 2001 ensures that the settlement agreement will be implemented with the ultimate goal of making these telecommunications licenses available to those who will best utilize them for the American people.  Given the time constraints implicit in the pending settlement agreement and the need to tree up these licenses as soon as possible, it is my hope that Congress will promptly consider and pass H.R. 3484.                          ____________________
