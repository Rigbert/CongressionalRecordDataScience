 The Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs will have jurisdiction over matters relating to the Department of Homeland Security, except with respect to any other function related to the customs revenue functions or to the commercial functions or commercial operations that were exercised by the United States Customs Service on the day before the effective date of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. Now, the Homeland Security Act directed the Secretary of the Treasury to identify, within 60 days after the date of enactment of the Act, those authorities vested in the Secretary of the Treasury that were exercised by the Commissioner of Customs on or before the effective date of the act. By letter dated January 24, 2003, the General Counsel at the Department of the Treasury transmitted that report to the Finance Committee. I ask unanimous consent that the General Counsel's letter and attached report be printed in the Record, in order to provide further guidance as to what is covered by this third clarifying provision. As comprehensive as this report is, I note that it serves to provide illustrative guidance and is not an exhaustive list of the functions or operations encompassed by the third clarification we've added.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                   Department of the Treasury,                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 2003.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Chairman, Committee on Finance, Dirksen Senate Office          Building, Washington, DC     Hon. Max Baucus,     Committee on Finance, Dirksen Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Gentlemen: Under Section 418(b) of the Homeland Security      Act of 2002 (the ``Act''), Title IV, Subtitle B, Public L.      No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135 (November 24, 2002), the      Secretary of the Treasury is directed to report to your      Committees any proposed conforming amendments to determine      the appropriate allocation of legal authorities described      under section 412(a)(2) of the Act. The Secretary of the      Treasury is also directed to identify those authorities      vested in the Secretary of the Treasury that are exercised by      the Commissioner of Customs on or before the effective date      of this section. This report is due not later than 60 days      after the date of enactment of the Act and is provided by      this letter.       Treasury has identified no conforming amendments needed to      determine the appropriate allocation of legal authorities      described under section 412(a)(2) of the Act. Under section      412(a)(1), authority related to Customs revenue functions      that was vested in the Secretary of the Treasury by law      before the effective date of this Act under those provisions      of law set forth in section 412(a)(2), shall not be      transferred to the Secretary of Homeland Security by reason      of this Act. Rather, on and after the effective date of this      Act, the law provides that the Secretary of the Treasury may,      at his discretion, delegate any such authority to the      Secretary of Homeland Security and that the Secretary of the      Treasury shall consult with the Secretary of Homeland      Security regarding the exercise of any authority not so      delegated. Based on our review, we have identified no      barriers to the appropriate allocation of legal authorities      described under section 412(a)(2). As we work with the      Department of Homeland Security and others to implement the      act, we will notify you promptly if we determine that      currently unforeseen legal barriers pose a problem that      require a legislative solution.       To complete this report, a chart is attached identifying      those authorities vested in the Secretary of the Treasury      that are exercised by the Commissioner of Customs on or      before the effective date of this Act. We are pleased to be      of assistance in this matter.           Sincerely,                                               David D. Aufhauser,                                                  General Counsel.
