Speaker, it is my honor to rise today to commend Wilbur Wright Middle School, and its principal, Mr. Donald Guske, and Munster High School, and its principal, Dr. Kevin McCaffrey, for having been awarded the Blue Ribbon School Award. Both schools are located in Munster, IN.  Blue ribbon schools have been judged to be particularly constructive in meeting local, State, and national goals. These schools also display the qualities of excellence that are necessary to prepare our young people for the challenges of the next century. According to the U.S. Department of Education, which issues this award, blue ribbon school status is awarded to schools that have: strong leadership; a clear vision and sense of mission that is shared by all connected with the school; high quality teaching; challenging up-to-date curricula; policies and practices that ensure a safe environment conducive to learning; a solid commitment to parental involvement; and evidence that the school helps all students achieve a quality education.  State education departments, the Department of Defense Dependent Schools, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the Council for American Private Education, review schools in depth to determine which schools meet the high standards of the award. Following the screening process, the nominations are forwarded to the U.S. Department of Education. At this point, a panel of 100 outstanding educators and other professionals review the nominations, select the schools for site visits, and make recommendations to the Secretary of Education. These schools will be honored at a national ceremony in Washington, DC, this spring.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Wilbur Wright Middle School and Munster High School for a job well done. The teachers and administrators of these two schools make Indiana's First Congressional District a better place in which to live and work. There is no greater success than to successfully educate our children.                          ____________________
