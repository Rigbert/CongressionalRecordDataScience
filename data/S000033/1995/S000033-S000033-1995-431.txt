 It is really quite incredible, and the other irony I would point out is the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Lipinski] quite correctly talked about the impact of NAFTA 1 year later--loss of jobs, lessening of the trade balance.                              {time}  1740  Fourteen months ago when we were debating that issue here, who would have believed it, after hearing all that the proponents told us, right? It is going to improve the standard of living of Mexican workers. It is going to create untold jobs in America; 14 months come and go, and what we are talking about now is the collapse of the Mexican economy, the decline in the volume of the peso by 40 percent, and a $40 billion bailout. You know what gets me? Where are all the editorial writers? Every major newspaper in America told us what a great thing it would be. Remember that?
