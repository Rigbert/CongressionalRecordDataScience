Chairman, they are something that needs to be preserved, and we think about, too, the safety of all those boaters. Whether one sails across Lake Michigan at night, or Lake Superior, Lake Erie, Lake Huron, they are important, and they stand as a beacon for every community in terms of historical significance, and I appreciate the gentleman's support and also that of my Michigan colleagues that were instrumental in getting this amendment adopted.  Mr. Chairman, again I appreciate the help of the full committee here in helping me prepare the amendment and the time this afternoon.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton).  The question was taken; and the Chairman pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it.
