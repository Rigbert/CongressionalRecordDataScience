 President, I renew the unanimous consent that I offered several days ago that allowed us to begin the process of amendments and listed the first seven amendments that would be offered on my side.  To refresh everyone's memory, the unanimous consent agreement I proffered would have allowed us to go forward and rotate from side to side, as we have done in the past on major legislation of this type, with one amendment on each side. I listed the first seven amendments that would be offered on our side, and it was objected to.  Mr. President, I renew that unanimous consent request.
