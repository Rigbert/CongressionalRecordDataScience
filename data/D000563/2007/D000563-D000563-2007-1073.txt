President, in the next day or two, the House and Senate will consider the Iraq supplemental appropriations bill. This is the fifth year of our war in Iraq. This is the seventh time the President has come to Congress for an emergency supplemental bill.  In the ordinary course of events, a President and administration will submit to Congress an appropriation. We carefully review it, consider amendments, vote on it, and send it back to the President for signature.
