Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey) has not read this bill. Apparently he wrote his speech before he read the bill. Now this bill is not too weak. It provides twice the criminal penalties than the bill that was passed by the other body. It provides criminal sanctions against those who retaliate against whistleblowers. The other body provides more lawsuits.  Every criminal penalty does allow the judge to enter a restitution order. Restitution orders are nondischargeable in bankruptcy. The huge fines in my bill are nondischargeable in bankruptcy. Corporate executives up to $5 million in fines, nondischargeable. Corporations up to $25 million in fines for filing a false statement, nondischargeable in bankruptcy.  So what we do is we provide jail terms for the bad actors, we provide nondischargeable fines for the bad actors, and we get tough on those that have looted the pensions and the savings of the employees that have worked dutifully for those corporations where the officers and the boards of directors have not fulfilled their fiduciary responsibility.  This is a tough bill because it puts people in jail for a long time. It ought to be passed, and passed now, as the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Gephardt) has urged us to address this issue. I urge an aye vote.
