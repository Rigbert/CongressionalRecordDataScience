President, today I wish to bring the attention of the Senate to a small business in Vermont, the Outdoor Gear Exchange, which is moving to a new location near and dear to my heart--the Church Street Marketplace in Burlington.  A large, national retailer recently chose to depart the Marketplace. This left a big hole on one of our nation's most successful pedestrian malls. The local owners of the Outdoor Gear Exchange, Marc Sherman and Mike Donahue, quickly took the opportunity to move their successful venture from a nearby side street onto Church Street.  As a longtime supporter of the Church Street Marketplace, I was pleased to see this locally owned and much-beloved fixture in the Vermont business scene fill one of the most high-profile store fronts on Church Street.  I hope Americans interested in good news during this difficult economy might take a moment to read about this great business, and I ask unanimous consent to have the May 16, 2011, Burlington Free Press article written by Dan D'Ambrosio entitled ``Outdoor Gear Exchange takes its store, and philosophy, into a bigger space'' printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Burlington Free Press, May 16, 2011] Outdoor Gear Exchange Takes Its Store, and Philosophy, Into a Bigger                                  Space       At the beginning of last week, Marc Sherman, co-owner of      Outdoor Gear Exchange, sat in the empty, cavernous space on      Church Street where he was moving his business--in the spot      Old Navy used to occupy--and contemplated the grand opening      of his new store approaching on Thursday.       Sitting surrounded by partially finished displays and      unopened boxes of merchandise scattered about on the concrete      floor, it was hard to believe. But Sherman and his crew of 65      full-time employees were determined to be ready for this      week's ribbon cutting and remarks by Gov. Peter Shumlin.      Sherman said the creation of his new store--at 15,000 square      feet of retail space, twice the size of the old store on      Cherry Street--cost more than $100,000.       ``All of my staff is running around putting this      together,'' Sherman said last week. ``Unlike most stores,      we're not moving into a store, we're building our own. That      increases everyone's commitment.''       Sherman said he thinks of his staff as family, and said the      rush to get the new store open has been exhilarating. He's      proud to be, he says, the first local store in that prime      space on Church Street in a very long time.       ``I have the world's greatest staff,'' Sherman said.      ``Everyone is fun and enthusiastic. They're funny and smart.      I love hanging out with them. They're all really active. To      me that is the most important thing about what I do. I like      the people I work with.''       Sherman grew up in Englewood, N.J., moving to New York City      after graduating from college to take a job crunching numbers      for the marketing department of a manufacturing company, a      job he remembers as ``not particularly exciting.''       On winter weekends, he would drive to Vermont to ski at      Ludlow.       ``I realized every weekend I wanted to go home to New York      less and less,'' Sherman said. ``I never had a bad experience      in Vermont. I said, Why not stay here and visit New York?'      That was 19 years ago.''       Sherman began his business with a friend in 1995 in an 800-     square-foot space on Main Street, where Tonic is now. Their      business plan was based on the fact that Sherman had more      outdoor equipment than he knew what to do with, and his      friend didn't have any.       ``We wanted to connect people who have too much with people      who have too little and make it affordable for them to get      outside because, I'll be the first to say, the gear is      expensive; the clothing is expensive,'' Sherman said.       Sherman quickly moved beyond consignments, settling on a      three-tier model. Consignment items still make up about 8      percent of his business, all of it walk-in, but the bulk is      in new clothing and gear plus seconds, close-outs and      cosmetic blemishes. There are very few outdoors stores using      this particular mix of product offerings, Sherman said.       ``It's a model that's proven to work even if it doesn't      always make sense,'' Sherman said. ``Somebody is looking at a      full-price backpack for $450 next to somebody looking at a      close-out backpack for $250, next to somebody looking at a      used backpack for $150, and we sell to all of them. Some      people want to spend more for what's out this year. Some      people want to save a little. We have something for      everybody.''       Sherman also went his own way when it came to deciding what      to stock.       ``We felt if we opened a store that would focus on what      consumers are looking for opposed to what manufacturers are      generating,     we'd be successful,'' Sherman said. ``We always tried to find      gear our friends would buy, or that we would want to buy.''       Outdoor Gear Exchange also does an online business account      for 25 percent of its sales and growing, nearly doubling this      year. Sherman was able to consolidate his online staff from      where they were, in a space above The Body Shop on Church      Street, to offices in his new space. Although he doesn't      release sales figures, Sherman did say his annual payroll      approaches $1 million.       With all the extra space to work with in the new location,      Sherman and co-owner Mike Donohue are getting into gear for      family camping, also known as car camping, which will put      them in competition with Dick's Sporting Goods in Williston.      Traditionally, Outdoor Gear Exchange has focused on      backpackers, climbers and hikers, ``folks going out into the      wilderness,'' Sherman said, and who place a high value on      light-weight gear.       But Sherman said family camping is a growing segment of the      market, especially for people his age--45 years old. It's not      inexpensive to get into, but once you're set up, it is a      relatively cheap vacation. The priorities for the gear are      different than those for hikers and climbers.       ``Car camping is a little more focused on amenities and      space, as opposed to weight,'' Sherman said. ``We'll offer      tents with more features oriented toward cushy living,      thicker sleeping pads, things like that.''       Sherman also plans to expand his offering of casual outdoor      clothing to include lower price ranges than he has      historically stocked, in memory of the recently departed Old      Navy.       ``We're sensitive to the fact that Old Navy provided a      service to folks who couldn't afford more expensive      clothing,'' Sherman said. ``Whether it was high quality or      not, the bottom line is it was highly affordable. We want to      make sure that doesn't become a void in the downtown, so      we'll look for outdoor casual that's more affordable than      what we currently sell.''       Eventually, Sherman plans to add another 8,000 square feet      of retail space in the basement of his new space, which he is      also leasing. Panera Bread, the national chain of bakery-     cafes, will also be on the main floor of the building as the      only other tenant, although there will be no physical      connection between the two businesses. Panera isn't expected      to open for another month or two.       ``I hope we get some bread smell, but that's about it,''      Sherman said.                          ____________________
