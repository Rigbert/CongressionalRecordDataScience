 President, I understand the Senator from Wyoming is on the floor. I want to set up sometime allotment for our side so we can go back and forth. Under our time, I yield 10 minutes to the Senators from Delaware, 5 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico, and 10 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota. We will alternate time with the other side as they require.
