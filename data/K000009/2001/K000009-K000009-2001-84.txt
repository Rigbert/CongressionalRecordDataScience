Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fattah) for bringing up the important point, that in many communities across this country, until this program was enacted, local police were not policing. In fact, in many places in America the local police had no relationship with the authorities. This program has drawn in local policing, whether it is county, State officials, local police, on-site resident management that are trained now in working with the local residents.  The relationship locally with the authorities was not always a good one. In many cases, and I cited Chicago in particular, which I never forgot after visiting there, the authorities were completely out of control. They were neglected. They neglected areas of our community.  I want to thank the gentleman for pointing out the importance of this program in creating an appropriate bond with local authorities so that now there is security, and crime has gone down all over this country including in these very important neighborhoods.
