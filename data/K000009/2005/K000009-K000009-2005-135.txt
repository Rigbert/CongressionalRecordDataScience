Chairman, I would just say, along with what the gentleman has stated for the record, there are over 140 million cars and 85 million trucks on our highways. And today 3,300,000 of those cars and trucks all already are on our highways running on 85 percent ethanol. If we but use our fleets in a wiser way and help transition to these new fuels, we can make a difference in the pockets of every single American and leave a better world to our children.  Today, there are 187,000 retail locations in our country from which we purchase our fuels, but only 400 stations across 38 States sell E-85. I want to buy. I just said to the head of GM, who came here to Washington this week, to the Auto Caucus event, I said, Sir, I want to buy a GM Malibu powered by ethanol. Do you sell it? And even if I bought it, could I go to Toledo and buy the fuel?  He said, ``I do not think I have that yet.'' I said, ``Can you go back to Detroit and figure that one out for me?''  I know that the Jeep Liberty that is rolling off the lines in Toledo today has, for the first time in U.S. history, a 5 percent biodiesel blend as original equipment, called B-5. Someday we are going to get that up to B-20, and the farms in Ohio that surround the cities that some of us live in are going to provide that fuel. And that money is going to be going in their pockets. We are going to have a new fuel-based age in this Nation.  I get pretty excited about this, because I have seen the future and it is in Ohio, and it is in Iowa, and it is in Nebraska.
