Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 673) expressing support for the efforts of the people of the Republic of Belarus to establish a full democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights and urging the Government of Belarus to conduct a free and fair Presidential election on March 19, 2006.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 673       Whereas the establishment of a democratic, transparent, and      fair election process for the 2006 presidential election in      the Republic of Belarus and of a genuinely democratic      political system are prerequisites for that country's      integration into the Western community of nations;       Whereas the Government of Belarus has accepted numerous      specific commitments governing the conduct of elections as a      participating State of the Organization for Security and      Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), including provisions of the      1990 Copenhagen Document;       Whereas these commitments, which encourage transparency,      balance, and impartiality in an election process, have become      the standard by which observers determine whether elections      have been conducted freely and fairly;       Whereas the election on March 19, 2006, of the next      president of Belarus will provide an unambiguous test of the      extent of the commitment of the Belarusian authorities to      implement these standards and build a democratic society      based on free elections and the rule of law;       Whereas previous elections in Belarus have not met      international standards;       Whereas the 2004 vote on the constitutional referendum in      Belarus did not meet international standards;       Whereas it is the duty of government and public authorities      at all levels to act in a manner consistent with all laws and      regulations governing election procedures and to ensure free      and fair elections throughout the entire country, including      preventing activities aimed at undermining the free exercise      of political rights;       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires a      period of political campaigning conducted in an environment      in which neither administrative action nor violence,      intimidation, or detention hinder the parties, political      associations, and the candidates from presenting their views      and qualifications to the citizenry, including organizing      supporters, conducting public meetings and events throughout      the country, and enjoying unimpeded access to television,      radio, print, and Internet media on an equal basis;       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires that      citizens be guaranteed the right and effective opportunity to      exercise their civil and political rights, including the      right to vote free from intimidation, threats of political      retribution, or other forms of coercion by national or local      authorities or others;       Whereas a genuinely free and fair election requires the      full transparency of laws and regulations governing      elections, multiparty representation on election commissions,      and unobstructed access by candidates, political parties, and      domestic and international observers to all election      procedures, including voting and vote-counting in all areas      of the country;       Whereas control and manipulation of the media by national      and local officials and     others acting at their behest could raise grave concerns      regarding the commitment of the Belarusian authorities to      free and fair elections;       Whereas efforts by national and local officials and others      acting at their behest to impose obstacles to free assembly,      free speech, and a free and fair political campaign will call      into question the fairness of the upcoming election in      Belarus; and       Whereas the arrest or intimidation of opposition political      parties and candidates, such as the leader of the Unified      Democratic Forces and other people involved with the      opposition, represents a deliberate assault on the democratic      process: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--       (1) looks forward to the development of cordial relations      between the United States and the Republic of Belarus;       (2) emphasizes that a precondition for the integration of      Belarus into the Western community of nations is its      establishment of a genuinely democratic political system;       (3) expresses its strong and continuing support for the      efforts of the Belarusian people to establish a full      democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights in      Belarus;       (4) urges the Government of Belarus to guarantee freedom of      association and assembly, including the right of candidates,      members of political parties, and others to freely assemble,      to organize and conduct public events, and to exercise these      and other rights free from intimidation or harassment by      national or local officials or others acting at their behest;       (5) urges the Government of Belarus to meet its      Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)      standards and commitments on democratic elections, including      the standards on free and fair elections as defined in the      1990 Copenhagen Document;       (6) urges the Belarusian authorities to ensure--       (A) the full transparency of election procedures before,      during, and after the 2006 presidential election;       (B) unobstructed access by election monitors from the      Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR),      other participating States of the OSCE, Belarusian political      parties, candidates' representatives, nongovernmental      organizations, and other private institutions and      organizations--both foreign and domestic--to all aspects of      the election process, including unimpeded access to public      campaign events, candidates, news media, voting, and post-     election tabulation of results and processing of election      challenges and complaints;       (C) multiparty representation on all election commissions;       (D) unimpeded access by all parties and candidates to      print, radio, television, and Internet media on a non-     discriminatory basis;       (E) freedom of candidates, members of opposition parties,      and independent media organizations from intimidation or      harassment by government officials at all levels via      selective tax audits and other regulatory and bureaucratic      procedures, and in the case of media, license revocations and      libel suits, among other measures;       (F) a transparent process for complaint and appeals through      electoral commissions and within the court system that      provides timely and effective remedies; and       (G) vigorous prosecution of any individual or organization      responsible for violations of election laws or regulations,      including the application of appropriate administrative or      criminal penalties;       (7) encourages the international community, including the      Council of Europe, the OSCE, and the OSCE Parliamentary      Assembly, to continue their efforts to support democracy in      Belarus and urges countries such as Lithuania and other      Baltic countries and Nordic countries to continue to provide      assistance to nongovernmental organizations and other      Belarusian organizations involved in promoting democracy and      fair elections in Belarus; and       (8) pledges its support to the Belarusian people, their      commitment to a fully free and open democratic system, their      creation of a prosperous free market economy, and their      country's assumption of its rightful place as a full and      equal member of the Western community of democracies.
