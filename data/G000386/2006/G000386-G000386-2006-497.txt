 President, in explaining the rationale for my motion to instruct, I will be referring to other motions to instruct that two Senators on the other side have put in place, Senator Dodd of Connecticut and Senator Reed of Rhode Island.  The Dodd motion to instruct is yet another episode in the tale of the ``groundhogization'' of this tax relief reconciliation bill, a long journey. The Senate adopted the alternative to the Dodd amendment, a Grassley amendment, that passed, including the following Budget Act waiver language:       Waive all provisions of the Budget Act and budget      resolutions necessary for the consideration of the pending      amendment to this bill, and for the inclusion of the language      of the pending amendment in consideration of an amendment      between Houses.  That is what we added back on February 2 to S. 2020. The Dodd motion instructs conferees to proceed by ignoring this waiver language. You see, the waiver language only applies for the purposes of our action in the Senate. If Senator Dodd were to prevail, the conferees could not follow his directive without violating the Budget Act. It is because the Dodd motion deals with outlays. We can't do outlays in a budget reconciliation package. I might add that the Reed motion that we expect to vote on tomorrow suffers from the same defect. The conferees, even if they were inclined, can't return from conference with a provision that contains outlays.  We all know this is a political season. If you look at this motion, and if you look at the Reed motion, both cannotbe adopted and followed. You can draw your own conclusion, then, why they are adopted, unless the Members don't know that this is a parliamentary situation. I can't believe they don't know what that parliamentary situation is.  While we are at it, I am going to offer a motion to clarify what the Dodd and Reed motions are all about. Basically, if you support the principles of providing more health care for veterans, the supposed purpose of the Dodd amendment, and, secondly, assisting our troops with body armor, the supposed purpose of the Reed amendment, then vote for the Grassley motion. If you support these two principles but don't support a tax increase on America's seniors, at a higher cost of capital for American business, support the Grassley motion. If you just want an increase, then vote for the Dodd motion.  I will summarize it this way: I appreciate Senator Dodd's attention to the issue of our veterans health care needs. This issue is of utmost importance to the Members of the Senate, as evidenced by the fact that we appropriated a massive amount of extra money last fall for the fiscal year we are in now to meet the needs of veterans, particularly those who were not recognized, people returning wounded from Iraq. But my colleagues suggest that in order to provide this support, we should give up the important economic tax policy of reduced capital gains and dividends tax, the present tax policy, just continue it for 2 more years so that people have a long-term view of what the tax policy is so that they know what they are going to invest.  The Dodd motion claims to be paid for by capital gains, but capital gains offsets don't even come into play until the year 2009. I have offered a motion that supports military health care facilities, but we don't tie it up with an offset that is 3 long years down the road.  You will remember that the Senate debated this issue on Groundhog Day and voted to accept my amendment that provides the same benefits but does not raise taxes to pay for it. I urge my colleagues to vote against Senator Dodd's motion and to support my motion to instruct the conferees on the amendment we have already passed.  In regard to what Senator Reed is trying to do with his motion to instruct, this is the issue of funding for our military. Proper funding for those serving our country is not a controversial issue. The method of providing this funding for our military is, on the other hand, being made into an unnecessarily controversial issue. My colleague suggests that in order to provide for this funding, we eliminate a tax benefit that doesn't even arise until the year 2009, similar to the same issue in the Dodd amendment. I ask how this would provide the funds so badly needed this very day to ensure that we meet the operational needs of our courageous military service personnel.  I offered an amendment that supports the operational needs of our military without tying it to an offset that is 3 long years down the road.  Again, in an effort not to sound repetitive, you will remember that the Senate debated this issue also on Groundhog Day and voted to accept my amendment that provides the same benefits but does not raise taxes to pay for them. So I urge my colleagues to vote against Senator Reed's motion and to support my motion to instruct conferees on the amendment we have already passed.  To sum up, if you are against a tax increase but for veterans health care and properly equipping our military, vote for the Grassley motion. If you are for a tax increase, then look elsewhere to our colleagues who are offering their version of it.                      Motion To Instruct Conferees
