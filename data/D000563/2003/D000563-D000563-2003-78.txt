As noted here, for Judge Breyer, twice. That is a clear example. On some of the others, there could have been more than one time, as well.  The point I would like to make to my friend from Nevada, we also know that under President Clinton, 63 of his nominees never got a hearing. They were never given a chance to come to the floor for this vote because the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee would not even give them a hearing.
