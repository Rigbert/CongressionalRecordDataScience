President, as we move to the vote, basically all the arguments made against theWyden-Sununu-Snowe-Ensign-Binga-man amendment, all of the arguments made against us were made for the WPPSS facilities which resulted in the biggest municipal bond failure in history. Back then they said it wouldn't be unduly risky. They said there wouldn't be any questions with respect to exposure to those who were financing it. Look at what happened. Four out of those five facilities did not get built.  I say to my colleagues, those who are pronuclear, those who are antinuclear, this is not about your position with respect to nuclear power pro or con. It is about whether or not you are going to be protaxpayer. The Congressional Research Service says the taxpayers are on the hook for $14 to $16 billion. The Congressional Budget Office says there is upwards of a 50-percent likelihood of default. Under this provision, the loan guarantees provide opportunities to construct nuclear facilities that no one else is getting. Other people don't get the break unless they produce something. Here you get the break even if you produce no nuclear power whatsoever and you get it directly out of the taxpayer's pocket.  It is unwise. I hope my colleagues will vote with three Democratic Senators, three Republican Senators, and an Independent for this amendment.  I yield the floor.
