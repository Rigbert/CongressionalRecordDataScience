President, I rise today to congratulate a Chicago business on its 50th anniversary.  The public relations firm GolinHarris began as a six-person operation in Chicago in 1956. Fifty years later, GolinHarris is one of the world's leading public relations firms, with a client list that reads like a Who's Who of Business. It employs more than 450 professionals in 29 offices across the globe--from Brazil to Belgrade, Stockholm to Singapore--but, I am proud to say, GolinHarris continues to call Chicago home.  One thing about GolinHarris has not changed over these 5 decades and that is the strength of its leadership. Under the guidance of Chairman Al Golin who has helped shape the firm from its beginning, GolinHarris has developed a reputation as an outstanding corporate citizen and an innovator in an intensively competitive and fast-changing field.  I would like to extend my congratulations to Al Golin and the employees of GolinHarris on this milestone 50th anniversary and wish them continued success in the years to come.                          ____________________
