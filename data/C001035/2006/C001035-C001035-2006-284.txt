I would also note that over 50 senators signed the Collins-Salazar-Alexander letter in support of $100 million in funding for LWCF-stateside in fiscal year 2007. As evidenced by this support, this program is absolutely vital to communities throughout the Nation. Almost every county in the Nation has taken advantage of this program to conserve open spaces or build playgrounds, ballparks, and trails. I sincerely hope the Senate will restore this historic level of funding through the appropriations process, in addition to those funds that will be made available under this bill.
