President, it is our intention to yield our time. However, I repeat: This is a feasibility study. It is nothing more than that. You can quote all these other people whose opinion is we should have this. It doesn't make any difference. If the feasibility study says we should go into R and production, we can do that. If the 5-year plan says they come up with that recommendation, we can do that. But, first, the feasibility study would have to be done. Then the President would have to make a request, and both Houses of Congress would have to authorize it. This is just a feasibility study. We voted on this last year. I have sent for the vote. We will have it down here to remind people how they voted. Nothing has changed.  I yield the remainder of our time and suggest the absence of a quorum.
