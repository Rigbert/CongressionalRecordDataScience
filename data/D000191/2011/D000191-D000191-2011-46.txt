That job is done. Afghanistan has been superseded now as a haven for terrorists by tribal areas in Pakistan, Yemen, and Sudan. The inter- and intratribal disputes in Afghanistan are rooted in ancient history, and 12 to 36 more months of a large U.S. troop footprint is not going to resolve centuries-old conflicts among the Afghan tribes. There never has been, there never will be, a strong central government in Afghanistan.  So I disagree with the President's plan for a snail-pace partial drawdown of U.S. troops over the next few years. We should do it much more quickly and leave only a residual force to prevent a terrorist takeover. There were only a few thousand troops there when we drove out the Taliban and when we pursued Osama bin Laden. Unfortunately, we lost an early opportunity to capture and kill him because of mistakes by then-Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.  But that being done, the President did say something last night with which I strongly agree. He said, America, it is time to focus on nation-building here at home. I couldn't agree more. I've been trying to do that for the last 2\1/2\ years but running into roadblocks down at the White House when I try and rebuild the Nation's transportation infrastructure.  Now, let's just think for a minute. We're borrowing and spending $120 billion a year in Afghanistan, both to support our troops and to engage in nation-building, building them schools, building them highways, building them bridges, while our own schools, our own highways, our own bridges are crumbling and collapsing; $120 billion borrowed and spent in Afghanistan, what could we do with that here at home?  We could begin to address the backlog of 150,000 bridges on our national highway system that need repair or replacement; the $70 billion backlog on our transit systems for basic capital maintenance, let alone new investment in new transit systems to more efficiently transport our people; to deal with the 40 percent of the pavement on the national highway system that's substandard; to deal with congestion in our major cities and our ports; to move freight and Americans more effectively.  And in addressing that with $120 billion that we're borrowing and spending in Afghanistan today and instead spending that money here at home, we could put over 3 million to work, not just construction workers. People say to me, well, Congressman, I don't work in construction. It's not just construction. We have the strongest buy-America requirement in transportation ofany part of the government. That means when you buy a transit vehicle, it's going to be made in America. That's manufacturing, that's software, that's engineering, design. It goes all across the economy. It's small business suppliers, minority suppliers under the laws. We could put millions to work and stimulate our economy if that money were spent here.  Last week, I confronted the President's deputy economic adviser, Mr. Furman, over these issues; and he did admit that instead of more tax cuts, which isn't putting anybody back to work--that's their one nostrum which seems to have been adopted by the Obama administration--hasn't worked for a decade, but if we cut them even more, that will then. It doesn't work. Investment works. We know it works. Let's invest. But the President's deputy economic adviser said we can't do that, we can't get the money to do that, but we can do a Social Security tax holiday and borrow $200 billion more and not put people back to work.  Come on. Let's follow up on what the President said last night. Let's get serious about it, and let's make the investments here. America, it is time to focus on nation-building here at home and put our people back to work and ensure prosperity for future generations.                          ____________________
