However, we are right now debating the cloture motion. While I think it is perfectly appropriate to talk about the game last night, I hate to get into another subject when we only have an hour and 20 minutes to be talking about our cloture motion.  I, first of all, ask the Senator if this is something that could be postponed until after that motion.
