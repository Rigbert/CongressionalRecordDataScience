 President, this is a sense of the Senate amendment to make room in the FY 2000 budget for remedial education funds for schools to end social promotion.  My amendment would assume enactment of legislation or competitive grants to school districts to help provide remedial education, after school and summer school courses for needy and low-performing students who are not making passing grades.  The purpose is to provide federal incentives and federal help to school districts that abolish and do not allow social promotion and provide interventions to help students meet state achievement standards in the core curriculum.  This amendment seeks the endorsement of the Senate for providing remedial education that help students meet achievement standards and help school systems end social promotion.                              The Problem  Why do we need this amendment? In short, our students are failing.  I truly believe that the linchpin to education reform is the elimination of the path of least resistance whereby students who are failing are simply promoted to the next grade in hopes that somehow they will learn, by virtue of sitting in the classroom.  To promote youngsters when they are failing to learn has produced a generation of young people who cannot read or write, count change in their pockets or fill out an employment application. It has been called ``educational malpractice.'' It is inexcusable for our education system to hand out a high school diploma to a youngster who does not have the skills to get a job.  It is that bad. And California is just about the worst.  On March 5, we received the bad news that California ranked second to last among 39 states in fourth-grade reading skills.  This report by the National Assessment of Educational Progress, also showed that in California:  Eighty percent of fourth-graders are ``not proficient readers,'' meaning they do not have a solid command of challenging reading materials.  Fifty-two percent of the fourth-graders scored below the basic level, meaning they had failed to even partially master basic skills.  The news was not must better for California eighth-graders who ranked 33rd out of 36 states and only 22 percent were proficient readers.  In a December 1998 study by the Education Trust, California ranked: last in the percent of young adults with a high school diploma; 37th in SAT scores; and 31st (of 41 states) in 8th grade math.  And nearly half of all students entering the California State University system require remedial classes in math or English or both.                     U.S. Students Lagging As Well  The news is grim throughout the United States, where students are falling behind their international peers:  The lowest 25 percent of Japanese and South Korean 8th graders outperform the average American student (source: Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development study, November 1998).  In math and science, U.S. 12th grade students fell far behind their counterparts, which is especially troubling when we consider the skills that will be required to stay ahead in the 21st Century. (Source: Third International Mathematics and Science Study, 1998).  Specifically, U.S. 12th graders:  Were significantly outperformed by 14 countries and only performed better than students in Cyprus and South Africa.  Scored last in physics and next to last in math.                       What Is Social Promotion?  Social promotion is the practice of schools' advancing a student from one grade to the next regardless of the student's academic achievement.  It is time to end social promotion, a practice which misleads our students, their parents and the public.  And apparently, the American Federation of Teachers agrees. Let me quote from their September 1997 study:       Social promotion is an insidious practice that hides school      failure and creates problems for everybody--for kids, who are      deluded into thinking they have learned the skills to be      successful or get the message that achievement doesn't count;      for teachers who must face students who know that teachers      wield no credible authority to demand hard work; for the      business community and colleges that must spend millions of      dollars on remediation, and for society that must deal with a      growing proportion of uneducated citizens, unprepared to      contribute productively to the economic and civic life of the      nation.  That is well said, from those faced with the problem everyday.           Remedial Education Needed for Student Achievement  Merely ending social promotion and holding students in grade will not solve the problem. We cannot just let them languish without direction and without help in a failing system.  Instead, ongoing remedial work, specialized tutoring, after-school programs and summer school all must be used--intensively and consistently.  That is why I am proposing a new federal infusion of funds for remedial education, as embodied in this amendment.                  How Widespread Is Social Promotion?  Social promotion is widespread. Although there is no hard data on the extent of social promotion, most authorities, in the schools and out, know it is happening--and in some districts it is standard operating procedure.   In fact, 4 in 10 teachers reported that their schools automatically promote students when they reach the maximum age for their grade level (Source: Los Angeles Times, January 14, 1998).  And the September 1998 American Federation of Teachers study says social promotion is ``rampant.''  This study involved 85 of the nation's 820 largest school districts in 32 states--representing one-third of the nation's public school enrollment. It found most school districts:  Use vague criteria for passing and retaining students.  Lack explicit policies of social promotion, but have an implicit practice of social promotion, including a loose and vague criteria for advancing students to the next grade.  View holding students back as a policy of last resort and often put explicit limits on retaining students.  Also, the study found that only 17 states have standards in the four core disciplines (English, math, social studies and science) which are well grounded in content and that are clear enough to be used.                     Social Promotion in California  In July 1998, I wrote 500 California school districts and asked about their policy on social promotion.  Their responses, which are vague and often misleading, include the following:  Some school districts say they do not have a specific policy.  Some say they simply figure what is ``in the best interest of the student.''  Some say teachers provide recommendations, but final decisions on retention can be overridden by parents.  And some simply promote regardless of failing grades, non-attendance, or virtually anything else.  In short, the policies are all over the place.                Social Promotion Is Ending in California  Last year, in California, the Legislature passed and the Governor signed into law a bill to end social promotion in public education.  This new law requires school districts to identify students who are failing based on their grades or scores on statewide performance tests.  The schools have to hold back the student unless their teachers submit a written finding that the student should be allowed to advance to the next grade.  In such a case, the teacher is required to recommend remediation to get the student to the next level, which could include summer school or after-school instruction.  In one example, the Los Angeles Unified School District is currently working to develop a plan to end social promotion.  The LAUSD Board plans to identify those students who are at risk of flunking and require them to participate in remedial classes.  The alternative curriculum will stress the basics in reading, language arts and math through special after-school tutoring. The district's plan would take effect in the 1999-2000 school year and target students moving in the third through sixth grades and into the ninth grade.                      The Cost of Social Promotion  Here are some of the painful results of social promotion:  Half of California's students--3 million children--perform below levels considered proficient for their grade level.  One third of college freshmen nationwide take remedial courses in college and three-quarters of all campuses, public and private, offer remediation.  More than two-thirds of students entering California State University campuses in Los Angeles lack the math or English they should have mastered in high school. At some high schools, not one graduate going on to one of Cal State's campuses passed a basic skills test.  And these numbers represent an increase. In the fall of 1998, almost 50 percent of freshmen needed remedial help. In 1997, it was 47 percent, compared to 43 percent in each of the previous three years.           The Public Recognizes the Flaw in Social Promotion  President Clinton called for ending social promotion in his last two State of the Union speeches. Last year, he said, ``We must also demand greater accountability. When we promote a child from grade to grade who hasn't mastered the work, we don't do that child any favors. It is time to end social promotion in America's schools.''  Seven states have a policy in place that ties promotion to state level standards. They are California, Delaware, Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina, Ohio, and Virginia.  The Chicago Public Schools have ditched social promotion. After their new policy was put in place, in the spring of 1997, over 40,000 students failed tests in the third, sixth and eight and ninth grades and then went to mandatory summer school.  In my own state, the San Diego School Board in February adopted requirements that all students in certain grades must demonstrate grade-level performance.  And they will require all students to earn a C overall grade average and a C grade in core subjects for high school graduation, effectively ending social promotion for certain grades and for high school graduation. For example, San Diego's schools are requiring that eighth graders who do not pass core courses be retained or pass core courses in summer school.                               Conclusion  A January 1998 poll by Public Agenda asked employers and college professors whether they believe a high school diploma guarantees that a student has mastered basic skills. In this poll, 63 percent of employers and 76 percent of professors said that the diploma is not a guarantee that a graduate can read, write or do basic math.  California employers tell me that many applicants are unprepared for work and they have to provide very basic training to make them employable.  High tech companies say they have to recruit abroad. For example, last year, MCI spent $7.5 million to provide basic skills training.  On December 17, 1998, the California Business for Education Excellence announced that they were organizing a major effort to reform public education.  This group includes the State's major corporations and organizations like the California Business Roundtable, the California Manufacturers Association, and the American Electronics Association, and companies like Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Boeing and Pacific Bell. They had to organize because they see firsthand the results of a lagging school system.  I offer this amendment today to get the Senate, officially, on record, to support the notion that we have to provide our students and teachers the resources they need to help students achieve.  The amendment is not meant as an indictment of our schools and the many able educators who work hard everyday.  This amendment is being offered because we must face up to these deficiencies and do the hard work that reform requires.  We can no longer tolerate doing what is ``politically correct'' or the latest teaching fad. It takes hard, proven, concentrated work by students, teachers, and families. And we have to have the ability to know the difference.  I urge my colleagues to accept this amendment, to give educators the resources they need to help students achieve and to tie federal resources to real results.
