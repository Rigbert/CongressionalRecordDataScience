Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information. Clearly, all of us know that the pay-as-you-go provision has been apparently the stumbling block in the reaching of an agreement between the two Houses. There was, as I understand it, our expectation was that there would be a freestanding bill coming to the floor on the pay-go issue. Can the leader tell us whether that is still contemplated or whether we might see that at any time in the near future?  I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's yielding. Yes, we do have a bill that was marked up in the Committee on the Budget that we are looking forward to considering inthe near future. There has been a lot of discussion about that bill. The process by which we would consider it has been widely discussed. However, I believe that the chairman of the Committee on the Budget would prefer to wait until the budget resolution conference report has been completed and passed before we consider that bill. So it is very difficult for me to give the gentleman any sort of time frame, but as soon as the budget is passed, I think we can anticipate within a matter of weeks the Budget Enforcement Act coming to the floor.
