This legislation would help expand opportunities for small businesses to bid on government contracts, thus allowing them to sell more products and services to Federal agencies. The bill would prohibit the consolidation of contract requirements in excess of $5 million absent a written determination that the benefits of consolidation substantially exceed the benefits of alternative contracting approaches that would involve a lesser degree of consolidation.  The Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997, P.L. 105-135, requires Federal agencies to conduct market research to assess the potential impact of ``bundled contracts,'' and to proceed with such contracts only if the benefits of bundling substantially exceed the benefits of proceeding with separate contracts. Unfortunately, the reality is that the Department of Defense, and other Federal agencies, have narrowly interpreted these provisions of the Small Business Reauthorization Act. The result is that too many Federal contracts are so large that they are out of reach for small businesses. Yet, small businesses could perform the work if the contract requirements were divided into separate contracts rather than consolidated.  For the past several years, the evidence that contract bundling is hurting small businesses has been growing. For example, on November 16, ``Eagle Eye'' publishing released its second study on bundling since 1997, which found that the Defense Department is the biggest culprit of bundling, accounting for 82 percent of all bundled dollars. The study report goes on to say, that large businesses are the main beneficiaries of bundling, and highlights that large firms win 74 percent of all bundled dollars and 67 percent of all prime contract dollars. With the average bundling contract worth $8 million, it is no wonder small businesses receive only 9 percent of all bundled contract dollars. Eagle Eye found that the average bundled contract was 11 times larger than the average unbundled contract.  Also, according to the Eagle Eye study, major DoD bureaus remain the largest proponents of bundling. Army's 1999 bundled total was up to 22 percent since 1992 to $15.8 billion, while Navy increased only by 2 percent, but still managed to bundle $22 billion worth of contracts. Air Force bundled $18.8 billion, but offered some good news because its total is down 24 percent since 1992.  The legislation that I am proposing would require the Department of Defense to prove the cost benefit of consolidating a contract in excess of $5 million. Now is the time to enact this modest provision to ensure that our small businesses have the opportunities that they deserve to provide goods and services for the Department of Defense.  I urge all Members of the Senate to join me in support of the Contract Consolidation Act of 2002.                                 ______                                       By
