Speaker, today I rise in tribute to a man who for 46 years has represented the very best traditions of citizenship, corporate involvement, and support for his community.  Sam Irmen began his career at a time when employers and companies were truly involved in their communities and served as a base of support and stability for their communities.  Sam began his career with the Andersons of Maumee, OH, 46 years ago, and rose to the position of vice president and group manager of the grain division. And for those 46 years, he sought to share with his community and advantages his position gave him and the resources that his company could utilize to better his community.  To Sam and his wife Charlee and their seven children, both his company and his community, Maumee, OH, were there home. Sam never stopped contributing. He served on the elementary school board, as president of the church's parish council, and as president of the school board at St. John's High School. He also served as a member and past vice president of the Maumee Chamber of Commerce.  Good men and women can contribute endlessly when their companies encourage participation. Over the course of his 46 years with the Andersons, Sam's business participation stretched throughout the business community. He is a member of the board of directors at Mid Am National Bank & Trust Co., a member and past president of the National Grain and Feed Association and past chairman of the Grain Grades and Weights Committee, a member and past international president of the Grain Elevator and Processing Society, and a member of distinction of the Grain Elevator and Processing Society.  In addition to these contributions and responsibilities, Sam has led numerous government and trade task forces, served three terms as president of the Toledo Board of Trade, and was a designated representative of agriculture on Ohio Governor Celeste's 1984 Ohio Trade Mission to the Far East.  Simply put, Sam Irmen's career and contributions to his community deeply reflect the bonds that should join every company to its community.  I would like all my distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating Sam, his wife Charlee, and their wonderful family for 46 years of service and contributions to his company and his community. My fervent hope is that his career will become a lesson for future employees and their companies. His is an example we should all emulate.                          ____________________
