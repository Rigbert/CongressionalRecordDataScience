I admire the leadership of the Senators from Virginia and Michigan. But I have to concur with what the Senator from Nevada said. If we are going into this new debate topic about security at the Laboratories, we are going to have to give it an adequate amount of time, and that will be substantial. I hope the Senator understands and will advise his side of the aisle.
