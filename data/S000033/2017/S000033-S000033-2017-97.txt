 President, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment violates section 313(b)1(A) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.  I am glad that the Senator from Nevada is concerned about Medicaid, but I would remind the Senate that yesterday the vast majority of Republicans voted to throw 15 million people off of Medicaid on their way to end health insurance for 22 million Americans.  Our job as a nation is to guarantee healthcare to every man, woman, and child and join the rest of the industrialized world, not throw disabled children off of the healthcare they currently have.  I urge a ``no'' vote.  Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment violates section 313(b)1(A) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
