Just recently they were in charge, as a matter of fact, from 2001 to 2008, when we saw the deepest recession start and flourish and continue into this next administration since the Great Depression.  So let none of us on this floor point the finger at one another. The American people want to see solutions, not angry rhetoric. The American people want to see this economy grow and create the jobs that they need. All of us ought to be committed to that objective, and we ought to project to the American people that we are prepared to come together and work together and legislate together to achieve that end.  As I said, I will vote for this resolution, but the hard work is ahead of us.
