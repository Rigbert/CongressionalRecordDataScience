 President, if we look at that, that is 91 feet with the twin 33s and the cab, 91 feet of truck. Thirty-eight States do not want that in their States. This bill overwhelms that. We had an amendment in the Appropriations Committee that would prevent that. It was a tie vote.  Senator Wicker and I ask you, please don't force States to do this before the safety work is done by the Secretary. We have 4,000 people killed every year from these trucks in all kinds of horrific accidents--and they are not as long as this one. These trucks would not only be on the freeways, but they would be in the villages, the towns, and the cities as well.  I hope you will support this motion to instruct to protect the 38 States and say: Before you do this, do the safety investigations and tell us these trucks are safe.  I yield the floor.
