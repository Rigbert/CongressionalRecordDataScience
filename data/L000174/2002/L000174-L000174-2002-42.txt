President, yesterday the Senate confirmed the 98th judicial nominee of President George W. Bush.  These past 16 months, since the reorganization of the Senate Judiciary Committee following the change in majority last year, have been an historic and impressive period in which we have fairly considered hundreds of the President's executive and judicial branch nominees. Despite partisan rhetoric to the contrary, the Senate has done a good job.  If this Senate had a ``lousy'' record on judicial confirmations, then the Republican leadership, which controlled the pace on confirmations from 1995 through the first part of 2001, must have been far, far worse than ``lousy''. Under Republican control judicial vacancies on the Courts of Appeals more than doubled, from 16 to 33, and overall vacancies rose from 65 to 110. We have heard no criticism from the White House of that period, in which Senate Republicans blocked President Clinton's nominees. We have heard no apologies from the Republican leadership that engineered those efforts.  Just last night, in one night, the Democratic-led Senate confirmed more judges, 18, including more circuit judges, than the Republican-led Senate allowed to be confirmed in the entire 1996 session more in one day than Republicans were willing to proceed on for an entire year. Seventeen of those judges were the nominations we were able to get reported from the Committee on October 8 with some significant effort and in spite of Republican efforts to divert the Committee into other matters.  This week the Committee met, again, as I had said it would. We considered the nominations of Dennis Shedd and Michael McConnell and voted on them as the 101st and 102nd judicial nominations voted on by the Committee during the last 16 months and reported them to the Senate. One hundred judicial nominations have now been reported favorably to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee during the past 16 months; two were rejected. One indication of the fairness with which we have conducted ourselves is that as chairman I have proceeded to consider nominations that I do not support and the Committee has reported nominations that I do not support to the Senate. As I said during this week's Committee consideration of the Shedd nomination, for example, having examined his record as a District Court Judge, I intend to vote against his nomination to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.  With the Senate's actions last night, we have confirmed 98 of this President's judicial nominees in only 16 months. This compares most favorably to the 38 judicial confirmations averaged per year during the six and one-half years when the Republican majority was in control of the Senate. Last night, the Senate confirmed another 18 judicial nominees. In the entire 1996 session over the course of an entire year, the Republican majority allowed only 17 district court judges to be confirmed all year and would not confirm a single circuit court nominee--not one. Last night, the Democratic-led Senate confirmed all 17 district court nominees reported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee after our October 8 business session as well as a 6th Circuit nominee from Kentucky. The Democratic-led Senate exceeded in one day what it took the Republican majority of the Senate an entire year to accomplish. That should put our historic demonstration of bipartisanship toward this President's judicial nominees in perspective.  The 17 district court nominees confirmed last night were on the Senate calendar because, on October 8, the Senate Judiciary Committee was able to report those nominations despite unparalleled personal attacks by Republicans on me as chairman. The circuit court nominee confirmed last night, Professor John Rogers, is the second of this President's judicial nominees confirmed to the Sixth Circuit this year. They are the first confirmations to the 6th Circuit since 1997, when Republicans for four years shut down consideration of President Clinton's nominees to that circuit. Three of President Clinton's nominees to that court were never allowed a hearing by the Republican majority; the Democratic majority has, in contrast, proceeded to confirm two new judges to that same circuit court.  The hard, thankless, but steady work of the Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee has reduced judicial vacancies substantially during these last 16 months. We inherited 110 vacancies and an additional 49 have arisen since July 10, 2002. Today, after 98 confirmations, district and circuit court vacancies combined number only 60--not the more than 150 vacancies that would exist had we shut down the process or the 111 vacancies that would exist if we had followed the Republican pace of confirmation during the Clinton administration. The President has failed to send nominations for almost half of the 60 current vacancies on thedistrict and circuit courts and only 11 of his remaining nominees have both home-State consent and ABA ratings. Despite false attacks on our record, the Senate has acted with bipartisanship, fairness and expedition on this President's judicial nominees, confirming 98 in just 16 months. We have reduced judicial vacancies from the 110 we inherited to fewer than the 65 vacancies the Republicans began with when they took over the Senate in 1995. Unlike the Republican majority that allowed judicial vacancies grow, we have outpaced attrition and reduced the overall level of vacancies, including the vacancies on the circuit courts.                          ____________________
