 President, that the ACLU is not always right. However, it certainly has been on the campaign finance issues, and I think they have been a lot right on constitutional questions.  This is an organization, Mr. President, we all know exists to help Americans enforce first amendment rights. And what the Senator from Minnesota is seeking to do here today is to set aside a type of American citizen and say that because you earn your income in this particular way, you do not have the constitutional rights that everybody else in America has. The ACLU said this is constitutionally impermissible. I hope that will be persuasive to my colleagues, and that is the reason I raised the point.
