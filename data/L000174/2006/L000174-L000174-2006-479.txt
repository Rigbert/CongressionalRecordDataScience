President, I understand the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania is going to speak to correct one part of the record, but both Senator Coleman and I want to make sure the record is correct and Senators know what they are voting on. Some Senators, in speaking in opposition to the Leahy-Coleman amendment, suggested that members of Hamas, the Kurdish PKK, or the Basque separatist group might obtain refugee status in the U.S. because those terrorists organizations do not specifically target the United States. That is totally incorrect. They are not allowed in with this. Hamas, the Basque separatists, the Kurdish PKK are already listed as terrorist organizations by our government. Members of the Taliban are also barred. These individuals could not obtain entry with this amendment. It was wrong to misrepresent the amendment that way. It is inflammatory to say the Leahy-Coleman amendment would aid members and supporters of designated terrorist organizations. It does not. It does not. It does not. This amendment in no way changes current law as suggested, but it would do something for those people who have been raped, tortured, or forced into helping terrorist organizations.
