 President, as you know the issue of drug use by our children is very important to me. I believe that we must do whatever we can to protect our children from the harmful effects of illegal drugs. The survey by the Partnership for a Drug-Free America recently released showed that children continue to cite their parents as a reliable source of information about the dangers of drugs. This confirms a 1996 study by the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse which showed that the extent parents shouldered responsibility for their kids resisting drugs was a key indicator of whether or not their child experimented with drugs. Not Presidents, not Federal officials, not television, but parents and others who play an integral role in a child's life make the difference.  Today, in conjunction with 13 of my fellow Senators, we are introducing the Drug Free Communities Act of 1997. This act will take funds currently being spent for less productive areas of the Federal drug control budget and route them to community coalitions with proven track records. Seeking to make the most efficient use of taxpayer dollars, Federal grants will match funding efforts from the private sector and the local community.  It will put resources in the hands of those who make a difference; of the people that our children say their opinions they respect. It puts the resources at the community level, where parents, teachers, coaches, and community leaders can use these resources to educate our children about the evils of drug use.  There are four key features to this legislation, features that make it different from existing funding opportunities. First, communities must take the initiative. In order to receive support, a community coalition must demonstrate that there is a long-term commitment to address teen-drug use by having a sustainable coalition that includes the involvement of representatives from a wide variety of community activists.  In addition, every coalition must show that it will be around for a while. Community coalitions must be in existence for at least 6 months prior to applying for funds provided for in this bill, and they are only eligible to receive support if they can match these donations dollar for dollar with non-Federal funding, up to $100,000 per coalition.  The third key feature of this legislation is an assurance that the funds for this bill will come from existing legislation. We plan on working closelywith the members of the Appropriations Committee to find appropriate off-sets within the current $16 billion Federal drug control budget.  An advisory commission, consisting of local community leaders, and State and National experts in the field of substance abuse, will oversee the implementation of the program at the Office of National Drug Control Policy. They will insure the funds are directed to communities and programs that make a difference in the lives of our children.  At other times I've talked about the statistics--how drug use is up again this year among teens, and how emergency room admissions are rising after years of decline, and other depressing statistics. But the bill we introduce today is in support of organizations that are on the front lines, making a difference in the lives of our children. I urge my fellow members to join my colleagues and me in supporting this legislation for our children.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 536       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Drug-Free Communities Act of      1997''.     SEC. 2. NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL PROGRAM.       (a) In General.--The National Narcotics Leadership Act of      1988 (21 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.) is amended--       (1) by inserting between sections 1001 and 1002 the      following:         ``CHAPTER 1--OFFICE OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY'';     and       (2) by adding at the end the following:                   ``CHAPTER 2--DRUG-FREE COMMUNITIES     ``SEC. 1021. FINDINGS.       ``Congress finds the following:       ``(1) Substance abuse among youth has more than doubled in      the 5-year period preceding 1996, with substantial increases      in the use of marijuana, inhalants, cocaine, methamphetamine,      LSD, and heroin.       ``(2) The most dramatic increases in substance abuse has      occurred among 13- and 14-year-olds.       ``(3) Casual or periodic substance abuse by youth of 1997      will contribute to hard core or chronic substance abuse by      the next generation of adults.       ``(4) Substance abuse is at the core of other problems,      such as rising violent teenage and violent gang crime,      increasing health care costs, HIV infections, teenage      pregnancy, high school dropouts, and lower economic      productivity.       ``(5) Increases in substance abuse among youth are due in      large part to an erosion of understanding by youth of the      high risks associated with substance abuse, and to the      softening of peer norms against use.       ``(6)(A) Substance abuse is a preventable behavior and a      treatable disease; and       ``(B)(i) during the 13-year period beginning with 1979,      monthly use of illegal drugs among youth 12 to 17 years of      age declined by over 70 percent; and       ``(ii) data suggests that if parents would simply talk to      their children regularly about the dangers of substance      abuse, use among youth could be expected to decline by as      much as 30 percent.       ``(7) Community anti-drug coalitions throughout the United      States are successfully developing and implementing      comprehensive, long-term strategies to reduce substance abuse      among youth on a sustained basis.       ``(8) Intergovernmental cooperation and coordination      through national, State, and local or tribal leadership and      partnerships are critical to facilitate the reduction of      substance abuse among youth in communities throughout the      United States.     ``SEC. 1022. PURPOSES.       ``The purposes of this chapter are--       ``(1) to reduce substance abuse among youth in communities      throughout the United States, and over time, to reduce      substance abuse among adults;       ``(2) to strengthen collaboration among communities, the      Federal Government, and State, local, and tribal governments;       ``(3) to enhance intergovernmental cooperation and      coordination on the issue of substance abuse among youth;       ``(4) to serve as a catalyst for increased citizen      participation and greater collaboration among all sectors and      organizations of a community that first demonstrates a long-     term commitment to reducing substance abuse among youth;       ``(5) to rechannel resources from the fiscal year 1998      Federal drug control budget to provide technical assistance,      guidance, and financial support to communities that      demonstrate a long-term commitment in reducing substance      abuse among youth;       ``(6) to disseminate to communities timely information      regarding the state-of-the-art practices and initiatives that      have proven to be effective in reducing substance abuse among      youth;       ``(7) to enhance, not supplant, local community initiatives      for reducing substance abuse among youth; and       ``(8) to encourage the creation of and support for      community anti-drug coalitions throughout the United States.     ``SEC. 1023.

Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am very proud to join the Senator from Iowa in being an original cosponsor of the drug-free communities legislation.  In the last 5 years, substance abuse by America's young people has more than doubled. Even more troubling, it is taking place at younger and younger ages.  We need to turn this around. And this is a challenge that requires the involvement of the whole community--young people, their parents, schools, businesspeople, the media, law enforcement, religious organizations, civic and fraternal groups, as well as professionals in the area of drug abuse treatment.  Community-based antidrug coalitions have proven their worth in the fight against drug abuse. I'm thinking of groups like the Madison County Prevention Assistance Coalition Team--or PACT--in Madison County, OH. PACT was established in a rural area in central Ohio in 1991, and rapidly inspired over 50 local substance abuse prevention initiatives.  What PACT did was mobilize the community. Middle school students acted as mentors and role models for third graders. Teachers in Head Start taught their students about drug abuse prevention. A local church held a father-son retreat.  A research team from Miami University found that Madison County's alcohol-related crime dropped by 50 percent. And students are reporting a decline in the use and availability of alcohol and other drugs.  The key is mobilizing the community. The bill we're introducing today will help tap into this resource--by redirecting Federal funding to community coalitions that have developed comprehensive programs to educate children about the dangers of drugs. A similar bill was introduced in the House by Representatives Portman, Hastert, Rangel, and Levin.  This bill will channel funds from the fiscal year 1998 drug control budget--in the form of matching grants--to community coalitions with proven track records. It will enhance programs that work, without allocating new funds.  I think this is exactly the type of legislation we need. It's a sensible and cost-effective approach to solving a major problem. And I will join my colleague from Iowa in working for its enactment.
