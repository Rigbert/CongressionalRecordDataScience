 Hatch, Mr. Kyl and Mr.      Sessions):  S. 950. A bill to provide for equal protection of the law and to prohibit discrimination and preferential treatment on the basis of race, color, national origin, or sex in Federal actions, and for other purposes; read the first time.                      THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1997  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am pleased today to announce the introduction of the Civil Rights Act of 1997. President Clinton has asked for a national dialog on the issue of race in America. I applaud his efforts and welcome this opportunity.  Any discussion of race must begin with the basic principle that all are created equal. In fact, the Constitution, our Nation's most cherished document, mandates that all individuals receive the equal protection of the laws.  No one in our history understood the principle of equality better than the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. Reverend King spoke eloquently about a time when people would be judged by the ``content of their character'' and not the ``color of their skin.'' He, like so many of us do today, prayed for America to become a colorblind society.  This fundamental principle of equality is the foundation for the Civil Rights Act of 1997, which declares that: the Federal Government shall not discriminate against or grant a preference to any individual or group based on race, color, national origin, or sex.  The Federal Government must lead by example. We must promote a nation where our citizens are seen as individuals and not as mere members of a group. We must declare that the immutable traits of race and sex will not be relevant in Federal contracting and employment. Simply put, the Federal Government should not decide who gets the contract or who gets the job based on race and gender.            No Winners in a World of Government Preferences  Throughout our nation's long history, we have established that certain immutable traits should be irrelevant in life. Yet, in direct defiance of this principle, the Federal Government has engineered policies and programs to award valuable Federal dollars, jobs, and contracts to individuals based on the immutable traits of race and gender. In fact, last summer, the Congressional Research Service found that the Federal Government runs approximately 160 race and gender preference programs.  These preference practices and programs serve to divide, rather than unite. There are no winners in a world of government-sponsored set-asides and quotas.  First, Government preferences harm the very ones it seeks to help. Minorities who receive affirmative action preferences are often stigmatized and stereotyped. And, the stigma doesn't stop with those who receive the preferences. The cloud also unfairly hovers over the heads of all the other minorities whose accomplishments are not based on their race or gender, but purely on merit. All of this serves to reinforce group stereotypes at a time when we so desperately need to move beyond division.  Second, every time the Government grants a preference to one person based on race or gender, it discriminates against another based on race and gender. Discrimination by any other name is still discrimination. And, it still strikes at the very heart and soul of the person being discriminated against.  Let me put a face on this discrimination, as reported recently in the Wall Street Journal:       Michelle Doe is a 16-year-old girl and a straight-A student      from a humble background in Corpus Christi, TX. She decided      that she wanted to go to summer camp. The camp was called      Camp Planet Earth, and was funded by the Federal Government's      National Science Foundation.       Michelle applied and became a finalist. Her hopes were      dashed, however, during the interview stage where it became      clear that she wasn't eligible for the camp. Why wasn't she      eligible? Was it her grades? No, she was a straight-A      student. Was it her application form? Did she forget to      answer a question on her application? No.       Michelle was denied the opportunity to go summer camp      because of her race. You see, ``the program was for      `minorities' only,'' and Michelle was not a minority.  In the words of the Wall Street Journal, ``[w]hen Michelle went looking for some productive way to spend her summer, she soon discovered that the government divides people according to skin color.''  Third, race and gender preferences create a downward spiral of division and animosity in our national melting pot. Government preferences put individuals into little group boxes and then pit them against each other. African-Americans against Hispanic-Americans against Asian-Americans against Caucasian-Americans.  Some have even gone so far to calculate the amount of money that one race owes to another. For example--and I promise that I'm not making this up--Richard America, a lecturer at theGeorgetown University School of Business, has written a book that he calls, ``Paying the Social Debt: What White America Owes Black America.'' According to the Washington Post, Mr. America has estimated that ``White America Owes Black America'' five to ten trillion dollars.  With all due respect to Mr. America, I cannot imagine a mentality that is more un-American. Our Nation cannot survive and thrive with this type of ledger sheet mentality. Justice Scalia summed up this point very poignantly in Adarand, and I quote:       Individuals who have been wronged by unlawful racial      discrimination should be made whole; but under our      Constitution there can be no such thing as either a creditor      or debtor race. * * * In the eyes of the government, we are      just one race here. It is American. Courts and the American People Understand the Danger and Divisiveness                          of Racial Preferences  The courts and the American people understand the danger and divisiveness of racial preferences.  First and foremost, the Supreme Court has ruled that racial preferences deserve the most exacting and strict scrutiny. In the landmark case of Adarand, the Court ruled that racial preferences will be allowed to stand only where they meet a compelling government interest that is narrowly tailored to redress specific past discrimination.  Just this month, the district court in Adarand ruled that the Federal highway construction program at issue in that case did not meet the Supreme Court's strict scrutiny standard and, thus, violated of the equal protection clause.  Second, lower courts, including the third, fourth, and fifth circuits, have recently struck down affirmative action programs. Additionally, a panel of the ninth circuit has upheld the decision of the California voters to ban preferences in California State government.  Last, and most importantly, the American people understand that preferences forever defer the dream of a colorblind society. Public opinion polls show that large majorities of Americans oppose racial preferences, including a large percentage of minorities. For example, a recent Washington Post-ABC News survey showed that not even a majority of African-Americans favor preferences.  A recent Zogby poll asked Americans about their view of this legislation. The question asked ``Would you support a federal law to ban discrimination and preferential treatment in the government?'' An overwhelming 83 percent of Americans stated that they would support such a law, including 79 percent of African-Americans.  The American people and the courts understand this issue and I am hopeful that the Congress and the President will understand this issue as well as they do.                               conclusion  The President said over the weekend that he wants to ``break down the barriers in our lives, our minds, and our hearts.'' The President must realize that the Federal Government has to take the lead in removing these barriers. He must realize what the American people know--that is--race and gender preferences serve only to raise barriers and to widen the breach.  I firmly believe that, in a matter of years, we will look back upon our Government's current race and gender preferences and shake our heads and wonder how we could have ever allowed such discriminatory and divisive practices to occur for so long. The Civil Rights Act of 1997 is the next step in our Nation's struggle to overcome discrimination and to achieve unity as a nation of individual Americans, not groups.  We must provide genuine opportunities to all disadvantaged individuals, regardless of race or gender. These opportunities can become a reality through a comprehensive empowerment strategy that includes: strict enforcement of the laws against discrimination, court-ordered remedial action for victims of specific acts of discrimination, and targeted outreach and recruiting efforts to encourage all qualified minorities to apply for Federal employment and contracts. We must also: improve our education system through competition and school choice, provide economic opportunities through reduced regulatory and tax burdens, move more and more persons from the welfare roll to the payroll, and finally, make the streets safer for every American child.  I would like to close today by quoting Ward Connerly, who so valiantly led the fight in California to end discrimatory preferences. In his recent letter to the President, Mr. Connerly wrote:       For the American experiment with democracy to succeed and      for every American to have an equal chance to compete to      fulfill our dreams, it will be necessary for the factory      worker, the bus driver, the police officer, the fire      official, the secretary, and all other Americans to embrace      the principle of equality and to believe fervently in the      proposition that ``race has no place in American life or      law.''  I also want to say a special word of gratitude to Senators Hatch, Kyl, and Sessions for their co-sponsorship of this civil rights legislation. Their leadership and integrity will be invaluable in our fight for all Americans to be treated as equal in the eyes of the law.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a summary of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 950       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

SEC. 9. DEFINITIONS.       In this Act, the following definitions apply:       (1) Federal government.--The term ``Federal Government''      means executive and legislative branches of the Government of      the United States.       (2) Preference.--The term ``preference'' means an advantage      of any kind, and includes a quota, set-aside, numerical goal,      timetable, or other numerical objective.       (3) Historically black college or university.--The term      ``historically Black college or university'' means a part B      institution, as defined in section 322(2) of the Higher      Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1061(2)).                 The Civil Rights Act of 1997--Summary       The Civil Rights Act of 1997 is designed to bring the      Federal Government into compliance with the Equal Protection      Clause of the United States Constitution, and to ensure that      the federal government treats all people equally, without      regard to their race or sex.       The bill contains two main operative provisions:       (1). Prohibits the Federal Government from discriminating      against, or granting preferences to, individuals based in      whole or in part on race, color, national origin, or sex, in      connection with federal contracts, employment, or other      programs or activities.       (2). Prohibits the Federal Government from requiring or      encouraging federal contractors, subcontractors, licensees,      or recipients of federal assistance, to discriminate, or      grant preferences to individuals on the basis of their race,      color, national origin, or sex.       The Act defines ``preference'' as ``an advantage of any      kind'' including quotas, set-asides, goals, timetables, and      other numerical objectives.       The bill expressly protects the Federal Government's      ability to engage in outreach, recruiting, and marketing      efforts--the original form of affirmative action.       The bill maintains the full range of judicial remedies      currently available to proven individual victims of race or      sex discrimination.       The bill contains exemptions for historically Black      colleges and universities, Indian tribes, and for sex-based      bona fide occupational qualifications that are already exempt      under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or applied in      the Armed Forces.       The Act requires the heads of each department or agency to      modify all existing policies and regulations to comply with      the Act and report to the Senate and House Judiciary      Committees the results of the modification.       The Act is limited to Federal Government actions and would      not affect voluntary programs adopted by State and local      governments, or private sector entities.
