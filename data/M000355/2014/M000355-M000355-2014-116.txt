  The Senate sends its sincere condolences to the family of Senator Baker. In particular, we want to pass along our deep sympathies to his wife Nancy Landon Kassebaum Baker. Many of us served alongside Nancy in the Senate, and we know this must be a difficult moment for her.  Senator Baker was a true pathbreaker. He served as Tennessee's first popularly elected Republican Senator since Reconstruction. He served as America's first Republican majority leader since the time of Eisenhower. He served his Nation with distinction as a member of the U.S. Navy, as Chief of Staff to President Reagan, and as our country's Ambassador to Japan.  Senator Baker truly earned his nickname, the ``Great Conciliator.'' I know he will be remembered with fondness by Members of both political parties.  Again, let me express the Senate's sympathies to the Baker family. He will be missed by the Senate and by his country.
