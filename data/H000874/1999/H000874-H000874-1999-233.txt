Obey) for yielding me the time, and I rise in support, very strong support of this motion to instruct. I am not surprised that the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young) is not objecting to this motion, and I congratulate the chairman on his leadership.  I want to associate myself with the remarks both that the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) made earlier and that the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi) has just made.  With respect to offsets and with respect to the necessity to move the supplemental as quickly as possible bothfor our farmers and for those victims of Mitch, we have, as the gentlewoman indicated, and the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young) may have referenced as well, some 800,000-plus people.  We see the pictures of refugees in Albania and in Macedonia being created by the violence and, from my perspective, war crimes being committed by the Milosevic army. But having said that, we also know that there are other reasons to support this motion to instruct.                              {time}  1045  I want to specifically refer to the Y2K emergency fund that was put in, the supplemental that we proposed last year, or the omnibus bill we appropriated last year, some $2.25 billion for nondefense agencies to make sure their critical computer systems are Year 2000 compliant. The motion that the Senate adopted would cut that by 44 percent. Quite obviously, that would have a devastating effect on all the other programs, but as well on the Y2K, which all of us, all of us, admit is an emergency.  There is not a day that goes by that we do not hear on our televisions or our radio or read in our newspapers about the issue of Y2K. Are we, on December 31 of 1999, going to have our computer systems, which are involved in almost everything we rely on on a daily basis, going to recognize the change and be able to ensure that the systems remain operative as they should? Obviously most critical, I suppose, with the FAA airplanes flying, but to so many other systems, large and small.  On the Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government of the Committee on Appropriations, we tried in a bipartisan manner to enact the critical appropriation as an emergency fiscal year 1998 supplemental. But we were continually told by the leadership to wait until the end of the year. Unfortunately, now the Senate has waited until well into the fiscal year and are proposing a 44 percent cut.  Madam Speaker, I am hopeful that not only will this motion to instruct prevail, which I presume it is going to, but also that the Senate, in conference, will see the wisdom of this motion to instruct and will not only reconsider this amendment to cut by 44 percent those supplemental funds but will, in addition, also see the necessity, the emergency of reconsidering their requirement for offsets. And that on those matters that are truly emergency, which we believe the supplemental is, we will move ahead without political rancor, without debate about offsets, to see that our farmers, those ravaged by an act of God such as Mitch, and those as well ravaged by war and by genocide will all be given the help of this Nation and of our people as quickly as possible.
