Reauthorization of these effective and efficient councils will allow them to continue their important work of strengthening rural communities in Vermont and across the country.  This reauthorization would recognize the State councils' on-the-ground leadership in rural communities, and allow them to continue their vital work. I would note that this amendment does not cost a single farm bill dollar; it would merely maintain the States' statutory authority to establish these State-run rural development councils.  I urge all Senators to support this amendment.
