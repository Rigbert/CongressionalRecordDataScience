Pearl Marcus Richter of Toledo, Ohio, on the occasion of her forthcoming 90th birthday. Pearl will be celebrating this milestone event with family members, including two grandchildren, who will be gathering this weekend in the Washington, DC area where Pearl's daughter and son have each settled.  Pearl was born on April 6, 1917, in Indianapolis, Indiana, to immigrant parents (like so many other fine Americans) on that momentous day in history during which Congress declared war against Germany and the United States entered the conflict in Europe that became World War I. Her mother was ill during most of her childhood and Pearl was always a great help in the home. Pearl graduated from Shortridge High School in Indianapolis in 1934 at the age of 17. By then, her mother had passed away, leaving Pearl to be the female head of a household that included her father and one older and one younger brother. In 1940, life changed dramatically for Pearl. She met Morris A. Richter in February, it was love at first sight, and in May they married and moved to Terre Haute, Indiana, where Morris worked.  For nearly 15 months, December 1944-February 1946, Pearl was at home alone to care for a daughter, born in 1940, and a son, born in 1944, while Morris served in the American Area Campaign of the U.S. Navy. Both children share the same birthday, July 18, and Pearl always jokes that it was because her husband was an accountant. In the summer of 1958, the Richter family moved to Toledo, Ohio, where Morris had taken a job with the federal government, and into a house on Cheltenham Road in the Old Orchard district. Daughter Ceceile Kay graduated from the University of Toledo in 1963 and son Sheldon Jay graduated from Ohio State University in 1967. Pearl was at both graduations but unfortunately Morris was not; he had died of a heart attack in October 1961, just weeks after his 46th birthday. Pearl went to work soon afterwards as a sales clerk with Petrie Stores and had worked her way up to assistant manager before she retired.  Pearl has always been active in her synagogues and taught Sunday School in both Terre Haute and Toledo. In Toledo, she is a member of B'nai Israel Synagogue and its Sisterhood and its Synagogue Organized Afternoon Program. She is also an active member and was an officer for several years in the Friendship Club, one of many activities she enjoys through the Jewish Family Services Senior Adult Center. Pearl lived in Kenwood Gardens for over 35 years and since late 2001 has enjoyed living at Carriage House East where she is regular caller at monthly bingo and a semi-regular in an informal poker club in which she is one of the youngest members. Pearl's favorite activity besides working crossword puzzles is mah jongg, and she plays as frequently as she can. She is a member of the National Mah Jongg League, having joined soon after its inception in 1937, and she is always the first in her groups to learn the rules changes each year.  Even more so than any of the above, her family and friends know Pearl as a favorite baker. Pearl used to bake almost every day and most of this she would give away. Now she has cut her baking back to a few times a month. A visitor to her home is always served a cup of steaming hot coffee or, perhaps, fresh-squeezed lemonade or limeade, and a baked dessert. If something fresh is not on the counter, her visitors need not worry. There are always tins of baked goods in her freezer. Her family has been wishing for some time that Pearl would move to the Washington, DC area where one of the pleasures, besides her company, will be the ritual of opening her freezer to see what baked goods are inside. Pearl has always been generous about sharing her recipes. Family members and close friend Bea Goldman have now sent copies of these recipes to Pearl's daughter, who will be combining them with recipes in her collection and from her memory into a recipe book to be provided to guests after the dinner in honor of Pearl's birthday.  I join with Pearl's family and friends in wishing her a most joyous birthday, spent looking back in fond recollection and looking forward to future years. Congratulations and best wishes!                          ____________________
