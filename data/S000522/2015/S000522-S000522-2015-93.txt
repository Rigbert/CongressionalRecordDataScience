Thank you very much, Mr. Huizenga. I want to thank you, Bill, for your leadership on pro-life issues in general, but especially for your legislation that deals with the detainees issue because that could quickly emerge as a trouble spot if we are paying for abortions of people who make it across the border. That would be unconscionable to think that we would be enabling the killing of those precious children, so thank you.  I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Latta).
