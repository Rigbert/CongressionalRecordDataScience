Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New York (Chairman Gilman) for his comments. Although not a member of the committee, he is ever faithful on veterans' legislation, always here, and we thank him for his contribution.                             General Leave
