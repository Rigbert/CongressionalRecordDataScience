 President, this bill has three simple provisions. First of all, it bans soft money. Second, it raises hard money contributions to candidates from $1,000 to $3,000. Third, it requires the disclosure of those parties who pay for the so-called issue ads, who contribute to the soft money which at present is undisclosed. So it would require disclosure of any expenditure of $10,000 or more of an independent campaign within 48 hours, and it would require disclosure of any individual who contributes more than $3,000 to an independent campaign. That is all this bill would do.  I think, any way you look at it, looking at campaign spending reform, one has to look at the unregulated nature of soft money and the appearance--and I use the word ``appearance''--of corruption that it brings to campaigns.  Clearly, when in the same session of Congress you have tobacco legislation in front of this body and you have a tobacco company that contributes $1 million in soft money at the same time, you can draw a conclusion--perhaps falsely, but nonetheless draw it--that that money is contributed in large amounts with hopes of gaining votes in support of the company.  I think the numbers, the size of soft money contributions, really, are what ought to concern this body. The Republican Party raised $131 million in soft money during the 1998 election cycle. That is a 150-percent increase over the last midterm election, in 1994. So from 1994 to 1998, 4 years, there has been a 150-percent increase in the amount of soft money. The Democratic Party raised $91.5 million during this same period. That is an 86-percent increase over 4 years.  At this rate, you can see the amount of soft money is going to, by far, dominate anything individual candidates can raise or do during an election.  A recent analysis found that national political party committees together raised $107 million just during 1999 alone. That is 81 percent more than the $59 million they raised during the last comparable Presidential election period in 1995. Congressional campaign committees of the national parties raised more than three times as much soft money during 1999 as they raised during 1995--$62 million compared to $19 million.  We clearly have a trendline going. I think the decision one has to make is, is this trendline going to be healthy for the American political process? Those who think it is will be for soft money. But I think most of us believe, truly, that it is not.  The problem comes because the contribution limit is so low for an individual candidate. My bill says eliminate soft money, and the tradeoff is to increase the hard money contribution for every individual candidate from $1,000 to $3,000.  We heard that the 1971 contribution limit of $1,000 today in real dollars is worth about $328. The limit was set 29 years ago and clearly needs to be raised because the costs of campaign materials, consultant services, television, radio, all of the necessary tools of any viable campaign have clearly increased. So what was worth $1,000 in 1971 is now worth $328. This would clearly be equalized to have a meaningful parity with 1971 if the sum were raised to $3,000.  What my bill will do is move campaign contributions from under the table to above the table. Instead of hundreds of thousands of unregulated dollars flowing into the coffers of national political parties, this legislation will increase the amount an individual might contribute to a candidate under the existing rules of the Federal Election Campaign Act. So what we would be doing is exchanging soft money for increased limits, soft money being undisclosed and unregulated and hard money being both disclosed and regulated.  It is not the small contributions to an individual's campaign, I think, that Americans view as corrupting.  It is the large checks of $100,000, $250,000, and $1 million, or more, to parties that creates this appearance. My bill would eliminate this soft money while still allowing candidates to compete without the influence of the national parties and these huge amounts of money.  The final component of the bill is the greater regulation of so-called issues advocacy. A current campaign law loophole allows unions, corporations, and wealthy individuals to influence elections without being subject to disclosure or expenditure restrictions.  Issue advocacy does not use the so-called ``magic words'', such as ``vote for,'' ``elect,'' ``defeat'' or ``reelect'' that the Supreme Court has identified as express advocacy and, therefore, are not subject to FEC regulation.  This bill would define ``electioneering communications'' as an advertisement broadcast from television or radio that refers to a candidate for Federal office and is made 60 days before a general election or 30 days before a primary.  Any individual or organization that spends more than $10,000 on such an ad must disclose the expenditure to the FEC within 48 hours. In addition, all contributions greater than $3,000 to groups that engage in electioneering communications must be disclosed to the FEC within 48 hours.  This takes that anonymous area of independent campaigns and clarifies express advocacy and regulates and discloses all of the money.  The Annenberg Public Policy Center has studied the amount that independent groups have spent on issue advocacy in each of the last two election cycles: 1995-96 and 1997-98. The study estimates that the amount spent on issue ads more than doubled, to some $340 million.  The Center's report indicates that as election day gets closer, issue ads become more candidate-oriented and more negative. This kind of unregulated attack advertisements are poisoning the process and driving voters, I believe, away from the polls.  With the passing of every election, it becomes increasingly clear that our campaign system desperately needs reform. I think this reform measure has a very real chance of being passed.  Once again, let me say, it bans soft money; it increases hard money contribution limits to candidates from $1,000 to $3,000; it ties them to inflation after 2001; it says simply that anyone engaging in independent campaigns must, in effect, disclose, within 48 hours, contributions greater than $3,000 or expenditures of more than $10,000.  I strongly believe that congressional action on meaningful campaign finance reform is a very necessary first step in restoring the public's confidence in our government. I hope that my colleagues will see this as an attempt to reach across the partisan gap, and join me in supporting this bill.                                 ______                                       By
