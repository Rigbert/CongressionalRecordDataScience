President, I am delighted that the Senate confirmed Bruce C. Kauffman to be a U.S. district judge for the eastern district of Pennsylvania. Mr. Kauffman is a well-qualified nominee.  The nominee has decades of legal experience in the private practice of law at the firm of Dilworth, Paxson, Kalish & Kauffman in Philadelphia. He has also served the public interest as a justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the Commonwealth's highest appellate court, and as a member of numerous task forces and commissions benefiting the city of Philadelphia. The American Bar Association has found him to be well-qualified for this appointment.  We first received Mr. Kauffman's nomination on July 31, 1997. He had a confirmation hearing on September 5. He was unanimously reported by the committee on November 6. With the strong support of Senator Specter, this nomination has moved expeditiously through the committee and the Senate.  I congratulate Mr. Kauffman and his family and look forward to his service on the district court.                          ____________________
