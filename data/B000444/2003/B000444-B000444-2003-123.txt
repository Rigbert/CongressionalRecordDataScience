 President, I rise very briefly to state the obvious and what everyone else has stated. The Prime Minister made a remarkable speech today. We should listen to our friends. I took away much of what others did as well, but I took away one very important message we heard from a friend; that is, don't give up on Europe, that France and Germany are our friends.  By reference, Mr. Kagan and those who believe Europe is an anachronism and is an ``Old Europe'' are dead wrong, and that if Europe and the United States stand together, the world will stand with us. If Europe and the United States are divided, the world will be divided. It is that basic.  I hope everyone listened to not only the rhetoric but to the substance of his message. The substance of his message: The neo-conservative notion that Europe is no longer an asset, that Europe no longer shares our values, will be the very thing that will undo this great country of ours. We are united. We are together. We have to work on it. And if we stand together, the world will stand with us.  For that, I thank the Prime Minister for delivering his message and reminding us, his friends, of how valuable that alliance is. There is none more valuable.
