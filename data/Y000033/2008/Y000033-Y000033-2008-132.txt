Madam Speaker, on June 25, 2008, the Committee on Natural Resources adopted a resolution directing the Secretary of the Interior to make an emergency withdrawal of more than one million acres of land in Arizona from the operation of the mining laws, jeopardizing significant reserves of critical high-grade sources of uranium for clean-burning nuclear power plants. The Committee passed this resolution without a quorum present in violation of House and Committee rules, as documented by the 20-2 roll call vote on the motion to adopt. In addition, the Republicans had vacated the markup in protest of what is an unconstitutional measure, and so this vote reflects only those of Democratic members. The resolution therefore clearly does not reflect the views of the Committee on Natural Resources.  The majority marked up the resolution even though the use of this authority under section 204(e) of the Federal Land Policy Management Act is clearly unconstitutional. This view is supported by an informal opinion of the Justice Department issued in 1983 as well as a recent analysis by the Congressional Research Service. I reproduce the Justice Memorandum below and have appended the conclusion of the CRS American Law Division.  There is no emergency. If there was, the Secretary of the Interior would use his own power to make an emergency withdrawal. The reality is that the majority could not pass actual legislation locking up these millions of acres of public lands from resource development--in an area where there are already many mining claims.  This resolution is a toothless act of political theater. I hope that Interior Secretary Kempthorne gives it all the deference it deserves--none.     Subject: Legislative Veto Provision Contained in Sec. 204(e)          of FLPMA.     Date: September 12, 1983.       From: Name: Ralph W. Tarr, Office Symbol: OLC.       Statement: This memorandum memorializes the oral advice I      recently conveyed to the Solicitor's Office of the Interior      Department concerning conclusions we reached as to the      legislative veto provision contained in Sec. 204(e) of the      Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), 43      U.S.C. Sec. 1714(e). That section provides in pertinent part      that the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs of either      House of Congress (subsequently designated as the Committee      on Energy and Natural Resources in the Senate) may notify the      Secretary of the Interior (``Secretary'') that an emergency      situation exists and direct the Secretary to withdraw certain      public lands from disposition under laws pertaining to      mineral leasing.       Previous litigation under this provision followed a      Resolution of May 21, 1981, by the House Committee, directed      to the Secretary, for the withdrawal of certain lands in the      Bob Marshall, Great Bear, and Scapegoat Wilderness Areas.      This Office determined, and the Department subsequently took      the position in that litigation, that Sec. 204(e) was      unconstitutional insofar as it authorized a Committee of      either House to direct the Secretary to take an action which      would change the status of public lands. It was our view that      the provision, as legislative action, violated the      Bicameralism and Presentment Clauses, Art. I, Sec. 1, and      Art. I, Sec. 7, cl. 2 and 3, and, as executive action,      violated principles of separation of powers and the      Incompatibility Clause, Art. I, Sec. 6. See generally      Memorandum in Support of Federal Defendants' Cross-Motion to      Dismiss and/or for Summary Judgment and in Response to      Memorandum in Support of Plaintiffs' Motions for Summary      Judgment in Pacific Legal Foundation v. Watt, Civil No. 81-     141BLG, and Mountain States Legal Foundation v. Watt, Civil      No. 81-168-BLG (D. Mont.)       The Department's Memorandum submitted to the court at that      time also concluded that the portion of Sec. 204( e), which      provided for the committee veto was severable from the      Secretary's leasing authority, which is contained in entirely      different and earlier statutes, and from the Secretary's      authority under Sec. 204(e) to withdraw lands on his own      initiative. Section 707 of FLPMA, 43 U.S.C. Sec. 1701 note,      provides that if any provision or its application of the Act      is held invalid, the remainder of the Act and its application      shall not be affected. See, e.g., Champlin Refining Co. v.      Corporation Commission of Oklahoma, 286 U.S. 210 (1932),      quoted with approval in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 108-109      (1976).       In the court decision which resulted, the district court      upheld Sec. 204(e) against the separation of powers      challenge, on the ground     that the scope and duration of a withdrawal order under      Sec. 204(e) were within the Secretary's discretion, subject      to judicial review. The court did not view Sec. 204(e) as a      veto provision and thus did not address the bicameralism and      presentment issues. The court added, however, that if the      section were interpreted to permit a congressional committee,      by majority vote, to direct the Secretary to withdraw      wilderness areas until the date specified in the Resolution,      the committee action would be, in effect, an attempt to amend      the Wilderness Act of 1964, and would be unconstitutional      under the Ninth Circuit's decision in Chadha v. INS, 634 F.2d      408 (9th Cir. 1980). See Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF) v.      Watt, 529 F. Supp. 982 (D. Mont. 1982), on reconsideration,      539 F. Supp. 1194 (D. Mont. 1982) (final order of Aug. 31,      1982, unpublished).       The constitutionality of the legislative veto device has      since been firmly and finally decided. INS v. Chadha, 51      U.S.L.W. 4907 (June 23, 1983); Consumer Energy Council v.      FERC, 673 F.2d 425 (D.C. Cir. 1982), aff'd, 51 U.S.L.W. 3935      (June 29, 1983), Consumers Union v. FTC, 691 F.2d 575 (D.C.      Cir. 1982), aff'd, 51 U.S.L.W. 3935 (June 29, 1983). There      remains no doubt that the power to direct withdrawal of lands      granted to a single Congressional Committee by Sec. 204(e)      is, by its terms, a legislative veto and is unconstitutional      under Chadha.       At the request of Interior, this Office examined      Sec. 204(e) and the relevant case law in conjunction with a      Resolution of August 3, 1983, by the House Committee on      Interior and Insular Affairs, which purported to direct the      Secretary to withdraw lands in the Fort Union Coal Region of      Montana and North Dakota. We determined and advised Interior      that the Resolution passed pursuant to Sec. 204(e) purporting      to direct withdrawal was unconstitutional as a legislative      veto and was not salvageable under the construction of the      court in PLF v. Watt. We further determined and advised that      constitutional failure of the veto provision has no effect on      the substantive authority granted to the Secretary of      Interior by the statutes.                                  ____       Congressional Research Service, Memorandum, June 20, 2008.       SUBJECT: Constitutional Issues with Sec. 204(e) of the      Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, as amended.       . . . For there to be a legal obligation to withdraw land      imposed on the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to      Sec. 204(e), the [INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983)]      decision requires that actions of Congress comply with both      the bicameralism and presentment clauses of the Constitution.      The single committee resolution contemplated by Sec. 204(e)      does not satisfy these requirements and, therefore, cannot be      said to impose any legal obligation on the Secretary to      withdraw land. Accordingly, should such a resolution be      adopted it appears likely that the Secretary would be well      within his authority to interpret it as informational and/or      advisory in nature and, thus, will be able to avoid taking      the actions contemplated under the statute. Should Congress      wish to impose a binding legal obligation on the Secretary it      could opt either to pass a joint resolution or a bill, both      of which satisfy the bicameralism and presentment      requirements of Article I, as they would need to be presented      to the President for his signature or veto (and in the case      of a veto be overridden) to have the necessary effect of      mandating that the Secretary withdraw land.                          ____________________
