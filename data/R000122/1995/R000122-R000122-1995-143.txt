Chairman, throughout the debate on welfare reform, I have stated that real welfare reform must meet three important tests: Does the proposed plan promote work? Does it provide States with adequate resources? Does it protect children? Although the bill offered by Representative Deal as a Democratic substitute is not perfect, I believe that it meets these three tests.  Individual responsibility is at the heart of this bill. On the first day an individual applies for welfare benefits, that individual will be required to sign a comprehensive individualized responsibility plan detailing what the individual is expected to do to find a job and what the State is expected to do to assist them in achieving this goal. If an individual refuses to sign such a plan, that individual will not be eligible for AFDC benefits. In contrast, the Republican bill does not require that an individual actively look for a job for 2 years. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office [CBO] has stated in its analysis of the Republican bill that all 50 States will fail to meet the job requirements of the bill.  In addition, whereas the Republican bill simply requires States to move a growing percentage of their welfare caseload off of the welfare rolls, the Democratic bill requires States to move a growing percentage of their welfare caseload off of the welfare rolls and into jobs.  The substitute also removes traditional barriers to employment by recognizing the reality of our changing work force. If welfare reform is successful and truly about work, the demand for child care will increase as individuals move from welfare to work. The substitute guarantees that child care assistance will be provided to any parent on AFDC who needs child care assistance to accept and keep a job or participate in a work program. In recognition of this accepted increase in demand, the substitute increases child care assistance for the working poor by $424 million over 5 years above current projections. Under our current system, States are often forced to choose between providing child care assistance to individuals on welfare and the working poor.  The Deal bill recognizes that real welfare reform is not cheap, and it provides States with the resources needed to move recipients from welfare to work. The bill provides $9 billion to assist States in establishing programs to move people into the work force.  The Democratic substitute also maintains the current structure of successful child nutrition programs. In contrast, the Contract With [[Page E695]] America proposal would have consolidated dozens of programs into block grants and handed over responsibility, without the necessary resources, to the states. As one of my colleagues recently stated, ``their bill is about who gets the problem, not how to fix the problem''.  The Deal bill does not make children suffer for the shortcomings, real or imagined, of their parents. The bill does not require that States deny benefits to teen mothers or their children, but the bill does require, however, that teen mothers live with a responsible adult and that the teen mother stay in school.  The Deal bill also retains the guarantee that abused and neglected children will receive foster care and adoption assistance.  There has been a lot of talk about the abuses in the Supplemental Security Income Program [SSI]. The Deal bill attempts to get at the abuses in the program without harming the medically disabled children the program was established to assist. And perhaps most importantly, the bill retains the decisionmaking power on how to care for a disabled child with the family, not with a State bureaucrat. In contrast, the Republican bill would deny cash benefits to 700,000 disabled children in the SSI Program.  This is welfare reform that is tough, but fair. It promotes work, provides States with the resources to design effective programs, and provides protection for our children. At the heart of the Democratic welfare reform bill is work--at the heart of the Republican welfare reform bill is shifting responsibility, not resources to States. The Democratic bill represents real welfare reform that does not take from our children to pay for tax cuts for the rich.                          ____________________
