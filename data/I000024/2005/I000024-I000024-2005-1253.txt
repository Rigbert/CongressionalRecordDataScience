President, I also rise today to extend my congratulations to the Oklahoma State University's wrestling team for winning the 2005 National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division I Wrestling Championship on March 19, 2005, at St. Louis, MO.  The Cowboys' historic victory this year contributes to an already exceptional legacy of achievement that makes the OSU wrestling program a touchstone for all others. In fact, the Collegiate Wrestling Hall of Fame is at OSU.  The 2005 Championship title is the 33rd overall title in the storied history of wrestling at OSU, and also represents the most possessed by any school in the history of Division I wrestling. Moreover, this year's win marks the Cowboys' third consecutive championship under the dynasty of Coach John Smith, an accomplishment that had not occurred at OSU since the 1954 to 1956 seasons.  Indeed, the Cowboys' dominance was in full display not only during the season in which they went undefeated but also in the finals where they continued to remain perfect. The Cowboys swept all five of its matches and clinched the national championship, getting titles from Steve Mocco, Zack Esposito, Johny Hendricks, Chris Pendleton, and Jake Rosholt and tying the record of five championships set by Iowa in 1997. In all, OSU finished with an all-time high of 153 points and far surpassed second-place Michigan by 70 points, which was the second highest winning margin in NCAA wrestling history.  Much credit for this amazing achievement undoubtedly goes to coach John Smith, who was named Big 12 Wrestling Coach of the Year for the sixth time in his career. Finally I would be remiss, if I did not recognize the extraordinary effort, commitment, and grit of these student athletes. They are a tremendous source of pride for their university and community, and I offer them my sincere congratulations for all that they have achieved.
