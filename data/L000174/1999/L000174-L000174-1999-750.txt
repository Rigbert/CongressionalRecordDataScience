President, the sweeping terms of the bill before us are not justified. Senator McCain's substitute, like the underlying bill, unfortunately, remains a wish list for special interests that are or might become involved in Y2K litigation. The broad liability limitations in the legislation risk rewarding irresponsible parties at the expense of the responsible and the innocent. That is not fair or responsible.  I cannot support such one-sided legislation that restricts the rights of American consumers, small business owners and family farmers who seek redress for harms caused by Year 2000 computer problems.  I remain open to continuing to work with interested members of the Senate on bipartisan, consensus legislation that would deter frivolous Y2K lawsuits and encourage responsible Y2K compliance. In my judgment, today's bill would more likely have the opposite effect. It proposes sweeping liability protection that will encourage more Y2K litigation and discourage curing Y2K problems.  The right approach is to fix as many of these problems ahead of time as we can. Ultimately, the best defense against any Y2K-based lawsuit is to be Y2K compliant.  Let me offer a few examples how this bill would restructure the laws of the 50 states and cause great harm to the nationwide effort to fix our Y2K computer problems in 1999.  First, this bill provides special liability protection to directors and officers of companies involved in Y2K disputes. Why are we doing this? Directors and officers are already protected by the business judgment rule, which has been adopted by each of the 50 states. How will this special legal protection for corporate directors and officers affect the well-established precedents interpreting the business judgment rule in our states?  Moreover, every director and officer of a corporation has standard insurance coverage to protect him or her from personal liability in the course of their duties. Will insurance companies reap windfall profits from this special legal protection for corporate directors and officers? Or should insurance companies rebate the premiums they have charged for existing insurance coverage for corporate directors or officers because it might be superfluous now? Who knows? But these questions will be hot spots for future litigation if this bill becomes law.  Providing special Y2K liability protection to the key decision makers in a company at this juncture sends the wrong message to the business community.  We want to encourage these key decision makers to be overseeing aggressive year 2000 compliance measures. Instead, this bill says to corporate officers and directors: ``Don't worry, be happy.''  I want those corporate officers motivated to fix their company's Y2K problems now. After their corporation is Y2K compliant and they have worked with their suppliers and customers and business partners and we have avoided Y2K problems is the time to be happy.  Second, this bill caps punitive damages to 3 times the amount of compensatory damages or $250,000, whichever is greater. If the defendant is a small business, then $250,000 is the ceiling for any punitive damage award.  These punitive damages caps again send the wrong message to the business community by protecting the bad actor, instead of rewarding the responsible business owner.  The bill contains an exception to these punitive damages caps if a plaintiff can prove by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant intentionally defrauded the plaintiff. This exception will prove meaningless in the real world because no one will be able to meet this high and specific standard for proving the injury was specifically intended. How in the world is a plaintiff going to prove some intentionally tried to injury him or her in a Y2K case? Get real.  Punitive damages are awarded only in cases of outrageous conduct. If a business takes responsible steps to become Y2K compliant, it will not be subject to punitive damages. These caps on punitive damages, like many other parts of the bill, discourage responsible Y2K remediation efforts.  Indeed, by limiting punitive damage to a dollar figure, $250,000, these special legal protections may encourage some companies to analyze the costs and potential risks of Y2K noncompliance and make the calculated business decision not to make the investment needed to come into compliance. The same type of calculation, for example, apparently made by Ford in the exploding Pinto gas tank case.  A cost-benefit approach does not fix a corporation's Y2K problems, but only leads to more litigation. Litigation with punitive damages caps may, in the judgment of the company's accountants, be worth enduring if it costs less than Y2K compliance.  Third, the bill severely restricts the amount of damages that an innocent plaintiff can recover from a guilty defendant by abolishing joint and several liability in most cases. The exceptions to this proportionate liability are so complex that they invited more litigation, not less.  This proportionate liability may unfairly penalize innocent consumers and small businesses and reward irresponsible companies.  For example, a small business forced to shut down temporarily because of a Y2K computer malfunction may not be able to recoup all of its losses under proportionate liability if it fails to identify all the responsible parties that caused that Y2K problem. As a result, that small business may be forced to file for bankruptcy because of its limited resources. Why is the innocent small business owner, who may not know and should not know all the responsible parties in the manufacturing chain of a non Y2K compliant product, forced to go out of business?  Moreover, this bill's many federal preemptions of state contract and tort law are all one-sided. The bill's provisions benefit only defendants, not plaintiffs, in Y2K disputes.  The bill raises the standards of proof from a preponderance test to a clear and convincing test for plaintiffs to prove negligence and other torts claims without any corresponding responsibility on defendants. The bill adds new state of mind requirements on plaintiffs to prove tort claims without any corresponding responsibility on defendants.  The bill also greatly expands the jurisdiction of the federal courts to consider Y2K cases under its class action provisions--an approach soundly rejected last month by Chief Justice Rehnquist and the Judicial Conference. The Judicial Conference found that shifting Y2K cases from state courts ``holds the potential for overwhelming the federal courts, resulting in substantial costs and delays.''  In addition, the Judicial Conference concluded ``the proposed Y2K amendments are inconsistent with the objective of preserving the federal courts as tribunals of limited jurisdiction.'' I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Judicial Conference opposing this expanded federal court jurisdiction be printed in the Record.  Finally, the bill adds a sunset date of January 1, 2016, according to the latest public draft. A bill that stays effective for the next 17 years is not narrow in scope. This sunset date is not reasonable. Is this bill intended to cover year 2015 computer problems?  I agree with Assistant Attorney General Eleanor Acheson who testified at the Judiciary Committee hearing a few weeks ago on similar Y2K liability legislation that ``this bill would be by far the most sweeping litigation reform measure ever enacted.''  So why do we need these sweeping litigation reforms to address year 2000 computer problems? I don't know. The proponents of this legislation have offered no solid evidence to justify these sweeping provisions.  There is no reasonable justification for the sweeping liability protections in this bill because these protections are not reasonable. This bill overreaches again and again. It is not close to being balanced.  Worst of all, this bill as presently drafted would preempt the consumer protection laws of each of the 50 states and restrict the legal rights of consumers who are harmed by Y2K computer failures. Why is this bill taking away existing protections for the ordinary citizen?  We all know that individual consumers do not have the same knowledge or bargaining power in the marketplace as businesses with more resources. Many consumers may not be aware of potential Y2K problems in the products that they buy for personal, family or household purposes.  Consumers just go to the local store downtown or at the mall to buy a home computer or the latest software package. They expect their new purchase to work. But what if it does not work because of a Y2K problem?  Then the average consumer should be able to use his or her home state's consumer protection laws to get a refund, replacement part or other justice. During the Judiciary Committee consideration of similar legislation, I offered an amendment to allow consumers to do just that. I may offer a similar amendment on this bill.  Those of us in Congress who have been active on technology-related issues have struggled mightily, and successfully, to act in a bipartisan way. It would be unfortunate, and it would be harmful to the technology industry, technology users and to all consumers, if that pattern is broken over this bill.  I sense that some may be seeking to use fear of the Y2K millennium bug to revive failed liability limitation legislation of the past. These controversial proposals may be good politics in some circles, but they are not true solutions to the Y2K problem. Instead, we should be looking to the future and creating incentives in this country and around the world for accelerating our efforts to resolve potential Y2K problems before they cause harm.  Last year, I joined with Senator Hatch to pass into law a consensus bill known as ``The Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act.'' We worked on a bipartisan basis with Senator Bennett, Senator Dodd, the Administration, industry representatives and others to reach agreement on a bill to facilitate information sharing to encourage Y2K compliance.  The new law, enacted six months ago, is working to encourage companies to work together and share Y2K solutions and test results. It promotes company-to-company information sharing while not limiting rights of consumers. That is the model we should use to enact balanced and narrow legislation to deter any frivolous Y2K litigation while encouraging responsible Y2K compliance.  I am continuing to work with Senators from both sides of the aisle to negotiate a narrow and balanced bill.  Unfortunately, this special interest legislation before us today is not narrow and it is not balanced.  I must oppose it.  Mr. President, I ask Unanimous Consent that a letter received by the Judiciary Committee from the Judicial Conference of the United States be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                            Judicial Conference of                                            the United States,                                   Washington, DC, March 24, 1999.     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,     Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate          Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the Judicial Conference of      the United States, I write to transmit views with respect to      pending year 2000 (``Y2K'') legislation. S. 461, as well as      S. 96 and H.R. 775, seeks to promote the resolution of      potentially large numbers of Y2K disputes. The federal      judiciary recognizes the commendable efforts of Congress to      resolve Y2K disputes short of full-scale litigation so as to      alleviate the burden of such litigation on private parties as      well as on federal and state courts. These are clearly      laudable public policy objectives.       Some of the provisions, however, will affect the      administration of justice in the federal courts. The Judicial      Conference, at its March 16th session, determined to oppose      the provisions expanding federal court jurisdiction over Y2K      class actions in bills (S. 461, S. 96, and H.R. 775)      currently under consideration by the 106th Congress. In      addition, because the Y2K pleading requirements included in      these bills circumvent the Rules Enabling Act, the Conference      also opposes these provisions.                             class actions       These bills create no federal cause of action. Instead,      they assume that plaintiffs will rely on typical state causes      of action to provide relief in Y2K disputes. Under the bills,      individual plaintiffs, as opposed to class action plaintiffs,      can bring their tort, contract, and fraud suits in a state      court where they will remain until resolved. While federal      defenses and liability limitations established in the      legislation may be raised in such litigation, the bills      recognize that state courts are fully capable of applying      these provisions and carrying out federal policy. This      reliance on state courts, which today handle 95 percent of      the nation's judicial business, follows the traditional      allocation of work between the state and federal courts.       The provisions of these Y2K bills take a radically      different approach to Y2K class actions--one that would      effect a major reallocation of class action workloads. These      bills create original federal court jurisdiction over any Y2K      class action based on state law, regardless of the amount in      controversy, where there is minimal diversity of      citizenship--that is, where any single member of the proposed      plaintiff class and any defendant are from different states.      They also provide for the removal of any such Y2K class      action to federal court by any single defendant or any single      member of the plaintiff class who is not a representative      party. While these bills do identify limited circumstances in      which a federal district court may abstain from hearing a Y2K      class action, it is unlikely that many actions will meet the      specified criteria. The net result of these provisions will      be that most Y2K class action cases will be litigated in the      federal courts.       This assignment of the class action workload to the federal      courts is particularly troubling because the Y2K problem may      result in a very large number of class actions. While no one      knows how many cases will be filed, Senator Robert Bennett,      Chair of the Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology      Problem, has predicted that there could be a ``tidal wave''      of litigation resulting from Y2K problems. Given the nature      of the Y2K problem, it is reasonable to expect that similar      claims will often arise in favor of multiple plaintiffs      against the same defendant or defendants. Thus, it can be      expected that a substantial portion of these cases will be      brought as class actions. Responding to class actions,      regardless of where they are filed, will likely be a      monumental task. If the current class action provisions      remain in these bills, however, the important contribution      the state courts would otherwise make to meeting this      challenge will be lost, and the burden of the federal system      will be correspondingly increased. The transfer of this      burden of the federal courts holds the potential of      overwhelming federal judicial resources and the capacity of      the federal courts to resolve not only Y2K cases, but other      causes of action as well.       Federal administration of these state-law class actions      will impose other substantial burdens. By shifting state-     created claims into federal court, the bills confront the      federal courts with the responsibility to engage in difficult      and time-consuming choice-of-law decisions. The Erie doctrine      requires that federal district courts, sitting in diversity,      apply the law of the forum state of determine which body of      state law controls the existence of a right of action. The      wholesale shift of state-law class actions into federal court      makes this choice-of-law obligation all the more daunting as      the sheer number of possible subclasses and relevant bodies      of state law multiples. Some federal courts have taken the      position that such multiplicity of law itself stands as a      barrier to the certification of a nationwide class action.      Even where a district court agreed to certify a class, it      would have to make choice of law     and substantive determinations that would have no binding      force in subsequent Y2K litigation in the states in question.       In addition to the potential adverse docket impact on the      federal courts, the proposed bills infringe upon the      traditional authority of the states to manage their own      judicial business. State legislatures and other rule-making      bodies provide rules for the aggregation of state-law      claims into class-wide litigation in order to achieve      certain litigation economies of scale. By providing for      class treatment, state policymakers express the view that      the state's own resources can be best deployed not through      repetitive and potentially duplicative individual      litigation, but through some form of class treatment. The      proposed bills could deprive the state courts of the power      to hear much of this class litigation and might well      create incentives for plaintiffs who prefer a state forum      to bring a series of individual claims. Such individual      litigation might place a greater burden on the state      courts and thwart the states' policies of more efficient      disposition.       Federal jurisdiction over class action litigation is an      area where change should be approached with caution and      careful consideration of the underlying relationship between      state and federal courts. The Judicial Conference Advisory      Committee on Civil Rules has recently devoted several years      of study to the rules in class action litigation. One      outgrowth of that study was the appointment by the Chief      Justice of a Mass Torts Working Group. The Working Group      undertook a study which revealed the complexities of      litigation that aggregates large numbers of claims and      illustrates the need for a deliberative review of the issues      that must be addressed in attempting to improve the process      for resolution of such litigation. Such issues involve not      only procedural rules, but also the jurisdiction of federal      and state courts and the interaction between federal and      state law. Y2K class action litigation implicates the same      complex and fundamental issues that the Working Group      identified. Even for familiar categories of litigation, these      issues can be satisfactorily resolved only by further study.      An attempt to address them in isolation, for an unfamiliar      category of cases that remains to be developed only in the      future, is unwise.       It may well be that extending minimal diversity to mass      torts may be appropriate if accompanied by suitable      restrictions. The Judicial Conference, for example, has      endorsed in principle the use of minimal diversity      jurisdiction in single-event, mass tort situations, like      airplane crash litigation, and there may be other situations      in which the efficiencies to be gained from consolidating      mass tort litigation in federal courts are justified.      Expansion of class action jurisdiction over Y2K class actions      in the manner provided in the pending bills, however, would      be inconsistent with the objective of preserving the federal      courts as tribunals of limited jurisdiction and the reality      that the federal courts are staffed and supported to function      as tribunals of limited jurisdiction.       Judicial federalism relies on the principle that state and      federal courts together comprise an integrated system for the      delivery of justice in the United States. There appears to be      no substantial justification for the potentially massive      transfer of workload under these bills, and such a transfer      would seem to be counterproductive. State courts provide most      of the nation's judicial capacity, and a decision to limit      access to this capacity in the face of the burden that Y2K      litigation may impose could have significant consequences for      the efficient resolution of Y2K disputes.                         pleading requirements       S. 461, as well as S. 96 and H.R. 775, sets forth specific      pleading provisions in Y2K litigation that would require a      plaintiff to state with particularity certain matters in the      complaint regarding the nature and amount of damages,      material defects, and the defendant's state of mind. These      requirements are inconsistent with the general notice      pleading provisions found in the Federal Rules of civil      Procedure (i.e., Rule 8), which apply to civil cases. The      bills' provisions bypass the rulemaking provisions in the      rules Enabling Act (28 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2071-77). They have      not been subjected to bench, bar, and public scrutiny      envisioned under the Rules Enabling Act and are inconsistent      with the policies underlying the Act, which the Judicial      Conference has long supported.       Not only do the statutory pleading requirements bypass the      Rules Enabling Act, they do so in a particularly      objectionable way because they are contained in stand-alone      statutory provisions outside the federal rules. This will      cause confusion and traps for unwary lawyers who are      accustomed to relying on the Federal Rules of civil Procedure      for pleading requirements. It also would signal yet another      departure from uniform, national procedural rules, following      closely in the wake of similar pleading requirements      contained in the Private Securities Reform Litigation Act.       On behalf of the federal judiciary, I appreciate your      consideration of these views. If you or your staff have any      questions, please contact Mike Blommer, Assistant Director,      Office of Legislative Affairs (202-502-1700).           Sincerely,                                            Leonidas Ralph Mecham,     Secretary.                          ____________________
