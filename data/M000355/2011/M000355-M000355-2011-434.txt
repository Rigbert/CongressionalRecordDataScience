 President, I wish to start by welcoming everyone back from the recess. It is good to be back. Time away from Washington is an opportunity to step back and measure the priorities of party against those of people who sent us here to make sure they are properly aligned.  As the two parties reengage this week in a debate about our Nation's finances, it is vital that we focus not on mere partisan advantage but on what is right for the Nation. When it comes to the two choices before us of either maintaining an unsustainable status quo on spending or beginning to cut spending, the choice could not be more clear.  This morning's news brought word that a 47-member panel of some of the Nation's top business economists view government overspending as the top threat to our economy. In other words, a majority of those experts think Washington's inability to live within its means is the single greatest threat to our Nation's economic future. This is not a groundbreaking observation. After all, Americans have been telling lawmakers for more than 2 years that business as usual simply will not cut it anymore.
