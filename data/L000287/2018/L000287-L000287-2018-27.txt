Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, Brother Paul, for yielding.  It is hard. It is difficult to stand here and know that Sister Louise Slaughter is not here. We came to Congress together, and, from time to time, she would call me Brother John. I loved Sister Louise.  She would talk. She would laugh. She was smart, gifted, and brave. She was courageous and sometimes very bold. I will never forget the trip to Rochester to be with her and see how the people loved her, adored her. I think when God created Sister Louise, he destroyed the mold. She was one of a kind, so wonderful. I miss her every single day.  I thank Brother Paul for doing this. Sister Louise would be very proud of him.
