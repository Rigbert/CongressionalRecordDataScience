 This town sits on an eroding bluff on the bank of the Mississippi River. If the erosion of the bluff is not halted the city of Hickman risks losing two 500,000-gallon water tanks, the police, fire, and ambulance stations, the county health department, and the community library buildings. As recently as 2 weeks ago the Fulton County School Board was evacuated after engineers indicated that bluff erosion had made the building unsafe.  Over the last several years, I have worked to find a solution to this problem. In 1992, I obtained funds to direct the Corps of Engineers to study the bluff's instability and determine the least costly alternative to address the erosion problem. Last year I was able to get additional funds included in the Energy and Water Development Appropriations, subject to authorization. Unfortunately, the Water Resources Development Act never passed the Senate, leaving the Corps of Engineers without the authorization to initiate their plan to stabilize the bluff. This amendment merely authorizes the expenditure of already appropriated funds.  This year I am concerned that time may run out on the residents of Hickman. Since the erosion does not conveniently conform to the Senate's schedule, I simply can not stand by and wait to see if the Water Resources Development Act will be passed this year.
