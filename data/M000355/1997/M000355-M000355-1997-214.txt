 I apologize to my colleague from Vermont. I thought he knew the substance of the Allard amendment. So I will withhold on asking for a time agreement on the Allard amendment for the moment.  Then Senator Hutchison is here to offer an amendment with regard to MFN and China. Then Senator Dodd and Senator McCain wish to offer an amendment related to the drug certification process for Mexico, which will be a rather spirited discussion, and it is my understanding that it is not possible to get a time agreement on that amendment at this time.  So, Mr. President, seeing my colleague from Alaska on his feet, I yield the floor.
