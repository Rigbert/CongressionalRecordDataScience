Biotechnology has produced drugs that hold the promise for many to live healthier lives. Biotechnology also holds enormous promise to make even more profound contributions to public health in the future.  For example, biotechnology strategies include the development of cancer vaccines as well as drugs that target specific cancer antigens to stimulate a patient's own immune system to kill tumor cells. There are so many other diseases that devastate families, like Alzheimers and heart disease, which biotechnology could be applied to successfully.  The Federal government has increased funding for basic scientific research. Private sector investments and small business development should also be encouraged. As remarkable as some of its achievement so far, biotechnology is only beginning. It is appropriate to begin the 21st Century with National Biotechnology Month because biotechnology holds so much promise for medicine and improving the quality of life.                          ____________________
