 Is it not true that you have amended page 12, section (B)(I) of S. 256, which reads in part: ``In any proceeding brought under this subsection, the presumption of abuse may only be rebutted by demonstrating special circumstances'' such as being called to active duty in the Armed Forces?  So when I say you are presuming that they are abusing bankruptcy, these are the exact words of your amendment.
