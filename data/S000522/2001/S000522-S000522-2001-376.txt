Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde) for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, let me just say to my colleagues, if we subsidized an organization that used their money and our money for hunger relief, but hunger relief was only part of their mix of programs a mix that also include the promotion of racial prejudice, we would withhold U.S. funds. Take for instance, apartheid, just go back 15, 20 years in South Africa. We would fund only NGOs who did not agree with Apartheid because we found it egregious and something we could not agree with. So we would suggest to those NGO's that had Apartheid as part of their package, just part of their program, that we will find another NGO to fund. One that divested itself from Apartheid.  Mr. Chairman, that is exactly what has happened with the Mexico City policy. We have said we will provide enormous amounts of money for family planning, but we want some pro-life safeguards to ensure that we are not promoting abortion. Many of us and many in America and many in the world believe abortion to be the taking of human life and exploitation of women as well, we don't want to fund that. Instead, we want to make sure that that money goes for family planning, their own money as well as our own.  Again, if we apply this policy to other issues where we have grave disagreements, like racial prejudice, we would pick and choose among NGOs, and only fund those who divested themselves, completely, from the egregious activity.  Finally, this policy has been found to be constitutional. It has already been litigated, and has been reaffirmed through the scrutiny of the U.S. courts. The Mexico City policy is fully constitutional.
