Chairman, let me tell you what this debate is all about. Too many Members of this new Gingrich Republican Party are frightened by freedom of expression in the United States.  Six screwballs to out and burn the American flag last year. The Gingrich Republicans come in and want to change the Bill of Rights for the first time in over 200 years. Garrison Keillor gets on public radio and needles them, and they decide to do away with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. A Congressman receives a few letters from advocacy groups he does not care for, he introduces an amendment to shut them down so they can no longer lobby Capitol Hill.                              {time}  2215  And now we have an amendment offered by the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon] which seeks to silence controversial discussions on college campuses, a place where we should encourage these discussions on the right and on the left. That is what America is all about.  I say to my friends in the Republican Party, if your revolution is so right, so popular, so American do not be afraid of the court of public opinion. That is what America is all about.  This amendment is not conservatism, it is elitism. Defeat this abomination. Defeat the Solomon amendment.
