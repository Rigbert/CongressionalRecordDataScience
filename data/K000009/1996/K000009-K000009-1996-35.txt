In other words, there is a lot of land out there that needs to replentify itself with additional moisture and so forth. We have severe problems in many parts of our country, we understand those needs, but we want the land ultimately to be used for livestock. We want it to be used for cash crops, vegetable crops, whatever. We just do not want to reward investors.  We have gotten some letters from the gentleman's part of the country, for example, from tenant farmers who have had their contracts cut off for this next fiscal year because the investors who own the land can actually make more money by getting the payments from USDA than if, in fact, they had raised a herd or grown a crop. We want to prevent any abuse like that and really reward the people who are doing the work. That is the purpose of the language.  I think both gentlemen, being respected ranchers and farmers in their own States, understand those who may try to cash in on a program like this, and I know that is not his intention in any way.
