 President, we will finish up the set of appropriations measures we have been considering for several days and take four more big steps toward our goal of completing a regular appropriations process and funding the government in a timely and orderly manner.  We will authorize vital resources for our Nation's Armed Forces. We will attend to several other priorities as well, including an extension of flood insurance and sending the bipartisan farm bill to a conference with the House.                          ____________________
