He is a friend. I understand what he is saying. Unfortunately, the reason why this position was not taken in the other body is what he has asked for is something they could do anyway, simply ask for a reporting requirement. What they have done, in asking for that, they simply put it over for another 60 days and then do exactly what they want. I don't think anybody questions the reporting that would come back from the very department that wants to do this would be to say: Do what you want to do. They accept the report, they accept the way it will be done. Rather than needing 60 days, they could probably do it in 6 minutes.  What I am concerned about is the reason why there is such a bipartisan support for this in the other body--not for the gutting amendment of the Senator from Wyoming but for our amendment--was this makes sure that these very critical services are in the hands of Government agencies.  There are jobs that can be privatized but I think sometimes we privatize what we should not. We sometimes privatize law enforcement and we have seen some of the problems we have had in our prisons when we have done that. Otherwise we privatize investigations and we find that people have their records and their reputations ruined by private companies that do not meet the standards they are supposed to follow and afterwards they say, Sorry, we made a mistake.  Frankly, if you vote for the second-degree amendment you are voting to outsource positions that are critical to our security. We have had 35 Senators who have already written to Secretary Ridge, asking him not to do this. Basically the second-degree amendment simply says tell us why you think you should do it and just go ahead and do it anyway.  I hope we would not vote for it.
