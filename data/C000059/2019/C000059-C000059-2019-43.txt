Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to point out that leaders in the Border Patrol want a barrier as a part of securing the border. Most people the majority leader mentioned are also in favor of a barrier as part of securing the border, as that is something that acts like, using a football metaphor, an offensive line. It slows people down in order for technology and people at that point to pick up people who are coming into this country illegally with drugs or otherwise illegal activity.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Joyce).
