 President, I was pleased to see the Senate pass by unanimous consent just now the bipartisan Protecting Our Infants Act. As prescription drug abuse and heroin use have increased in Kentucky and other States across the Nation, no demographic, socioeconomic status, age, or gender has been left untouched.  As the father of three daughters, particularly concerning to me is the increase in prenatal opiate abuse, which has resulted in a staggering 300-percent increase in the number of infants born suffering from withdrawal symptoms since 2000.  To address this crisis, I introduced the Protecting Our Infants Act, along with my colleague Senator Bob Casey. The bill would direct the Health and Human Services Secretary to conduct a departmental review to identify gaps in research and any duplication, overlap, or gaps in prevention and treatment programs related to this issue. It would also direct the Secretary to work with stakeholders on recommendations to address the problem. Furthermore, this measure would encourage the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to work with States in an effort to help improve their public health response to this epidemic.  Also, I want to acknowledge the outstanding work of the Senator from New Hampshire, Ms. Kelly Ayotte. I know that one of the things New Hampshire and Kentucky actually, unfortunately, share is that this has reached epidemic proportions. Nobody has been more involved in this issue than the Senator from New Hampshire. She has been on top of it from the very beginning. She shares the concerns of others, obviously, who have States that are suffering from this enormous problem.  I would also like to thank Representatives Katherine Clark and Steve Stivers for leading the effort to advance a similar message in the House of Representatives. I look forward to the House taking up this bill and it being sent to the President for his signature.
