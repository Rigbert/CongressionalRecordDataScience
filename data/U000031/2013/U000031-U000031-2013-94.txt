622, the Animal Drug and Animal Generic Drug User Fee Reauthorization Act of 2013.  This bipartisan bill is nearly identical to H.R. 1407, which we favorably reported out of the Energy and Commerce Committee last month. This bill, as well as the Animal Generic Drug User Fee Act, has proven to be very successful; and they are so important for the Nation's public health. Congress first created ADUFA back in 2003 and AGDUFA in 2008. Collectively, these programs have yielded many benefits for the American public.  These two bills have ensured that veterinarians, livestock, poultry producers, and pet owners have access to new and affordable animal drugs to keep their animals healthy. They have assisted animal drug producers by fostering a stable and predictable FDA review process, a rigorous process that helps expedite access to new therapies and fosters new drug development. The programs have also helped American consumers by keeping the food supply safe. Having medications that keep our animals healthy is essential to keeping our Nation's food supply safe. For companies like Zoetis, which employs some 700 people in southwest Michigan, these programs are vital in allowing them to keep producing innovative drugs for pets and livestock.  I was the lead sponsor of the original ADUFA legislation back in 2003, and it is terrific to see how successful it has been and how many Americans it has helped over the last decade.  I want to thank my colleagues, particularly Mr. Shimkus and Mr. Gardner, for their real leadership on this important issue. They deserve tremendous credit as we work to get this bill to the President's desk, and I urge my colleagues to support it.
