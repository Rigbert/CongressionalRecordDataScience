Mr. Chairman, I strongly support the Sessions amendment. This amendment helps ensure that deportable aliens are actually removed from the United States. Incredibly, only 13 percent of the illegal aliens arrested and ordered deported are actually removed from the country. Illegal aliens trying to sneak across the borders realize that, even if they get caught, they likely will never be required to leave. Of course, this only encourages illegal immigration.  The Sessions amendment helps correct this problem by giving the Department of Homeland Security guidance on the use of delivery bonds. Delivery bonds are already authorized under current law. This is nothing new. They require aliens to post a cash deposit and provide a written commitment they will appear in court. If the alien who posts bond violates any conditions of the bond, the bonding agent can take the alien into custody and surrender him to the Department of Homeland Security.  The Sessions amendment improves the use of delivery bonds by setting up 10 turn-in centers around the country to help bonding agents turn over deportable aliens to the Department of Homeland Security. It also sets up a system to encourage bonding agents tokeep looking for deportable aliens and turn them into DHS when they are found.  Illegal aliens, who comprise over 20 percent of all Federal prisoners today, are a serious problem in the United States and pose, obviously, a homeland security threat. We need to make sure that aliens who are deported by a court of law are in fact removed from the country. The Sessions amendment helps make sure that happens.
