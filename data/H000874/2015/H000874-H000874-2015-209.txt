Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to one of our Nation's greatest higher education leaders and a great advocate for accessible quality higher education. He is a dear friend and a colleague of mine for the last 40 years.  On June 30, Dr. William E. ``Brit'' Kirwan will retire after 12 years as chancellor of the University System of Maryland. Under his leadership, the University System has transformed from being a national leader in public higher education into a national model in several areas; these include campus diversity, academic innovation, and efforts to close the achievement gap.  There is, of course, a lot I could say, Mr. Speaker, to my colleagues about Dr. Kirwan's distinguished career and commitment to improving higher education across the country.       Mr. Speaker, on June 30, Dr. William E. ``Brit'' Kirwan,      who has served as chancellor of the University System of      Maryland (USM) for more than twelve years, will retire after      a career dedicated to advancing higher education.       Dr. Kirwan has left his mark on academia and the State of      Maryland in a way few others have. After a quarter-century as      an educator and administrator at the University of Maryland,      he was President of the University of Maryland, College Park,      before serving as President of The Ohio State University.      Later, he returned to Maryland to assume the position of USM      Chancellor. Common threads throughout his fifty-one-year      career in public higher education include an unwavering      commitment to affordability, a passion for excellence, and a      drive to increase access, especially for underrepresented      minorities and low-income students.       Mr. Speaker, Dr. Kirwan's leadership has helped move the      USM from a national leader in public higher education to a      national model in several areas. The USM's groundbreaking      Effectiveness and Efficiency (E&E) initiative--a      reengineering of administrative and academic processes to cut      costs and improve quality--has been profiled in national      publications and specifically cited by President Obama. The      ``Closing the Achievement Gap'' Initiative, which USM      launched in 2007, targets the gap in college participation,      retention, and graduation rates between low-income students,      first-generation college students, and underrepresented      minorities, on one hand, and the general student population      on the other. With this enhanced focus, these gaps in      diversity have been narrowed--and even eliminated--on some      USM campuses.       As President of the University of Maryland, College Park,      Dr. Kirwan helped make that institution one of the most      diverse public research universities in the United States. As      President of The Ohio State University, he made diversity a      centerpiece of the University's Academic Plan. When he left      Ohio State in 2002, the University added his name to its      interdisciplinary research institute dedicated to      understanding racial and ethnic disparities worldwide, now      known as the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and      Ethnicity.       Dr. Kirwan's effort to establish a productive working      relationship with Maryland's elected officials is another      testament to his leadership. By aligning higher education      goals with state priorities, the USM has ushered in an era of      academic and research excellence, targeted workforce      development, greater economic impact, and improved      affordability. In fact, the average tuition for undergraduate      in-state students at USM institutions, once the nation's      seventh highest, has now dropped to twenty-sixth.       With the launch of its Course Redesign Initiative in 2006,      the USM became the first university system in the nation to      use innovative new technology to redesign entire courses. To      facilitate academic transformation and excellence even      further, in 2012 the USM established the Center for Academic      Innovation (CAI) to develop, apply, and evaluate more ways to      deliver high-quality courses optimizing technology and other      resources system-wide. Today the USM is recognized as a      national leader in the burgeoning academic innovation      movement.       Mr. Speaker, Dr. Kirwan's impact has also been felt beyond      Maryland's borders. He currently serves or has served as Co-     Chair of the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics;      Chair of the College Board's Commission on Access,      Admissions, and Success in Higher Education; a member of the      Business-Higher Education Forum, and Chair of the National      Research Council Board of Higher Education and the Workforce.      Dr. Kirwan has also been called upon by U.S. Presidents from      both parties to advise on national higher education efforts.      His impact on higher education has been honored with two of      the most prestigious awards in the field: the TIAA-CREF      Theodore M. Hesburgh Award for Leadership (2010) and the      Carnegie Corporation Leadership Award (2009).       Under Dr. Kirwan's leadership the USM has flourished, and      his lifetime of achievement and service will be celebrated on      April 18 at a special retirement gala that will raise      endowment funds for the Center for Academic Innovation, which      promises to continue exploring the themes of access,      affordability, and excellence in higher education that have      been hallmarks of his career.       I hope my colleagues in the House will join me in thanking      Dr. Kirwan for fifty-one years of service to higher education      in our country and congratulating him on his retirement.                          ____________________
