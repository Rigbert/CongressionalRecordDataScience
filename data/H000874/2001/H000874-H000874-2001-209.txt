Speaker, I yield 1 minute to myself simply to introduce the next speaker.  I indicated that we are passing this resolution today, and next week I expect the House will pass a resolution sponsored by the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) and co-sponsored by every other woman Member of the House to recognize the contribution of women.  We have a distinguished African-American woman who now chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, an outstanding leader in the State Senate in Texas for many years, and an outstanding leader in this House. She is not only a Texas leader, she is a national leader as well.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson).
