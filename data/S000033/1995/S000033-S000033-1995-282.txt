 Last week the House Committee on Ways and Means, as I understand it, passed a provision, this is hard to believe, especially for people, those real deficit hawks concerned about the large deficit, that would repeal the minimal corporate tax.  Now, some people may remember that in the early 1980's, when the large corporations in America were writing tax law in this country, what we had is the outrage, was the outrage of huge multibillion dollar corporations like General Electric, AT&T, du Pont, wealthy, powerful corporations, who were paying in the early 1980's zero in taxes. Zero in taxes.  Well, the embarrassment became so deep that finally in 1986, a minimal corporate tax was passed that said, corporations, even with all your good lawyers you can go through all the loopholes you have put into the system and you pay nothing in taxes, there has got to be a minimal tax.  Recently, last week, the House Committee on Ways and Means proposed to do away with that minimal tax. But I know that there is another aspect of corporate welfare that has interested Ms. Kaptur very, very much, and that is the bailout of Mexico. And maybe in terms of the discussion that we are having now, in which last week we cut back, the Republicans voted to cut back on fuel assistance for 5 million Americans, cut back on the WIC program, cut back on senior citizen housing, now, tell us perhaps how could we find $20 billion, not just the Republican problem by the way, how can we find $20 billion to bail out Mexico?
