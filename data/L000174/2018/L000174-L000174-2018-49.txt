President, I have spoken before about Suvash Darnal, an extraordinary Nepalese Dalit activist who was tragically killed in a traffic accident in Virginia on August 15, 2011.  Mr. Darnal was only 31 years old when he died, but he had already made more of his life than many people who live to be twice or three times his age. He grew up impoverished, with nothing to look forward to. In large measure because of the adversity he experienced and his inherent thirst for knowledge, he became a passionate advocate for his people at home and around the world. As I have said before, his integrity, his humility, his vision, and his dedication live on as an inspiring example of why caste discrimination has no place in the 21st century, in Nepal or anywhere else.  From 2008 to 2009, Mr. Darnal was a fellow at the National Endowment for Democracy. Carl Gershman, President of NED, was among Mr. Darnal's admirers and has helped to convey the lessons of Mr. Darnal's life to a wider audience.  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Gershman's account of recent events in Kathmandu in remembrance of Suvash Darnal be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                        [From the kathmandupost]                           (By Carl Gershman)       Aug. 28, 2018.--I visited Nepal recently to attend two days      of memorial events held in honour of Suvash Darnal, an      activist for Dalit rights who perished in a terrible car      accident in Washington in 2011. I first met Darnal a decade      ago when he was a Reagan-Fascell Democracy Fellow at the      National Endowment for Democracy (NED), the organisation that      I head. 1 found him to be an unusually gifted democracy      activist. He had a marvellously engaging personality, and he      impressed many people in Washington as a sophisticated      analyst of Nepal at a time when the country was just coming      out of a civil war. He was also an ardent and effective      spokesman against caste discrimination.       Darnal had the ability to make the Dalit issue come alive      for Americans, partly by     drawing parallels with America's own history of slavery and      racial discrimination. There are obviously great differences      between the US and Nepal, as well as between racial and caste      discrimination. But experiences have a way of travelling      across borders and cultures in our globalised world, and in      his public presentation as a NED fellow on discrimination      against Dalits, Darnal called for a programme of `affirmative      action', an idea that was developed in the US after the civil      rights movement to highlight the need for proactive measures      to address the deeply rooted problem of racial inequality.       One of the attributes that made Darnal such an effective      activist was that he understood the importance of      organisation and the need for institutions of civil society      capable of taking collective action. When he was only 20      years old, he took the lead in creating the Jagaran Media      Centre which was both the largest Dalit media outlet in South      Asia and an advocacy group fighting to eliminate caste-based      discrimination.       When king Gyanendra took power in 2001 and shut down      Nepal's nascent democracy, he helped found the Collective      Campaign for Peace, a coalition of 43 non-governmental      organisations that became the secretariat for the civic      movement fighting for the restoration of democracy. And when      he returned from his fellowship at NED, during which he had      thought deeply about the need to change the pure-impure      dichotomy of the caste-based culture and system in Nepal, he      created the Samata Foundation to bridge the gap between      politics and caste.       What has impressed me about the Dalit movement in Nepal is      that it did not succumb to discouragement by Darnal's tragic      death, but has found a way to build upon his legacy of      struggle and organisation. The programme of remembrance on      August 14-15 consisted of three major events--a conference at      Tribhuvan University at which five young Dalit scholars and      practitioners presented papers on different dimensions of the      continuing struggle against caste discrimination; an evening      forum where four prominent international scholars placed the      Dalit issue in a global context; and a concluding award      ceremony at Kathmandu's City Hall attended by 500 people at      which frontline Dalit activists were recognised for their      efforts to carry forward Darnal's vision of social justice.       These events took place at a time of deep anxiety among      Dalits over the rise of nationalism in Nepal that has led the      Left Alliance government to dismiss demands for minority      rights and the inclusion of marginalised groups as      inconsistent with the need for national unity. This problem      was addressed by a paper delivered at the Tribhuvan      University conference by Amar BK, a PhD candidate at the      University of Pittsburgh in the US, who wrote that despite      the hopes for an end to untouchability engendered by the      adoption in 2007 of a progressive interim constitution, the      recent rise of Hindu religious nationalism has caused an      anti-Dalit backlash. Other conference papers highlighted the      persistence of exclusion and discrimination in the judiciary      in Nepal and the need to refute `dominant narratives' against      affirmative action, such as that the policy undermines      meritocracy.       Despite the current backsliding on the Dalit issue, I was      heartened that the movement is pressing ahead at every level.      In Parliament, Dalit Members of Parliament are preparing      shadow bills on the critical issues of land reform,      employment, housing, health care, education and the defence      of political rights and freedom of assembly and association.      At the state level, the Samata Foundation is developing a      leadership academy to train new Dalit members of Provincial      Assemblies. Training and protection are also being provided      to the thousands of Dalits who have been elected to positions      on local councils but who are being blocked by old-line      forces from carrying out their responsibilities. And, of      course, there are continuing efforts to address the critical      long-term need for youth education and capacity-building.       What especially impressed me was the invariably positive      and hopeful attitude that the Dalit activists take to the      challenges they face, despite the legacy of harsh      discrimination and a bloody civil war. At the Tribhuvan      University conference, for example, grassroots activist Sona      Khatik movingly described the terrible injustices she had      suffered, yet said that she had decided early on to take her      revenge by doing good deeds, not by using violence. Darnal's      widow Sarita Pariyar also took the path of nonviolence by      invoking the memory of Dr Martin Luther King when she spoke      about ending the scourge of caste humiliation.       This positive attitude exemplified the spirit of Suvash      Darnal, who always rejected the politics of grievance and      victimisation. He never appealed to people's sense of guilt      over the injustices done to Dalits, nor did he ever ask for      sympathy, let alone pity. Rather than put people off with      rancour and righteous anger, he preferred to draw them in      with humour, warmth and wit. He always took the high road and      appealed to common ideals of social justice and shared      humanity. The Dalit movement is building upon what Suvash      accomplished, and is using his example as a model and      inspiration. If they succeed, they will make Nepal a stronger      and more successful country, and will give inspiration to      others around the world who are responding to new threats to      democracy at a very troubled time in world history.                          ____________________
