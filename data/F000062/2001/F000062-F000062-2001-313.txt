 President, today I am introducing a bill designed to better direct and refocus ESEA Title I funds on academic instruction. The goal of this bill, titled ``The Title I Integrity Act,'' is to target Title I funds on learning and to get ``more for our money'' from the largest Federal elementary-secondary education program.  Title I provides assistance to virtually every school district in the country for services to children attending schools with high concentrations of low-income students, from preschool through high school. It has been the ``anchor'' of Federal assistance to schools, since its origin in 1965. For Fiscal Year 2000, funding for Part A basic grants to school districts is almost $8 billion.  This bill would specify in law how Title I funds can and cannot be used by schools. It seeks to direct Title I funds to uses that improve academic achievement and help students meet state achievement standards.  The bill says that ``a local educational agency shall use funds . . . only to provide academic instruction and services directly related to the instruction of students in preschool through grade 12 to assist eligible children to improve their academic achievement and to meet achievement standards established by the State.''  Permitted uses include these: Interventions and corrective actions to improve student achievement; extending academic instruction beyond the normal school day and year, including summer school; the employment of teachers and other instructional personnel (including employee benefits); instructional services to pre-kindergarten children for the transition to kindergarten; the purchase of instructional resource such as books, materials, computers, and other instructional equipment and wiring to support instructional equipment; development and administration of curriculum, educational materials and assessments; and transportation of students to assist them in improving academic achievement.  Uses explicitly not permitted are these: The purchase or lease of privately-owned facilities; the purchase or provision of facilities maintenance, janitorial, gardening, or landscaping services or the payment of utility costs; the construction of facilities; acquisition of real property; food and refreshments; travel to and attendance at conferences or meetings; and the purchase or lease of vehicles.  Current law on Title I is much too vague. It says, ``A State or local educational agency shall use funds received under this part only to supplement the amount of funds that would, in the absence of such Federal funds, be made available from non-Federal sources for the education of pupils participating in programs assisted under this part, and not to supplant such funds.''  The U.S. Department of Education has given states a guidance document that explains how Title I funds can currently be used. Permitted uses are for the following: instructional practices; counseling, mentoring; developing curricula; salaries; employee benefits; renting privately-owned facilities; janitorial services; utilities; mobile vans; training and professional development; equipment; interest on lease purchase agreements; travel and conferences; food and refreshments; insurance for vehicles; parent involvement activities.  Under this guidance document, only two uses are specifically prohibited: (1) construction or acquisition of real property; and (2) payment to parents to attend a meeting or training session or to reimburse a parent for salary lost due to attendance at ``parental involvement'' meeting.  My reason for introducing this bill is this: Our students are not learning; our schools are failing our children. We must use our limited federal dollars for the fundamental purpose of education: to help students learn.  Just this week I learned that a January 2001 study by Education Weekly, titled ``Quality Counts 2001: A Better Balance,'' brought more bad news about California's students. Here's what the report found:  In fourth grade reading, 20 percent of students are proficient and 52 percent are below the basic standard.  In eighth grade reading, 22 percent of students are proficient and 36 percent are below the basic standard.  Comparing California to other states, in how well fourth grade students read, California ranks 36 out of 39 states. In eight grade reading, California ranks 32 out of 36 states.  Nationally, the news is similarly distressing:  U.S. eighth graders are out-performed by their counterparts in math and science from Japan, Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore, Australia and Canada (Third International Math and Science Study, December 5, 2000). The 1999 study showed virtually no improvement for U.S. students over 1995.  American twelfth graders performed in mathematics better than students in only two countries, Cyprus and South Africa.  In writing, 75 percent of U.S. school children cannot compose a well-organized, coherent essay, concluded the National Assessment for Education Progress (NAEP) in September 1999.  While it is difficult to really ascertain exactly ow Title I funds are always being used, we do know of a few examples of uses that raise questions in my mind:  In Alabama, schools ``dipped into Title I to pay the electric bill and for janitorial services.'' Citizens' Commission on Civil Rights.  While most of Title I's $8 billion appear to be spent on instruction, the Los Angeles Times, in a March 12, 2000 editorial, said, ``About half that amount is wasted on unskilled though well-meaning teacher aides, who are often more baby-sitter than instructor.''  Title I has been used ``to pay for everything from playground supervisors and field trips to more time for nurses and counselors.'' San Diego Tribune, March 16, 2000.  California school officials have told my staff that Title I has been used for pay for clerical assistants in school administrative offices, payroll staff, truant officers, schoolyard duty personnel, school bus loading assistants, ``curriculum coordinators,'' ``compliance,'' attending conferences, and home visits.  It is time to put an end to the notion that Title I can be everything to everyone, that it can fund all the services that schools need. Federal funding is only seven percent of total funding for elementary and secondary education and Title I is even a smaller percentage of total support for public schools. We must get the most that we can educationally for our limited dollars.  It is time to better direct Title I funds to the true goal of education: to help students learn. This bill is one step toward that goal.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 309       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
