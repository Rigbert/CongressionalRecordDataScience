That doesn't seem like a very good deal.  But here is what I want to get to. Is this correct, in the view of the Senator from Arizona. You are an insurance company--BlueCross BlueShield in Kansas, for that matter, Arizona, or John Deere from Iowa--I know they provide this kind of insurance for low-income families. What happens to them when SCHIP expands and crowds them out? And another thing, I'm assuming that providers get less in terms of reimbursement from SCHIP than they do from private insurance. So if I am a provider--and this story has been told in Medicaid, it has been told in Medicare, and now it is going to be told in SCHIP--and I get paid less, some providers are going to say: Adios. I am sorry, I am not going to see you.  Basically, we had that with Medicare Part D and pharmacists, where they were only reimbursed up to 70 percent, and some of them say: I am not going to do this anymore.  Now we are doing it with SCHIP because we are crowding out the private insurance companies. If you are a private insurance company, if you are John Deere of Iowa, and all of a sudden somebody comes along and takes away this number of youngsters from the coverage, how are you going to exist?
