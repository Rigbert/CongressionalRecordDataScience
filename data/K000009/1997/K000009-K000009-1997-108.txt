 Just for clarification purposes, in the report that accompanies our bill, we did direct the administration with the following language: ``Funds for these initiatives are not available until justification and reprogram requests are approved.''  So I think we put language in the report accompanying the bill to put our subcommittee directly in oversight over what is happening. And I will say to the chairman of our subcommittee, I was hoping our community could get one of these designations. We have several rivers we need help on. But I look forward to working with the gentleman on the language as we move to conference.
