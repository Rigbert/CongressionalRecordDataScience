 President, I was going to say to our colleagues that it is the intention of Senator Reid and myself to continue to process amendments into the evening, with the goal of finishing tonight. We still have 30-some-odd amendments. There is certainly no requirement that they all be offered. We intend to keep plowing ahead and try to reach the finish line tonight.
