Speaker, I am sorry that Ron is not on the floor, but I want to rise on behalf of all of us on this side of the aisle. The gentleman from California indicated that Ron Lasch has been helpful to his side. That is of course very true. He is, after all, assigned that responsibility.  On the other hand, I want my colleagues to know and I want everybody to know that those of us on this side of the aisle who happened to be on the gentleman's side of the aisle and needed a question answered felt very comfortable talking to Ron Lasch. Because Ron Lasch, although he served in a partisan role, clearly felt himself an institutional person who wanted to facilitate the workings of this institution on behalf of the American people.  I want to join the gentleman from California (Mr. Thomas), the chairman of the Committee on House Administration in saying that we share his congratulations and appreciation for all the work that Ron Lasch has done and the service that he has performed for everybody on the floor of the House and for the American public.
