Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and my colleague, Mr. Levin, for yielding.  If we go home without passing the bipartisan Senate bill, we disgrace ourselves and this Congress. We are out of time. We cannot go into this holiday season without helping our unemployed brothers and sisters. We cannot keep our seniors from seeing their doctors. We cannot allow taxes to go up for millions of Americans.  What is happening here today is shameful, it is a disgrace, it is unreal, it is unbelievable. We can do better.  If we fail today, how will you face your neighbor, your family, who are suffering? Where is your compassion? Where is your heart? Where is your soul? I, sir, vote ``no'' on this motion and pass the Senate bipartisan bill.                              {time}  1150
