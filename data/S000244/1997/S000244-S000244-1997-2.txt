Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, the same version of this bill passed this House last year under suspension of the rules. H.R. 112 requires the Administrator of NASA to convey to Stanislaus County, California, the property known as the NASA Ames Research Center, Crows Landing Facility. Under this bill NASA shall retain the right to use this property for aviation activities.  In March of this year, NASA conducted a review of its field activities to identify potential closures which would reduce operational costs. As a result of this effort, NASA decided to cease operations at the NASA Crows Landing Facility in order to lower overhead burdens and eliminate operations costs.  This excess Federal property is ideal for use by Stanislaus County for economic development. It is a win-win arrangement for the Federal Government and the local government of California, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
