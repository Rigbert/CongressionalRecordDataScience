Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the language found at page 13, beginning on line 24 which begins ``for administration of such programs'' and continuing to line 25 and ending with the words ``section 40117.''  The language would fund the cost of administering the Airport Improvement Program from contract authoritythat, under chapter 471 and section 48103 of Title 49 U.S.C., is authorized only for grants, not administrative expenses. This is an unauthorized earmark of funds.  This language clearly constitutes legislation on an appropriations bill in violation of clause 2 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives.  Mr. Chairman, I also make a point of order against the language found on page 14, beginning on line 12 with the word ``Provided'' and continuing to end the end of line 20.  The language on lines 12 through 17 before the words ``Provided further'' would fund the cost of the Small Community Air Service Development Pilot Program from contract authority that is authorized only for AIP grants under chapter 471 and section 48103 of Title 49 U.S.C. Although I support this program, I must object to funding it with AIP grants as this would constitute an unauthorized earmark of funds.  This language clearly constitutes legislation on an appropriations bill in violation of clause 2 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives.  Mr. Chairman, the language found at page 14, beginning on line 17 with the words ``That notwithstanding'' and continuing through the end of line 20 would fund the cost of administering the Airport Improvement Program from contract authority under chapter 471 and section 48103 of Title 49 U.S.C., that is authorized only for grants, not administrative expenses. This supersedes existing law and clearly constitutes legislation on an appropriations bill in violation of clause 2 of rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives.
