 Their statements appear to be, even today, misleading and inaccurate.  Just because I didn't explain the policy exactly right did not mean the policy did not exist. Everything that was coming over the transom at night to me was telling me that I was on the right track.  I responded to the denials this way--and they are in this letter, my letter No. 11. I wish to quote a couple of sentences:       If this statement is indeed accurate--and ``Straight Pay''      doesn't exist, then why do I have official DFAS documents      establishing ``Straight Pay Procedures?'' Are these documents      a fake?  Are these documents I am getting a fake if they come directly from the financial center?  I later discovered another DFAS document, dated March 8, 1999, which states:       Due to concerns over the use of the term ``straight pay''      and its connotation, we must delete all references to      ``straight pay'' the from the policy. . . .  Now, how does that square with what the Secretary of Defense Cohen told me? How does that square with the exchange I had with Bill Lynn, Chief Financial Officer at that time? Those things are in this document No. 12.  I ask unanimous consent to have document No. 12 printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                   Defense Finance                                       and Accounting Service,                                                    March 8, 1999.                    memorandum for see distribution     Subject: Policy for Processing Unmatched Disbursements       Effective November 1, 1999, you were authorized to post      unmatched disbursements (UMDs) without posting a negative      unliquidated obligation (NULO) offset for transactions      meeting criteria described in the attached policy. Due to      concerns over the use of the term ``straight pay'' and its      connotation, we must delete all references to ``straight      pay'' from the policy, and clarify that the policy does not      create an environment for fraudulent payments. Terms such as      unmatched disbursements or direct disbursements were      substituted.       Operating location (OPLOC) recommendations to add other      categories under paragraph F, ``Unmatched Disbursements Which      May Be Recorded Without Research, Approval, and NULO      Offset,'' were incorporated. For example, Fund Type K      transactions for Deposit/Suspense Accounts and disbursements      posted under processing center ``Y,'' etc., were added. The      inclusion of these categories did not change the intent or      scope of the policy. We also clarified that for disbursements      made against obligations recorded as Miscellaneous Obligation      Reimbursement Documents (MORD) where the difference exceeds      $3,000, Financial Service Office/Accounting Liaison office      (FSO/ALO) approval is not required, but the FSO/ALO should be      notified within 4 work days.       The revised policy is attached for your action. OPLOCs will      continue to maintain a log on unmatched disbursements      requiring FSO/ALO review. Copies of attached Missing      Commitment/Obligation form (Atch 1) may be kept in lieu of a      log.       We are requesting you to submit another report from the log      statistics you gather for UMDs processed between February 1--     May 31, 1999. The UMD Report, in Excel 5.0 format, is due to      DFAS-DE/ASP on June 11, 1999. Please submit report via      cc:mail to address indicated on attached report format. At      that time we will decide whether another reporting cycle is      necessary.       These procedures were coordinated with the Office of the      Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Financial      Management-Air Force Accounting and Finance Office (AFAFO/     FMF).
