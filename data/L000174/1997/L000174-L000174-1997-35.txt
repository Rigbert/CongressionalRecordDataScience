President, it is with great pleasure that I pay tribute to Daniel Urban Kiley, a landscape architect from Charlotte, Vermont, who was named by President Clinton as recipient of the 1997 National Medal of Arts. Established by Congress in 1984, this award honors individuals who have made outstanding contributions to the arts in our nation.  My wife, Marcelle, and I have enjoyed the work of Daniel Urban Kiley for many years and I am honored that a Vermonter, and a friend, has received this national recognition.  I ask to have printed in the Record a list of Mr. Kiley's accomplishments put together by the awards committee.  The material follows:       As one of this country's most eminent landscape architects,      Daniel Kiley combines     experience and imagination with the vision to create classic      civic design where building and site come together as one. In      a professional career spanning over 50 years, Kiley has      worked on some of this country's most important commissions      along with many of today's most distinguished architects and      firms in 16 foreign countries. He has helped design sites      including the Washington Mall, the National Gallery of Art      East Wing, National Sculpture Garden--all in Washington, D.C.      More recently, he worked on the design of the Pittsburgh      Cultural Trust plaza and museum, the Soros residence, and      Riverfront Park in Corning, New York. He is the recipient of      many awards and honors including the 1995 Arnold W. Brunner      Prize in Architecture, the Outstanding Lifetime Achievement      Award from the Harvard Graduate School of Design, and a 1991      Governor's Award for Excellence in the Arts from the Vermont      Council on the Arts. Kiley's work has been shown at the      Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Library of Congress,      and in traveling national exhibitions. He has lectured      extensively and served on many design juries. His work has      been widely published in the U.S. and abroad. In 1998, Kiley      will publish a book exploring the breadth of his work. He      served on President Kennedy's Advisory Council for      Pennsylvania Avenue, the National Council on the Arts, the      Boston Redevelopment Authority, the Cambridge Redevelopment      Authority, the Washington, D.C. Redevelopment Land Agency,      and the Vermont Council on the Arts. He also has been a      Landscape Architect-in-Residence at the American Academy in      Rome. Kiley's designs have been widely cited for their      ability to raise public consciousness and enhance awareness      of man's relationship to nature, while maintaining a sense of      joyousness, fun, and excitement.                          ____________________
