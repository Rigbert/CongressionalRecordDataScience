Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a dear friend of mine, Jordie Tatter, who unexpectedly passed away in January 2003. Today, I am pleased that the conference center at the Southwest Michigan Research and Extension Center is being dedicated to Jordie. This is a great honor for my friend; however because of votes in the House today, I can not be at the dedication ceremony this afternoon in Berrien County.  As this dedication confirms, Jordie was a giant in the agricultural and natural resources industries. His commitment and enthusiasm to excellence in the field of agriculture was unmatched, whether it be at the local, national, and yes, even international level. He truly embodied the heart and soul of southwest Michigan, and I am blessed to have formed a close friendship. I looked at this friendship, not only as a source of console and inspiration, but also as a true compass of direction in greater understanding and appreciation of our community.  I have never met a man more passionate or knowledgeable toward the industry he loved--Michigan agriculture. Jordie was always willing to lend his extensive knowledge to those interested, and his great mind benefited all who had the pleasure of crossing his path. I was fortunate enough to call Jordie a close friend. During the time that I had with him, I relied on his insight and intelligence. He was kind and supportive--even more so when times were tough. Jordie's love of his work, the outdoors, the Farm Bureau, and Michigan State University, will be deeply remembered and this dedication is yet another reminder of his immense impact on our community.  We all miss Jordie greatly but his legacy lives on at the Extension Center, as others continue to follow in his footsteps in the agriculture community. He will always live on through our many wonderful memories that will not fade away.                          ____________________
