 President, I would like to speak in support of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act. I had hoped Senator Burr, the chairman of the committee, would be able to deliver the remarks initially. However, he has been unfortunately delayed, and so I will go ahead with my remarks as vice chairman of the committee.  There is no legislative or administrative step we can take that will end all cyber crime and cyber warfare, but as members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, we have heard over the course of several years now that improving the exchange of information and the sharing of that information, company to company and company to the government, can be very helpful and yield a real and significant improvement to cyber security.  Regrettably, this is the third attempt to pass a cyber security information sharing bill. In the almost 5 years that I have been working on this issue, two things have become abundantly clear about passing the bill. First, it must be bipartisan. In 2012, I cosponsored the Lieberman-Collins Cybersecurity Act, which included a title oninformation sharing based on a bill I had introduced. It was an important piece of legislation, but it received almost no Republican support and could not gain the 60 votes needed to invoke cloture. It became clear to me then that no cyber security legislation could pass without broad bipartisan support.  The second lesson that has been learned is, it must be narrowly focused. The Lieberman-Collins bill sought to address many critical challenges to our Nation's cyber security. Then-Majority Leader Harry Reid, brought the chairmen of all committees of jurisdiction on our side together and asked them to draft legislation on cyber security in their areas. It soon became clear that addressing so many complex issues makes a bill very difficult to pass. That bill died on the Senate floor in late 2012.  Based on these lessons, we have tried to take a bipartisan and focused approach so Congress can pass a cyber security information sharing bill. In the last Congress, in 2013 and 2014, then-vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee Saxby Chambliss and I sought to draft legislation on information sharing that would attract bipartisan support. We worked through a number of difficult issues together, and we were able to produce a bill that I believed would pass the Senate. The Intelligence Committee approved the bill in 2014 by a strong bipartisan vote of 12 to 3, but it never reached the Senate floor due to privacy concerns about the legislation.  This year, Chairman Burr and I have drafted legislation that both sides can and should support. This bill is bipartisan, it is narrowly focused, and it puts in place a number of privacy protections, many of which I will outline shortly. The bill's bipartisan vote of 14 to 1 in the Senate Intelligence Committee in March underscores this fact.  I would like to thank Senator Burr for his leadership and his willingness to negotiate a bipartisan bill that can and should receive a strong vote. As he often says, neither one of us would have written this bill this way if we were doing it ourselves. This Senator believes it is also true that by negotiating this draft, we will get substantially more votes than either of us can get on our own. I very much hope that is true.  I note that this bill has strong support from the private sector because it creates incentives for improving cyber security and protects companies that take responsible steps to do so. Companies are shielded from lawsuits if they properly use the authorities provided for in this bill. They can be confident that sharing information with other companies or with the government will not subject them to inappropriate regulatory action.  For these reasons, this bill has the support of over 40 business groups, and it is the first bill that has the support of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. It also has the support of the most important cyber security and critical infrastructure companies in the Nation.  Mr. President, I would like to ask unanimous consent to have those letters printed into the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                   August 3, 2015.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Harry Reid,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Reid: On      behalf of our diverse members, we write today in strong      support of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (S.      754), a bipartisan bill approved earlier this year on a near-     unanimous basis by the Select Committee on Intelligence. We      strongly urge you to bring up S. 754 as expeditiously as      possible, defeat any amendments that would undermine this      important legislation, and support the underlying bill.       The threat of cyber-attacks is a real and omnipresent      danger to our sector, our members' customers and clients, and      to critical infrastructure providers upon which we--and the      nation as a whole--rely. S. 754 would enhance our ability to      defend the financial services sector and the sensitive data      of hundreds of millions of Americans. It is critical that      Congress get cybersecurity information sharing legislation to      the President's desk before the next crisis, not after.       Our members and the broader financial services industry are      dedicated to improving our capacity to protect customers and      their sensitive information but as it stands today, our laws      do not do enough to foster information sharing and establish      clear lines of communication with the various government      agencies responsible for cybersecurity. If adopted and signed      into law, this legislation will strengthen the nation's      ability to defend against cyber-attacks and better protect      all Americans by encouraging the business community and the      government to quickly and effectively share critical      information about these threats while ensuring privacy. More      effective information sharing provides some of the strongest      protections of privacy, as it is sensitive information from      our member firms' customers that we are asking Congress to      protect from those who attempt to steal or destroy that      information.       Each of our organizations and our respective member firms      has made cybersecurity a top priority and we are committed to      continuing to work with you and your colleagues in the Senate      so that effective cyber threat information sharing      legislation can be enacted into law.           Sincerely,         American Bankers Association; American Insurance            Association; The Clearing House; Financial Services            Institute; Financial Services Roundtable; Investment            Company Institute; NACHA--The Electronic Payments            Association; The National Association of Mutual            Insurance Companies; Property Casualty Insurers            Association of America; Securities Industry and            Financial Markets Association.                                  ____                                                   August 3, 2015.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Reid:      The undersigned organizations reiterate their support for      cybersecurity information sharing and liability protection      legislation and urge the Senate to promptly take up and pass      S. 754, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) of      2015. Enactment of such legislation is urgently needed to      further enhance and encourage communication among the federal      government, the North American electric power sector, and      other critical infrastructure sectors, thus improving our      ability to defend against cyber attacks.       While the electric sector already engages in significant      information sharing activities and has in place mandatory and      enforceable reliability and cybersecurity standards, there      remains an urgent need for the government and industry to      better share actionable security information in a timely and      confidential manner, including protections against public      disclosure of sensitive security information. CISA provides a      framework to help foster even more meaningful information      sharing while maintaining a critical balance between      liability and privacy protections.       The electric power sector takes very seriously its      responsibility to maintain the reliability, safety, and      security of the electric grid. Beyond mandatory standards,      the industry maintains an all-hazards ``defense in depth''      mitigation strategy that combines preparation, prevention,      resiliency, and response and recovery efforts. We also work      closely with the federal government and other critical      infrastructure sectors on which the electric sector depends      through the Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council, and      share electric sector threat information through the      Electricity Sector Information Sharing and Analysis Center.      Passage of CISA will enhance these activities.         American Public Power Association (APPA); Canadian            Electric Association (CEA); Edison Electric Institute            (EEI); Electric Power Supply Association (EPSA);            GridWise Alliance; Large Public Power Council (LPPC);            National Rural Electric Cooperative Association            (NRECA); National Association of Regulatory Utility            Commissioners (NARUC); Transmission Access Policy Study            Group (TAPS).                                  ____                                 American Bankers Association,                                   Washington, DC, August 3, 2015.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Richard Burr,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators: I am writing on behalf of the members of the      American Bankers Association (ABA) to urge you to support the      Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA, S. 754) when it      is brought to the Senate floor, and to defeat any amendments      that would undermine this critically needed legislation.       CISA is bipartisan legislation introduced by Chairman      Richard Burr and Vice Chairman Dianne Feinstein, and reported      by a strong bipartisan 14-1 vote in the Senate Intelligence      Committee. It will enhance ongoing efforts by the private      sector and the Federal government to better protect our      critical infrastructure and protect Americans from all walks      of life from cyber criminals. Importantly, CISA facilitates      increased cyber intelligence information sharing between the      private and public sectors, and strikes the appropriate      balance between protecting consumer privacy and allowing      information sharing on serious threats to our nation's      critical infrastructure.       Cybersecurity is a top priority for the financial services      industry. Banks invest hundreds of millions of dollars every      year to put in place multiple layers of security to protect      sensitive data. Protecting customers has always been and will      remain our top priority and CISA will help us work more      effectively with the Federal government and other sectors of      the economy to better protect them from cyber attacks.       We urge you to support this important legislation and pass      it as soon as possible to better protect America's      cybersecurity infrastructure against current and future      threats.           Sincerely,     James C. Ballentine.                                  ____                                            Information Technology                                             Industry Council,                                    Washington, DC, July 23, 2015.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Democratic Leader Reid:      On behalf of the members of the Information Technology      Industry Council (ITI), I write to express our support for S.      754, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015      (CISA), and urge you to bring it to the Senate floor for      debate and vote. Given the importance of cybersecurity threat      information sharing to the high-tech industry, we will      consider scoring votes in support of CISA in our 114th      Congressional Voting Guide.       ITI members contribute to making the U.S. information and      communication technology (ICT) industry the strongest in the      world in innovative cybersecurity practices and solutions. We      firmly believe that passing legislation to help increase      voluntary cybersecurity threat information sharing between      the private sector and the federal government, and within the      private sector, is an important step Congress can take to      enable all stakeholders to address threats, stem losses, and      shield their systems, partners and customers. It is important      that the Senate act now to pass CISA and continue to move the      legislative process forward, so that Congress can reconcile      CISA with the House cybersecurity legislation, H.R. 1560, the      Protecting Cyber Networks Act, and H.R. 1731, the National      Cybersecurity Protection Advancement Act of 2015, and send a      bill to the president.       ITI believes that legislation to promote greater      cybersecurity threat information sharing should:       Affirm that cybersecurity threat information sharing be      voluntary;       Promote multidirectional cybersecurity threat information      sharing, allowing private-to-private, private-to-government      and government-to-private sharing relationships;       Include targeted liability protections;       Utilize a civilian agency interface for private-to-     government information sharing to which new liability      protections attach;       Promote technology-neutral mechanisms that enable      cybersecurity threat information to be shared in as close to      real-time as possible;       Require all entities to take reasonable steps to remove      personally identifiable information from information shared      through data minimization; and       Ensure private sector use of information received through      private-to-private sharing is only for cybersecurity      purposes, and government use of information received from the      private sector is limited to cybersecurity purposes and used      by law enforcement only:       For the investigation and prosecution of cyber crimes;       For the protection of individuals from the danger of death      or serious bodily harm and the investigation and prosecution      of crimes involving such danger; and       For the protection of minors from child pornography.       We appreciate the progress made by the Senate Intelligence      Committee to include provisions that would protect personally      identifiable information while also allowing for a      cybersecurity threat information sharing framework that will      enhance our ability to protect and defend our networks.       We look forward to working closely with you, your committee      leadership, and the House of Representatives to further      address outstanding issues in conference to ensure it adheres      to our above cybersecurity threat information sharing      principles. ITI remains committed to refining the legislation      and supporting a final product that can best achieve our goal      of promoting greater cybersecurity.           Sincerely,                                                 Dean C. Garfield,     President & CEO.                                  ____                                    BSA/The Software Alliance,                                    Washington, DC, July 21, 2015.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Senate Majority Leader,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Senate Minority Leader,     Washington, DC.       Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Reid: On      behalf of BSA/The Software Alliance, I write in support of      bringing the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015      (S. 754) to the Senate floor for a robust debate. Enactment      of bipartisan legislation that enhances voluntary cyber      threat information sharing while ensuring privacy protection      will be an important step in bolstering our nation's      cybersecurity capabilities.       Our members are on the front lines defending against cyber      attacks. Every day, bad actors are attacking networks to      extract valuable private and commercial information. We      believe it is now more important than ever to enact      legislation to break down the legal barriers that currently      discourage cyber threat information sharing between and among      the public and private sectors. Increased awareness will      enhance the ability of businesses, consumers, and critical      infrastructure to better defend themselves against attacks      and intrusions. We are confident that all of these goals can      be accomplished without comprising the privacy of an      individual's information.       I appreciate your leadership on moving this important      legislation forward to a successful outcome in the Senate. We      support this bipartisan effort and look forward to working      with you in the process to ultimately move a cyber threat      information sharing bill to the President's desk for      signature.           Sincerely,                                              Victoria A. Espinel,     President and CEO.                                  ____                                              Protecting America's                                     Cyber Networks Coalition,                                                    July 21, 2015.       To the Members of the United States Senate: The Protecting      America's Cyber Networks Coalition (the coalition) urges the      Senate to take up and pass S. 754, the Cybersecurity      Information Sharing Act (CISA) of 2015. Passing cybersecurity      information-sharing legislation is a top policy priority of      the coalition, which is a partnership of leading business      associations representing nearly every sector of the U.S.      economy.       In March, the Select Committee on Intelligence passed CISA      by a strong bipartisan vote (14-1). The Senate can build on      the momentum generated in the House to move CISA forward. In      April, the House passed two cybersecurity information-sharing      bills--H.R. 1560, the Protecting Cyber Networks Act (PCNA),      and H.R. 1731, the National Cybersecurity Protection      Advancement Act (NCPAA) of 2015--with robust majorities from      both parties and broad industry support.       Our organizations believe that Congress needs to send a      bill to the president that gives businesses legal certainty      that they have safe harbor against frivolous lawsuits when      voluntarily sharing and receiving threat indicators and      defensive measures in real time and taking actions to      mitigate cyberattacks.       The legislation also needs to offer protections related to      public disclosure, regulatory, and antitrust matters in order      to increase the timely exchange of information among public      and private entities. Coalition members also believe that      legislation needs to safeguard privacy and civil liberties      and establish appropriate roles for government agencies and      departments. CISA reflects sound compromises among many      stakeholders on these issues.       Recent cyber incidents underscore the need for legislation      to help businesses improve their awareness of cyber threats      and to enhance their protection and response capabilities in      collaboration with government entities. Cyberattacks aimed at      U.S. businesses and government bodies are increasingly being      launched from sophisticated hackers, organized crime, and      state-sponsored groups. These attacks are advancing in scope      and complexity.       The coalition is committed to working with lawmakers and      their staff members to get cybersecurity information-sharing      legislation quickly enacted to strengthen our national      security and the protection and resilience of U.S. industry.      Congressional action cannot come soon enough.

To the Members of the United States Senate: As the Senate      prepares to consider S. 754, the ``Cybersecurity Information      Sharing Act of 2015,'' the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the      world's largest business federation representing the      interests of more than three million businesses of all sizes,      sectors, and regions, as well as state and local chambers and      industry associations, and dedicated to promoting,      protecting, and defending America's free enterprise system,      writes to express our strong opposition to the adoption of      amendments that would weaken or overly complicate this      important bipartisan bill, including issues related to data      security, breach notification, or commercial privacy, which      are best addressed in other contexts.       The Chamber believes that all provisions of S. 754 must      support the important goal of protecting critical      infrastructure. Unrelated issues, such as data security,      breach notification, and commercial privacy legislation, have      not yet received any consideration in the committees of      jurisdiction and are not ready for consideration by the full      Senate. These sensitive topics should proceed through the      legislative process following regular order to ensure      complete and deliberate consideration separate from the      pending floor debate on cybersecurity information sharing      legislation.       Cybersecurity information sharing legislation meets a dire      national security need, and though the Chamber would like to      see meaningful data security, breach notification, and      commercial privacy legislation become law, for the benefit of      businesses and consumers alike, we are equally steadfast in      our belief that cybersecurity information sharing legislation      is important for national security and should be Congress's      immediate priority.       There are 47 separate state laws which deal directly with      data security and breach notification. The business community      has been working with members of Congress in both chambers      and on both sides of the aisle to find the right path toward      passage of a national data security and breach notification      law. However, much work remains to be done, as disagreement      continues regarding certain provisions which would be      contained in federal legislation. This disagreement is      evident in virtually every one of the significantly different      data security bills which have been introduced in the Senate      during the last several Congresses.       The Chamber has appreciated the opportunity to comment on      and offer edits to the various bills and looks forward to      working with their authors and cosponsors as legislation      works its way through the committee process. However, data      security legislation deserves its own due consideration and      deliberate debate, separate from the complicated and pressing      national security issue of cybersecurity information sharing.      For example, the House Energy and Commerce committee has held      multiple hearings on proposed legislation in addition to a      subcommittee markup and planned mark up at the full committee      level. Though there are issues which need to be resolved in      that legislation, the Chamber appreciates the process and      consideration given and that the bill has worked its way      through the proper channels.       Given the work that still needs to be done on data security      proposals, the Chamber urges you to keep them separate and      apart from cybersecurity information sharing legislation and      not rush to make changes to the current landscape of state      data security, data breach, and commercial privacy laws.      Doing so would have a fundamentally negative impact on a      broad segment of the American business community.           Sincerely,                                                  R. Bruce Josten.
