In addition, the House will consider H.R. 1734, the Improving Coal Combustion Residuals Regulation Act, sponsored by Representative David McKinley. This bill is essential to protect and create jobs.  If we do not act, the EPA will replace the existing successful State-based regulatory program with harmful new regulations that will cost hundreds of thousands of jobs and result in billions of dollars in burdensome costs for job creators.                              {time}  1245  The House will also consider H.R. 1599, the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act, sponsored by Representative Mike Pompeo. This bipartisan bill will ensure uniform national labeling of foods from genetically engineered plants. By addressing the patchwork of conflicting labeling laws, we will fix the growing problem of inconsistent and confusing information for consumers.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, the House is expected to consider the conference report for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016.
