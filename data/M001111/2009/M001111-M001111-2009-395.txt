REAUTHORIZATION OF NORTHWEST STRAITS MARINE                    CONSERVATION INITIATIVE ACT.       The Northwest Straits Marine Conservation Initiative Act      (title IV of Public Law 105-384; 112 Stat. 3458) is amended--       (1) in section 402, by striking ``(in this title referred      to as the `Commission')''; and       (2) by striking sections 403, 404, and 405 and inserting      the following:     ``SEC. 403. FINDINGS.       ``Congress makes the following findings:       ``(1) The marine waters and ecosystem of the Northwest      Straits in Puget Sound in the State of Washington represent a      unique resource of enormous environmental and economic value      to the people of the United States.       ``(2) During the 20th century, the environmental health of      the Northwest Straits declined dramatically as indicated by      impaired water quality, declines in marine wildlife, collapse      of harvestable marine species, loss of critical marine      habitats, ocean acidification, and sea level rise.       ``(3) At the start of the 21st century, the Northwest      Straits have been threatened by sea level rise, ocean      acidification, and other effects of climate change.       ``(4) In 1998, the Northwest Straits Marine Conservation      Initiative Act (title IV of Public Law 105-384) was enacted      to tap the unprecedented level of citizen stewardship      demonstrated in the Northwest Straits and create a mechanism      to mobilize public support and raise capacity for local      efforts to protect and restore the ecosystem of the Northwest      Straits.       ``(5) The Northwest Straits Marine Conservation Initiative      helps the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and      other Federal agencies with their marine missions by      fostering local interest in marine issues and involving      diverse groups of citizens.       ``(6) The Northwest Straits Marine Conservation Initiative      shares many of the same goals with the National Oceanic and      Atmospheric Administration, including fostering citizen      stewardship of marine resources, general ecosystem      management, and protecting Federally managed marine species.       ``(7) Ocean literacy and identification and removal of      marine debris projects are examples of on-going partnerships      between the Northwest Straits Marine Conservation Initiative      and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.     ``SEC. 404.
