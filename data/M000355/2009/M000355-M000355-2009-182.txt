 President, the reason for having a consent agreement is to expedite the process, do it more quickly. We have two competing consent agreements: one with six amendments and one with eight. Either one would move the process along. We will continue to talk about it and, hopefully, we can get this worked out in a way that is mutually satisfactory.                          ____________________
