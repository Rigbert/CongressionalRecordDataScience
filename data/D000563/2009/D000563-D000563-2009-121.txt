President, the majority side offered a unanimous consent, I believe on three successive days, to the Republican side, which they did not accept. Then yesterday the minority leader offered a variation on that, which is being considered at this moment by the majority leader. We are not prepared--I am not prepared to make a statement until the majority leader has made a final decision, having talked over the new offer with our members. The time may come. I cannot predict whether it will.  I do believe we have to work on it some more. In the meantime, I think the floor should be open for comments. I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.
