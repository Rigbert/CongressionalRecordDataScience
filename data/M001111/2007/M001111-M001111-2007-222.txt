 President, the bill that we are debating today comes at a critical time for our country.  As the connected world has brought about new competition from nations across the globe, the need for more Americans to be armed with a college education has become essential to the future of our economy.  And as a new generation enters a work world that demands highly skilled, highly trained workers, a college degree is necessary to open the door to a successful career.  But for too long the deck has been stacked against students seeking to build their careers and grow our economy.  College has become more expensive, interest rates have grown, and those students who are able to attend college often graduate saddled with debt and unable to buy a car or a house.  Today we have the opportunity to turn the tide in favor of students and ensure a stronger future for our country.
