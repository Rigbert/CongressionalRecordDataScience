President, ``We're just everyday people,'' said Linda Raymond of herself and her husband, Mike, of Woburn, MA. ``But we stopped a landfill from expanding and raised environmental awareness. Any community can do what we did.''  The Raymonds live in a blue-collar suburb of Boston where they both work in the public school system. Three years ago, while walking on a wooded trail in their neighborhood, they discovered that the city's landfill, which had been dormant for 15 years, was bustling with truck traffic. They had cause for alarm. Woburn is the setting of the events that were described in the book, ``A Civil Action.'' After rates of leukemia shot upward, local industries were sued in the 1980s for polluting the area water. The Raymonds, who had not previously been involved in environmental activism, sprang into action, determined to discover what was being planned for the landfill and how this would impact the community's public health.  The Raymonds' story was recounted in the January 25, 2004, issue of Parade magazine. ``When Linda Raymond contacted town officials to find out what was going on, she hit a stone wall. `I couldn't get a straight answer from anyone,' she says. `It was very frustrating.''' The article describes what the Raymonds did next: ``To get answers--and action--the Raymonds turned to a powerful set of tools: Federal and State Freedom of Information (FOI) laws.''  With the information the Raymonds collected under Massachusetts State FOI laws, they educated the community and held public officials accountable. Their actions ultimately led to the city shelving plans to expand the size of the landfill by over a million tons of waste--plans that had been developed without public knowledge or debate, and which had not been evaluated for environmental or health impacts.  The Raymonds' triumph highlights the power of Government sunshine laws. It also demonstrates one of the most common uses of such laws by citizens and local community groups--that is, reliance on FOI laws to ensure that schools, neighborhoods and local industries are safe and secure. Our FOI laws are in danger, however, especially in the post-9/11 era. As noted by Parade, ``Some journalists and civil liberties defenders believe that fences have gone up around FOI laws in the aftermath of 9/11. `Freedom of Information is under threat,' says Woburn Daily Times Chronicle columnist Marie Coady. `Across the country, it's becoming harder to access documents.'''  One of the most significant threats to American citizens' right to know about health and safety issues was enacted by Congress in 2002 in the form of a broad exemption to the Federal sunshine law, the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA. The Homeland Security Act of 2002, HSA, contained a subtitle purportedly designed to protect ``critical infrastructure information.'' That broadly defined term applies to information regarding a variety of facilities--such as privately operated power plants, bridges, dams, ports, or chemical plants--that might be targeted for a terrorist attack. In exchange for the cooperation of private companies in sharing information with the government regarding vulnerabilities in the Nation's critical infrastructure, those companies would not have to share certain information with the public.  Encouraging cooperation between the private sector and the Government to keep our critical infrastructure systems safe from terrorist attacks is a goal we all support. Unfortunately, rather than increasing security by encouraging private sector disclosure to the Government, the law guts FOIA at the expense of our national security and public health.  The HSA created a new FOIA exemption for ``critical infrastructure information.'' In HSA negotiations, House Republicans and the administration promoted legislative language that they described as necessary to encourage the owners of such facilities to identify vulnerabilities in their operations and share that information with the Department of Homeland Security, DHS. The stated goal was to ensure that steps could be taken to ensure the facilities' protection and proper functioning.  In fact, such descriptions of the legislation were disingenuous. These provisions, which were eventually enacted in the HSA, shield from FOIA almost any voluntarily submitted document stamped by the facility owner as ``critical infrastructure.'' This is true no matter how tangential the content of that document may be to the actual security of a facility. The law effectively allows companies to hide information about public health and safety from American citizens simply by submitting it to DHS. The enacted provisions were called ``deeply flawed'' by Mark Tapscott of the Heritage Foundation. He argued that the ``loophole'' created by the law ``could be manipulated by clever corporate and government operators to hide endless varieties of potentially embarrassing and/or criminal information from public view.''  In addition, under the HSA, disclosure by private facilities to DHS neither obligates the private company to address the vulnerability, nor requires DHS to fix the problem. For example, in the case of a chemical spill, the law bars the Government from disclosing information without the written consent of the company that caused the pollution. As the Washington Post editorialized on February 10, 2003, ``A company might preempt environmental regulators by `voluntarily' divulging incriminating material, thereby making it unavailable to anyone else.''  Last March, I introduced a bill to repeal this dangerously broad FOIA exemption and to replace it with a balanced measure that will protect our Nation's critical infrastructure without obliterating public oversight. The Restoration of Freedom of Information Act--Restore FOIA--would protect legitimate records pertaining to critical infrastructure safety, but would remove the free pass given by the HSA to industry for any information that a facility chooses to label ``critical infrastructure.''  Perhaps most important to people like the Raymonds, who relied on StateFOI laws to obtain information on the Woburn landfill, the Restore FOIA bill also allows local authorities to apply their own sunshine laws. Unlike the provisions of the HSA, the Restore FOIA bill does not preempt any State or local disclosure laws for information obtained outside the Department of Homeland Security. Likewise, it does not restrict the use of such information by State agencies.  By enacting Restore FOIA, we can protect the Nation's critical infrastructure without cutting the public out of the loop. James Madison said, ``A popular government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or tragedy or perhaps both.'' I urge my colleagues to support Restore FOIA so that this basic and fundamental principle is upheld.  I ask unanimous consent that the Parade article describing the Rayburns fight for open and accountable Government be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From Parade Magazine, Jan. 25, 2004]                      How They Uncovered the Truth                          (By Micah Morrison)       At first glance, they don't look like activists. Mike and      Linda Raymond of Woburn, Mass., a blue-collar community north      of Boston, are both in their mid-50s. They have been married      35 years, with two grown sons and four grandchildren. Mike      teaches computer and fitness classes at the local high      school. Linda is a secretary with the public school system.      But these self-described ``everyday working people'' took on      City Hall in a battle to protect their community.       Family pictures are on proud display in the Raymonds'      comfortable home on North Maple Street in one of Woburn's      many close-knit neighborhoods. ``It's a good place to raise      kids,'' Mike Raymond says of his town. ``It has excellent      schools and a good health-care system.'' Yet, on an autumn      day three years ago, the Raymonds discovered something about      their community that troubled them deeply.       The Raymonds took a walk down the wooden path at the end of      their street. Past small ponds and a rise of trees, they came      upon an astonishing sight: Trucks loaded with debris were      rumbling up the 60-foot slopes at the Woburn Landfill. The      40-acre mountain of trash had been dormant for more than 15      years--now, mysteriously, it was growing again.       ``I worried,'' Linda Raymond recalls. ``Who had opened the      landfill? Was it toxic? Why hadn't people in the neighborhood      been told?''       Given Woburn's history, the Raymonds had reason for      concern. In the 1980s, the town was rocked by a lawsuit      against local industries claiming that water pollution had      led to an increase in leukemia deaths. The story was revived      in the '90s with the book and movie A Civil Action. Today,      Woburn Mayor John Curran says the city ``has worked hard to      overcome the Civil Action stigma. Our drinking water has been      of the highest quality for over 20 years.''       Getting no answers. But when Linda Raymond contacted town      officials to find out what was going on, she hit a stone      wall. ``I couldn't get a straight answer from anyone,'' she      says. ``It was very frustrating.'' So, to get answers--and      action--the Raymonds turned to a powerful set of tools:      federal and state Freedom of Information (FOI) laws.       As the Raymonds discovered, FOI requests can be made by      anyone. ``There are a million ways the public can use FOI      laws,'' says Robert Freeman of the New York State Committee      on Open Government. ``When property taxes are raised, you can      review the assessment rolls to ensure that you've been      treated fairly. You can find out if your child's teacher is      really certified to teach math. You can find out if a      restaurant has health-code violations.''       First steps. After researching FOI laws, Linda Raymond      figured that her first letter should go to the Massachusetts      Department of Environmental Protection. She wrote asking for      ``any and all documents pertaining to the Woburn Landfill,''      noting that she was making the request under the state's      Freedom of Information laws. The agency quickly complied,      inviting Linda to come review the files.       Speeky cooperation from government agencies is not always      the norm. ``There will be delays,'' Linda says. ``Something      you have to be persistent. And it's important to know your      rights--including the right to an appeal when documents are      denied.''       Looking over the files, Linda made some important      discoveries. Under state law, the city was required to bring      in material to ``cap'' the landfill and close it with a      protective lining of topsoil, loam and netting. She found      that, to pay for the multimillion-dollar project, Woburn had      hired a private contractor who was hauling in soil and debris      from construction sites to cover the capping costs. In      reading through the documents, Linda also discovered that the      bottom of the landfill did not have a protective lining.       That's when the Raymonds really began to worry, because the      landfill sits on top of a watershed feeding into the      nearby Aberjona River. ``We found medical waste, coal ash,      construction debris and oil seeping into the wetlands,''      Mike recalls. Were contaminants polluting the watershed?       Digging deeper. The Raymonds zeroed in with more specific      requests. A second FOI petition went to the Woburn city clerk      for the contract the town had signed with the waste-     management firm. The response brought some startling news:      ``The original contract called for 300,000 tons of waste to      be brought in,'' Mike explains, ``but the town was looking to      expand the landfill by another million tons.''       A third request, to the Woburn Board of Health, brought      documents revealing that the former mayor had quietly      assembled a panel to advise him on landfill issues, with no      public input. The documents also showed discussions of plans      for the future of the site, including turning it into a      picnic area or police shooting range.       ``We got very angry,'' Linda recalls. ``We felt the      politicians were making plans without anyone knowing about      it. And there were possible health risks.''       Taking action. The Raymonds swung into action. They      organized their neighbors, contacted the media and raised the      issue at public meetings. ``The documents we obtained under      FOI educated us,'' Linda says. ``And we in turn were able to      educate the community.''       At first, their aims were modest. ``We wanted to postpone      the capping until the landfill could be tested and deemed      environmentally safe,'' Mike says. But the Raymonds had hit a      nerve. Under mounting pressure, plans for the landfill were      shelved.       ``Without FOI laws,'' Linda says, ``we couldn't have done      it.''       A threat to access? Next time, it might be more difficult.      Some journalists and civil liberties defenders believe that      fences have gone up around FOI laws in the aftermath of 9/11.      ``Freedom of Information is under threat,'' said Woburn Daily      Times Chronicle columnist Marie Coady. ``Across the country,      it's becoming harder to access documents.''       On the federal level, ``there has been a major change in      atmosphere since 9/11,'' says Lucy Dalglish, executive      director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.      Federal officials ``are not releasing information they would      have provided five years ago.''       Still, thousands of Freedom of Information requests      continue to be routinely processed every year. And with legal      challenges under way, ultimately the courts will decide      whether the new restrictions are a reasonable response to a      changed world.       The Raymonds say they'll keep using FOI laws. Although the      state of Massachusetts has given the Woburn Landfill a clean      bill of health, the couple plan to closely watch the results      of the elaborate pollution-monitoring procedures established      at the site.       ``We're just everyday people,'' Linda says, ``but we      stopped a landfill from expanding and raised environmental      awareness. Any community can do what we did.''       Mike agrees. He cites his favorite quote, from      anthropologist Margaret Mead: ``Never doubt that a small      group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world;      indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.''                    a powerful tool everyone can use       It's not difficult to use Freedom of Information laws, and      there's no telling what you might turn up. Here are some tips      on getting the information you want:       Research First.--Who has the information you're seeking?      Identify your targets. Ask your local librarian for help.      Check municipal, state and federal Web sites. Most states      have a designated office to help with public-records      searches. Federal agencies have FOI officers. The Reporters      Committee for Freedom of the Press (www.rcfp.org) publishes      guides to using state and federal Freedom of Information      laws.       Put It in Writing.--While some states allow oral requests,      it's best to write a short letter stating what information      you're seeking. Note that you're making the request under a      State or Federal Freedom of Information statute. Be as      specific as possible. The Reporters Committee for Freedom      of the Press has a helpful sample letter at its Web site.       Show Them the Money.--Often there will be a photocopying      fee and other costs related to your request. You can speed      the process by stating in your letter how much you're willing      to pay and asking to be notified if costs exceed that amount.      You also can request a fee waiver. In some cases, you can go      to a government office to view the documents and do your own      copying.       Exemptions and Appeals.--Many public records are exempt      from FOI laws. The U.S. Congress did not make itself or the      courts subject to the statute. Most documents impacting      minors, criminal investigations, trade secrets and personal      privacy are off-limits. But you also may be denied documents      that you have a right to see. If you are denied access, be      sure to use the FOI appeals process. A brief letter to the      agency head requesting a review of the decision will get the      ball rolling. Meanwhile, make photocopies of everything you      send out. Above all, be patient and persistent. You may be      pleasantly surprised!                      There's More You Can Discover        There's a common belief that FOI laws are used mainly in      environmental cases. Not true. Here are examples of other      uses of this powerful tool:       In Grand Rapids, MI, a high school government class used      Freedom of Information laws to expose flaws in the county's      jury-selection system.        In Fulton, MO, a concerned citizen used State open-     government laws--kissing cousins to FOI statutes--to force      disclosure of town-council discussion about building a golf      course at taxpayer expense.        In Washington, D.C., a women used FOI laws to find out      about the ownership of some drug-infested, abandoned      buildings. The owner? The District of Columbia government!        The U.S. Department of Agriculture--as a result of an FOI      request--revealed accounts of the mistreatment of circus      elephants.                          ____________________
