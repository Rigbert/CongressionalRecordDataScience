Speaker, today I introduce the ``Sentencing Fairness and Equity Restoration Act of 2006,'' to restore uniformity to Federal sentencing and reaffirm Congress' commitment to protecting our Nation's children.  This legislation addresses the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), which invalidated the mandatory sentencing requirement of the Sentencing Guidelines (18 U.S.C. section 3553(b)(1)), and struck down the de novo standard for appellate review of any downward departures in 18 U.S.C. Section 3742(e), which was enacted as part of the PROTECT Act in 2003.  On March 13, 2006, the U.S. Sentencing Commission issued its report on Booker's impact on Federal sentencing. The Sentencing Commission's report shows that unrestrained judicial discretion has undermined the very purposes of the Sentencing Reform Act, and jeopardizes the basic precept of our Federal court system that all defendants should be treated equally under the law.  The Federal Sentencing Guidelines are now advisory in all cases, even in those where they can be applied without any judicial fact-finding. Federal judges are now able to impose sentences outside the prescribed ranges, thereby undermining the very purpose of the Sentencing Reform Act to ``provide certainty and fairness in meeting the purposes of sentencing, avoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar criminal conduct.''  The PROTECT Act ensured that appropriate sentences would be administered to sex offenders, pedophiles, child pornographers, and those who prey on our children. Thus, I am troubled that the Commission's Report shows that these fundamental sentencing reforms have been effectively eliminated. That is neither good nor acceptable for justice and public safety.  Most alarming is the dramatic increase in departure rates for sex offenses including sexual abuse of a minor, sexual exploitation of a minor, and possession or trafficking in child pornography. Downward departures increased for these offenses to levels that had not existed since enactment of the PROTECT Act in 2003.  The Sentencing Commission's report shows that in the last year there has been a six-fold increase in below guideline range sentences for defendants convicted of sexual abuse of a minor, a five-fold increase in below guideline range sentences for defendants convicted of sexual exploitation of a child, a 50 percent increase in below guideline range sentences for defendants convicted of sexual contact of a minor, trafficking in child pornography, and possession of child pornography.  The report also shows an increase in overall departure rates for nearly all Federal offenses across all Federal jurisdictions, including drug trafficking offenses, firearms offenses, theft and fraud offenses, and immigration offenses. These four offense types comprise 75 percent of all Federal cases annually. According to current sentencing data, the rate of downward departures has not improved.  Shortly after the release of the Booker report, I expressed my concern for the increase in departures rates, particularly for sexual offenses, and promised a legislative response. The Sentencing Fairness and Equity Restoration Act directs the courts to impose a sentence at the minimum of the guideline range up to the statutory maximum and reinstates de novo review for all downward departures. The act also requires the Attorney General to create and implement a new policy for the filing of motions for departure for substantial assistance and report this policy to Congress within 180 days of enactment of the bill.  Mr. Speaker, I am introducing this legislation to restore equity in Federal sentencing and to ensure that tough sentences are handed out to all defendants, including sex offenders.       The Sentencing Fairness and Equity Restoration Act of 2006                      SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS       Section 1. Short Title. This section provides that the Act      may be cited as the ``Sentencing Fairness and Equity      Restoration Act of 2006.''       Section 2. Reaffirmation of Intent of Congress in the      Sentencing Reform Act of 1984.       Subsection (a). This subsection amends section 3553(b)(1)      of title 18 to address the Supreme Court's holding in United      States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005). The Booker court ruled      that the Sixth Amendment applies to the federal Sentencing      Guidelines and noted that the Sixth Amendment implications      hinged on the mandatory nature of the Guidelines, which are      dependent on judicial fact-finding. Id. at 232. In a separate      opinion, the Court excised the provision in section 3553(b)      that instructed the court to ``impose a sentence of the kind,      and within the range'' provided by the Guidelines.       This subsection amends the first sentence of section      3553(b)(1) to instruct that the sentencing court may not      impose a sentence below the minimum of the guideline range      unless the court finds the existence of a mitigating      circumstance that is not adequately addressed by the      Sentencing Guidelines. The amendment also instructs that the      court may impose a sentence above the minimum of the      guideline range up to the statutory maximum sentence.       Subsection (a) replaces the mandatory provision excised by      the Court with a requirement that the court adhere to only      the minimum of the guideline range established by the      Sentencing Commission. This requirement, however, is not      mandatory because the court may still depart from the minimum      of the range in certain instances.       Subsection (a) also reaffirms Congress' intent in the      Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 that the maximum sentence a      judge may impose is the statutory maximum rather than the      Guideline maximum. The Booker Court reasoned that because      section 3553(b)(1) required courts to adhere to the      sentencing guidelines, the ``maximum'' sentence authorized by      law was, in fact, the Guideline maximum and not the statutory      maximum. Amended section 3553(b)(1) removes the mandatory      requirement from the sentencing statute. Thus, the court is      not bound by the Guideline maximum and may impose a sentence      up to the maximum authorized by statute.       Subsection (a) makes identical revisions to section      3553(b)(2).       Subsection (b). This subsection amends section 3553(c) to      conform with subsection (a). Section 3553( c) continues to      require the court to state for the record its reasons for      imposing a particular sentence. The amendment does not change      the ability of the court to receive information in camera      pursuant to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and      requires the court to indicate for the record when such in      camera information is received and relied upon for sentencing      purposes. Finally, this subsection maintains current language      regarding restitution and dissemination of sentencing      transcripts.       Subsection (c). This subsection amends section 3742(e) of      title 18 to re-establish the de novo appellate review      standard for downward departures. In Booker, the Court also      excised the de novo appellate review standard, which was      enacted as part of the PROTECT Act, based upon its rationale      that this section ``contains critical cross-references to the      (now excised) Sec. 3553(b)(1) and consequently must be      severed and excised for similar reasons.'' Id. at 247. The      Court, however, provides no nexus between the de novo      appellate standard of review and the Sixth Amendment right to      a jury for sentencing. Moreover, having excised the mandatory      sentencing provision in Sec. 3553(b)(I), the cross-reference      to that section in Sec. 3742(e) carries no Sixth Amendment      implications. Section 3742(e) merely outlines the criteria      appellate courts use to review sentences.       Subsection (c) reasserts Congress' intent to reign in the      increasing rate of reduced sentences, particularly for sexual      offenses, expressed in the PROTECT Act. Pursuant to this      amendment, the appellate courts will continue to review      sentences below the minimum of the range de novo while      maintaining Booker's reasonableness standard for all other      sentencing appeals.       Section 3. Uniform National Standards for Downward      Departures for Substantial Assistance. A significant result      of the Booker decision is the spike in downward departures      for substantial assistance imposed by the courts in the      absence of a government motion. Substantial assistance      motions are filed in instances where the defendant has      provided the government with information relating to another      investigation or prosecution. In reviewing this increase in      sua sponte departures, the committee has learned that the      government's standards for these motions vary from district      to district, creating the potential for disparate treatment      of similarly situated defendants.       This section, therefore, directs the Attorney General to      implement a uniform policy for departure motions for      substantial assistance, including the definition of      substantial assistance in the investigation, the process for      determining whether departure is warranted, and the criteria      for determining the extent of departure. The amendment      instructs the Attorney General to report the policy to      Congress within 180 days of enactment of this Act.       Section 4. Assuring Judicial Administrative      Responsibilities are Performed by the     Judicial Branch. This section amends section 994(w) of title      28, which governs the reporting requirements of the federal      district courts to the U.S. Sentencing Commission. This      amendment simply clarifies that the reporting required by      this section is to be completed by the judicial branch and      may not be delegated to the executive branch.                          ____________________
