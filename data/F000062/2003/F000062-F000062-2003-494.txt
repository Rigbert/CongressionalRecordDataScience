 President, here is an explanation of what this bill does: It applies anti-fraud and anti-manipulation authority to all exempt commodity transactions--an exempt commodity is a commodity which is not financial and not agricultural and mainly includes energy and metals.  The bill sets up two classes of swaps. For those made between ``sophisticated persons,'' basically institutions and wealthy individuals, that are not entered into on a ``trading facility''--for example, an exchange--anti-fraud and anti-manipulation provisions apply and wash trades are prohibited.  The following regulations would apply to all swaps made on an ``electronic trading facility'' and a ``dealer market'', which includes dealers who buy and sell swaps in exempt commodities, and the entity on which the swap takes place: anti-fraud and anti-manipulation provisions and the prohibition of wash trades apply; if the entity on which the swap takes place serves a pricing or price discovery function, increased notice, reporting, bookkeeping, and other transparency requirements; and the requirement to maintain sufficient capital commensurate with the risk associated with the swap;  Except for the anti-fraud and anti-manipulation provisions, the CFTC has the discretion to tailor the above requirements to fit the character and financial risk involved with the swap or entity. While the CFTC could require daily public disclosure of trading data like open and closing prices, similar to the requirements of futures exchanges, it could not require real-time publication of proprietary trading information or prohibit an entity from selling their data.  The CFTC may allow entities to meet certain self-regulatory responsibilities- as provided in a list of ``core principles.'' If an entity chose to become aself-regulator, these core principles would obligate the entity to monitor trading to prevent fraud and manipulation as well as assure that its other regulatory obligations are met.  The penalties for manipulation are greatly increased. The civil monetary penalty for manipulation is increased from $100,000 to $1 million. Wash trades are subject to the monetary civil penalty for each violation, and imprisonment up to 10 years.  The FERC is required to improve communications with other Federal regulatory agencies. A shortcoming in the main anti-fraud provision of the CEA is also corrected by allowing CFTC enforcement of fraud to apply to instances of either defrauding a person for oneself or on behalf of others.  It requires the FERC and the CFTC to meet quarterly and discuss how energy derivative markets are functioning and affecting energy deliveries.  It grants the FERC the authority to use monetary penalties on companies that don't comply with requests for information. It is essentially the same authority that the SEC has.  It makes it easier for FERC to hire the necessary outside help they need including accountants, lawyers, and investigators for investigative purposes.  It eliminates the requirement that FERC receive approval from the Office of Management and Budget before launching an investigation or price discovery of electricity or natural gas markets involving more than 10 companies.  It increases the penalty amounts to $1 million instead of the current $5,000 for violations of the Federal Power Act and the Natural Gas Act; five years instead of the current two for violations of the statute; and, $50,000 per violation per day instead of the current $500 for violations of rules or orders under the Federal Power Act and Natural Gas Act.  The Commission's authority to impose civil penalties is broadened to all sections of Part II of the Federal Power Act and the penalty amount is increased from $10,000 to $50,000 per violation per day.  It modifies Section 206 of the Federal Power Act to allow for an earlier refund effective date to increase the opportunity for refunds as a deterrent to fraudulent and manipulative behavior in the energy markets.  This legislation is not going to do anything to change what happened in California and the West. But it does provide the necessary authority for the CFTC and FERC which will help protect against another energy crisis.  When regulatory agencies have the will but not the authority to regulate, Congress must step in and ensure that our regulators have the necessary tools. Unfortunately, sometimes an agency has neither. In this case I am glad to have the support of FERC and I hope that the CFTC will reconsider and support this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
