 President, what America is facing today is nothing short of an epidemic. Meth is cheap and easily manufactured from commonly available chemicals. Today, with Senator Feinstein, we are striking at the root of the problem: chemical suppliers who sell chemicals to illegal meth labs. The harder it is for criminal chemists to get the raw material to make meth, the more difficult it will be to produce. This in turn will make it more expensive. And this will reduce consumption. And that will help keep our kids alive a little longer.  With the rapid increase of meth use among young people, unless we act quickly--and decisively--to pass this bill, I fear for an entire generation of Americans. Mr. President, in the 1980's, we almost lost a generation to crack and power cocaine. Let's not get that close to the edge again.                                 ______      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Inouye):  S. 1608. A bill to extend the applicability of certain regulatory authority under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs. EXTENSION OF THE INDIAN SELF-DETERMINATION CONTRACT REFORM ACT OF 1994  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a measure that would extend for 60 days the authority Congress delegated in 1994 to the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to promulgate regulations implementing the Indian Self-Determination Contract Reform Act of 1994.  Under longstanding Federal-Indian policies favoring tribal self-determination, the United States has encouraged native American tribal governments and tribal organizations to assume the responsibility of carrying out essential governmental services previously performed by Federal employees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs [BIA] and the Indian Health Service [IHS]. Indian tribes have been waiting since 1988 for regulations that would guide the implementation of the act. The bill I am introducing today would elongate that delay by an additional 60 days, extending the authority to issue final regulations from April 25, 1996 to June 25, 1996.  Despite my initial hesitancy to sponsor such an extension, tribal governments have now convinced me of the need for this 60-day extension. The United South and Eastern Tribes, the National Congress of American Indians, and numerous tribal governments have asked me to support the extension. I respect their judgment and ask that the Congress honor their request. In addition, several days ago the Senate referred executive communication No. 1959 to the Committee on Indian Affairs, which I chair. EC 1959 forwards the request of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of the Interior that Congress enact the bill I am introducing today. The Departments argue that a 60-day extension is needed because winter weather conditions and recent Federal employee furloughs related to the budget impasse between the Congress and the administration have made it impossible for the administration to comply with the statutory deadline.  I remain, however, very concerned that further delay in issuing the regulations will erode the power Congress placed with Indian tribes in the negotiated rulemaking provisions of the 1994 act. A 60-day delay could potentially allow the Federal agencies more time to undermine tribal provisions in the negotiated regulations that were published in proposed form in late January.  My concern is based on history. On three occasions, the Congress has had to enact precise statutory directives--in 1988, 1990, and in 1994--to overcome the two Departments' entrenched resistance to the requirements in the original act. When, for example, in 1988 the two Secretaries were given a statutory 10-month timeframe to promulgate regulations with tribal participation, they cut off all tribal input and began a delaying process that extended to 6 years. After 6 years--not 10 months--the Clinton administration released proposed regulations in 1994 that sought in every conceivable way to retard, rather than enhance, tribal self-determination contracting. The Congress responded by promptly enacting the Indian Self-Determination Contract Reform Act of 1994. That act mandated, for the first time in the history of Federal-Indian legislation, that tribal governments be directly involved in the process of drafting the proposed regulations through a negotiated rulemaking format rather than the traditional process of being ``consulted'' on drafts prepared by Federal officials.  In the 1994 act, the Congress accepted the administration's request that the 12-month regulatory period, originally proposed by the Senate, be enlarged to 18 months. That 18-month period ends on April 25, 1996. The Clinton administration assured the Congress that this would be ample time to get the job done.  I am told that the proposed regulations prepared by the joint Federal-Tribal negotiated rulemaking committee were largely completed and ready for publication in October 1995. However, the draft regulations languished in the Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, for over 3 months before they were finally released for publication in the Federal Register on January 24, 1996. Soon after publication, the administration began to mount pressure for an extension.  Mr. President, I am very concerned about reports that OMB officials recently raised dozens of questions and issues after the joint Federal-Tribal negotiated rulemaking committee had finalized the proposed regulations. This is particularly disturbing, because I and other authors of the 1994 act expected the entire administration, including the OMB, to raise its concerns and questions during the negotiated rulemaking committee's deliberations with the Indian tribes, not afterward. What is most troubling to me, is that tribal representatives on the joint Federal-Tribal negotiated rulemaking committee have informed me that many of these OMB questions reflected a basic lack of understanding of the act and the special statutory and historic context in which these regulations have been developed. It appears that the administration's negotiators did not release these OMB questions to the tribal representatives until late last month. The questions are of the type that could easily have been addressed during the Federal-Tribal negotiated rulemaking process. I am disturbed that the OMB has apparently elected not to participate directly in the negotiations, where the OMB officials could have openly aired their concerns and afforded tribal government representatives an opportunity to respond.  The apparent risk associated with extending the deadline for final promulgation of the regulations is that the OMB, and their allies within the Departments, will have more time to unilaterally undo much of what the joint Federal-Tribal negotiated rulemaking committee has achieved to date as a result of government-to-government negotiations, and more time to resolve, against the Indian tribes, the remaining areas in dispute set forth in the January 24, 1996, notice of proposed rulemaking.  I am deeply concerned that the Departments' resistance to the act hasundercut the negotiated rulemaking process, as evidenced by the nature of the issues remaining in dispute. For instance, neither Department wants to use the negotiated rulemaking process to develop their agency procedures, despite the law's directive that they do so. The Interior Department insists on incomprehensible organizational conflict-of-interest provisions which can only serve to undermine the goal of tribal self-determination. The Interior Department insists that a standard contract renewal with no material change must be processed through the full contract application and declination process even though that is plainly not what Congress intended--as the IHS, to its credit, does recognize. The Departments both seek to preserve the right to impose on tribes unpublished requirements, despite the clear statutory prohibitions against doing so. And perhaps most distressingly, the Departments have resisted placing any language in the new regulations that would state that Federal laws and regulations will be interpreted liberally for the benefit of the Indian tribes in order to facilitate contracting activities under the act. This is the position of the Departments despite the fact that this language is a well-settled U.S. Supreme Court rule of statutory construction that applies to all remedial Indian legislation.  To sum it up, Mr. President, I and other Members of Congress in 1994 were persuaded by the Indian tribes to set a hard and fast publication deadline of April 25, 1996 in response to the delays tribes had experienced in getting final regulations under the 1988 amendments. Likewise, at the request of the Indian tribes, Congress mandated that the proposed regulations be developed by a joint, tribal-Federal negotiated rulemaking committee. Assuming substantial tribal involvement in that committee, and good faith on the part of the administration, it would be reasonable to expect that these timeframes could be met. But apparently, 60 more days is needed. Accordingly, I will support the extension with the warning to the administration that I do not want to learn at some later date that the expanded timeframe has allowed the administration additional advantage over tribal governments in the negotiation of the final regulations.  Despite my reservations, I remain hopeful that the ongoing negotiated rulemaking process can be successfully concluded within the extended timeframe. But the Departments and the OMB must commit themselves to this process, just as the Indian tribes have done, and they must resist the temptation to slide back into the paternalistic, adversarial, and bureaucratic thinking that has compelled the Congress since 1988 to micromanage the Departments in the area of tribal self-determination contracting.  I thank my friend, Senator Inouye, for joining with me as an original cosponsor of the bill. I urge my colleagues to support the 60-day extension and to join me in ensuring that the administration does not, by reason of the 60-day delay, gain any negotiation advantage over the Indian tribes.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1608       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF APPLICABILITY OF CERTAIN REGULATORY                    AUTHORITY.       Section 107(a)(2)(B) of the Indian Self-Determination and      Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450k(a)(2)(B)) is amended      by striking ``18 months'' and inserting ``20 months''.                                 ______      By
