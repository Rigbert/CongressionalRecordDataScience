Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4365, the Children's Health Act of 2000. This comprehensive measure will make a significant difference in the lives of millions of children and families by boosting biomedical and clinical research on a range of conditions and diseases that afflict children with particular severity and by improving access to treatment. As a member of the Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Health and the Environment, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to work closely with our chairman, Mike Bilirakis, who has shown great leadership on this legislation.  I am especially pleased and grateful that the final version of this bill includes provisions strengthening the National Institutes of Health's focus on Duchenne muscular dystrophy research. This will be the first time that Duchenne muscular dystrophy is mentioned in the Public Health Service Act.  I have seen the human face of this disease and the toll that it takes on children and families. Some time ago, I had the opportunity to visit with Don and Joyce Carpenter of Kalamazoo, MI, and their young and courageous son, Ben. Ben suffers from Duchenne muscular dystrophy. From them I learned that Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common and the most catastrophic form of genetic childhood disease. Sadly, it generally kills its victims in their late teens or early 20's.  For decades, the only drug treatment known to somewhat alter the course of the disease in the use of steroids--whose serious side effects are well-known. We've simply got to do better. We have to find a way to prevent this devastating disorder in the first place--perhaps through the promise of gene therapy. And until we learn how to prevent it, we've got to learn how to treat it more effectively.  I urge every Member of Congress to join me in voting for this bill and giving hope to Don and Joyce and Ben Carpenter and the many like them across this Nation and world. We can work miracles when we really try.
