President, if the Senator will yield, the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, and I are waiting to speak about the tragic death of Marla Ruzicka over the weekend in the form of eulogies. I don't want to interrupt the work of the distinguished senior Senator from Virginia, but when he is finished I am going to seek the floor--both Senator Boxer and I--to give the eulogies, which will not take a great deal of time, but they are important.
