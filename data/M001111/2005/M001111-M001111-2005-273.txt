 I think it goes to the point of exactly why we are seeing such a tremendous shortfall in the VA today--because of the types of injuries our returning soldiers are having.  I welcome my colleague's cosponsorship, and I agree we do need to look at 2006. We will work with her and the VA Secretary and all Senators on making up the shortfall. But we are here today with the Murray amendment because there has been some confusion in the Senate about how much aid we are going to send to the Veterans Department. We have heard a lot of numbers thrown around and a lot of discussion, but I think why I am here today and why it is so critical is because in the early morning hours just before our July 4 recess, some Senate leaders moved we lay down in deference to the House of Representatives' lower number.  I think in the Senate we need to say there is no confusion. On a unanimous vote we supported $1.5 billion.
