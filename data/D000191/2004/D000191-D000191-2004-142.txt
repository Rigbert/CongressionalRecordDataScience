Speaker, I come from a State that back when we were fighting NAFTA, I was pretty lonely up there in the Pacific Northwest, and we were told, what is wrong with you, you are going to be a major beneficiary. The State of Oregon on the Pacific Rim, strategically perched just north of Mexico and south of Canada, your State, your people are going to be a big winner, but it turns out that we are one of the top 10 losers under NAFTA.  As the gentleman alluded earlier, lumber and wood products are suffering because of subsidized Canadian lumber and wood products. The paper industry is seeing paper flee overseas to countries that do not observe any environmental practices or controls, and then a number of other more high-tech industries have gone elsewhere.  I sat next to a fellow who worked for Hewlett-Packard on the plane flying home a week ago, Hewlett-Packard in Corvallis. I said, what do you do? He said, I work in the ink jet division. I do engineering, design, and development. I said, God, that is really great. I am glad to see you are still working there. I was worried about those jobs. He said, well, no, actually, he said, my entire division was exported to Bangalore, India, last year. I am just working on a special project here in the United States, but my division is gone. The next design development, the next ink jet technology is going to come from Bangalore, India. He said they can get an engineer there for 8 to $10,000 bucks a year.  Are we telling Americans they should go to college for 4 years, incur $50,000 of debt to get a degree in engineering technology or whatever it is going to cost them to do it, and then they are going to work for $8,000 a year, raise a family, buy a home and all the other things that are a part of the American Dream? These people are killing the American Dream. That is what they are doing.  There are a few people who are going to profit from it, and those are the people that support them; and they are so insulated from it some of them do not even realize what they are doing to destroy our country.  One other point. Sometimes that is not even enough to say to an American, 4-year, 6-year degree, you are going to compete with some guy or woman from Indian who worked for $8,000. Sometimes it is not enought. You know what we also do? We are subsidizing, the American taxpayers, through our taxes, are subsidizing the export of these jobs. Here is a short list:  Motorola laid off 42,900 workers while investing $3.4 billion in China with a $190 million taxpayers subsidy.                              {time}  2145  In General Electric, 260,000 U.S. workers, while investing $1.5 billion in China, $2.5 billion in corporate subsidies paid for by U.S. taxpayers. Insult to injury. Steal their jobs, destroy the economic future of our country, our kids and our grandkids, and charge us to do it. That is what they are doing toaverage wage-earning Americans, because most of this is coming out of Social Security wages, out of payroll taxes.
