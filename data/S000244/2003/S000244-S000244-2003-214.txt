Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Chairman, I really regret that the gentlewoman from California was not interested in the compromise and clarification that I proposed, where we would allow elected district attorneys to continue to utilize the State court, but not private citizens with private attorney general actions which are authorized only in California and no place else. One of these private attorney general actions should not set national legal and economic policy. When you have an elected official like a district attorney or a State attorney general, that is one thing, because these people represent the public and it is their job to do this. When you have a private citizen in a procedure that has not been adopted by 49 out of the 50 States, they should not get a carve-out under this bill. Because there was no compromise that was agreed to, I would urge the rejection of this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
