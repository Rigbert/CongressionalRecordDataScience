Our first goal should have been to do what we told seniors for years we were going to do: help them buy pharmaceuticals, not change, undermine Medicare but to help them buy pharmaceuticals.  We could have applied all that $400 billion to do that. We didn't. We have stabilization funds to encourage private health concerns to compete with the traditional Medicare Program; we have health savings accounts, with billions of dollars there to encourage the insurance industry to sell health care plans to individuals. All of that very scarce money could have been used simply to say how much can we help the seniors to buy drugs and maintain our program. I agree with the Senator.
