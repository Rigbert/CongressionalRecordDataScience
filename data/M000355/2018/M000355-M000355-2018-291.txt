 President, we continue to welcome our new Senators-elect, who are in town this week for orientation meetings and votes on party leadership. Yesterday evening, the Democratic leader and I had the honor of toasting our future colleagues at our traditional bipartisan welcome dinner.  It is quite a distinguished group. Some of our new colleagues are talented legislators who will simply be relocating from the other side of the Capitol. Some are coming to the Senate as private citizens who have built successful careers outside the world of politics. Some have already served as statewide elected officials and are coming to Washington for the first time.  It is our pleasure to welcome these future Senators and congratulate all of them.                          ____________________
