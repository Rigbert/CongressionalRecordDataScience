 Of course, many of us have stated our positions on the record time and again, but this comes down to a specific element here. What Senator Wicker does is to strike the language in the bill that permits funding of the U.N. Population Fund for six limited purposes. He has stated that his reason for doing so is to make certain we don't put money into China, where there is evidence of coercive abortion and involuntary sterilization; and he certainly says he doesn't want Federal funds to be spent for the promotion of abortion anywhere in the world.  I would say there are two elements of the bill which I would recommend to all Members before they vote on the Wicker amendment, which I hope they will oppose. Page 763 of the bill--it is a big one, but I will point you to the specific page, 763--says:       . . . none of the funds made available in this Act nor any      unobligated balances from prior appropriations Acts may be      made available to any organization or program which, as      determined by the President of the United States, supports or      participates in the management of a program of coercive      abortion or involuntary sterilization:  A flatout prohibition. It is already there. Then when it comes to the issue of China, which has been the centerpiece of this debate about coercive abortions and involuntary sterilization, there is a long section--page 929--which I will refer my colleagues to. The net result is this. It says in the first paragraph:       Not later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this      Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a report to the      Committees on Appropriations indicating the amount of funds      that the UNFPA is budgeting for the year in which the report      is submitted for a country program in the People's Republic      of China.  So we ask the Secretary of State to go to New York and find out how much money is going to China, where we suspect coercive abortion and involuntary sterilization. The second paragraph says we will then deduct that amount of funds from any money that goes to the United Nations for family planning.  So it is specific, and we are specific in terms of these practices. We can't spend any money for these practices; and, secondly, no money to the People's Republic of China which is not set off by a reduction in the Federal investment.  Now, let me tell you why this amendment not only ignores the clear language of the bill but should not be passed. There are six limited purposes for which we are trying to use the U.N. Population Fund, and they are, among other things, to reduce genital mutilation and obstetric fistula and to provide voluntary family planning and basic health care to women and girls.  It has been my opportunity and honor to visit Africa. In one of those visits, with Senator Brownback of Kansas, we went to the Democratic Republic of Congo, which doesn't get the publicity of many places in Africa, but it has been one of the killing fields. There have been thousands--maybe hundreds of thousands--of people killed in this region. It has been torn back and forth since the Rwandan genocide, with the exploitation of minerals. The net result has been the poorest people on Earth, smack dab in the center of Africa, have been pushed out of their villages and into refugee camps, and they have been victimized by guerilla soldiers.  Well, I went to a hospital in Goma, which is in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is one of those places where you think if God has a bad day, the first thing he does is look at Goma because they have had it all--poverty, disease, all the strife of guerrillas and all the war that revolves around them and, to put the icing on the cake, a volcano which erupts with regularity. These poor folks get it in every direction. But there in Goma was a hospital called DOCS hospital. DOCS hospital is sustained and financed by protestant churches in the United States. It has a modern surgical suite, paid for by the United Nations.  When you go to this hospital, you see women lined up in a row, hanging onto their meager belongings, waiting for the chance to be admitted to the hospital. Why? Because this is the only place within hundreds of miles where they can go for surgical treatment of what is known as obstetric fistula. Obstetric fistula--I will try to describe it; not being a doctor--is the result of early pregnancies, long labors of young girls, rape, terrible mutilation that occurs and causes serious problems for these women. They become incontinent, they are unable to join their families, they are shunned by their villages. This is their only hope. They come to this hospital and they wait. They sit in the dust in the road hoping--and it is sometimes weeks later--to be seen by a doctor. They cook outside and help one another, and then they may go through a surgery. At the end of the surgery, they end up two to a bed trying to recuperate. Some of them, because they are so badly mutilated, have to go through multiple surgeries and wait month after weary month while a handful of surgeons and nurses do heroic jobs in trying to put their lives back together.  Is that worth putting some money into? Is it? Is it worth saying to the U.N. Population Fund: Can you help these people? Can you bring in some doctors, some surgeons to treat them? They are victims, helpless victims, who are trying to put their lives back together. I think it is money well spent.  I have a friend of mine named Molly Melching. Molly Melching is in Senegal. She was in the Peace Corps there, and after her service in the Peace Corps she decided to stay on. She has created an organization called Tostan. Tostan is trying to stop the ritualistic genital mutilation of girls. It is horrible, and it is dangerous. Village by village, tribe by tribe, Molly is making progress, and I think that is the right thing to do, for the dignity of these young girls and for the role of women in these African societies. Is it worth money from the United Nations Population Fund? I think it is.  And voluntary family planning, we have ascribed to that particular goal in America, that women should have a choice to plan their families with their spouse and with their conscience. I think the same thing, short of abortion, should be available through the United Nations Population Fund. Unfortunately, the Wicker amendment strikes the language which permits funding for those purposes. It is not right.  We know you cannot spend the money here for coercive abortion, weknow you cannot spend the money here for involuntary sterilization, we know if you spend the money in China we are going to take it away from the United Nations.  This amendment goes too far. I urge my colleagues, particularly those who are of a persuasion that opposes abortion and believe they should oppose it in every circumstance, give women in the poorest countries on Earth the option of voluntary family planning. Do something for these poor women who have been victimized by rape and war, and these young pregnancies that unfortunately cause so much damage to their bodies. Give them a chance to put their lives back together. Also, when it comes to genital mutilation, the United Nations should be in the forefront of promoting modern treatment of women and not leave ourselves in the distant dark past of these tribal customs. I am sure Senator Wicker does not intend for this to happen, but I am afraid that is the result of it.  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Wicker amendment.                          ____________________
