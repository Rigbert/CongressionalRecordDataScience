Speaker, our colleagues on the other side are so concerned that a starting police officer at $23,000 or a young teacher at $23,000 might get a tax credit for their children, but they are not concerned that the changes they are making in the alternative minimum tax would give tax rebates to large corporations like Texas Utilities, that did not pay a penny in Federal taxes.  The only reason they paid $19 million on their $1 billion profit was the AMT, and their repeal of the AMT will give them a tax rebate of $18 million on taxes they did not even pay, and we do not have a penny for the police officer or a penny for the young teacher. It is outrageous.
