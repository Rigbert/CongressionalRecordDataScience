President. I am very pleased that H.R. 3180, legislation to consent to certain amendments to the New Hampshire-Vermont Interstate School Compact, has been adopted by the Senate. This legislation was passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and I am pleased my colleagues have joined me in supporting its passage today.  There are a handful of Vermont communities that share a school district with their neighbors across the border in New Hampshire. Congress first approved of the New Hampshire-Vermont Interstate School Compact in 1969 to allow these interstate districts to be put in place. H.R. 3180 amends the original Compact by providing these interstate districts with local flexibility regarding how to conduct bond votes for their school construction projects.  Last year, residents of the Dresden School District, one of two interstate school districts formed under this Compact, voted to change the way bond votes are conducted in their communities. The Vermont and New Hampshire Legislatures approved these changes, as did the U.S. House of Representatives when it passed H.R. 3180, sponsored by Representative Charlie Bass of New Hampshire and my colleague from Vermont, Representative Bernie Sanders, after a 425 to 0 vote to suspend the rules.  This bill will allow local schools to make local choices about the best way to spend their dollars. While I regret that this simple piece of legislation was not agreed to sooner, I applaud its passage today.                          ____________________
