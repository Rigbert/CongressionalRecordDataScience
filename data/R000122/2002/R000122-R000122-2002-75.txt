President, I rise in recognition of the 90th Anniversary ofthe Girl Scouts of America. The Girl Scout tradition began on March 12, 1912, when founder Juliette Gordon Low assembled 18 girls in Savannah, GA for the first-ever Girl Scout meeting. Today, the organization offers girls of all races, ages, ethnicities, socioeconomic backgrounds, and abilities the chance to thrive by building the real-life skills they will need as adults.  I am especially honored to acknowledge the activities of the Girl Scouts of Rhode Island, which currently serves over 13,700 girls in my home State and several bordering towns of Massachusetts and Connecticut. The Girl Scouts of Rhode Island has created several enriching programs and activities over the years that truly help girls grow strong. One such programs is Girls on the Go, which serves low-income girls at free lunch sites throughout the State during the summer months, allowing them to participate in Girl Scout activities. Other examples include the City Summer Camps program in both Providence and Central Falls which provides 6 weeks of training and recreational activities, and the Girls at the Center program which has provided numerous scouts and adults with opportunities to explore science and technology.  I am truly proud of the achievements of the Rhode Island Girl Scouts and their mission to help young women achieve high ideals of character, conduct, patriotism and service. I wish them continued success in the future.                          ____________________
