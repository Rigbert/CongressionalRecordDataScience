Speaker, for 55 years in Toledo, hundreds of young boys and girls have danced and scampered across area stages and dozens of principal dancers have graced the stage with their artistry in a yearly production of ``The Nutcracker'' ballet. Thousands of northwest Ohioans have delighted in the Christmastime event. A production of enormous proportion has been given to us through the vision and talent of one woman, Marie Bollinger Vogt, who I rise today to honor. This year's production will be her last. Marie is retiring as the artistic director of the Toledo Ballet Association, which she founded.  Intent on imbuing her own love of dance into youngsters, Marie founded the Toledo Ballet School over 50 years ago. Under her direction, the company has performed hundreds of productions throughout our region, ``The Nutcracker'' being its premiere performance. During her tenure, Marie brought to the school not only her own creative choreography but also that of internationally famous artists. She also brought to northwest Ohio world renowned dance companies and performers.  Altruistic as well as artistic, under Marie's direction, the Toledo Ballet Association is involved in community service. The company stages free performances in the schools and local public housing authority. One performance of ``The Nutcracker'' is presented at no cost for children. Scholarships are provided by the school for children who could not otherwise afford lessons. These acts are surely fueled by Marie's passionate desire to inspire dance in young people.  Although retiring as artistic director of the Toledo Ballet Association, Marie intends to continue in her first love, that of teaching, and will remain the Toledo Ballet School's director. She also begins the ambitious project of bringing to fruition her lifelong dream of building a professional ballet company in Toledo.  In this, its 55th year, many of Marie's former students are returning to dance under her tutelage one last time. The 1995 ``Nutcracker'' performance will be a reunion for all who studied dance under her direction. Such a tribute gives testament to her teaching and quiet inspiration.  We thank Marie Bollinger Vogt for her yearly Christmas gift to all of us in northwest Ohio; a family evening lost in the enchantment of ``The Nutcracker,'' her legacy.
