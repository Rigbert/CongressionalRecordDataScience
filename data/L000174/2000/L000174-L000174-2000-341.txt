President, during the debate last week on the proposed constitutional amendment on victims' rights, a number of editorials and thoughtful essays were printed in the Record. Because of the way in which the Senate ended its consideration of S.J. Res. 3, I did not have an opportunity to include in the Record all such materials. Accordingly, I included additional materials yesterday and do so again today, in order to help complete the historical record of the debate. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record editorials from a number of sources around the country in opposition to the proposed amendment.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Philadelphia Inquirer, Apr. 22, 2000]                             Misguided Bill       Crime victims need justice and compassion, not the ability      to usurp the rights of others.       If ever there was a likely booster for the cause of      empowering crime victims, it's Bud Welch of Oklahoma City.       After his 23-year-old daughter, Julie, perished in the 1995      federal building bombing there, Mr. Welch recalls wanting to      see the co-conspirators ``fried'' rather than tried in court.       But the latest push in Congress to enshrine a victims' bill      of rights in the U.S. Constitution does not enjoy Bud Welch's      support. Nor does it have the backing of numerous groups      equally as concerned as Mr. Welch with seeking justice for      victims.       The amendment's opponents include advocates for battered      women, the families of murder victims--plus the nation's top      state judges, civil-rights groups and veteran prosecutors.       All of them, whether knowingly or not, are heeding James      Madison's wise directive that the Constitution be amended      only on ``great and extraordinary occasions.''       This isn't one of those occasions.       These groups understand that the proposals before Congress      would completely restructure federal and state criminal      justice systems. As such, the victims' rights measure is      dangerous to fundamental rights that protect all Americans.      In the Oklahoma case that Mr. Welch knows so well, he cites      the plea bargain that led to key testimony by an accomplice      of Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols.       Had victims been able to contest that plea--as provided by      the rights proposals in Congress--the case might have been      more difficult to prosecute or might even have unraveled.       That's just a hint of the practical problems in according      crime victims such rights as court-appointed counsel, a say      in prosecution decisions, and the like. How could anyone      think things are working so well in the nation's clogged      criminal courts that they could handle this wrench tossed      into the works?       There's a more fundamental problem, through, with giving      crime victims a virtual place at the prosecutors's table.       It presumes the guilt of a person charged with a crime      before the courts have spoken. With that, out the courtroom      window goes a fair trail--and in comes a threat to all      Americans' rights.       What crime victims are owed is compassion, the chance to      seek compensation, consideration of the demands a trial      places on their time and psyches, and a full measure of      justice. That's the intent of victims' rights provisions      already enshrined in law or state constitutions by all 50      states.       For instance, the Pennsylvania statute provides for      notifying victims of court proceedings, allowing them to      comment on--but not to veto--plea bargains, the right to seek      restitution, and notification of post-conviction appeals and      even convicts' escapes. These are good ideas that don't      deprive rights.       Shame on Congress if it seriously considers a measure that      could jeopardize the right to a fair trial. Ditto if the      victims' rights cause is turned into just another cynical      vehicle to make political hay--like the flag-burning      nonsense.       The region's senators should not be party to that--no      matter what their party.                                  ____              [From the Providence Journal, Apr. 27, 2000]                         The Quality of Justice       Bud Welch, whose daughter Julie was one of the 168 victims      of the bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma      City five years ago, testified before the U.S. Senate      Judiciary Committee against the proposed Victims' Rights      Amendment to the Constitution. ``I was angry after she was      killed that I wanted McVeigh and Nichols killed without a      trial. I probably would have done it myself if I could have.      I consider that I was in a state of temporary insanity      immediately after her death. It is because I was so crazy      with grief that I oppose the Victims' Rights Amendment.''       Mr. Welch is right. Giving the victims of crime the      constitutional right to influence bail decisions and plea      agreements would turn the principle of innocent until proven      guilty, the foundation of the American system of justice      embodied in our Bill of Rights, on its head. Other countries,      notably France, are still striving to incorporate this      principle into their legal codes. It would come as a shock to      see the United States move away from it, a move that would be      rightly perceived as a step backward into law's dark,      despotic past--the days of an eye for an eye and a tooth for      a tooth.       If that seems a hard indictment of an amendment that sounds      so eminently reasonable and fair, consider the provision      granting victims the right to a trial ``free of unreasonable      delay.'' The very phrase should send chills down the spine.      One person's ``expedited'' trial is another's ``legal      lynching,'' to borrow Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas'      phrase. And, like most amendments to the Constitution, there      is no telling where this amendment would lead. Would an      assault against a Ku Klux Klan member marching with thousands      of co-bigots mean that the state has to notify and consult      with every racist marcher ``victim'' in prosecuting the      criminal?       The United States is a country that abhors the miscarriage      of justice. It is, or should be, the key element of our      national character. No one would contend that it is good that      victims sometimes suffer further in the administration of      justice, and proponents of this amendment, such as Mothers      Against Drunk Driving, fight a noble cause in trying to      protect the rights of victims in the justice system. But      amendment the Constitution is not the way to do it. Victims'      rights laws are on the books in 35 states, including Rhode      Island. Strengthen and enforce these laws. That is the way to      ensure all Americans, victims and accused, have a fair trial.                                  ____           [From the Richmond Times-Dispatch, Apr. 16, 2000]                          Differently Situated       Complaints about partisan rancor in Congress are      commonplace. But sometimes it's even worse when Republicans      and Democrats agree.       Take the resolution sponsored by Republican Senator John      Kyl and Democrat     Dianne Feinstein. It proposes a victims' rights amendment to      the Constitution guaranteeing a right to be notified of,      attend, and testify at the defendant's trial. Thirty-three      states already codify such protections, and there is little      wrong with them. But an amendment would sully the      Constitution with (to borrow a turn of phrase) a new indoor      record for missing the point.       At a recent news conference supporting the proposed      amendment, Mothers Against Drunk Driving president Millie      Webb said, ``Many Americans don't realize that victims have      no guaranteed rights under our current law,'' whereas ``the      system caters to the rights of defendants.'' Such      statements--with which many Americans, including 41 Senate      co-sponsors of the Kyl-Feinstein resolution, would agree--     reflect a cavernous lack of understanding regarding the      machinery of justice in America.       That machinery exists for the very purpose of defending      rights, such as the right to physical safety and the right to      property. Legislatures pass laws forbidding assault, murder,      theft, fraud, and a host of other crimes. Policemen patrol      the streets to prevent those crimes. When a crime is      committed and a victim created, police hunt down the      likeliest suspect and arrest him.       Government attorneys then prosecute. The courts sit in      judgment, impose prison time, and order restitution where      appropriate. Corrections departments imprison--and sometimes      execute--offenders, not only to punish them for the misdeed      in question but also to prevent them from violating the      rights of additional victims. This vast legislative,      judicial, and executive machinery expends a great amount of      time and energy to guarantee the rights of innocent citizens.       The procedural rights of defendants exist for a good      reason. The right to trial by jury, the right to an attorney,      the right to an appeal, the right not to have a confession      beaten out of you--all are in place because a defendant      stands in a markedly different position from a crime victim.      The state wields its immense coercive power on behalf of the      victim--and against the defendant.       Some mechanism is necessary to ensure that powerful      machinery does not run out of control and crush someone it      should not. Though they sometimes are abused, the      constitutional protections guaranteed to a defendant are not      catering to the guilty, but to the innocent. They exist to      make sure the apparatus functioning on behalf of victims does      not create another one, or several other ones. If sloppy law      enforcement sends an innocent person to prison, then it      leaves the real perpetrator free--to strike again.                                  ____                 [From the Seattle Post-Intelligencer,                              Apr. 21, 2000]                   Victim Amendment Undoes Prior Work       With the drive to enshrine its tenets in the U.S.      Constitution, the victims' rights movement is in danger of      undoing much of the good it has done.       Granted, the proposed amendment to the Constitution, which      is scheduled for a vote Tuesday in the U.S. Senate, is      emotionally appealing. If approved by Congress and ratified      by three-fourths of the state legislatures, the amendment      would, among other things, require that victims be notified      of any court proceedings involving their accused assailants      and be told of an offender's release or escape.       These provisions are fairly innocuous; others in the far-     reaching proposal are not.       For example, the amendment would give victims the right to      attend all public proceedings stemming from the crime. But      there are compelling reasons for victim witnesses to be      excluded from the courtroom except when they are testifying.      Their presence could bias the testimony of other witnesses      sympathetic to what the victims have endured, and on hearing      other witnesses testify, victims might tailor their own      testimony to minimize any inconsistencies.       Another new ``right'' would authorize victims to submit a      statement at all public proceedings held to accept a      negotiated plea. That risks the possibility of victims      becoming equal partners with prosecutors in deciding when to      plea-bargain cases. Therein lies the crux of our objections.       The government prosecutes crimes on behalf of the      community, not just victims, even though victims routinely      suffer the greatest toll. It is the community's best      interests that should receive the highest consideration by      prosecutors.       One surprising opponent of the amendment voiced his      concerns simply: ``I think crime victims are too emotionally      involved,'' said Bud Welch of Oklahoma City, whose daughter      died in the bombing of the federal courthouse there.       Welch and his organization, Citizens for the Fair Treatment      of Victims, are joined in opposing the proposal by the      National Coalition Against Sexual Assault, the National      Network to End Domestic Violence and Murder Victims' Families      for Reconciliation.       Already, 32 states have passed victims' rights statutes or      amendments to their state constitutions. This is how it      should be, as the vast majority of crimes are prosecuted on      the state level. It is far too radical a step to amend the      federal Constitution for what is essentially a state matter.       All victims' rights run the risk of being diluted if this      proposal becomes the 28th amendment to the U.S. Constitution.      That should convince Washington's senators, Democrat Patty      Murray and Republican Slade Gorton, to vote no Tuesday.                                  ____              [From the South Bend Tribune, Apr. 27, 2000]            Proposed Victims' Rights Amendment Is Misguided       A proposed constitutional amendment to codify rights for      crime victims may be sincere in intent, but it is misguided      and should be defeated when the Senate votes today.       The most sacred tenet of the United States' system of      justice says that all those accused are innocent until proven      guilty. The Victims' Rights Amendment could jeopardize that      constitutional protection by giving victims an active role in      virtually every stage of prosecution, from plea bargaining to      punishment and parole.       Under terms of the amendment, victims would be allowed to      remain present in the courtroom throughout a trial, even if      they are witnesses for the prosecution.       Crime victims deserve sympathy and support, but inserting      them into the criminal justice system as proposed in this      amendment is an invitation to substitute vengeance for      justice. If Congress wants to establish a fund to help      victims recover emotionally, physically and financially it      should do so. It should not, however, seek to alter core      principles of the law.       Congress is developing an annoying tendency to legislate by      pandering to the public's feelings as a substitute for      thoughtful consideration. Amending the Constitution may      create many unintended consequences and should not be      undertaken when there are other ways to reach the goal      desired.                                  ____             [From the St. Petersburg Times, Apr. 25, 2000]                         A Wrong Set of Rights       The so-called Victims' Rights Amendment isn't all that it      seems. Politically motivated, it would tilt cases in favor of      prosecutors and strike a blow to constitutional guarantees of      due process and fairness for the accused.       The Constitution was purposely made hard to amend to shield      it from political whims, but that hasn't stopped Congress      from trying to alter this great document. In this 106th      Congress, at least 53 constitutional amendments have been      introduced concerning every hot-button issue from flag      burning to school prayer. The latest assault on individual      rights is the so-called Victims' Rights Amendment, a      wrongheaded attempt to give crime victims rights in criminal      proceedings.       The amendment is popular because any measure that appears      to favor victims over criminals is going to sail through      Congress. But the amendment has more to do with political      pandering than conscientious lawmaking. This helping hand for      crime victims is really about tilting the balance in favor of      prosecutors. It would substantially reduce the Constitution's      guarantees of due process and fairness for the criminally      accused.       While victims often complain that they are ignored or      mistreated by the criminal justice system, there are fixes      short of amending the Constitution. Florida, for example, has      codified victims' rights in statute and made it part of the      state Constitution. A caveat, though, prevents the exercise      of victims' rights from interfering with the defendant's      constitutional rights. But if the federal Constitution were      amended, this key protection for defendants would be      nullified.       Among the disturbing provisions, the Victims' Rights      Amendment would give crime victims the right to be present at      any public proceeding, to expect a trial free from      unreasonable delay and to have their safety considered      relative to a defendant's release from custody. While these      measures don't sound excessive on their face, they could      seriously handicap a defendant's right to a fair hearing.       For example, a victim who demands to sit in on every day of      trial could also be a key witness to the crime. By listening      to all other testimony, he could tailor his comments to avoid      inconsistent statements--complicating the defense's job.       Similar problems arise in interpreting the victim's right      to a quick resolution. A victim's demand for speed could      truncate the defense attorney's time to prepare for trial,      making it difficult to present a full defense. It is also      unclear how the victim's right to a speedy resolution would      impact the defendant's right of habeas corpus. Habeas claims      of wrongful imprisonment sometimes comes many years after      conviction.       Multiple concerns also are raised by the provision      requiring that the safety of victims be considered before a      defendant is released. At minimum, the accused could be      denied reasonable bond, but the provision could also give the      state the power to hold prisoners indefinitely after their      prison terms based on some minimal showing of fear by the      victim.       The amendment is scheduled to come up for action in the      Senate this week, and if it passes by the two-thirds majority      necessary, it's expected to fly through the House. The      amendment would then need to be passed by three-fourths of      state legislatures before becoming part of the Constitution.      Florida's Republican Sen. Connie Mack has already signed on      as a sponsor, but Democrat Bob Graham, as usual is waiting      until the last minute to reveal his position.       What seems to elude amendment supporters is that the rights      of defendants are not enshrined in the Constitution to      protect criminals. They are there to ensure that those      falsely accused by government get a fair trail. So really the      Constitution already provides for victims' rights: victims of      overzealous government prosecution, that is.                                       ____                [From the Wichita Eagle, Apr. 27, 2000]    Not Again--Victim's Rights Don't Merit Constitutional Amendment       There's no question that victims of crimes too often feel      victimized a second time by the justice system. Look at the      parents of the students killed at Columbine High School:      Their frustration with the Jefferson County sheriff's      department over access to videotape and records has rightly      provoked multiple lawsuits--and compounded their grief.       But the instances in which victims are wronged by      authorities hardly justify the ultimate legal remedy in      America--an amendment to the Constitution.       That's the conclusion that once again should be reached by      both the U.S. Senate, which moved ahead this week with debate      on the proposed Victims' Rights Amendment, and the House,      which has a similar measure pending in committee.       Supporters such as Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., argue      that the Constitution currently guarantees 15 rights to      criminal defendants yet extends none to victims. They want to      equalize the importance of defendant and victim, guaranteeing      the latter the right to be present at court hearings, speak      at sentencing, have a say in plea agreements, see the cases      resolved quickly and seek restitution.       But the proposed amendment is rife with problems:       It would step on existing statutory and constitutional      safeguards in 32 states, including Kansas.       It could end up conflicting with or compromising      defendants' rights.       It lacks even the support of some advocacy groups such as      Victim Services, which is focusing its resources and energy      elsewhere.       And, as Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., noted,      it ``is longer than the entire Bill of Rights.''       Authorities obviously need to do a better job respecting      and enforcing existing state victims'-rights laws and taking      pains not to treat victims like afterthoughts. But there are      good reasons why the 11,000 attempts to amend the      Constitution over the defining document's 213-year history      have succeeded only 27 times. The plight of crime victims is      heartrending, but it should be dealt with by appropriate      laws, not by this kind of intensive meddling with the      Constitution.                                  ____            [From the Winston-Salem Journal, Apr. 27, 2000]                            Victims' Rights       The victims of violent crimes and their loved ones often      have reason to feel that they have fewer rights under the      justice system than does the criminal. Many victims say that      they feel victimized all over again by the time the court      proceedings are done. Clearly there is much that ought to be      done to ensure that courts and related offices treat victims      with respect, compassion and efficiency. But a victims'      rights amendment to the U.S. Constitution, under discussion      this week in the Senate, is the wrong way to make those      improvements.       It's a bad idea to amend the Constitution for a problem      that could be handled by less sweeping and less permanent      legislation. The Constitution has remained strong for more      than 200 years precisely because the Founders did not address      the details of every issue that might arise. It is unwise to      amend it to deal with problems that can be addressed through      less drastic means.       Even more important, the drive for a victims' rights      amendment is based on a misunderstanding of the role of the      criminal-justice system. The courts are set up to protect the      rule of law and the greater interests of society, not to      exact personal vengeance. When a criminal is sentenced to      imprisonment or some other punishment, he is paying his debt      to society, not to the victim. He is being punished for      violating the rule of law that we all agree to as citizens      for our mutual protection.       Advocates of an amendment argue that the Constitution      establishes many rights of the accused, but none for victims.      But the Constitution is designed to provide the protection of      laws and fair and efficient justice for all. Crime victims      are suffering because a law has been broken, and the function      of the courts is to punish the lawbreaker. The rights of the      accused are spelled out because defendants are in danger of      having rights taken from them as punishment. Though the      victims of crimes deserve public sympathy and support, they      do not deserve special treatment by the legal system.       The move for victims' rights has arisen out of frustrations      when the court system, far from giving victims special      treatment, seems to disregard them. Among the rights in the      proposed amendment would be notification of proceedings,      speedier proceedings and notification of release or escape of      an offender.       Some of these rights exist but aren't honored because of      overcrowded courts and lack of staff. Those are problems that      Congress and state legislatures can address without an      amendment. They can also pass laws to make things more smooth      and comfortable for victims and to give victims a voice in      such proceedings as parole hearings. Some laws providing      restitution are appropriate.       A constitutional amendment is not needed to achieve any of      these worthy goals. Senators should make it clear that they      support the goals but don't want to pursue them in the wrong      way.                                  ____                [From the Washington Times, May 2, 2000]                      Constitutional Pandora's Box                          (By Debra Saunders)       Just when you thought that Congress was a totally craven      institution full of pandering pols who would sell out the      Constitution for a friendly story on Page 3 of the local      paper, the Senate up and takes a stand on principle. An      unpopular stand even.       I refer to a proposed Crime Victims' Amendment to the      Constitution. Last week, Senate sponsors Dianne Feinstein,      California Democrat, and Jon Kyl, Arizona Republican, pulled      a vote on the measure because they didn't have the two-thirds      vote needed for passage. Finally, some good news.       Of course, I support crime victims' rights, and the stated      goals of the measure. The amendment, among other things,      would give victims the right to be notified of legal      proceedings where they would have a right to be heard, to be      notified if a perp is released or escapes, and to weigh in on      plea bargains.       As Mrs. Feinstein explained in a statement, ``The U.S.      Constitution guarantees 15 separate rights to criminal      defendants, and each of these rights was established by      amendment to the Constitution. But there is not one word      written in the U.S. Constitution on behalf of crime      victims.''       I, for one, value that omission. The Founding Fathers wrote      the document when being a victim was not a badge of honor. If      it were written today in the decade of the victim, the      Constitution probably would read like a 12-step pamphlet.       More importantly, while the Constitution does not pay      homage to victims' rights per se, the entire process of      prosecution, of using the government to exact punishment for      wrongdoing against individuals, recognizes the government's      responsibility to protect citizens from lawless individuals.       Of course, there have been some victim horror stories that      give the measure legitimacy. One need look no further than      Littleton, Colo., where authorities have sold video-tapes of      the bloodstained high-school shooting crime scene for $25.      This is a true outrage, but it is best remedied by parents      suing the daylights out of these cruel civil servants.       'Tis better to sue than to revamp the U.S. Constitution.      Law enforcement generally is a local matter. A constitutional      amendment then would give federal judges another excuse to      butt in and tell local lawmen and women what to do. No      thanks.       I'll add that because a constitutional amendment has so      much force, and is so difficult to change, there must be a      compelling reason to pass it, and lawmakers should have a      clear idea of its effects.       But it's not clear how judges would interpret it. The      American Civil Liberties Union's Jennifer Helburn argues that      some judges, for example, could interpret the right of      victims to ``be present, and to submit a statement' at all      public legal proceedings to mean indigent victims would have      a right to publicly funded legal representation.       The ACLU also warns the provision could ``allow victims to      be present throughout an entire trial, even if they are going      to be witnesses.'' A Senate aide explained a judge would      determine whether victims could be present before testifying      or could testify first, and then attend the rest of the      trial. So, the provision could make life harder for      prosecutors. Not good.       Legal writer Stuart Taylor Jr. of the National Journal      worries that mandating victim output--even if it is not      mandatory that prosecutors obey it--could scuttle plea      bargain arrangements that might be unpopular but result in a      better outcome than letting murderers walk free.       Sen. Fred Thompson, Tennessee Republican, warned that the      measure is ``very, very disruptive in ways that there is no      way we can possibly determine. We are opening up a Pandora's      box.''       Except, last week, the Senate didn't open up Pandora's box.      And in not opening the box, it nonetheless released one      precious item: hope.                          ____________________
