President, as the Senate continues to debate funding priorities for the American people in the coming year, I want to take a moment to recognize the importance of supporting our Nation's seniors. May is Older Americans Month. This is a time to recognize our responsibility to expand resources for the elderly and a moment to acknowledge the important role older Americans play in contributing to our country's livelihood and development.  Older Americans Month has been recognized annually since 1963, when President Kennedy designated May as Senior Citizens Month to honor the dedication of seniors to our communities. At that time, just 17 million Americans had reached their 65th birthday, with over one-third of all seniors living in poverty. With few programs to support their needs, President Kennedy pledged to highlight elderly contributions to society in order to strengthen such services.  This year's Older American's Month theme is ``Blaze a Trail,'' aimed at raising awareness about the many issues facing seniors today. From high health care costs, to the availability of healthy foods in vulnerable communities, our Nation's seniors deserve the resources they need to enjoy these richer years.  Last month, the President signed the Older Americans Act Reauthorization Act into law, marking the end of a 5-year long debate on how to reauthorize crucial programs for seniors in underserved communities. For decades, the Older Americans Act has strengthened community assistance for seniors, including through transportation, caregiver support, nutrition, and home-based aid. I am pleased the reauthorization remains steadfast in supporting these initiatives, and includes stronger protections for elder rights, while expanding disability and long-term care programs.  But we cannot stop there. We must take this as an opportunity to underscore the importance of promoting senior services across all sectors. That means coming together as a Congress to produce solutions for long-term sustainability in Social Security and Medicare. It means expanding access to healthy foods across communities, including in hospitals and senior-care facilities. This means supporting caregivers and families who take time out of their lives to provide for their loved ones. And it means ensuring that cost of living adjustments are fairly calculated to account for senior expenses year after year.  We all have a stake in promoting the livelihood of our Nation's elderly, whether it be for our own families or for the children of future generations. Let us be reminded this May that supporting older Americans is not just a matter of fairness, but a commonsense solution to promoting the wellbeing of our Nation at large.
