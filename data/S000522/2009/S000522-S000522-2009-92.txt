Additionally, ethnic religious minority groups such as the Montagnards in the Central Highlands and the Khmer Krom Buddhists continue to face intense persecution, beatings and even death.  I would hope that Mr. Cao's resolution causes this Congress to reexamine Vietnam's human rights record and redouble our efforts to promote freedom and democracy in Vietnam and to remove hindrances for Vietnamese people seeking asylum in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world.  Again, I congratulate my good friend and colleague. His is a success story that needs to be held up in neon lights. Joseph Cao, you are an extraordinarily talented and courageous leader.
