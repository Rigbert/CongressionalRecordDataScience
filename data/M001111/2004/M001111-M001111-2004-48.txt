 I wrote:       Airbus' corporate behavior on this matter cannot be      tolerated by the U.S. government.       Its actions are further delaying our ability to meet a key      military requirement, and if successful, will result in the      outsourcing of thousands of American manufacturing jobs to a      foreign corporation that is unfairly subsidized by European      governments and that unfairly competes with the only U.S.      aircraft manufacturer.       Such an outcome represents ill-conceived public policy, and      will also unfairly punish the nearly 30,000 workers who will      be employed should the Air Force tanker lease program proceed      with a domestic manufacturer, as currently planned.  I have not received a reply from Secretary Rumsfeld, but I did receive a shocking reply from someone else. Two days after writing to Secretary Rumsfeld, I received a letter from Mr. Ralph Crosby, the Chairman and CEO of EADS North America.  So I sent a letter to Secretary Rumsfeld, and I got a reply from the head of Airbus. There's something very fishy about that. It got even more outrageous as I read Mr. Crosby's letter. Mr. Crosby stated that EADS is committed to being a ``strong U.S. citizen,'' and he repeated the same statistics that EADS refuses to verify to either me or to the Department of Commerce. I want to refute a few claims in Mr. Crosby's unsolicited letter.  First, Mr. Crosby had the gall to suggest that EADS is a ``strong U.S. citizen.'' Their history tells a much different story. Airbus and EADS have been willing suppliers to nations that the United States considers either rogue states or state sponsors of terrorism.  According to one news article dating back to 2001:       The Airbus Industrie Consortium views those countries      against which US or UN sanctions are in place--Libya, Iran,      Iraq and North Korea--as potentially representing major      opportunities, Noel Forgeard, CEO, indicated yesterday.  The same article quotes an Airbus Vice President as saying:       We might have been looking to place a total of 180      aircraft--100 with Iran, 50 with Iraq and 30 with Libya--with      at least 140-150 orders feeding through.  It was widely reported that Airbus was in close contact with Iraqi airways during the period of UN sanctions following the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Apparently, Airbus was in discussion with the state run--Saddam Hussein run--Iraqi airways to sell 20 Airbus aircraft. It was also widely reported that personnel from Iraqi Airways were taken to Jordan and Malaysia for three month training courses on Airbus equipment. Airbus still carries a five-plane deal with Saddam Hussein on its order books and has said the deal is still valid. While American troops are rebuilding Iraq's infrastructure and trying to build a peaceful, democratic future for the Iraqi people, Airbus wants the new Iraqi government to honor Saddam Hussein's plane deal.  To me, for so many reasons, EADS is not a ``strong U.S. citizen.''  Here is another claim from Mr. Crosby's letter that I must refute. He wrote:       Should decisions by the U.S. government open a competitive      procurement of aerial refueling tankers, EADS North America      will respond.       We will offer a superior, cost-effective aerial refueling      solution that will be completed by American workers, on      American soil, in the United States providing the Department      of Defense and the Air Force the opportunity to select the      product that provides the best capabilities to the U.S. armed      forces.  Let's remember that the Air Force already rejected Airbus's tanker proposal for the reasons I mentioned. The Air Force said Boeing was the cheaper option, and it deemed the A330 a ``significantly higher risk.'' But in Mr. Crosby's world, these failures somehow translate into what he calls a ``superior, cost-effective aerial refueling solution.''  There is another disturbing claim hidden in Mr. Crosby's statement that should set off alarm bells. He said that Airbus tankers would be ``completed'' in the U.S.  Mr. Crosby says the A330 refueling tanker for the Air Force would be completed by American workers on American soil. Translated that means tankers will be built in Europe by European workers at U.S. taxpayer expense and then American workers can install the final components. Once again, EADS and Airbus are trying to use their market-distorting tactics to shift aerospace jobs to Europe to the detriment of American workers.  I have a simple reply to the Airbus's campaign to build tankers in Europe paid for by U.S. taxpayers.  No thank you. No thanks. Never.  I wrote back to Mr. Crosby, and I ask unanimous consent that my letter to him be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                    Washington, DC, April 6, 2004.     Ralph D. Crosby, Jr.,     EADS North America,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Crosby: Thank you for your letter of March 24,      2004. I appreciate your attempt to clarify your position.      Unfortunately, the vague and ambiguous language in your      letter has served to underscore my earlier concerns about      Airbus's efforts to undermine the Air Force Tanker      Modernization program. Additionally, I continue to seriously      question Airbus's unsubstantiated claims regarding its      employment and economic impact in the United States.       Your letter outlines, as you have stated publicly on      several occasions, Airbus's desire to compete for the Air      Force Tanker Modernization program. Your continued insistence      on Airbus's qualifications to compete in such a contest seems      to belie the fact that the tanker competition already took      place in 2002--a competition that Boeing won and Airbus lost      based on each company's proposed design, technology, delivery      schedule, and overall risk reduction plan.       As you know, the Air Force informed EADS on April 2, 2002      that its platform was deemed high-risk for the Air Force's      operational requirements for the refueling tankers. I remain      puzzled by Airbus's continued effort to re-open the tanker      competition two years after its final conclusion.       To my knowledge, the Airbus 2002 proposal has never been      made public. Providing the public with a clear picture of      Airbus's capabilities at the time of the competition would      help to address concerns refuting the competitions outcome.       I continue to believe that Airbus has engaged in a campaign      of distortion and half-truths to discredit the Air Force,      Boeing and the KC-767 lease program. Your letter did not      dispel my concern that Airbus is engaged in a campaign to      undermine the tanker lease program. I would welcome a full      accounting of Airbus's continued involvement with the tanker      lease program on par with the various information subpoenaed      from both the Defense Department and Boeing. A full      accounting of Airbus's lobbying activities including support      given to tanker opponents would provide the public with a      full sense of this debate.       As enlightening as the examination of the facts may be, I      do not think Airbus is willing to be as transparent in      detailing its communications with the Congress, the      Administration, and others outside of government as the      Boeing Company has been. From my vantage point, Airbus's      involvement in the campaign to discredit Boeing and the      tanker program could not be clearer.        I am also troubled by your continued assertions regarding      Airbus's economic and employment presence in the U.S. Your      letter states that Airbus ``supports'' a certain number of      U.S. jobs, and that an Airbus tanker would be ``completed''      by U.S. workers. In my view, an Airbus tanker ``completed''      by U.S. workers is a tanker manufactured in Europe with the      overwhelming number of jobs also created in Europe.        I would appreciate any solid, verifiable, and straight-     forward information detailing the number of U.S. workers and      vendors that Airbus directly employs, as well as specific      direct employment and U.S. content relating to manufacturing      a national Airbus tanker aircraft.        As you know, I earlier challenged Airbus' many rhetorical      claims about jobs, suppliers and economic contributions in      this country. The Department of Commerce confirmed my      suspicions and almost entirely discredited Airbus' claims. To      date, despite vows to do so, Airbus has not provided the      Department of Commerce any additional credible information on      its contributions to U.S. workers and the U.S. economy. The      truth is Airbus continues to market itself to the Congress      and the American people with assertions that appear to be      untrue and dishonest. You are aware of my concerns, as well      as those raised by the Department of Commerce, and I      encourage you to provide justification for Airbus' direct      claims on jobs, suppliers and economic contribution.       Finally, to set the record straight, Airbus did file a bid      protest challenge regarding the leasing provisions contained      in the FY'03 DoD Appropriations Act (PL 107-248). The Air      Force executed the lease of four commercial Boeing 737      special mission aircraft long before the Air Force attempted      to proceed with the KC-767 program. The Airbus bid protest      was specific to the four 737 aircraft but I must conclude      that the real Airbus target was the lease program itself and      ultimately the Air Force's ability to move forward with a 100      plane KC-767 lease with the Boeing company. The Airbus bid      protest was dismissed by the General Accounting Office.        Again, thank you for your response to my letter. I look      forward to hearing from you.            Sincerely,                                                     Patty Murray,                                            United States Senator.
