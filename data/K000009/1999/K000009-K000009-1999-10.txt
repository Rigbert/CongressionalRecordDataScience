Speaker, soon the House will have an opportunity to consider S. 900, what is entitled the Financial Modernization Conference Report.  This complicated and controversial legislation seeks to overhaul banking laws that have been in existence in our country since the Great Depression. These laws were dedicated to safety and soundness in the banking system of the United States.  The laws that have been on the books for this entire century since the Great Depression have separated the activities of bankers, of the insurance industry, and of the securities and stock brokerage industries. Essentially, what this legislation attempts to do is to allow them to intermarry and to do business together.  Now, I recently did a survey in my district, and I asked our constituents the following question: How would you describe your personal views of bank practices? Two-thirds stated that they disliked the changes that have been occurring in the banking system. They say the fees are not consistent with the services provided, services are declining, and most of our banks are no longer locally owned.  If we think to the system that has been in place in this country that has permitted us to grow and to increase equity for America's families, the epitome of this system was the community bank. And in fact, the community banker became an active member of the local chamber of commerce in every neighborhood, in every city; and banking became equated with stability.  What we have seen happen in the banking system of our country, and it has been happening slowly, slowly, slowly, we have watched communities like my own, Toledo, OH, become a branch economy of an institution located someplace else. And when that happened, community contributions to Boy Scouts by those institutions went down, to children's softball teams and so forth. The community contributions, the philanthropy of that institution and the personal identification of the president of the institution with the community as a whole diminished.  In addition to that, we have seen the idea of safety and soundness changed fundamentally to where now most of these institutions have turned into high-flying debt pushers trying to get consumers to take on more credit than they can afford.  In fact, last week when I got home from Congress and I opened my mail, I got so mad I ripped this letter up. Because this came from an institution that does business in Ohio, and what did it have? It had one of these $5 checks attached that says that, if you cash this and sign up for our program, we will send you $5.  But what was I to sign up for? Here is a banking institution pushing more credit on the commercial side to me, a depositor in that institution. They want me to sign up for Shopper's Advantage, over 250,000 brand items; Traveler's Advantage, again credit to travel; concierge's service; Saver's Club discount book. In other words, they are pushing debt, pushing debt through the banking system at our consumers.  Now, this is a fundamental change in the way that our country used to operate in the field of banking and credit. In some ways, these lending institutions, if we can call them that, are not so much interested in building communities as in milking communities and in taking money that should be placed in those depositors' accounts so that they can end up owning a piece of the rock rather than assuming these greater and greater debt burdens that are characterizing family accounts across this country.  Here is a recent chart on the rising level of consumer debt in our country. The average family cannot survive more than 3 months without getting their paycheck in the mail because of the debts that they owe. Yet these institutions that are supposed to be dedicated to safety and soundness are into pushing more credit, not in the interest of community building, but in the interest only of profits of those institutions.  We have seen megafinancial conglomerates and mergers across our country, and this bill will only add new hurdles to the already difficult task for consumers obtaining basic financial services without incurring outlandish and arbitrary fees.  Further, consumers will be forced to speak with more 1-800 recordings. How many of us have got lost in those when we try to get an answer out of a banking institution in this country and very pricey automatic teller machines rather than dealing with human beings? This is happening across our country.  Mr. Speaker, the fundamental precept of any banking laws in this country should be safety and soundness, not high-flying credit pushers.  I rise today to outline my concerns with this conference report. I believe America's Fiscal Fitness is in jeopardy as we enter the next millennium. Are we really prepared for the challenges that lie ahead?  I am concerned about the growing trend toward mergers and acquisitions throughout America's banking industry. These massive consolidations, most recently seen with the merger of Nations Bank and Bank of America, will likely result in fewer financial service options and fewer alternatives for consumers when it comes to shopping for life insurance, checking accounts, and investments transactions.  The mega-financial conglomerates created by this bill will only add new hurdles to the already difficult task of obtaining basic financial services without incurring outlandish and arbitrary fees. Further, consumers will be forced to speak with 1-800 number recordings and sent to pricey automatic teller machines rather than dealing with human beings.  Consumer spending makes up two-thirds of our economy, but increases accounted for an astounding 85 percent of the growth in the gross domestic product last year. And it's fueled by unsustainable efforts by most families.  Consumer debt, from credit cards to home mortgages, now total about 85 percent of personal income--with installment loans accounting for $1.4 trillion. The 55 to 60 million households that carry a credit card balance from month-to-month have an average balance of $7,000 and pay more than $1,000 per year in interest and fees.  As consumer debt has increased net family worth has declined. Federal Reserve reports that the median net worth of all U.S. families, in constant 1995 dollars has dropped from $57,000 in 1989 to $55,600 in 1995.  A report released by the Consumer Federation of America found that half of U.S. households do not have $1,000 in assets available for an emergency. Should the economy take a dramatic downturn, these families are not prepared.  As a percentage of the gross domestic product, consumer debt has increased from 13.74 percent in 1990 to 15.41 percent this year. One family in six below $25,000 in annual income spends more than 40 percent of its income on debt service.  American families have kept their heads above water by working more hours--middle-income couples with children are putting in an average of 6 full-time weeks more each year than a decade ago.  The burden of today's consumer debt coupled with an increase in interest rates, a newwave of downsizing, or a cutback in overtime hours would force families to curtail spending and push many into bankruptcy.  Today, over 12 million American families can't afford bank accounts. And for those who do have accounts, the average annual cost of maintaining a regular checking account has risen to more than $217 in 1999--according to U.S. Public Interest Research Group. Meanwhile, in 1998 banks recorded nearly $62 million in profits, an eighth straight record year.  The Financial Modernization Conference bill does little to discourage the growth of bigger, higher fee banks, leading to less consumer choice and higher fees for all Americans. There are also privacy concerns that are not addressed in this bill.  The bill allows for sharing between mega-bank affiliates. Which can only lead to more of the solicitations like this one that I received over the weekend from Key Bank.  The bill does not allow a customer to ``opt-out'' if a financial institution wishes to distribute the customer's information to affiliates within the financial holding company. Is it too much to ask for a customer to have the right to ``opt-out'' and inform his or her financial institution that it may not distribute his or her personal, private financial information to financial institutions?  Mr. Speaker, I am aware of the tremendous work on the part of the Banking Committee Members and staff and appreciate their work on this important issue. I remain, however, concerned that the bill falls short from meeting consumer protection needs and reducing bank fees.                          ____________________
