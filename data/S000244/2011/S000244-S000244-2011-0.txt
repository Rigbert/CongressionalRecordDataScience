Speaker, I can't believe what I just heard from my friend from Missouri. Doing away with the Presidential Election Campaign Fund is not a Jim Crow law. And I'll put my record alongside his on ensuring voting rights to minorities as the author of the latest extension of the Voting Rights Act and one who got the 1982 compromise passed and signed into law by President Reagan.  The Presidential Election Campaign Fund was destroyed 3 years ago by President and then-Candidate Barack Obama. He refused to be bound by its restrictions. Senator John McCain was. And he was put at a significant disadvantage in the general election campaign by running against Candidate Obama, who rejected the Election Campaign Fund's funds and raised huge and unlimited amounts of money.
