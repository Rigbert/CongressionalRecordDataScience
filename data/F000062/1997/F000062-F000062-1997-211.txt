 President, I, along with Senators Boxer, Graham, Snowe, Moseley-Braun, Landrieu, Harkin, Specter, D'Amato, Mack, Johnson, Reid, and Murray would like to introduce the Breast Cancer Research Stamp Act.  In a time of shrinking budgets and resources for breast cancer research, this legislation would provide an innovative way to provide additional funding for breast cancer research.  This bill would: authorize the U.S. Postal Service to issue an optional special first class stamp to be priced at 1 cent above the cost of normal first-class postage; earmark a penny of every stamp for breast cancer research; provide administrative costs from the revenues for post office expenses; allow 100 percent of the proceeds from the stamp to fund HHS breast cancer research projects; clarify current law, in that any similar stamp would require an act of Congress to be issued in the future.  If only 10 percent of all first class mail used this optional 33 cent stamp, $60 million could be raised for breast cancer research annually.  There is wide support for this legislation. Congressman Fazio, along with over 100 cosponsors have already introduced the companion bill (H.R. 407) in the House.  The breast cancer epidemic has been called this Nation's best kept secret. There are 2.6 million women in America today with breast cancer, one million of whom have yet to be diagnosed with the disease.  In 1996, an estimated 184,000 were diagnosed with breast cancer. It is the number one killer of women ages 40 to 44 and the leading cause of cancer death in women ages 15 to 54, claiming a woman's life every 12 minutes in this country (source: National Breast Cancer Coalition).  For California, 17,100 women were diagnosed with breast cancer and 4,100 women will die from the disease (source: American Cancer Society cancer facts and figures, 1996).  In addition to the cost of women's lives, the annual cost of treatment of breast cancer in the United States is approximately $10 billion.  Over the last 25 years, the National Institutes of Health has spent over $31.5 billion on cancer research--$2 billion of that on breast cancer. In the last 6 years alone, appropriations for breast cancer research have risen from $90 million in 1990 to $600 million today. That's the good news.  But, the bad news is that the national commitment to cancer research overall has been hamstrung since 1980. Currently, NIH is able to fund only 23 percent of applications received by all the institutes. For the Cancer Institute, only 23 percent can be funded--a significant drop from the 60 percent of applications funded in the 1970's.  Most alarming is the rapidly diminishing grant funding available for new researcher applicants.  In real numbers, the National Cancer Institute will fund approximately 3,600 research projects, of which about 1,000 are new, previously unfunded activities. For investigator-initiated research, only 600 out of 1,900 research projects will be new.  The United States is privileged to have some of the most talented scientists and many of the leading cancer research centers in the world such as UCLA, UC San Francisco, Memorial Sloan-Kettering, and the M.D. Anderson.  This lack of increase in funding is starving some of the most important research, because scientists will have to look elsewhere for their livelihood.  The U.S. must increase the research funds if these scientists and institutions are to continue to contribute their vast talents to the war on cancer and finding a cure.  What is clear is that there is a direct correlation between increase in research funding and the likelihood of finding a cure.  Cancer mortality has declined by 15 percent from 1950 to 1992 due to increases in cancer research funding. In fact, federally-funded cancer research has yielded vast amounts of knowledge about the disease--information which is guiding our efforts to improve treatment and search for a cure. We have more knowledge and improvements in prevention through: identification of a ``cancer gene'', use of mammographies, clinical exams, and encouragement of self breast exams. Yet there is still no cure.  The Bay Area has one of the highest rates of breast cancer incidence and mortality in the world. According to data given to my staff by the Northern California Cancer Center, Bay Area white women have the highest reported breast cancer rate in the world, 104 per 100,000 population. Bay Area African-American women have the fourth highest reported rate in the world at 82 per 100,000 (source: Northern California Cancer Center).  I want to recognize Dr. Balazs (Ernie) Bodai who suggested this innovative funding approach. Dr. Bodai is the Chief of the Surgery Department at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Group in Sacramento, California. He is the founder of Cure Cancer Now, which is a nonprofit organization committed to developing a funding source for breast cancer research.  This legislation is supported by the American Cancer Society, American Medical Association, American Hospital Association, Association of Operating Room Nurses, California Health Collaborative Foundations, YWCA-Encore Plus, the Sacramento City Council and Mayor Joe Serna, Siskiyou County Board of Supervisors, Sutter County Board of Supervisors, Nevada County Board of Supervisors, Yuba City Council, California State Senator Diane Watson and California State Assemblywoman Dede Alpert as well as the Public Employees Union, San Joaquin Public Employees Association, and Sutter and Yuba County Employees Association and many more on the attached list.  Given the intense competition for Federal research funds in a climate of shrinking budgets, the Breast Cancer Research Stamp Act would allow anyone who uses the postal service to contribute in finding a cure for the breast cancer epidemic.  In a sense, this particular proposal is a pilot. I recognize that the postal service may oppose this since it hasn't been done before. I also recognize that in a day of diminishing federal resources, this innovation is an idea whose time has come.  It will make money for the post office and for breast cancer research. No one is forced to buy it, but women's organizations may even wish to sell the stamps in a fundraising effort.  The administrative costs can be handled with the 1 cent added on to the cost of a first class stamp and conservatively it can make from $60 million per year for breast cancer research.  We need to find a cure for breast cancer and I believe the Breast Cancer Research Stamp Act is an innovative response to the hidden epidemic among women. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 726       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECITON 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Breast-Cancer Research Stamp      Act''.     SEC. 2. SPECIAL POSTAGE STAMPS.       (a) In General.--In order to afford the public a convenient      way to contribute to funding for breast-cancer research, the      United States Postal Service shall establish a special rate      of postage for first-class mail under this section.       (b) Higher Rate.--The rate of postage established under      this section--       (1) shall be 1 cent higher than the rate that would      otherwise apply;       (2) may be established without regard to any procedures      under chapter 36 of title 39, United States Code, and      notwithstanding any other provision of law; and       (3) shall be offered as an alternative to the rate that      would otherwise apply.       The use of the rate of postage established under this      section shall be voluntary on the part of postal patrons.       (c) Use of Funds.--       (1) In general.--       (A) Payments.--The amounts attributable to the 1-cent      differential established under this Act shall be paid by the      United States Postal Service to the Department of Health and      Human Services.       (B) Use.--Amounts paid under subparagraph (A) shall be used      for breast-cancer research and related activities to carry      out the purposes of this Act.       (C) Frequency of payments.--Payments under subparagraph (A)      shall be paid to the Department of Health and Human Services      no less than twice in each calendar year.       (2) Amounts attributable to the 1-cent differential.--For      purposes of this subsection, the term ``amounts attributable      to the 1-cent differential established under this Act''      means, as determined by the United States Postal Service      under regulations that it shall prescribe--       (A) the total amount of revenues received by the United      States Postal Service that it would not have received but for      the enactment of this Act, reduced by       (B) an amount sufficient to cover reasonable administrative      and other costs of the United States Postal Service      attributable to carrying out this Act.       (d) Special Postage Stamps.--The United States Postal      Service may provide for the design and sale of special      postage stamps to carry out this Act.       (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress      that--       (1) nothing in this Act should directly or indirectly cause      a net decrease in total funds received by the Department of      Health and Human Services or any other agency or      instrumentality of the Government (or any component or other      aspect thereof) below the level that would otherwise have      been anticipated absent this Act; and       (2) nothing in this Act should affect regular first-class      rates or any other regular rate of postage.     SEC. 3. ANNUAL REPORTS.       The Postmaster General shall include in each annual report      rendered under section 2402 of title 39, United States Code,      information concerning the operation of this Act.                                  ____                          Original Cosponsors       Tony Hall (OH)--original.
