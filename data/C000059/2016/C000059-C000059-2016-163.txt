Chair, it is my understanding that the overall rule is supported broadly by many in the truck and the manufacturing industry. However, as any rule, there are some specifics that do need to be ironed out, and my colleague has narrowly tailored this amendment to address concerns within the EPA's rule. So you really can't drive a truck through it.  I support this language in the Interior bill.  Mr. Chair, I urge Members to vote ``aye'' on this amendment.
