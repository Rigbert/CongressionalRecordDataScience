 One issue we need to clarify with our people on our side is that the conservative position is to support this. Our good friend, our mutual friend Gary Ridley, said that the extensions cost about 30 percent off the top--30 percent. In fact, I will say this, after our 27-month bill, we went over it in the House, and I had requested an audience with the entire--all 33 Republicans on the appropriate committees, and all 33 agreed that it was a conservative position. All 33 voted for the bill. I think we have the opportunity to make that happen again.
