President, I thank my colleague. He has been extraordinarily active in ensuring us the resources are available for our military forces. I would be happy to explore with him the possibility of additional funding if it is necessary.  Again, let me thank Senator Dodd. We traveled together in October of last year to Iraq and saw the great service that is being rendered by our soldiers and the need for the equipment, the honest need. But I will, at this juncture, Mr. President, yield the floor.
