Chairman, I offer an amendment.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will designate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:       Amendment No. 1 printed in House Report 109-266 offered by      Mr. Sensenbrenner:       Page 9, strike lines 1 through 7, and insert the following:       (A) conveying private property--       (i) to public ownership, such as for a road, hospital,      airport, or military base;       (ii) to an entity, such as a common carrier, that makes the      property available to the general public as of right, such as      a railroad or public facility;       (iii) for use as a road or other right of way or means,      open to the public for transportation, whether free or by      toll;       (iv) for use as an aqueduct, flood control facility,      pipeline, or similar use;       Page 8, line 7, after ``States.'' insert the following:      ``The taking of farmland and rural property will have a      direct impact on existing irrigation and reclamation      projects. Furthermore, the use of eminent domain to take      rural private property for private commercial uses will force      increasing numbers of activities from private property onto      this Nation's public lands, including its National forests,      National parks and wildlife refuges. This increase can      overburden the infrastructure of these lands, reducing the      enjoyment of such lands for all citizens.''.       Add at the end the following new section:     SEC. __. LIMITATION ON STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION.        Nothing in this Act may be construed to supersede, limit,      or otherwise affect any provision of the Uniform Relocation      Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970      (42 U.S.C. 4601 et seq.).  The Acting CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to House Resolution 527, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin.
