 I think this is a very significant day. We had a very blessed event over the weekend at my house. We had our fifth grandchild. And when little Mollie Elizabeth Inhofe was born, I say to Senator Thurmond, she inherited a $20,000 personal debt. I remember it was only a year before when little Jase, our fourth grandchild, was born. He inherited a $19,000 debt. So it is going up every year.  When I look over, I see Senator Hagel from Nebraska. You do not have to go back just to the Reagan administration. If you go back long before that, one of our very fine Senators, Carl Curtis, had an idea that he would balance the budget by getting the States to preratify it. It was an ingenious idea, and it did not work, even though in the State legislature, I was the first State legislator to get it preratified.  So we have something we are faced with today that we have been fighting for 20 or 25 years. This is our opportunity to do it. If we do not do it now, I do not think we will be able to do it in the near future. This is a moral issue, Mr. President, we have to meet.
