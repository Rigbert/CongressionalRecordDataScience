President, I want to compliment the senior Senator from Nevada, the Democratic leader. I supported him for assistant leader, and I supported him for leader, and I have never regretted, nor doubted, that support.  I have been here 31 years. He is a fine leader. I have been here for 12 nominations to the Supreme Court, 2 of them for Chief Justice. I am one of only a handful of Senators who can say that. I know, throughout all this process, the Senator from Nevada, Senator Reid, dealt with us evenhandedly and fairly. Never at any time did he try to twist any arms on this side of the aisle. Throughout it all he said: Keep your powder dry--his expression which I picked up--until the hearings were over. That is the sort of thing we should do. Hear the evidence first. Hear the evidence, and then reach a verdict. I am extremely proud of him.  We have reached different conclusions on this, but we remain friends and respectful to each other throughout. His praise of Senator Specter and of myself means so much to me. But I think, more importantly, what he has done means so much to the Senate. Senator Reid has worked with both sides of the aisle to make sure that we were going to have a hearing for the Chief Justice of the United States that reflected what was best in this country.  When I finished my speech, I spoke directly to Judge John Roberts, and I will do so again: Please, remember there are 280 million Americans. Be a Chief Justice for all of us.  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.
