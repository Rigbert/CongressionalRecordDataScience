Speaker, I rise today to give recognition to the football team of Bowie High School for winning the Maryland State Football Championship. An estimated ten thousand fans were in attendance at Byrd Stadium on the Campus of the University of Maryland to witness Bowie High School's first ever division 4A football championship.  On December 1st, Bowie completed their season with a 23-6 victory over rival and previously unbeaten Eleanor Roosevelt High School. The game was the first All-Prince George's County title game since 1983, and the first time Bowie High School has played for the championship since 1987. The victory capped an outstanding season for Coach Scott Chadwick and his Bulldogs.  The championship culminated an incredible revival of the football program. When athletic director Bob Estes was hired two years ago, the football program had not had a winning record since 1988. The team had a 38-61 record from 1989 to 1997, including six years with less than four wins. Since Head Coach Chadwick took over the team four years ago, they have increased their win total each year, and now have a championship trophy.  Bowie High School's first championship is especially gratifying for the fans that have been vocally and passionately supporting the team throughout the year. Many parents of the team have been actively involved in the school's pep rallies and have stuck with the team throughout some tough years.  I applaud the efforts of the team members, their coaching staff, their fans, the school system and the Bowie Community for a winning season and for being the Maryland State Football Champions.  Mr. Speaker, and colleagues, please join with me in wishing the Bowie High School football team continued success and congratulations on their outstanding achievement.                          ____________________
