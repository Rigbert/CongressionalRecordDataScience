President, I rise in strong support of this amendment by the Senator from Wisconsin. He is correct. We tried this across the United States in, I think, six different jurisdictions, to see what would happen. What is at issue here is a person is about to file for bankruptcy and is so penniless that they cannot even afford the filing fee of $175, then in these six different court jurisdictions we waived it. That is what this is all about. We found as a result of that experience they didn't open the floodgates to people coming in filing for bankruptcy. In fact, just the opposite was true. A lot of very serious cases, and those called out for justice, were served by this program.  One of the judges in my home State of Illinois, the southern district, who tried this, Judge Meyers, has written a letter to me and said it was quite a success and he encouraged it be done on a national basis.  If there is anything that distinguishes American jurisprudence from some other countries, it is the fact that we have basically said the court system is open to the rich and poor alike. It is an oddity in our law that we don't allow those who are truly poor to have a waiver of the filing fee so that they can come into bankruptcy court.  Senator Feingold has a good amendment. I was happy to support it in committee. I hope now, because of the evidence of its success across the country that has been shared on both sides of the aisle, it ultimately will be adopted.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Who seeks recognition?
