Chair, we have increased the underlying budget request by $837 million, and we have added two ships.  The best description for the amendment before us is shortsighted cannibalism. It eats other important Navy and Air Force programs in 2019 to feed the Virginia-class submarine. In doing so, it creates a myriad of problems in the out years.  The chairwoman mentioned a number of the programs that were cut in this proposal. I mentioned one in a previous amendment. I would emphasize that some of the gross numbers that have been mentioned include a cut of $10.5 million from weapons procurement from the United States Navy. It does, I emphasize, cut from carriers $49.1 million. It takes $20 million from fleet oilers. It takes $26.1 million from our research and development from the Navy and $262.9 million from the Air Force.  This is not new money. This is not free money. We are taking money from programs that need it in 2019.  Mr. Chair, I would also point out that Mr. Courtney mentioned two letters that were referenced by the chairwoman. I would also reference two other letters. The suggestion was made that we hear from the administration all of the time.                              {time}  1900  Well, Chairman McCain, in the Senate, on May 30, 2017, heard from Admiral Richardson relative to the Navy's unfunded priority list for fiscal year 2018. Admiral Richardson, who is Chief of Naval Operations, mentioned 38 priority items for the United States Navy. It did not include this item. It included a request for an additional $4,796,000,000. It didn't include this item.  Mr. Chairman, I have a letter that was sent to Chairman Frelinghuysen on February 22 of this year from Admiral Richardson for the Navy's unfunded priority list for this year, 2019. It includes 25 items. I have been scanning this with my bifocals, looking for this item of importance to the United States Navy, and I have not been able to find it in their request for an additional $1,502,270,000.  The sponsors' claim that this gives the Navy the option to construct two additional Virginia-class submarines during the next 5-year block contract, cutting $1 billion for useful programs this year, to give the Navy an option to do something in 4 years, does not make a bit of sense to me.  The sponsors say that this amendment sets the Navy up well for a multiyear procurement agreement, and I might not be able to argue that, in particular. However, in their quest to set that up, they are, in fact, damaging the ability of the United States Navy to set up a multiyear procurement program for the DDG-51 program.  Mr. Chairman, for all of these reasons, I am strongly opposed to this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
