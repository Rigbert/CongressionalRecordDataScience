Speaker, as an original cosponsor of H.R. 2887, The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, I am very pleased that we are taking it up tonight under the Suspension Calendar. As the FDA's report to Congress earlier this year indicated, ``the pediatric exclusivity provision has been highly effective in generating pediatric studies and in providing useful new information on product labels.'' It is important that we reauthorize this very effective program to protect and improve children's health.  The bill before us today makes some important improvements in current law. Under current law, there is little incentive to perform the studies necessary to label off-patent drugs for pediatric use. This bill establishes a federally funded program operated through the NIH and the FDA to contract for studies of off-label drugs. It also establishes a nongovernmental foundation to fund these studies as well as other pediatric research. I have confidence that this foundation's work will be generously supported by the pharmaceutical industry, which indicated in a recent letter to Chairman Tauzin that ``such a charitable foundation is an excellent idea.''  Third, the bill provides the user fees that the FDA has requested to speed up the consideration of applications for labeling changes to reflect pediatric use and gives priority status to the review of these applications.  Fourth, the bill establishes an Office of Pediatric Therapeutics at the FDA to coordinate and oversee pediatric activities across the agency.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act. In the interest of children's health, we cannot allow the pediatric exclusivity provisions to expire at the end of this year.
