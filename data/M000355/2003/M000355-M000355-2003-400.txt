 President, tomorrow morning following the period of morning business, the Senate will begin consideration of the conference report to accompany the partial-birth abortion ban bill. Under that agreement, there will be up to 4 hours of debate, and therefore a vote on adoption of the conference report will occur sometime tomorrow afternoon. The vote on the conference report will be the first vote of the day.  Following that vote, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 1751, the class action reform bill.  As a reminder, cloture was filed on the motion to proceed to the bill just a few moments ago. That cloture vote will occur on Wednesday. Senators obviously will be notified when that vote is scheduled.                          ____________________
