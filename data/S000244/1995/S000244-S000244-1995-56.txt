Speaker, yes, today has been a debacle, and a debacle because I think of people not the reading the rules that we have been living under for as long as I have been [[Page H310]] in the Congress of the United States. The rule that has been voted upon today and the Speaker's rulings have been in the precedent book of the House of Representatives for decades. It has never been in order for one Member to impugn the motivation of another Member. Speakers throughout the years, whether they be Democrat or Republican, have always enforced that rule in a uniform manner, and that is what happened today.  I do not see why my friends on the other side of the aisle object to that. They should not, because their Speakers enforced their rules just like our Speaker today has enforced the rules that we adopted in the first day of the session. Let us get down to legislation instead of talking about this.                          ____________________
