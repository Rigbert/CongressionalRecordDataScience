President, I wish to explain to my colleagues the reasons for my objection to a unanimous consent request for the Senate to take up the anti-terrorism legislation, the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001, H.R. 2975, passed by the House of Representatives on October 12, 2001. My public explanation is consistent with the commitment I have made to explain publicly any so-called ``holds'' that I may place on legislation.  I regret that I must object to any Senate action on the House-passed measure at this point. I do so because the national anti-terrorism legislation is in grave danger of being rendered useless. The Senate-passed anti-terrorism bill included an important, bipartisan provision, the Professional Standards for Government Attorneys Act of 2001, authored by Judiciary Chairman Leahy, Ranking Member Hatch and myself and supported by the Administration, the FBI and the Department of Justice. This provision corrected an immediate and severe impediment to the undercover investigations that must be employed to shut down terrorism in our Nation. The House failed to include this provision, which is section 501 of the Senate's anti-terrorism bill, that will untie the hands of Federal prosecutors in Oregon, allowing them to supervise undercover and other covert enforcement techniques. For more than a year now, the so-called McDade law has prohibited prosecuting attorneys working at the State and Federal levels in Oregon from advising and conducting law enforcement undercover investigations on narcotics, child sex abuse, prostitution, organized crime, housing discrimination and consumer fraud. Without advice of counsel, law enforcement operatives cannot conduct wiretaps, sting operations or infiltrate dangerous criminal or terrorist operations. If the Senate does not insist on this language, it will be an engraved invitation to terrorists and criminals to set up shop in Oregon with little fear of detection or apprehension through undercover or covert methods. This would endanger not just the people of Oregon, but all Americans.  I do not believe the Senate should allow the security of every American to be jeopardized. As I stated on the floor of the United States Senate yesterday, I do not want to find six months from now that terrorists have made their homes in Oregon because this body failed in its resolve to shut them down in every State in our country. I regret having to take this action but I believe that leaving one State vulnerable makes each State in this country vulnerable.                          ____________________
