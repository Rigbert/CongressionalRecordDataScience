 The legislation that I am introducing with my colleague from Alabama would create a corporate structure to oversee TVA.  This legislation expands the board from the current three members to 14 members, requiring the President to appoint two members from each of the seven states in which TVA operates. In addition to expanding the board, our legislation creates the position of a Chief Executive Officer who will be responsible for daily management and operation decisions. Under this new structure, board members would serve on a part-time basis, receiving a stipend for their services and the CEO would become the only full-time, paid position.  It is no secret that TVA has suffered financial turmoil in the past and is still trying to work its way out of substantial debt. In my view, restructuring and reform are overdue. The goal of this legislation is to provide the Authority with board members that have a direct interest in the well-being of TVA and its rate payers and to place at the helm a Chief Executive Officer to make the difficult business decisions that will guide TVA through the impending challenges of an evolving energy industry.  TVA is a multi-billion dollar entity. However, it continues to operate under the same administrative structure it did when Congress created the Authority in 1933. Senator Sessions and I believe that it is time for that structure to change. It is time for the Tennessee Valley Authority to step into the 21st Century and out of the bureaucratic stronghold that has guided its decision making process for so long. We believe that this new board structure will equip TVA to meet the challenges of the future and better serve the people of Alabama and the other States in which it operates.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1288       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
