Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment that has been offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts. He mentioned multiple solutions. The fact is we have a waste problem.  As I pointed out in my general remarks, last year the Congress voted again to move ahead to provide funds to pursue a competitive process for choosing sites for integrative reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel as well as interim storage. The fact is the chairman and I and the subcommittee arecommitted to pursuing Yucca Mountain. That is not enough. If we are to have a nuclear industry and to have an investment in our energy future, we also have to examine options to reduce waste. That is what we are about.  I also believe that the subcommittee has taken a very thoughtful approach, and people have only to look at pages of committee report language that is very explicit in detail relative to the concerns and observations we have made relative to the GNEP proposal that the administration has put forth.  So we are trying to solve an energy problem dealing with our energy future. I would oppose the gentleman's amendment.
