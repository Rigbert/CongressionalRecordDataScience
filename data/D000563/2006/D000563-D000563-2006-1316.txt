President, if I might further ask a question without asking the Senator to surrender the floor, of course, let me ask this question: What you said and the last thing you mentioned was if you were in the United States and had an order issued that you will leave, depart, but the language of your amendment doesn't say that. The language says you are subject to a final order, which means you could be--you could be--subject to a final order. You are not saying a final order has been issued for deportation, and, therefore, you are ineligible. You are saying you are sure. If I have overstayed my visa, sadly, I am subject to an order of deportation, even if it has not been entered.
