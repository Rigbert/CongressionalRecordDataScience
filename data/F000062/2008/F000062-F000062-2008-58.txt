 President, if I can finish with this last statement.  Our strength as a nation emanates not just from our power but from our moral stature and our principled stand for truth, justice, and freedom. It must be restored.  I say to the Presiding Officer, thank you for your indulgence.  Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from Louisiana, whom I also compliment. I see my fellow colleague from California. They are part of Senator Mikulski's Checklist for Change.
