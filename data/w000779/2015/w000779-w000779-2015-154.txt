In effect, we are going to have two choices with respect to this issue, one offered by the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Hatch, and myself, and one offered by Senator Portman and others.                           Amendment No. 1299  I wish to take a few minutes to raise what are my biggest concerns with respect to the amendment offered by the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Portman, and try to put this issue in context. What is particularly troubling to me is it seems to me that the Portman amendment would outsource the question of the Federal Reserve's intent in decisionmaking to the whims of an international tribunal, and I think that is very troubling. That is why Chairman Hatch and I have thought to take a more flexible approach.  I am going to outline how I have reached that judgment so that colleagues, as we turn to this question of currency, have a bit more awareness of what is at stake. As I indicated already this morning, we will be discussing this particularly in the conference committee that is going to take place next month when the House and the Senate get together to talk about currency and other critically important enforcement issues.  I fully agree with my colleagues who have been saying this is a very important issue and our government must do more to target countries that harm our economy by artificially deflating their currency. What is at issue is making sure we proceed in a way that really redounds to the benefit of our country, our workers, and our business.  In the process of taking aim at foreign currency manipulators, it is especially important to make sure that this Senate does not cause collateral damage to the Federal Reserve and our dollars. We all understand the Federal Reserve uses monetary policy as a tool to stabilize prices and boost employment. The right solution is to make sure that our country gets the upside of going after those who manipulate currency and avoids the downside of restricting the tools that Janet Yellen and those in charge of monetary policy may want to use.  The bipartisan trade promotion bill now before the Senate includes a first--many firsts but one in particular. For the first time currency will be a principal negotiating objective. What Chairman Hatch and I have sought to do is to strengthen that and to take yet another step. We direct the administration to hold our trading partners accountable when they manipulate currencies by using the most effective tools available: enforceable rules, transparency, recording, monitoring, and a variety of cooperative mechanisms. My view is that what Chairman Hatch and I are seeking to do here strikes the right balance. We get the upside of confronting unfair currency manipulation, and we don't pick up the downside, tying our hands with respect to policy options that are completely legitimate and important.  One of those policy options that I feel especially strongly about is ensuring that the Fed has the ability to use policies to strive towards full employment. So for me, this issue really comes down to making sure we have all the tools at the Fed and elsewhere for helping to create good jobs and economic stability--jobs that pay higher wages and help our communities prosper.  The Portman amendment is very different than what I and Chairman Hatch have been talking about. Under the Portman amendment, our country would be subject to dispute settlement in an international tribunal, which means that there would be trade sanctions. Now, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has expressed serious concern that this type of provision could ``hamper''--these are Janet Yellen's words--that this type of provision could ``hamper or even hobble monetary policy.'' The Chair's concern--Janet Yellen's concern--is that because monetary policy can impact currency valuation, we could end up tying our hands and, in effect, taking one of the Fed's important tools out of their economic toolbox.  For example, a number of countries have argued that the Fed's quantitative easing policy unfairly values our dollar. Now, I want it understood that I think those countries are dead wrong--dead wrong--in making that argument. But we ought to realize that those countries that have sought to cry foul argue that what the Fed did to bring down the unemployment rate was in effect an unfair strategy for increasing exports. Colleagues, as we think about this currency issue, consider what could happen if the United States was subject to dispute settlement by an international tribunal on this issue.  That is why I am concerned that taking the path of the Portman amendment would, as I have described, outsource the question of the Federal Reserve's intent in decisionmaking to an international tribunal. I think Americans are going to be very skeptical of the idea that, in effect, we are going to have this international tribunal trying to divine essentially what the Federal Reserve's intent was. I personally do not like the idea at all of outsourcing this judgment to an international tribunal. I think it could have very detrimental consequences both to the cause of trade and to our economy.  Just yesterday, Treasury Secretary Lew said he would recommend a veto of a TPA package that included this type of amendment, because he, too, thought it would threaten our Nation's ability to respond to a financial crisis. So it is going to be important to get this right, to make sure that our trade agreements have the upside of being strong in the fight against currency manipulation, but to make sure that we also avoid the downside of restricting our monetary policy tools.  I hope my colleagues will think about the unintended consequences of the Portman amendment. If we were to have another unfortunate financial crisis--and no one wants that--we all want to make sure that the Federal Reserve has the full array of economic tools to get our economy moving again and to keep workers on the job.  So we are going to be faced with this judgment, and I hope my colleagues will say that the approach Chairman Hatch and I have offered is one that will allow us to build on the first-ever negotiating objective for currency that is in the bill and accept our amendment and recognize that, as I stated earlier, we are going to have another bite at the apple when currency is certain to be an important part of a Customs conference between the House and the Senate in June.  With that, I see my colleagues are here, and I yield the floor.
