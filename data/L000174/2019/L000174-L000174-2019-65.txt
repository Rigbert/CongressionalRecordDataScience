Led by a band of female entrepreneurs, this village tucked along the Connecticut River is today the home of dozens of thriving businesses. No fewer than 25 of these business are run by women, and together they are the core of a vibrant, growing community.  Kim Souza, the owner of the consignment store Revolution, was one of the first business owners to move back to White River Junction. The first few years were tough, but with the support of her community, Revolution found its footing. Soon more businesses opened, and new life was breathed into the town.  Across the street, Julie Sumanis and Elenda Taylor opened JUEL, a juice bar and cafe, in the ground floor of a new apartment building. In 2008, Leslie Carleton moved from nearby Norwich to open Upper Valley Yoga. Seven years later, Kate Gamble opened Open Door, another yoga studio.  The successes of these businesses did not come without challenges and difficulties, but their successes showcase the power of bold ideas, commitment, dedication, and, ultimately, community. In 2007, Kim thought Revolution would have to close its doors, until she found the backing of a local mother and daughter that allowed her to stay open. Catherine Doherty, the producing director of White River's Northern Stage theatre company, credits the community's support for keeping the company alive through challenging times.  Today, White River Junction has become a destination and a cultural center of the region. The surge of development brought on by pioneers like Kim continues to bring new people into the town, some feeling empowered to start businesses of their own, to shape their futures, and to make the community stronger. This is the very heart of the American dream. The future of Vermont rests with entrepreneurs across the State, and I am glad to see it in such capable hands.  I am proud to recognize the achievements of these women and the contributions they have made to the town of White River Junction and their broader communities. I ask unanimous consent to enter into the Record a Boston Globe article titled ``In White River Junction, sisters are doing it for themselves.'' It describes their successes and the challenges they overcame in helping to revive their town.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Boston Globe, July 4, 2019]      In White River Junction, Sisters are Doing it for Themselves                           (By Kevin Cullen)       White River Junction, VT.--Kim Souza opened her consignment      and thrift clothing store here in 2002, when this old, wheezy      village hard by the New Hampshire border was so deserted you      half-expected to see tumbleweeds rolling down North Main      Street.       She let the locals know that beyond selling new clothing,      she would also sell used stuff and offered to buy gently used      clothes from them.       Dancers at The Wrap, a strip joint directly across the      street from Souza's shop, began showing up regularly with      outrageously high platform shoes and audacious, skimpy      outfits. Souza had to wave them off when the strippers tried      to sell her their thongs.       ``I had to draw the line somewhere,'' Souza said, standing      behind the counter of her store next to an elaborate      cappucino machine.       The Wrap burned to the ground years ago, and in its place      has risen, phoenix-like, a modern apartment building, the      anchor of which is a ground-level cafe, apothecary, and juice      bar called JUEL, after its owners, Julie Sumanis and Elena      Taylor.       The cafe, located on the corner of North Main and Bridge      streets, in the heart of downtown, captures the essence of      the renaissance of this old industrial village: On the same      spot where women were once exploited and objectified, two      young female entrepreneurs are running a thriving business.       Souza, White River's pioneering businesswoman, recently did      some research and figured out that no less than 25 businesses      that have opened in the once-vacant and newly built      storefronts in the four-block downtown area are run by women.       It wasn't planned. It isn't part of some high-minded      government-incentive program. It just happened. Organically.       Souza was working at a travel agency in New Hampshire when      a mentor, Murray Washburn, suggested she start a business in      gritty White River, which is sandwiched in the Upper Valley      between the more genteel locales of Hanover in New Hampshire      and Woodstock in Vermont.       Souza went for it, opening a funky clothing store in what      had been a frame shop for 30 years and called it Revolution,      which was prescient because she started one.       Things were slow at first. After four years, Souza thought      she would have to go out of business. A local woman, Ann      Johnston, and her then-teenage daughter, Simran, loved the      store and were crestfallen when Souza told them she was going      to close up.       ``What would it take to keep Revolution open?'' Ann      Johnston asked.       The answer was financial backing, which Johnston and her      daughter provided, giving new, sustained life to Revolution,      and the revolution of female businesses.       Souza said Leslie Carleton's decision to open Upper Valley      Yoga on North Main Street in 2008 was a pivotal moment.      Carleton's previous studio was in Norwich, a nearby, more      upscale town. Many of Carleton's well-heeled students      followed her, with some trepidation, to White River.       Those mostly female yogis discovered something that Souza      has immortalized on a T-shirt she sells, emblazoned with the      words, ``White River Junction'' on the front, and, on the      back, ``It's not so bad.''       ``When I came to White River Junction,'' Carleton said,      sitting at a table outside JUEL, ``it was still pretty rough.      It was dead on a Sunday morning. The sleazy strip club was      still there. The ATM at the strip club dispensed only $1 and      $5 bills.''       But Carleton hung in there, and other yoga studios have      followed.       Four years ago, Kate Gamble, a physical therapist, opened      Open Door, a one-stop wellness center, offering services      including yoga, physical therapy, acupuncture, and Chinese      medicine. At something she hosts called The Death Cafe, a      hospice nurse helps people ``be more comfortable about end of      life issues,'' Gamble said.       ``This place reminds me of Brooklyn,'' Gamble said. ``It      was a dump, but a lot of people with energy and new ideas      have moved in and changed things.''       Carleton harbors a nagging worry that it might become too      much like Brooklyn, with rents soaring and inventory drying      up.       But given what White River Junction looked like and felt      like not so long ago, the pros seem to far outweigh the cons,      and officials in the town of Hartford, where White River is      located, are thrilled with all the new businesses and tax      revenue.       And as freight trains roll through the downtown regularly,      blowing their horns, White River is not in danger of becoming      precious or pretentious any time soon. It retains a chunk of      its old grittiness.       Taylor, 37, and Sumanis, 31, became fast friends when they      worked as waitresses at Elixir, an upscale restaurant here.      They had a shared interest in wellness, herbalism, and eating      healthy. More importantly, their bosses, Skip Symanski and      Jane Carrier, had set an example.       When Symanski and Carrier opened a high-end restaurant here      10 years ago, people thought they were nuts. But Taylor and      Sumanis learned that if you build a quality business, the      people will come. It gave them the gumption to strike out on      their own. Three years ago, they started with a food truck.      When space became available in a new building, they went all      in.       ``Elixir paved the way for a lot of us,'' Sumanis said.       They also point to Souza as a nurturing maternal figure to      younger entrepreneurs.       Souza gives credit to the male developers who remade the      town's footprint, but agrees there is a mutually supportive      business climate that has an especially feminine side to it.       ``Women are by nature nurturing,'' she said. ``There is a      lot of mutual support and encouragement going on here.''       Given that they both offer yoga classes, Carleton and      Gamble are technically competitors. But they routinely send      customers to each other's business, depending on what those      customers want and need.       ``Everybody has each other's back,'' said Taylor, who has      given spare keys for JUEL to Gamble and Souza, whose      businesses are right across North Main.       There are downsides to all this progress and prosperity.      You used to be able to park an aircraft carrier along North      Main Street. Now they limit free parking to two hours between      7 a.m. and 7 p.m., from Monday to Saturday. Things can get      tight, especially on weekends.       And, this being Vermont, there are some who decry what they      dismiss as gentrification.       A local blogger, Rejjie Carter, bemoaned what he calls the      colonization of White River Junction, writing that the land      where it sits belonged to the Abenaki tribe before settlers      showed up, and that landlords are now cashing in and driving      out poorer residents.       ``Colonialism, capitalism, and private property are the      enemies,'' Carter wrote.       Like I said, this is Vermont.       Souza, who is a town selectboard member and committed to      many social justice causes, bristles at characterizing what      has happened here as gentrification.       ``When women are opening businesses in a defunct town, it's      less about money and power and more about care and      community,'' she said. ``Gentrification happens when people      are displaced. There were no people in White River Junction      when developers like Matt Bucy, Mike Davidson, and Bill      Bittinger came along. Almost every single one of the old      empty buildings they rehabbed or the new buildings they      erected in vacant lots added affordable living space to our      community.''       Two months ago, a teacher from the Hartford public schools      brought a bunch of students on a field trip to visit some of      the female-run businesses.       ``It was a joy to listen to so many of the young girls ask      questions about how to start a business,'' said Souza. ``It      felt like something was happening.''                          ____________________
