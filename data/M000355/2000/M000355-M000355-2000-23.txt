 President, I want to express my support for the FY 2001 Agriculture Appropriations bill and offer my support for the prescription drug reimportation provisions included in this conference report. While I do not believe the provisions are perfect and I continue to have grave concerns about the so-called ``non-discrimination'' language, I believe this final product represents a good faith compromise which will meet the needs of the American people.  However, I would like to emphasize that my support for reimportation was and remains contingent upon the legislation specifically ensuring that any prescription drug reimported from another country meets all of the United States' safety standards. In other words, our citizens must remain confident that their prescriptions will be filled with products that are safe and effective. In particular, I am pleased that under these provisions, FDA must issue regulations requiring that reimported products be FDA-approved drugs that meet all of the conditions of the New Drug Application, or NDA. It is especially important to maintain our gold standard of drug quality, that all such products comply fully with what FDA calls the ``chemistry, manufacturing, and controls'' portions of the NDA. Compliance with these requirements assures that the drugs not only have the necessary ingredients but also have been manufactured according to the same specifications as the domestic drug product, and the same high-quality process.  I respectfully ask unanimous consent that several letters outlining concerns similar to mine be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         House of Representatives,                                        Committee on Commerce,                               Washington, DC, September 28, 2000.     Dr. David A. Kessler,     Dean, Yale University School of Medicine,     New Haven, CT.       Dear Dr. Kessler: On June 29, 1999, you were kind enough to      write me regarding the dangers of weakening provisions of the      Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA). I am now in receipt      of your recent letter to Senator Dorgan, which is supportive      of significant changes to PDMA. I continue to see real risk      in making those changes, so I would appreciate your insight      as to how safety can be assured.       Your June letter cited my multi-year subcommittee      investigation of re-imported prescription drugs which      demonstrated that     adulterated, misbranded, and counterfeit drugs were entering      the U.S. market, posing as American-made. You noted that the      problems found in our investigation were addressed by PDMA      provisions designed to prevent the ``introduction into U.S.      Commerce of prescription drugs that were improperly stored,      handled, and shipped'' and to reduce ``opportunities for      importation of counterfeit and unapproved prescription      drugs.'' Your letter went on to state, ``In my view, the      dangers of allowing re-importation of prescription drugs may      be even greater today than they were in 1986. . . . I know of      no changed circumstances that require either a shift in FDA      policy or the passage of legislation to repeal PDMA's      prohibition on re-importing drugs. Furthermore, I believe      that such a repeal of change in policy would re-create the      substantial public health risks PDMA was designed to      eliminate.''       Your September letter now says, ``if FDA is given the      resources necessary to ensure that imported, FDA-approved      prescription drugs are the authentic product, made in an FDA-     approved manufacturing facility, [you] believe the      importation of these products could be done without causing a      greater health risk to American consumers that currently      [exists].'' Unfortunately, much of your confidence seems to      not only be dependent on whether FDA will in fact      receive those additional resources, but also whether FDA      can in reality undertake the very tasks that were not      being done before the PDMA was signed into law.       While FDA has indeed argued that it will need substantial      additional resources to undertake this monumental new task, I      am not convinced it has done a thorough analysis of what this      undertaking will actually cost. For example, while FDA has      provided the Committee with a cursory three-page document on      expected budgetary needs (approximately $23 million for the      initial ramp-up years, and approximately $90 million for      succeeding years), I remain concerned at the lack of      specificity in FDA's effort. When asked by Committee staff      for the actual work papers supporting the assumptions made in      this document, staff was told that no such supporting      documents even exist.       Moreover, certain FDA assumptions reveal other concerns.      For example, on page two of its document, FDA mentions that,      ``[g]iven the expectation that criminal activity will      increase with implementation [of the proposed plan], it is      expected that investigations and other supporting laboratory      work would increase.'' FDA clearly recognizes that additional      criminal elements will attempt to undermine the very      ``medical armamentarium'' you refer to in your letter.       In short, Dr. Kessler, the caveats in your letter raise      several questions on which I would appreciate your help:       (1) A June 8, 2000, hearing by the Subcommittee on      Oversight and Investigations of the Committee on Commerce      revealed that FDA is now substantially behind in their      inspections of foreign firms that ship drug products into the      U.S., and that much of this lag can be attributed to the same      resource constraints that plagued your tenure at FDA. You      point out that the success of the proposed legislation hinges      directly on whether FDA is properly funded. Did the FDA      adequately fund foreign inspections during your tenure as      Commissioner? Do you believe FDA will actually receive the      full amount necessary to competently address the burdensome      new tasks imposed by this legislation, particularly given      that FDA is already not afforded enough resources to      presently oversee the production, movement, and final      delivery of drug products now sent to the U.S. from foreign      sources? What might happen if sufficient resources are not      available?       (2) On a recent trip to China to investigate issues      relating to both FDA foreign inspections and pharmaceutical      counterfeiting, committee staff were told by several security      officials that counterfeit material is often mixed into      shipments of legitimate products, as an additional tactic to      elude regulators. Thus, rather than entire shipments being      counterfeit, in some cases, only a part of a total shipment      may be illegitimate. Would batch testing which is what the      proposed legislation envisions as the primary test to      determine authenticity, be a reliable method for protecting      the U.S. consumers from potentially rogue and dangerous      counterfeit drugs? If a batch test were only to test the      legitimate product, how, under this legislation, will a      portion of counterfeit material be detected? Is there a      methodology for doing this? Finally, FDA has long argued      that quality assurance cannot be ``tested'' into a system      (hence, the purpose behind the current foreign inspection      program), which is why they have rejected batch testing as      a final test for finished product and bulk materials sent      to the U.S. Do you believe that batch testing will      suitably meet the same stringent safety requirements long      relied upon by the agency?       (3) As you are aware, the PDMA, and the implementing      regulations established standards for storage and handling of      medicines as they move from a manufacturer to a retail      pharmacy. These provisions were enacted because      pharmaceuticals are very sensitive to various environmental      factors, and drugs are thus packaged under controlled      conditions. Storage of pharmaceuticals under extreme      environments, as you know, can lead to premature      deterioration of the drug. As the testing requirements for      product degradation called for in the Jeffords amendment will      provide information on drug potency at the point a test is      conducted (and not across the shelf life of the drug), there      is no guarantee that a product imported from another country      will arrive with roughly the same shelf life as envisioned by      the manufacturer. If drug products have been subjected to      temperature extremes while being shipped or stored, or are      improperly repackaged, the medicines could not be guaranteed      to meet its specifications up to the expiration date. On the      recent trip to China, committee staff was told by a security      official that he has seen one batch of drug product literally      circle the globe several times, over the course of more than      a year, including being stored in temperatures in excess of      40 degrees centigrade, before ultimately being bought by an      importer. Imported drugs will require repackaging and      relabeling (so that the imported product conforms with an      FDA-approved and required dosage form, packaging, and product      labeling for the American market), so there is a very real      chance that an American patient will unknowingly receive      pharmaceuticals that are not fully efficacious because of      premature loss of potency. Do you agree with this assessment?      Specifically, how can these very real and potentially      dangerous possibilities be dealt with in this legislation or      its implementation, so that we can ensure that the health and      well-being of American patients is not compromised?       (4) As you know, in the United States, pharmaceutical      recalls are initiated by manufacturers because a manufacturer      can quickly and efficiently, through its wholesale      distribution system, located products. In the case of      imported drug products under the proposed amendments, a      manufacturer may not have a systematic way of knowing where a      drug originated, or even if a product has been transshipped      to multiple countries before entering the United States. The      Jeffords amendment allows not only for a drug to be shipped      through multiple foreign locations, but also for a drug to be      transferred among any number of intermediaries. Because of      the likelihood of repackaging, it is not even certain that      the product will be labeled with the original manufacturers      lot number. How can a manufacturer's recall be administered      efficiently and effectively under these new conditions?       I appreciate your attention to this matter. In light of the      major public health implications associated with loosening      reimportation restrictions, I daresay that we will be      corresponding well into the future on these issues.           Sincerely,                                                  John D. Dingell,     Ranking Member.                                  ____                                               September 20, 2000.     Hon. Joe Skeen,     Chairman, Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development,          Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies,          Committee on Appropriations, Washington, DC.       Dear Joe: As you know, the House adopted two amendments to      the Agriculture Appropriations bill relating to the      reimportation and importation of pharmaceutical products from      abroad. I voted against both these amendments and remain      concerned about the potential impact of these proposals on      the health and safety of American consumers and the future      integrity of the U.S. drug supply.       While the House amendments were characterized as simply      providing for the personal importation of pharmaceuticals for      personal use, they actually go beyond this to reverse      longstanding policy in this regard. In my view, such an      important change with implications for American consumers      should not be implemented through the appropriations process.      Such changes warrant careful thought and deliberation through      the regular legislative process.       I recall the congressional investigation in the mid-1980's      that led to the enactment of the Prescription Drug Marketing      Act and current ban on pharmaceutical reimportation. At the      time, there was considerable evidence of both the      counterfeiting and diversion of pharmaceutical products      outside the United States. I do not believe that the      situation has changed. In fact, it may have become worse with      the advent of Internet purchases. I agree that seniors need      help paying for their prescription drugs, and voted for our      plan to do that. But now is not the time to weaken the rules      that have protected American patients for more than a decade.       I urge you to address these concerns by dropping these      provisions from the Agriculture Appropriations bill in      conference.       With best personal regards,           Sincerely,                                                      Bill Archer.
