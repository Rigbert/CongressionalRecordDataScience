President, if I might, through the Chair, address the chairman of the committee. I have an amendment which I would like to offer, but I don't want to step into a process or a queue that is already established. I am not going to call up the amendment at this moment. I merely want to speak to it and offer it and put it on the list of amendments to be considered at a later time.
