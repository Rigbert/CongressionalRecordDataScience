President, last Sunday, the legendary chef Yoshi Katsumura passed away after a battle with cancer.  You would never guess that a 15-minute walk from Wrigley Field, where hot dogs and beer reign supreme, would take you to a place bringing together the foods of Tokyo, Paris, Lyon, and Chicago. But that is what Yoshi built at the quiet, unassuming place known simply as Yoshi's Cafe. Honored by his peers for the past 30 years of exquisite food preparation, Yoshi was a master of his art.  Yoshi was born in Japan's Ibaraki Prefecture--a region on the main island of Japan--in 1950. At the age of 20, he apprenticed under another legendary chef, Hiroyuki Sakai in Tokyo. Through Sakai, Yoshi began learning the complexities of French cooking.  In 1973, Yoshi ventured to Chicago, where he quickly advanced in fine French culinary arts. He studied under Chicago's first celebrity chef, Jean Banchet, at Le Francais. Yoshi would go on to refine his skills in Paris and Lyon, and he returned to Chicago as a chef and partner at the city's premier French fusion restaurant, Jimmy's Place. In 1982, Yoshi opened his own restaurant with his wife Nobuko, Yoshi's Place.  For more than three decades, Yoshi's Cafe has won the hearts and stomachs of Chicago and the country. Yoshi's has been featured on the Food Network and listed among ``America's Top Tables'' by Conde Nast's Gourmet magazine. His fusion of cultures brought diners to North Halsted Street for dishes like Hamachi tartare and the Wagyu burger.  If you look closely for a sign next to Yoshi's Cafe, you will find that Aldine Avenue east of Halsted is designated ``Yoshi Katsumura Way.'' His way was creating wonderful food for his community and making it a better place. He served on the Northalsted Business Alliance board and organized charitable events, including Hurricane Sandy relief and aid for victims of the 2011 Japanese tsunami. And he always took the time to talk to his customers.  Loretta and I love Yoshi's. I once showed up at the restaurant on a Monday evening, forgetting it was closed. Stranded on the corner, trying to decide where to go, I heard someone call my name. It was Yoshi, who livedabove the restaurant, calling down to me and offering to fix a meal for me on his day off. That was the moment when service became friendship and I came to know the goodness of this man.  Yoshi was indeed a special kind of man. His last message was to keep Yoshi's Cafe going. He will be missed. Loretta and I send our prayers and thoughts to his wife, Nobuko; his daughter, Mari; his son, Ken; his brother Kazuhiro Katsumura; and grandson Hiro.                          ____________________
