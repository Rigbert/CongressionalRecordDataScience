 President, let me thank Senator Warner very much for his consideration, and Senator Reed, Senator Levin, and Senator McCain. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside, and that the Sanders-Byrd-Burr-Bond-Webb-Feingold amendment No. 3082 at the desk, and later the Sununu-Kerry-Brown amendment at the desk, No. 2905, be called up.
