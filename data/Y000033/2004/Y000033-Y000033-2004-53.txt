Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  I will speak quickly because time is so limited. We are dealing with a constitutional issue in what we are talking about today. We have raised that issue many times.  Section 9 of article I is very specific: ``No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.'' But it goes further to say ``and a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time.''  If we were to agree to put into place an automatic continuing resolution, we would not follow the Constitution. We put the administration on auto pilot; and we let the Congress say that it is going to be a lot easier to avoid those difficult days and hours, those difficult decisions. Just go on automatic pilot with a CR. Ignore the Constitution.  This is not a good amendment.                              {time}  1800  This is not a good plan. I supported the first amendment of the gentleman, but I cannot support this amendment. I think it flies in the face of the Constitution.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
