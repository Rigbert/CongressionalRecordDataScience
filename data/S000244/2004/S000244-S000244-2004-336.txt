Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit.  Mr. Speaker, passing this motion to recommit will not serve to do anything but to continue a debate that has gone on for almost 45 years. In 1960, the Senate passed an amendment to allow for the appointment of House Members.                              {time}  1730  It was never voted on in the House of Representatives, and that was during the height of the Cold War when everybody was afraid that the Soviet Union would unleash a missile or massive numbers of bombers, and if we did not make it down to the bunker at the Greenbriar in West Virginia, the entire Congress would be wiped out. That was a crisis time, and the Congress did the right thing: It ignored what the Senate did in terms of appointment of House Members.  Sending this resolution back to committee is not going to change anybody's mind on whether replacement House Members should be appointed or elected. We ought to hit this issue directly on the nose and vote on the amendment after defeating the motion to recommit.  Now I am again very puzzled by the fact that many of the proponents of this amendment, including the Commission on Continuity in Government, and their spokesperson is Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute, have said that the problem should be addressed seriously and expeditiously. This is what we are doing today.  And the author of the resolution, who now wants to have more hearings, told Roll Call on October 23, 2003, that the more urgent matter is to put the measure before the body. The measure is before the body today. We ought to vote down the motion to recommit. We ought to have a clear vote on whether Members want to have temporary successors appointed or to preserve Madison's principle of having the People's House be elected by the people. It is time to stand up and be counted, not to have more hearings on the subject. Vote no on the motion to recommit and vote no on the joint resolution.
