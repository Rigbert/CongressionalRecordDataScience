 President, I rise today to introduce legislation not only for myself, but for Senator Heflin, the ranking minority member of the Court Subcommittee of Judiciary, and for Senator Gregg.  This legislation would reauthorize the State Justice Institute [SJI] for 4 more years through fiscal year 2000. Congress originally authorized the State Justice Institute for 4 years in the State Justice Institute Act of 1984, then reauthorized it for 4 more years in 1988, and another 4 years in 1992. The bill I introduce today will authorize annual appropriations for this program of $20 million each of those 4 years.  The requested authorization levels will enable the State Justice Institute to fully carry out its statutory mission to award grants, to improve the quality of justice in State courts throughout the 50 States of our Nation.  The State Justice Institute serves critically important Federal purposes. Just as Federal financial assistance to State and local police, prosecutors, and corrections is critically needed to help them control crime, it is equally imperative that Federal funds assist the State courts that decide 98 percent of the criminal cases brought in this country.  SJI plays an important role in the Nation's response to crime by providing the critically needed funding to support projects that evaluate the effectiveness of new trial and sentencing approaches, and improve judges, performance in cases involving violent crimes and drug abuse.  The Institute also has been a leader in fostering improvements in the civil justice system by supporting efforts to evaluate innovative procedures to reduce litigation delay, demonstrate innovative alternative dispute resolution programs, and increase the public's access to the legal system. In addition, the Institute has devoted considerable resources to improving the public's confidence in both the criminal and civil justice system.  The list of the Institute's current grant priorities reveals just how important it is to our overwhelmed State court system. The Institute's 1996 grants will focus on: children and families in court; improving public confidence in the courts; application of technology; education and training for judges and key court personnel; the relationship between State and Federal courts; and projects following up on recent Institute-supported conferences on court-community collaboration, drug courts, funding the courts, and eliminating race and ethnic bias in the courts.  Mr. President, the Institute has performed the mission Congress assigned it exceedingly well. The judges and court staff who toil in our Nation's underfunded and outmoded State courthouses commend the Institute as the only national source of support for innovation, education, and information about how other States are coping with similar problems in their struggle to better serve the public.  The Institute is the only vehicle the Federal Government has to assure that State courts deliver a high quality of justice to every citizen in every type of case. By doing so, the Institute fulfills the highest standards of federalism. Its seed money bears fruit across the country, carrying out SJI's important national purposes in a cost-efficient manner that maximizes the impact of every dollar that Congress provides.  Reduced to its core, that is State Justice Institute's special role: Supporting promising innovations and spreading the word about them to every key State--and Federal--judge and court official. That saves State and Federal governments significant money, time, and effort on a national scale.  The bill also specifies that funds appropriated to the Institute are available until expended, without regard to the expiration of the year in which they were appropriated, and proposes three technical amendments to the State Justice Institute Act.  Mr. President, as chair of the Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, which has oversight authority over SJI, I am pleased to note that the cosponsor of this bill is the ranking member of that subcommittee, senator Heflin. We urge the Senate to continue its support of the Institute in order to enhance the State courts' ability to deliver effective justice in areas that are critically important to the Federal Government and the American public.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1721       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
