 President, what the H-2B program provides is that guest workers may come into this country on a temporary basis if no qualified U.S. worker is available for that position and that the wages paid to H-2B employees do not adversely impact U.S. wages and working conditions. Unfortunately, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Labor have proposed regulations that would eliminate the labor certification process and move toward a process which has virtually no enforcement mechanisms and which simply takes the employer's word as towhether they are obeying these regulations. In other words: Trust us, we are doing the right thing.  This is absurd. This amendment would simply prohibit the Department of Homeland Security from using any of the funds in this act to implement these proposed regulations. This amendment is supported by Senator Feingold as well.
