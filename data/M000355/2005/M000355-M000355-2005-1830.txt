 President, I ask unanimous consent that today, following the confirmation of the Spellings nomination, the Senate proceed to the confirmation of Condoleezza Rice to be Secretary of State; provided further that there be 2 hours of debate equally divided in the usual form, and that following that debate the Senate proceed to a vote on the confirmation of the nomination with no intervening action or debate.
