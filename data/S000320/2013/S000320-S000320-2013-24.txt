 There is a lot in this bill, a lot of good in this proposed legislation.  I hope that reason will prevail and that people, even if they have some amendments, will come to the floor, as I said earlier, and offer them. Let's debate them, and let's get to regular order, up or down. That is what it is about. But I think the essentials of this bill are solid and good. We have gone into this, and we will go into it more and more. We want the process to work, but the process is not going to work if we don't get the bill up so we can go to the regular order.  So I hope tonight that things will work out and we will get going. This is important legislation.  I yield the floor.
