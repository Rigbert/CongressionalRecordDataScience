 President, last night the two parties reached an agreement on amendments to the highway bill. As the majority leader will indicate shortly, or may already have before I came to the floor, we will be able to move forward on that later today.  I am also happy to report there are a number of strong, very strong, job-creating measures in the mix. One that stands out is Senator Hoeven's amendment on the Keystone XL Pipeline, that massive private sector project that will create 20,000 jobs almost immediately.  Most Americans strongly support building the pipeline and, of course, the significant number of construction jobs that would come along with it. It is incomprehensible to me that the President of the United States, as I read, is actually lobbying against the Keystone Pipeline amendment.
