 President, as the Member of the Senate who has worked closely with Senator Baucus over the last 10 years--either he has been chairman of the committee or I have been--I congratulate him on this 11,000th vote. But more important, I thank him for the close working relationship we have had, which I think people back home in our respective States probably don't observe, which is that there is a great deal of bipartisanship that goes on in Congress. I think Senator Baucus and I have established a close working relationship that refutes that everything in Washington is political. I thank him for that close working relationship and, more importantly, I thank him for putting up with a lot of problems I have created for him.
