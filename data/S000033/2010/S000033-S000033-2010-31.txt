 We won 53 to 45, but around here the majority does not rule. The Republicans filibustered, as they almost always do on anything of substance, and we could not get the 60 votes because we did not get one Republican vote.  The point the Senator was making gets to the heart of this entire issue, which is that our friends over there are fighting vigorously for $700 billion in tax breaks for the top 2 percent--$70 billion a year for the richest people in this country. And when we say to them that senior citizens and disabled vets who are living on $14,000 or $15,000 a year need a check of $250, oh, we can't afford that. But we can afford to give a billionaire a $1 million tax break.
