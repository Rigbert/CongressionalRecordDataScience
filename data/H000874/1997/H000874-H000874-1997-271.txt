Speaker, this is National Teacher Recognition Week. I rise today to recognize three very special teachers in my district: Debbie Lane, Kathleen Donahue, and Deborah Walker. Together they run the title I resource program at Mt. Hope/Nanjemoy Elementary School in Nanjemoy, MD. The Mt. Hope/Nanjemoy Elementary School placed almost a full three points above the countywide average in the Maryland school performance assessment program. This improvement over last year's below average score is due in part to the efforts of these three very distinguished teachers.  The Department of Education joins me in recognizing the Mt. Hope/Nanjemoy Elementary School. This title I program is part of a select group honored by the Department of Education this week.  I salute, Mr. Speaker, these three teachers and the title I resource program for its outstanding success. They touch the future, and the future will be better for their efforts.                          ____________________
