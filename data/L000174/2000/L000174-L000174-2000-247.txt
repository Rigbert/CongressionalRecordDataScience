President, I rise to call the Senate's attention to a recent tribute to the late Justin Brande authored by Professor Carl Reidel of the University of Vermont.  In his article, Professor Reidel captures the spirit of one of the most influential pioneers of 20th Century Vermont environmental stewardship. Justin Brande of Cornwall was among the founders of the Lake Champlain Committee and the Vermont Natural Resources Council, two of the most enduring and effective conservation organizations in our state.  Vermonters committed to stewardship of the land, to clean water and to family farms owe a debt to Justin Brande. He was a leader in organic agriculture and a selfless volunteer for countless community and stewardship organizations who earned the sincere respect of all.  I request that the text of Dr. Reidel's article be prined in the Record and note that his words serve as a wonderful reminder of a life well led and aVermonter whose legacy will nurture future generations. Vermont has been greatly improved because of both Justin Brande and Carl Reidel.  [From the Sunday Rutland (VT) Herald/the Times Argus, May 14, 2000]                  Brande Exemplifies Secret of Vermont                            (By Carl Reidel)       ``What's Vermont's secret?'' a friend in Minnesota asked      after I gave a talk in 1975 about Vermont's innovative      environmental laws. He couldn't understand how such a small      state could be ``so creative, even bold.''       I replied that I didn't know. I had only lived in Vermont      two years.       I'm confident now that I know the secret of Vermont. It is      people like Justin Brande, who lived in Cornwall from 1951      until he died on April 11 at the age of 83. Like so many who      come to live in Vermont from elsewhere, Justin and Susan      Brande knew they were coming home when they moved here. And      the Vermont Constitution asserts that they are real      Vermonters: ``Every person of good character, who comes to      settle in this State . . . shall be deemed a free denizen      thereof, and entitled to all rights of a natural born subject      of this state . . .'' (Chapter II, 66).       After graduating from Williams College and several years of      legal studies, Justin married Susan Kennedy and moved to      Vermont. They settled on a dairy farm in Cornwall, where they      raised eight children. In the late '60's Justin sold their      herd and enrolled at the University of Vermont, where he      earned a master's degree in resource economics. He continued      to work his land, honing the ability to farm organically long      before most people heard of ``organic'' agriculture. I can't      guess how many people he taught over the years to make      compost and garden in ways that made pesticides and chemical      fertilizers unnecessary by drawing on the inherent health of      the land.       Early on Justin became involved in his community as a      relentless advocate for the land--a free denizen who may have      participated in the founding of more Vermont environmental      institutions than anyone I have known. And always as a      volunteer. He has been a delegate or alternate on the      Addison County Regional Planning Commission since its      founding. He helped establish the Lake Champlain      Committee, and was a founder and the first director of the      Vermont Natural Resources Council.       In recent years he co-founded the Smallholders Association,      which advocates ownership of small, sustainable farms and      businesses. Once again, he was ahead of others in seeing the      dangers of large enterprises out of scale with Vermont. He      argued that his call for moderation and limits was ``not      nostalgia for the past, but a real workable model for today      and the future * * * a truly humane, democratic and      sustainable society.''       Former Sen. Art Gibb recalls him as ``a man ahead of his      time, a voice crying in the wilderness'' in his advocacy for      land protection. Gov. Deane Davis who, with Gibb, crafted Act      250, said of him that ``although a staunch environmentalist,      he came to problems open-minded until all the evidence was      in. Then he took his stand. Justin got me started, and kept      after me until Act 250 was signed into law.''       My first encounter with Justin was shortly after I came to      UVM in 1972 to direct the new Environmental Program. One of      the first to teach in the program, his courses seemed to      cover everything from cosmology to composting, with no      student surviving without new respect for the English      language and permanent doubts about conventional economics.       When he offered a course in ``organic gardening''--the      first at UVM--the dean of the College of Agriculture chided      me for allowing such ``nonsense'' in a classroom. It wasn't      the first or last time that Justin Brande defined      conventional thinking.       The secret of Vermont exemplified in Justin Brande's life      is not, however, to be found in this summary of his      accomplishments. Rather, it is in the words of the      Constitution, which define a free denizen of Vermont as a      ``person of good character.'' Justin passed the test in every      way.       He was a person of unusual integrity--a man who lived his      convictions, every day, in every place. Never a traitor to      his beliefs, Justin taught me and many others by example the      deeper meanings of personal integrity.       He was a man of courage who was himself in the presence of      anyone, be it a fellow farmer, college president, governor or      member of Congress. Friend or foe did not daunt him, because      he always put principle above reputation.       He was a man who cared enormously, for family and friends,      for Vermont, for Lake Champlain, for land and life itself.      Justin and I enjoyed a good debate. We could disagree      strongly, but never with an unkind word.       Once, at the end of a lively discussion, he said to me:      ``What I like about you, Reidel, is that you are often in      error, but never in doubt.''       I have no doubts whatsoever that the secret of Vermont is      people like Justin Brande, the every-day denizens who are the      real heroes of this state.                          ____________________
