 President, before I leave the floor, let me say this as well. The chair of the energy committee knows how to write good legislation. We have proof of that before us today. But here is something else: The chair of the energy committee also knows how to pick good staff. Take Mike Brumas as one example. He served as her communications director. He served as communications director for the junior Senator from Alabama, too, and as chief of staff for the State's senior Senator. Mike also spent time covering Washington back when he was a reporter.  Mike Brumas obviously had a lot of experience under his belt by the time he came to work for me. Mike was an important part of my team, he worked hard, and he earned positions of trust among respected Members of our conference and among the Washington press corps. Mike was there both in the minority and in the majority as we made our way through many challenges, but he never let his good humor or his zest for life get lost along the way.  People will tell you that Mike loves history and political history in particular. It is a shared passion that kept me challenged and often entertained. People will tell you a few other things about Mike too. He is always smiling. He is always laughing. He always has a story to tell and a recipe to share. This aspiring chef and endeavoring fly fisherman is happiest when he is with his family--his delightful wife Ann and his sons Alex and Will--and Mike is at his best when he is outdoors camping or biking or just simply enjoying life beyond these walls.  When Mike told me it was his time to retire from the Senate, I was sad to see him go, but at the same time I was glad to see him able to spend more time around the people and things that make Mike, Mike.  Ronald Michael Brumas came to my office as a colleague and leaves as a friend. I thank him for his many years of dedicated service to me and to this body, and I send him best wishes for a retirement that promises to be anything but boring.                          ____________________
