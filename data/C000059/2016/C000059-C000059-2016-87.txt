Chairman, we have a process in place. I certainly won't support subjective Federal decision-makers deciding who is a good employer and who is a bad employer. As a former employer myself, I know that most employers in this country are good people who want to make sure that people have good jobs.  Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
