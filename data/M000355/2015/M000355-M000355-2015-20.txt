 So let's take steps, as the legislation we will consider proposes, to support more jobs, more opportunity, and more economic growth.  Let's enact permanent tax relief for American families and small businesses. Let's set the table for pro-growth tax reform. Let's permanently eliminate an energy policy from the 1970s that not only costs American jobs but also strengthens America's adversaries like Iran and Russia. This will end the absurd position we are in now, where the Iranians, as a result of the President's deal, can export oil and the United States can't.  Here is something else. We know our constituents are deeply concerned about America's national security. So let's take steps, as the legislation we will consider proposes, to strengthen our national security in a dangerous world. Let's help ensure our military has more of the funding it needs to train, equip, and confront the threats that face us from literally every corner of the globe. Let's bolster the FBI's ability to confront terror within our borders. Let's bring badly needed reform to the Visa Waiver Program. The last provision is especially important. Let's prevent the transfer of dangerous terrorists from Guantanamo's secure detention center into America's communities. Let's provide the people we represent with some long overdue protection from cyber attacks. Let's honor our veterans and enact critical reforms to help address the crises we have seen at the VA.  The legislation we will consider today would take steps to strengthen our economy and strengthen our national security. It would also bolster the First Amendment. It would attack key pillars of ObamaCare and prevent a taxpayer bailout of this partisan law. That last provision is especially important. Protecting the middle class from financing a bailout of ObamaCare means we are likely to speed up America's day of liberation from ObamaCare as well.  So here is my view. This legislation helps our economy, helps our national security, and strikes more blows to a partisan health law that hurts the middle class. I think it is legislation worth supporting.                          ____________________
