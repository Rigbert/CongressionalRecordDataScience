Mr. Speaker, I just want to make the point that some misinformation perhaps inadvertently is being spread on this floor, that these stem cells that are derived from cord blood only have a blood application. That is unmitigated nonsense. It is not true. And I pointed out in my opening comments that in the Celgene Cellular Therapeutics first reported back in 2001 that placental stem cells turned into nerve, blood, cartilage, skin and muscle cells, and that since that time other studies have confirmed cord blood's pluripotent capability. Surely there needs to be further research.
