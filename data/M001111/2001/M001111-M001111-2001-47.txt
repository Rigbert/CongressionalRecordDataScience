 In this year's bill, we have provided a good number of resources to deal with the meth problem, including an earmark for the Washington State Methamphetamine Program.  Is it the intent of the Appropriations Committee that the money provided for the Washington State Methamphetamine Program be spread among the participating counties in Washington State, which include the counties of King, Benton, Snohomish, Kitsap, Spokane, Thurston, Pierce, Lewis, Grays Harbor, Mason, Cowlitz, Clark, Grant, Chelan, and Yakima?
