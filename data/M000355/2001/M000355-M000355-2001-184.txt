 FRIST. Yes.  Mr. McCONNELL. Not only is the Senator correct that the last three campaign finance reform bills that cleared the Senate had nonseverability clauses in them, the amendment we voted on a few moments ago--the Harkin amendment, which was supported by 31 colleagues on the other side of the aisle--had a nonseverability clause in it. In fact, the Senator from Tennessee is entirely correct.  When the subject turns to the first amendment and to the constitutional rights of Americans in these kinds of bills, it is the exception not to have a nonseverability clause in it. I am sure the other Senator from Tennessee was not suggesting that nobody would have standing to bring a case affecting so many different people's constitutional rights. I am confident, I say to my friend, the junior Senator from Tennessee, there will be some Americans who will have a standing to bring a suit against this case. I will be leading them. I thank the Senator from Tennessee.
