Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a great public servant of Metro Atlanta and the international aviation community.  For 12 years, Mr. Benjamin R. DeCosta has led the City of Atlanta's Aviation Department and successfully managed Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport--the world's busiest passenger airport. Located in my congressional district, this outstanding internationally-recognized transportation center employs more than 56,000 people and generates more than 400,000 jobs and $23.5 billion in Metro Atlanta's economy. Recently, Mr. DeCosta announced that he will be leaving Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.  I am proud to have known and worked with Mr. DeCosta for over a decade. Whenever I call Ben and his staff about national aviation policy issues and the impact on Hartsfield-Jackson--I could always expect an honest, thorough, and researched answer. Ben successfully led the effort to open a 5th runway, the Maynard H. Jackson, Jr. International terminal, a consolidated rental car center, and upgrades to the central passenger terminal complex. He also managed to award almost 40 percent of contracts that were part of this $6 billion capital improvement initiative to women- and minority-owned businesses.  Consumed with improving customer service and setting higher standards for passengers, Ben has led the airport's team in making the entire experience smoother for those traveling, to, from, and through Hartsfield-Jackson. For example, we worked together to improve the security screening processes at the airport. Now the passenger wait times average less than 10 minutes; the lines may be long, but they move. He also brought numerous retailers to the airport; on both sides of the security check points, you can find great food and shopping for whatever your needs may be while you wait.  It has not been easy; many would have walked away a long time ago. Somehow, Ben rose to the challenge. The aviation community took notice of his successes. Last year, the National Forum of Black Public Administrators (NFBPA) recognized him as the recipient of the 2009 prestigious National Leadership Award. In 2007, Airport Revenue Magazine voted him Best Director. Under his leadership, Hartsfield-Jackson was recognized as the World's Most Efficient Airport for three consecutive years, the world's top airport with Wi-Fi connectivity, and the Executive Traveler's Best Large U.S. airport.  Ben came to Atlanta from New York where he worked for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and served as the general manager of Newark International Airport. He earned a physics undergraduate degree from Queens College and a Juris Doctor degree from New York Law School, and continued his studies as part of a senior executive program for local and state governments at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.  I would like to thank Mr. DeCosta for his service, dedication and success to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and the Metro Atlanta community. I wish him and his family continued success and happiness in the next chapter of his great career.                          ____________________
