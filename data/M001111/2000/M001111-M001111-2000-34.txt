 President, it is with great admiration that I rise to pay tribute to Mr. Bernie Whitebear, of Seattle, Washington, who passed away at the age of 62 on Sunday, July 16, 2000.  A long-standing advocate and leader in the fight for tribal self-determination, Bernie Whitebear was an outstanding role-model for tribal and non-tribal people alike. Known for his vision, humor and commitment, he lives on in the minds and hearts of everyone who knew him.  Bernie Whitebear was born on September 27, 1937 on the Colville Indian Reservation in Eastern Washington. Born into a large family, Bernie grew up confronting many of the barriers facing reservation children, including poverty and discrimination.  As an adult, he moved to Seattle, attended the University of Washington and worked as an engineer for Boeing. He later joined the Army as a paratrooper in the 101st Airborne Division and served as a Green Beret.  During the activism of the late 1960's, Bernie Whitebear emerged as one of the central tribal leaders in the Pacific Northwest and was a tireless advocate for American Indian recognition and empowerment. We often remember his social action, seen through his leadership in the ``invasion'' of Fort Lawton in Seattle in 1970. Bernie and others occupied the Fort Lawton property after plans were announced to list the Fort as surplus property for the city to designate as a park. He felt local tribes had a historic right to the land, which could be better used as a central service base for Seattle's largely unserved urban Indian population.  The 3-month occupation, civil arrests and resulting media attention prompted Congress to order the city of Seattle to negotiate a settlement, which included a 99-year lease on a 20-acre parcel for Whitebear's group. The settlement provided space for construction of the Daybreak Star Art Center, which currently stands in Discovery Park.  I want to share with the Senate one of my favorite memories of Bernie Whitebear. Bernie had invited me to attend the Mini-Pow Wow in my state on February 7, 1998. He asked me to stop by to talk about the People's Lodge, to see the artwork, and to have a quick look at some of the traditional dances. I told Bernie I would stop by, but that I only had a short while because I had a lot of events I needed to attend that day.  I remember when I arrived at the University of Washington Bernie welcomed me with his big bright smile and an outstretched hand. We watched some of the traditional dances, and then I realized that if I didn't leave soon I would be late for my next event. It was one of those days when I was trying to meet as many people as possible. Well Bernie didn't let me just meet the people at the Mini-Pow Wow, he made me stay and understand them. He started by introducing me to everyone in the room.  Then Bernie leaned over to me and explained that it was customary for a visiting United States Senator to move to the front of the dancing group. You know, it was one of the many Native American traditions Bernie told me about that always sounded a little invented to me. Like another old tradition he told me about: That anytime a U.S. Senator stepped foot in Discovery Park he or she had to pay a visit to the Daybreak Star Center. Well there was Bernie asking me to move to the front, and who could say no to Bernie?  He had his arm around me. He was leading me to the front. Everyone was watching, and I went along. The next thing I knew, I was leading about 300 people in a tribal dance. Even though I was not born to be a dancer and I certainly didn't know that particular dance, Bernie made it easy. He had such an open, loving, and compassionate nature that you just couldn't help but feel a part of it. As I looked around, people were smiling, and there was a real sense of comradery and respect shared by everyone in the room. About two hours later, as the event was winding down, I said goodbye to Bernie, and I got into my car.  As I drove away, I realized what Bernie had really done for me that day. He helped me understand Native American cultures from the inside, not as someone sitting on the sidelines watching, but as someone in the middle of the festivities. I felt the sense of community and respect that Bernie was always so proud of. Anyone can talk about those qualities and traditions, but Bernie let me experience them, and he did it with a big grin on his face. I know I'm better off for that experience.  That day shows just how effective Bernie was at getting us to shed our expectations, to realize what we have in common, and to work together.  Throughout his life, Bernie used his own unique style and generous heart to accomplish many things. He founded the United Indians of All Tribes Foundation, which provides education and counseling resources for the estimated 25,000 American Indians in the Puget Sound area. Along with the Daybreak Center and the United Indians Foundation, he worked to sensitize Seattle police to urban Indian issues. Recognizing the persistent need for American Indian health services, he also helped create the Seattle Indian Health Board and later served as its first executive director.  For his many contributions, Bernie Whitebear was awarded numerous honors. In 1997, Governor Gary Locke named him a ``Citizen of the Decade.'' He recently received Seattle's Distinguished Citizen Medal. In 1998, the University of Washington gave him the Distinguished Alumnus of the Year Award. Bernie was a remarkable man with spirit and a warmth that touched everyone he encountered. My thoughts and sympathies are with all of Bernie's family and friends.  Bernie Whitebear acted as a beacon for compassion, cultural understanding and tribal sovereignty in the Puget Sound Region. His legacy is left in all of us who have tremendous respect for the history and cultures of the tribes, a history Bernie would draw us into, by his passion, by his words and by his deeds. I will miss him.                          ____________________
