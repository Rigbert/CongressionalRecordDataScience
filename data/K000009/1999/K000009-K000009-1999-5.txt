Speaker, I thank the chairman of the full committee, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young), and I do underline ``gentleman.'' I want to compliment him on carrying through these negotiations, along with the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Callahan), the chairman of the subcommittee, who have worked so vigilantly with the ranking members of the full committee, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) and also the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee, who has done such a tremendous job in bringing a compromise measure to the floor.  I just want to say before discussion closes here that, as the Wye Accords move forward, I think it is very important for the administration and this Congress to recognize that building peace takes a long time. And we have one important ingredient of the peace process under which the subcommittee, of which I am ranking member, has something to offer; and that is using the tremendous power of our food aid programs under section 416 and P.L. 480 in the West Bank to help Israel with its desalinization efforts and also in Lebanon, because we know the funding in this bill is not sufficient to meet the needs of the peace process.  These programs have largely not been used in this region simply because of the instability of the region. But now that the peace process is moving forward, it is amazing what can be done if we look at a country like Lebanon. Using food aid creatively, monetizing it in a counterpart way, a country could double the number of villages that are being assisted.  In the West Bank this has never been used, and we know that the funds are insufficient there. So we could have a win for America for our farmers, for our rural communities. We could also have a win for the peace process. I wanted to highlight that as these discussions close this morning.  Again, we thank those here who were able to reach a final compromise and bring this measure to conclusion.
