President. I wish to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Town of Hiram, ME. Known today as a gateway to the rugged and beautiful Western Maine Mountains, Hiram was built with a spirit of determination and resiliency that still guides the community today.  Hiram's incorporation on June 14, 1814, was but one milestone on a long journey of progress. For thousands of years, the banks of the Saco River were the hunting grounds of the Sokokis Tribe, and the legendary Pequawket Trail was their route between the Atlantic Ocean and the mountains. The reverence the Sokokis had for the natural beauty and resources of the region is upheld by the people of Hiram today.  The very name of the town, dating to the first European settlement in the 1780s, speaks of this reverence. Like the realm of the biblical King Hiram I of Tyre, the community was established among the trees that were its first source of prosperity. With the fast-moving Saco River and its tributaries providing power, sawmills became an important industry, soon followed by blacksmiths, leather manufacturing, and other endeavors vital to Maine's development. As a junction of two of Maine's early railroads, Hiram became the gateway to the White Mountains of New Hampshire. The wealth produced by the land was invested in schools and churches to create a true community.  The history of Hiram is directly connected to the very birth of our Nation. One of the town's first settlers was General Peleg Wadsworth, whose company of Minutemen answered the call of freedom at Lexington and Concord. After a life of remarkable service to our young country, in the military and in public office, General Wadsworth settled in Hiram in 1807, established a farm, and led the incorporation of the township. It is fascinating to consider the influence the beautiful surroundings had upon his grandson, the poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, who spent many summers in Hiram as a boy.  A quality that runs through Hiram's history is courage. Some 100 young men from the town fought to save our Nation in the Civil War, and 39 gave their lives in that noble cause. It is humbling to know that Pleasant Ridge Cemetery is the final resting place for patriots from four generations of the Lyons family who served with valor and distinction.  Today, Hiram is a charming town of involved citizens. The historic Soldiers Memorial Library, built nearly a century ago in honor of those who defended our country, is avidly supported and remains a center of community activity. The saw and scythe depicted on the new bicentennial seal are reminders of Hiram's past and indicators of the hard work and enthusiasm the townspeople have put into this year's landmark birthday celebration.  This 200th anniversary is not just about something that is measured in calendar years; it is about human accomplishment, an occasion to celebrate the people who for more than two centuries have pulled together, cared for one another, and built a community. Thanks to those who came before, Hiram has a wonderful history. Thanks to those who are there today, it has a bright future.                          ____________________
