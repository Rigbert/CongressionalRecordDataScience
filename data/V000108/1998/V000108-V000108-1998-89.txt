Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to commend the members of the Gary, Indiana, branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Tonight, June 25, 1998, the Gary NAACP will hold its thirty-fifth annual Life Membership Banquet and Scholarship Diner at St. Timothy community Church, in Gary.  This annual event is a major fundraiser for the Gary branch of the NAACP. The funds generated through this activity, and others like it, go directly to the organization's needed programs and advocacy efforts. In addition, the dinner serves to update and keep the community aware of the activities, accomplishments, and accolades of the local and national chapters of the NAACP on an annual basis. This year's banquet will feature the branch's own Dr. Randall C. Morgan, Jr., a resident of Valparaiso, as the keynote speaker. Dr. Morgan, a second generation life member, has been a proud Golden Heritage Member of the NAACP for fifteen years, and he is the immediate past President of the National Medical Association.  Tonight, the Gary NAACP will honor seven of Northwest Indiana's finest leaders for their efforts to further equality in society. Joining more than five hundred outstanding civil, community, and religious leaders of the region, the following distinguished individuals will be inducted as life members of the Gary NAACP: Frances Boler, of Gary; Edward Evans, of Gary; Walter James, of Gary; Floyd Mask, of Gary; Gussie Mask, of Gary; Mozella Stone, of Gary; and James Thomas, of Munster. In addition, Richard Williams, of Gary, will be awarded a scholarship for his excellence as a student, an activist, and a leader. This four thousand dollar scholarship will help finance Richard's college education at a college or university of his choice.  The Gary NAACP was organized in 1915 by a group of residents that felt there was a needfor an organization that would monitor and defend the rights of African-Americans in Northwest Indiana. The national organization, of which the Gary branch is a member, focuses on providing better and more positive ways of addressing the important issues facing minorities in social and job-related settings. Like the national organization, the Gary branch of the NAACP serves its community by combating injustice, discrimination, and unfair treatment in our society.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Frances Boler, Edward Evens, Walter James, Floyd Mask, Gussie Mask, Mozella Stone, James Thomas, and Richard Williams, as well as the other members of the Gary NAACP, for the efforts, activities, and leadership that these outstanding men and women have utilized to improve the quality of life for all residents of Indiana's First Congressional District.                          ____________________
