 On the schedule, last week we talked about the 29th being the target date, and that we were going to get out on the 29th. But that being Friday, we might go over to Saturday if we did not finish on Friday, and we have advised Members to make sure that their Saturday schedule was flexible to accommodate that. But can you clarify that additionally as to what your thoughts are and the possibility of being here on Saturday?  I yield to my friend.
