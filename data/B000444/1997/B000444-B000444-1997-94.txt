 I gave your staff her phone number. She is literally waiting by the phone.  And I might note, Mr. President, I have not found, in my 25 years here, a more accommodating Secretary of State. So she is literally waiting for your call, as they say. If there is business we can conduct in your absence--I do not know if there is any--if there is, maybe we can do that.  I ask unanimous consent to temporarily lay aside, if there is an amendment--is there an amendment at the desk?
