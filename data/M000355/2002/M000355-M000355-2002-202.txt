 President, I rise today to pay tribute to the players and coaches of the 2001 Georgetown College football team.  On December 15, 2001, the Georgetown College Tigers defeated the University of Sioux Falls by a score of 49-27 to win the 46th Annual NAIA Football National Championship. Under the expert leadership of coach Bill Cronin, the Tigers finished with a perfect 14-0 record for the second straight year and became only the 9th team in NAIA history to win consecutive National Championship titles. Clearly, this is a remarkable accomplishment.  Although the Bluegrass State is widely known for producing great basketball teams, the Georgetown College Tigers are doing their very best to let the Nation know that Kentucky is also the home of great football. This season's victory marks the third time the Tigers have claimed the national title and caps a remarkable 28-game winning streak. In addition to bringing home another national championship in 2001, the Tigers also captured their fourth straight Mid-South Conference title. Through hard work, determination, and skill, this team has established itself as a football powerhouse.  It should also be noted for the record that in addition to being star athletes, these players are also dedicated students. Georgetown College has a long standing history of academic excellence and has been rated by U.S. News & World Report as one of the Nation's top liberal arts colleges for the last seven years. During the 2001 season, the Tigers proved they could juggle the intense responsibility of being student-athletes. As a result, 15 Tigers were named Mid-South Conference Scholar-Athletes.  I want to congratulate the Tigers for their tremendous success. They have made the State of Kentucky very proud. I ask each of my colleagues to join me in honoring Georgetown College, history-making coach Billy Cronin, and most importantly each and every talented player on the 2001 Championship Tiger team.                          ____________________
