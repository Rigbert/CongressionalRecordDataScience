I thank the distinguished Senator from Michigan and my distinguished friend and colleague from Colorado for their time.  This is sort of a news update on Kosovo, if I could describe it that way, because several Senators have indicated a strong desire to offer amendments to this bill in regard to the United States' role in Kosovo. I hope that we won't do that. We need this bill to be expedited to send a strong message to our American men and women in uniform. This is not to say, however, that we do not need a frank discussion of ongoing discussions about the United States' role in regard to Kosovo.  I have, as of 3 o'clock this afternoon--we are about an hour after that--the latest report from the peace talks in Rambouillet, France. Secretary of State Albright has just indicated that:       After 17 days of laborious negotiations, Secretary of State      Madeleine Albright said today that ethnic Albanians have      agreed to sign a Kosovo peace agreement within two weeks but      the Serbs continue to balk at a deal.  I will go on with this very briefly.       According to senior U.S. officials, the Serbs still refuse      to permit ethnic Albanians to have a president and are      unwilling to cooperate with a war crimes tribunal looking      into atrocities against civilians.                           *   *   *   *   *       At a news conference by the six-nation Contact Group      overseeing the talks, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine      announced that a new conference on the Kosovo conflict would      be held in France beginning March 15.  So we have a lull. So the peace talks can continue. A cynic might say we drew a line in the sand. And yet, at another time we have gone beyond that line in the sand and our credibility is at stake.  Robin Cook, Foreign Secretary of Great Britain, called for the parties to ``use these three weeks, use them to build peace. . . . We have done a lot here, even if we have not done enough.''  The agreement came 1\1/2\ hours after the deadline for the peace conference had passed. However, in regard to the Serbs, the news is not that good, to say the least. Their Deputy Prime Minister has described the talks as a bust, blaming the United States officials, who he said ``want the blood of the Serbs.''  He said, ``I am afraid the Rambouillet conference failed and we must say very clearly who is guilty for that. But peace appeared as elusive''--right during these talks, Mr. President. ``New fighting''--or continued fighting. Actually, it is old and continued and new fighting--``broke out between the Yugoslav army troops and the Serb police and the ethnic Albanian rebels.''  So we still have war.  The reason I brought all of that up is that there was an article in Monday's Washington Post written by Dr. Henry Kissinger. I think Dr. Kissinger has pretty well summed up some of the concerns, at least, and the frustrations that many Senators have in regard to the lack of clarity in regard to the situation in Kosovo. And, of course, it affects everything we do in the Balkans, not to mention Bosnia.  Dr. Kissinger said this:       In Bosnia, the exit strategy can be described. The existing      dividing lines can be made permanent. Failure to do so will      require their having to be manned indefinitely unless we      change our objective to self-determination and permit each      ethnic group to decide its own fate.  But in Kosovo, Dr. Kissinger certainly pointed out that option doesn't exist. There are no ethnic dividing lines and both sides actually claim the entire territory. Our attitude, the U.S. attitude toward the Serbs attempts to insist that their claim has been made plain. It is the threat of bombing. But how do we and NATO react to Albanian transgressions? Are we prepared to fight both sides and for how long?  As a matter of fact, Secretary Albright indicated if the Albanians didn't get along, we could not bomb the Serbs. That seems to me to be a little bit unprecedented and unique. As a matter of fact, I think it is a little nutty.  But at any rate, are we prepared to fight both sides and for how long?       In the face of issues such as these, the unity of the      contact group of powers acting on behalf of NATO is likely to      dissolve. Russia surely will increasingly emerge as the      supporter of the Serbian point of view.  And then Dr. Kissinger goes on, and I will not take the time of the Senate in regard to his entire statement, but he sums up by saying: ``Each incremental deployment into the Balkans is bound to weaken our ability to deal with Saddam Hussein and North Korea.''  You draw the line in the sand. That time expires, and it is a problem in terms of our credibility.       The psychological drain may be even more grave. Each time      we make a peripheral deployment, the administration is      constrained to insist that the danger to American forces is      minimal--the Kosovo deployment is officially described as a      ``peace implementation force.''       Such comments have two unfortunate consequences: They      increase the impression among Americans that military force      can be used casualty-free,--  And obviously that is a big concern on the part of everyone--     and they send a signal of weakness to potential enemies. For      in the end our forces will be judged on how adequate they are      for peace imposition, not peace implementation.  I ask unanimous consent that the full statement of Dr. Kissinger be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 22, 1999]                   No. U.S. Ground Forces for Kosovo      leadership doesn't mean that we must do everything ourselves                          (By Henry Kissinger)       President Clinton's announcement that some 4,000 troops      will join a NATO force of 28,000 to help police a Kosovo      agreement faces all those concerned with long-range American      national security policy with a quandary.       Having at one time shared responsibility for national      security policy and the extrication from Vietnam, I am      profoundly uneasy about the proliferation of open-ended      American commitments involving the deployment of U.S. forces.      American forces are in harm's way in Kosovo, Bosnia and the      gulf. They lack both a definition of strategic purpose by      which success can be measured and an exit strategy. In the      case of Kosovo, the concern is that America's leadership      would be impaired by the refusal of Congress to approve      American participation in the NATO force that has come into      being largely as a result of a diplomacy conceived and      spurred by Washington.       Thus, in the end, Congress may feel it has little choice      but to go along. In any event, its formal approval is not      required. But Congress needs to put the administration on      notice that it is uneasy about being repeatedly confronted      with ad hoc military missions. The development and      articulation of a comprehensive strategy is imperative if we      are to avoid being stretched too thin in the face of other      foreseeable and militarily more dangerous challenges.       Before any future deployments take place, we must be able      to answer these questions: What consequences are we seeking      to prevent? What goals are we seeking to achieve? In what way      do they serve the national interest?       President Clinton has justified American troop deployments      in Kosovo on the ground that ethnic conflict in Yugoslavia      threatens ``Europe's stability and future.'' Other      administration spokesmen have compared the challenge to that      of Hitler's threat to European security. Neither statement      does justice to Balkan realities.       The proposed deployment in Kosovo does not deal with any      threat to American security as traditionally conceived. The      threatening escalations sketched by the president--to      Macedonia or Greece and Turkey--are in the long run more      likely to result from the emergence of a Kosovo state.       Nor is the Kosovo problem new. Ethnic conflict has been      endemic in the Balkans for centuries. Waves of conquests have      congealed divisions between ethnic groups and religions,      between the Eastern Orthodox and Catholic faiths; between      Christianity and Islam; between the heirs of the Austrian and      Ottoman empires.       Through the centuries, these conflicts have been fought      with unparalleled ferocity because none of the populations      has any experience with--and essentially no belief in--     Western concepts of toleration. Majority rule and compromise      that underlie most of the proposals for a ``solution'' never      have found an echo in the Balkans.       Moreover, the projected Kosovo agreement is unlikely to      enjoy the support of the parties for a long period of time.      For Serbia, acquiescing under the threat of NATO bombardment,      it involves nearly unprecedented international intercession.      Yugoslavia, a sovereign state, is being asked to cede control      and in time sovereignty of a province containing its national      shrines to foreign military force.       Though President Slobodan Milosevic has much to answer for,      especially in Bosnia, he is less the cause of the conflict in      Kosovo than an expression of it. On the need to retain      Kosovo, Serbian leaders--including Milosevic's domestic      opponents--seem united. For Serbia, current NATO policy means      either dismemberment of the country or postponement of the      conflict to a future date when, according to the NATO      proposal, the future of the province will be decided.       The same attitude governs the Albanian side. The Kosovo      Liberation Army (KLA) is fighting for independence, not      autonomy. But under the projected agreement, Kosovo, now an      integral part of Serbia, is to be made an autonomous and      self-governing entity within Serbia, which, however, will      remain responsible for external security and even exercise      some unspecified internal police functions. A plebiscite at      the end of three years is to determine the region's future.       The KLA is certain to try to use the cease-fire to expel      the last Serbian influences from the province and drag its      feet on giving up its arms. And if NATO resists, it may come      under attack itself--perhaps from both sides. What is      described by the administration as a ``strong peace      agreement'' is likely to be at best the overture to another,      far more complicated set of conflicts.       Ironically, the projected peace agreement increases the      likelihood of the various possible escalations sketched by      the president as justification for a U.S. deployment. An      independent Albanian Kosovo surely would seek to incorporate      the neighboring Albanian minorities--mostly in Macedonia--and      perhaps even Albania itself. And a Macedonian conflict would      land us precisely back in the Balkan wars of earlier in this      century. Will Kosovo then become the premise for a NATO move      into Macedonia, just as the deployment in Bosnia is invoked      as justification for the move into Kosovo? Is NATO to be the      home for a whole series of Balkan NATO protectorates?       What confuses the situation even more is that the American      missions in Bosnia and Kosovo are justified by different,      perhaps incompatible, objectives. In Bosnia, American      deployment is being promoted as a means to unite Croats,      Muslims and Serbs into a single state. Serbs and Croats      prefer to practice self-determination but are being asked to      subordinate their preference to the geopolitical argument      that a small Muslim Bosnian state would be too precarious and      irredentist. But in Kosovo, national self-determination is      invoked to produce a tiny state nearly certain to be      irredentist.       Since neither traditional concepts of the national interest      nor U.S. security impel the deployment, the ultimate      justification is the laudable and very American goal of      easing human suffering. This is why, in the end, I went along      with the Dayton agreement insofar as it ended the war by      separating the contending forces. But I cannot bring myself      to endorse American ground forces in Kosovo.       In Bosnia, the exit strategy can be described. The existing      dividing lines can be made permanent. Failure to do so will      require their having to be manned indefinitely unless we      change our objective to self-determination and permit each      ethnic group to decide its own fate.       In Kosovo, that option does not exist. There are no ethnic      dividing lines, and both sides claim the entire territory.      America's attitude toward the Serbs' attempts to insist on      their claim has been made plain enough; it is the threat of      bombing. But how do we and NATO react to Albanian      transgressions and irredentism? Are we prepared to fight both      sides and for how long? In the face of issues such as these,      the unity of the contact group of powers acting on behalf of      NATO is likely to dissolve. Russia surely will increasingly      emerge as the supporter of the Serbian point of view.       We must take care not to treat a humanitarian foreign      policy as a magic recipe for the basic problem of      establishing priorities in foreign policy. The president's      statements ``that we can make a difference'' and that America      symbolizes hope and resolve'' are exhortations, not policy      prescription. Do they mean that America's military power is      available to enable every ethnic or religious group to      achieve self-determination? Is NATO to become the artillery      for ethnic conflict? If Kosovo, why not East Africa or      Central Asia? And would a doctrine of universal humanitarian      intervention reduce or increase suffering by intensifying      ethnic and religious conflict? What are the limits of such a      policy and by what criteria is it established?       In my view, that line should be drawn at American ground      forces in Kosovo. Europeans never tire of stressing the need      for greater European autonomy. Here is an occasion to      demonstrate it. If Kosovo presents a security problem, it is      to Europe, largely because of the refugees the conflict might      generate, as the president has pointed out. Kosovo is no more      a threat to America than Haiti was to Europe--and we never      asked for NATO support there. The nearly 300 million      Europeans should be able to generate the ground forces to      deal with 2.3 million Kosovars. To symbolize Allied unity on      larger issues, we should provide logistics, intelligence and      air support. But I see no need for U.S. ground forces;      leadership should not be interpreted to mean that we must do      everything ourselves.       Soonor or later, we must articulate the American capability      to sustain a global policy. The desire to do so landed us in      the Vietnam morass. Even if one stipulates an American      strategic interest in Kosovo (which I do not), we must take      care not to stretch ourselves too thin in the face of far      less ominous threats in the Middle East and Northeast Asia.       Each incremental deployment into the Balkans is bound to      weaken our ability to deal with Saddam Hussein and North      Korea. The psychological drain may be even more grave. Each      time we make a peripheral deployment, the administration is      constrained to insist that the danger to American forces is      minimal--the Kosovo deployment is officially described as a      ``peace implementation force.''       Such comments have two unfortunate consequences: They      increase the impression among Americans that military force      can be used casualty-free, and they send a signal of weakness      to potential enemies. For in the end our forces will be      judged on how adequate they are for peace imposition, not      peace implementation.       I always am inclined to support the incumbent      administration in a forceful assertion of the national      interest. And as a passionate believer in the NATO alliance,      I make the distinctions between European and American      security interests in the Balkans with the utmost reluctance.      But support for a strong foreign policy and a strong NATO      surely will evaporate if we fail to anchor them in a dear      definition of the national interest and impart a sense of      direction to our foreign policy in a period of turbulent      change.
