Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I am not going to take further time. I understand there are other amendments and other debates that need to be considered.  I certainly thank my colleague, the gentleman from New York, He has been a pleasure to work with, on a very important issue. I also want to salute the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Knollenberg] and the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Hoke], who share our feelings on this important issue, as well as my colleague from Chicago, the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Lipinski], who is a cosponsor of this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
