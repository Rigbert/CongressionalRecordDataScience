 The Senator from Kentucky.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Wyoming for his important contribution to this issue and express to our colleagues that we intend to stay interested in this. There is some indication in today's paper that some accommodation to the WAC and to the Conference USA may be forthcoming. But I want to reassure all of those who have been left out that the antitrust case is clear and that the four of us plan to continue our interest in this, if the problem is not solved by the organizations themselves. I thank my friend from Wyoming for his important contribution.
