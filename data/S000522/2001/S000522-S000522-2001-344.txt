Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, in an emotional appeal before the House Committee on International Relations last Tuesday, the wife of Dr. Li Shaomin and the husband of Dr. Gao Zhan, two highly respected scholars held hostage by the People's Republic of China, asked Congress and the President to leave no stone unturned in securing the release of their loved ones.  Also at that hearing, Mike Jendrzejczyk of Human Rights Watch made a number of incisive comments and said, ``The detentions of respected China scholars have sent a shock wave through the international academic community. Many researchers are increasingly worried about the risks of working in China, and have taken extraordinary steps to speak out.''  He noted on April 17, more than 400 leading scholars from 14 countries, as well as Taiwan and Hong Kong, all of them who work in the field of China studies, sent a petition to President Jiang Zemin. The authors of the letter noted that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the latter, which was ratified last February, makes it very clear that holding academics and scholars are precluded by international law. Movever, China's intolerance to free expression will likelydeter other academics from pursuing research in the People's Republic of China. The respected human rights leader bottom-lines it and says, ``The detentions raise serious questions about the rule of law in China and whether it exists.''  Indeed, Madam Speaker, at least six Chinese American scholars and intellectuals are today being unjustly detained. They are being held hostage by the PRC, an outrage that demands immediate relief. H. Res. 160, which I introduced on June 8 and now has approximately 40 cosponsors, calls for the immediate and unconditional release of these scholars and academics.  These include: Dr. Li Shaomin, who is a United States citizen and scholar who has been detained by the PRC for 120 days and counting. He has been deprived of his basic human rights by arbitrary arrest, detention and indictment, and has not been allowed to contact his wife and child, both of whom are American citizens as well, nor has he been in contact with his lawyer.  Dr. Gao Zhan is a permanent resident of the United States and is a member of the faculty of American University. She has been detained by the People's Republic of China for 134 days and counting.  Mr. Wu Jianmin is an American citizen and author who has been detained by China and deprived of his basic human rights by arbitrary arrest and detention.  Qin Guangguang is a permanent resident of the United States and a researcher who has been detained by China on suspicions of leaking state secrets. His human rights have been violated by arbitrary arrest and detention.  Ms. Teng Chunyan is a permanent resident of the United States, a researcher and a Falun Gong practitioner. She has been sentenced to 3 years in prison for spying by the PRC. The apparent reason for her sentence is her research showing that the PRC is violating the human rights of Falun Gong adherents in China. If that is true, Madam Speaker, the U.S. State Department is guilty of that charge. This country's Report on Human Rights Practice, which catalogs the myriad of human rights abuses by China, also points out that at least 100 Falun Gong were tortured to death last year as part of their crackdown.  Then there is Mr. Liu Yaping. He is a permanent resident of the United States and a businessman. He was arrested in Inner Mongolia in March 2001. He has been diagnosed with severe health problems while in detention, including a brain aneurysm which may rupture. The reason for his arbitrary arrest and detention are unclear. He has had no contact with his family, and has not had regular access to his lawyers.  Madam Speaker, at a hearing of the Committee on International Relations, noting that both she and her husband, Li Shaomin, are American citizens, Liu Yingli testified, ``If China's Ministry of State Security can get away with imprisoning my husband now, it may well detain more academics in China in the future, regardless of their skin color, or country of origin.''  Despite the fact that Dr. Li is not a political activist or dissident, but is a teacher who worked for AT in New Jersey for 8 years, Liu Yingli said, ``This case is not just about the freedom of one man, but about academic freedom.'' Again, Dr. Li has been held hostage for 120 days.  Liu Yingli also testified, ``It has been nearly 4 months since Li Shaomin's detention on February 25: 4 months of grief and pain, 4 months of worry and fear. But we are American citizens. We should not have to live with such fears.''  She said, ``This painful experience has not spared our daughter, who is only 9, and our parents, who are more than 70 years old. Our family has spent sleepless nights and restless days waiting for news of Shaomin. Our daughter, Diana, has asked repeatedly when Daddy will come home.''                              {time}  1530  Madam Speaker, when this unjust detention was brought to my attention I expressed concern and dismay. But when I met with Liu and her daughter--I knew more--much more had to be done. Diana, the 9-year-old daughter of Dr. Li asked me to help her dad. She composed two letters and drawings in crayon that really hit home with me. One that was for me and one I was asked to give to President Bush. I would just like to quote the one that I gave to the President on April 25. I hand delivered it to him.  ``Hi, Mr. President,  ``My name is Diana Li. I am 9 years old. I have never written to a President before in my life. Now I am writing because China has captured my daddy, Shaomin Li. I need your help to rescue my daddy. Would you please help me? I miss my daddy very much. I can imagine if you were captured by China, your daughters would miss you very much, too. And so would their mom.  ``Please help me rescue my daddy. Thank you. Diana Li.''  Madam Speaker, let us hope that the crayon is mightier than the sword and that Beijing will understand the extreme folly of their hostage-taking and listen as well to the plea of a 9-year-old asking for her father.  And, Madam Speaker, the cases of the other hostages are equally compelling. At the hearing last Tuesday, we also heard from Donghua Xue, the husband of Dr. Gao Zhan, who has been held hostage for 134 days. Mr. Xue, a senior systems analyst at EDS Corporation, told us how on February 11 when he and his wife, a U.S. permanent resident and research fellow at American University and their 5-year-old son Andrew, an American citizen, were leaving China after a brief vacation, were arrested and detained. To quote Mr. Xue.  ``The three of us were separated by force, blindfolded and held in three different places.''  Donghua was held for 26 days. His 5-year-old son, an American citizen, was separately held for 26 days without any contact whatsoever with his parents or family members. Even our embassy in Beijing was in the dark about this littlest hostage who, I need to say again, is an American citizen.  Madam Speaker, it was and is abundantly clear that Mr. Xue is desperately worried about his wife's condition, and he told us at the hearing that her attorneys in Beijing have made several attempts to visit her and they have all been denied. The only reason we can think of, he went on to say, is that she perhaps has been physically tortured or at least has some obvious wounds that they do not want the outside world to see. In a word he went on, ``My wife Gao Zhan is in a very dangerous situation. I am calling on the American government to try even harder to help.''  In his testimony, Madam Speaker, Mr. Xue also underscored the Chinese government's rhetorical commitment to the rule of law. He said ``the Chinese Ambassador to the U.S. emphasized several times in his letters to the congressional Members and to U.S. officials that, quote, ``China is a country ruled by laws.'' The spokesman from the Chinese foreign minister has said that they, quote, ``strictly follow the legal procedures to deal with the scholars' cases.''  ``I certainly wish that these statements were true,'' he went on, ``but from my nightmare experience in China, the statements are far from reality. To make a family disappear from the earth for almost a month, to illegally detain my son Andrew,'' he testified, ``a U.S. citizen for 26 days, without even notifying the U.S. embassy, to separate a 5-year-old American child by force from his legal guardians and his family, to emotionally and psychologically torture a 5-year-old child for several weeks just for interrogations hostage. These actions not only violate Chinese and international laws and U.S.-China treaties, these actions are inhuman and they are barbaric. We can only associate these actions with the terrorism organizations, not with a country that purports to be ruled by laws.''  Mr. Xue also made an important comparison, Madam Speaker, with the way in which his wife's case has been portrayed and that of our 24 detained servicemen and women from the EP-3E reconnaissance aircraft. I quote him again:  ``When our 24 crew members had been detained in China, they were allowed to meet with U.S. officials. They were allowed to send messages to their families. They lived in a hotel condition according to news reports. They were finally released after 11 days of diplomatic negotiations. We don't know where our scholars are. We don't knowanything about my wife's health condition. But one thing we are 100 percent sure of, they are not living in a hotel condition. Why do they treat crew members and the scholars so differently? It is the Chinese government who is discriminating against the Chinese people. I hope the American government pays the same effort as they did for the crew members to rescue these detained scholars.''  Madam Speaker, I urge the passage of this resolution. Hopefully, this is the first step in raising everyone's consciousness concerning this outrage of hostage-taking of these Chinese Americans.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
