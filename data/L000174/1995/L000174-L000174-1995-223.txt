President, I have earlier discussed his amendment with the Senator from Maine. There is much I find very appealing, for a number of the reasons that he has laid out. There have been just a couple of questions raised on this side. I wonder if we might delay any action just for a few more minutes.  What I am going to do is suggest the absence of a quorum, but it will be only for a very few--I see the chairman may have something else to say about it. But I suggest, in a few more minutes we may be able to resolve this whole issue. I am sure that would be agreeable to the Senator from Maine.
