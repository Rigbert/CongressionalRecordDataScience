 President, I wish to recognize Dr. Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, whose nomination to be Deputy Secretary at the Department of Energy was confirmed today.  Throughout her career, Dr. Sherwood-Randall has been an exemplary public servant and academic. She has mastered the domain of nuclear issues, arms control, European affairs and has served her country at the highest of levels. I am confident she will continue her impressive record of service and will be an excellent Deputy Secretary of Energy.  At the outset of her career she was a foreign policy advisor to then-Senator Joe Biden.  In the Clinton administration she served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia.  In the Obama administration she was Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for European Affairs at the National Security Council and later White House Coordinator for Defense Policy, Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction and Arms Control.  When not serving in government, she held a variety of academic roles affiliated with Harvard and Stanford Universities and the Council on Foreign Relations.  The mission of the Energy Department is ``to ensure America's security and prosperity by addressing its energy, environmental and nuclear challenges through transformative science and technology solutions.''  As the chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee for Energy and Water Development, I know the complexities of the issues facing the new Deputy Secretary. I also know that it will be invaluable to the Energy Department to have a well-rounded leadership team.  The current Secretary of Energy is well-steeped in energy issues. Dr. Sherwood-Randall brings expertise in the national security realm, which is becoming more and more important and related to energy issues. This leadership model has been proven to work and I trust this combination of skills will result in smart energy policy and strong management.  For example, a key part of the Department's mission--and one which is a high priority for me--is the responsibility to secure and dispose of nuclear and radiological material. For this, I am encouraged by Dr. Sherwood-Randall's long history of experience working on non-proliferation issues.  It remains a priority of mine to enact a national policy to store our nuclear waste. Nuclear waste is piling up all around the country and we are losing millions of dollars every year in the absence of a coherent policy. This is why I have introduced, and will continue to push, legislation which establishes an interim national policy to safely store our nuclear waste.  It should be obvious that this is precisely the type of issue that Dr. Sherwood-Randall will be adept at navigating, and I look forward to working with her on this and many other issues.  In sum, the nominee before us today is a skilled policy advisor, an accomplished academic and a dedicated American public servant.  It is with great pleasure that I support her nomination today and I thank my colleagues for their vote to confirm her.                          ____________________
