I had 2 minutes left for closing. I did not know the gentleman was closing, that he was speaking on the remaining 5 minutes he had. Do I still have the right to close or do I have to use up the time?  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The gentleman from California is just exhausting his own time. The gentleman from Alaska still has 2\1/2\ minutes remaining.
