Speaker, I rise this evening to include for the Record a letter that was sent today by myself to both President Bush and President Fox of Mexico.  Tomorrow will be an historic day here in this Chamber as we welcome the President of Mexico, Vicente Fox, to hear his remarks as the new President of Mexico. Following that address, both Presidents will then travel to our home district, the Ninth District of Ohio, the greater Toledo area.  With respect to their visit, we certainly want to extend an official welcome to both Presidents on their historic journey, and we look forward to their visit and to their remarks.  We also hope that both Presidents will listen and learn as our citizenry attempts to draw them into a dialogue about the conditions of workers and education in our region, and other concerns on the minds of our citizens.  We hope that, building on this trip, more important than any single day would be a request that we are sending to both Presidents to establish a working relationship between their administrations in the form of an intercontinental organization on working life and cooperation in the Americas, to actually set up a means by which we could deal with some of the unintended economic and social consequences of NAFTA in both nations.  The serious dislocation of millions of industrial and agricultural workers, as well as small- and medium-sized firms, demands serious and compassionate action by those sworn to serve their fellow citizens.  In our own region of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, since NAFTA well over 115,000 more good-paying jobs have been lost to the maquiladora zone, where workers in that region toil for hunger wages and have no job security.  Ohio is among the top five States losing jobs to NAFTA, and nationally, since NAFTA, over 776,000 middle-class jobs have been relocated to the maquiladora zone.  Most recently, Phillips Electronics in Ottawa, Ohio, where we hope both Presidents will ultimately visit, is the latest plant that has announced its shutdown of large portions of production, terminating hundreds and hundreds of middle-class workers, those jobs going to Mexico.  Spangler's Candy in Bryan, Ohio, announced it will shift its candy cane line production to Mexico.  Last week in Chicago, Brach's Candy, employing 1,500 people, with a major segment of Latino-American workers, announced it is shutting down its centuries-old factory there and moving production south to Mexico, or possibly Argentina.  The displacement of high-paying middle-class manufacturing jobs across our country is fueled by NAFTA, and will only worsen if the proposed Free Trade Agreement of the Americas ignores the plight of workers. This is why we are pleading with both Presidents to set up a formal mechanism that intercontinentally deals with these serious distortions in our labor markets.  There are 3,200 firms in the maquilladora zone, and most of those employ largely women workers, have no freely-lected labor representation, no job security, and people work in high-productivity poverty.  The U.S.-Mexico border, meanwhile, is plagued more and more by alarming rates of tuberculosis on both sides, sewage effluent flowing into drinking water, moot environmental laws, and crumbling infrastructure that cannot bear the load being placed on it.  The root causes of the illegal immigration crisis in our country lie in deep and continuing disparity between the compensation and living standards of workers on either side of the border. Our continent needs a common minimum wage and common labor standards and common environmental laws that are enforced.  The chart that I have here this evening gives some sense of what has happened to the United States since NAFTA's passage. Prior to NAFTA's passage, we had a favorable trade balance with Mexico, which means that we were exporting more there than importing.  Since that time, what has happened is we have been racking up historic deficits with Mexico, and in fact, Mexico has become the export platform that we predicted. What the trade deficit translates into are thousands and thousands of lost jobs from our country, and the exports that go down there actually U-turn. They come back to us in the form of finished goods.  But the wages of the people in Mexico have actually gone down since NAFTA, and our wages have been stuck in this country for well over a decade.  In the countryside in Mexico, over 30 million farm families have been removed from their land simply because the trade agreement provides no soft landing for people who have eked out a living on their small ajita lands.  These people are moving across our continent. Hundreds and hundreds are literally dying, some at our border, some inside our country. We simply must have a task force on this international, intercontinental organization that I am proposing to deal with this agricultural issue.  Mr. Speaker, we will invite both Presidents to travel with us to the sites that I am talking about in both the United States and Mexico.  I include for the Record the formal letter we have sent to both of them, along with an article from today's Los Angeles Times entitled ``Toledo's Plea to Presidents Bush and Fox: Don't let trade cost jobs.''  The material referred to is as follows:         Toledo's Plea to Bush, Fox: Don't Let Trade Cost Jobs                           (By Megan Garvey)       Toledo, Ohio.--Even as President Bush and Mexican President      Vicente Fox prepare to visit this industrial city known for      strong unions, ethnic neighborhoods and fierce opposition to      free trade, unemployment checks will be going out to workers      laid off at the Jeep plant.       Bush plans to come here Thursday to tout his commitment to      helping Mexican immigrants pursue the American dream and, the      White House says, ``again commemorate the very important role      that Mexicans and Hispanic Americans play in our American      culture.       With a Mexican American community that dates to the 1930s,      not many in Toledo have a problem with that.       They just think that it's beside the point.       The point--what concerns Toledo's white majority, its      sizable Mexican American population and even many of the      undocumented workers who harvest northwestern Ohio's tomato      and cucumber crops each year--is not immigration or culture.       It's jobs.       To many in this gritty Great Lakes port on the southwest      tip of Lake Erie, free trade means the flight of jobs to low-     wage places like Mexico. And although the U.S. industrial      heartland has prospered in the years since the U.S.-Mexico      border was opened through the North American Free Trade      Agreement in 1994, Bush and Fox have chosen a dicey time to      come to Toledo: The manufacturing recession that began about      a year ago is taking its toll here.       And Ohio is losing jobs as companies move to Mexico for its      cheap, nonunion labor--from a Mr. Coffee plant that lost      about 320 jobs, to Amana's kitchen range plant where almost      645 more positions disappeared. Then there is      DaimlerChrysler's Jeep plant, where union workers who thought      they had guaranteed jobs are being laid off, even as the      company spends $300 million to expand its Toluca, Mexico,      plant to meet demand for the popular PT Cruiser.       ``It's not about race or ethnicity,'' said Toledo native      Marcy Kaptur, a Democrat who has represented the area in      Congress for more than two decades. ``We're beyond all that.      It's about economics.''       Toledo officials, who bill their town as ``A Renaissance      City,'' have fought hard to keep jobs, cutting deals to      entice new auto industry investment and pushing for a      riverfront development zone, which is up for a vote.       Still, economic projections for the state and region show      job growth mainly in low-paying service industry jobs.      Manufacturing employment, long Toledo's backbone, has      declined. And like other Rust Belt cities, the decline in      high-paying manufacturing jobs translates into declining      population: The city of Toledo has lost more than 20,000      residents since 1990, according to the most recent census      figures.       While many here blame NAFTA, free-trade proponents point to      figures that show Ohio's exports to Mexico have risen from      $709 million annually to nearly $2 billion in the years since      the pact was concluded.                even migrants are losing work to mexico       At Tony Packo's Cafe, a Hungarian place on Toledo's east      side that makes it own hot dogs, the regulars say much the      same thing.       ``There is no doubt in anyone's mind here that free trade      has cost good jobs. No doubt,'' says Ken Oehlers, 59, a      retired teacher who grew up in the Old North End.       More surprising, perhaps, is that some of the migrant      Mexican farm workers who gather tomatoes in the wide, flat      field south of town for Heinz tomato paste, or cucumbers for      the Vlasic pickle plant, echo that view.       Wages are so low south of the border, pickers say, that      tomato-growing operations long based in the United States are      shifting to Mexico. So migrant workers who come to the U.S.      are losing out to Mexican workers back home.       In Toledo, local pride is important. Tony Packo's hot dogs,      a visitor quickly learns, were the favorites of the cross-     dressing Cpl. Klinger of ``MASH'' fame.       There is similar pride in the city's historical role in      building cars--pride now mingled with a sense of betrayal.      Workers think the new economy has not played fair with them,      that it has not abided by its own rules.       DiamlerChrysler's decision to eliminate 1,500 jobs when it      stopped manufacturing the Jeep Cherokee caught many local      politicians and United Auto Workers leaders by surprise.       A few years before, the city went to great expense to      persuade the auto maker to build a plant here to make the      Cherokee's replacement, the Jeep Liberty. The deal came with      massive tax breaks and other inducements, and, the people of      Toledo believed, the promise to keep 5,000 union jobs in      town.       But shortly after the Liberty plant opened, the Cherokee      workers were laid off, rather than moved to other lines or      given their own line converted for another vehicle.       What particularly galls locals is the fact that those jobs      were cut even as the company has had trouble keeping up with      demand for its retro-style PT Cruiser. The Cruiser's      transmissions are made in Toledo, but the car is assembled in      Mexico.       ``We had a line shut down here that put more than 1,000      people out of work,'' said Larry Jamra, 58, a business owner      who counts himself as one of the relatively few Toledo      voters who supported the Republican ticket in the last      presidential election. ``But that's NAFTA--it put every      business in a position of knowing they could do things for      half the price in Mexico, and that's just good business.''       Jamra grew up with Oehlers, the retired teacher, who says      most people in Toledo aren't mad at Mexicans about what's      happened. They're furious with the corporations.       ``We don't see the standard of living being raised in      Mexico,'' Oehlers said, ``And wasn't that part of the point      of free trade?''       Juan Perez Quiroz, a 48-year-old Mexican working on      Toledo's rural outskirts, reflects what Oehlers and others      see as the problem: Wages remain so low in Mexico, despite      free trade, that coming north still pays, even for a low-wage      field hand.       What's worse, even itinerant farm workers like Quiroz      apparently are being undercut by desperate workers back home.       Midday in the August heat, Quiroz stands idle in a tomato      packing shed.       When the pickers reported for duty at first light, the      current crop was judged too small, and most were sent back to      the camps for a forced day off; no pay.       Quiroz shrugs it off, having learned in the five years he      has been making the trip north from his home in Mexico that      this sometimes happens. College-educated, a retired      agricultural engineer with a modest government pension,      Quiroz still makes more in 12 to 16 grueling hours of packing      fresh tomatoes than he could back home.                      A Question of ``Disbalance''       In Mexico his children are professionals: a lawyer, a      soccer player, a college professor and a plant manager.       Still, when he considered his own economic future, Quiroz      and his wife elected to make their way to U.S. farm fields      where he can get $10,000 for eight months' work, more than      three times what he could earn in the local tortilla factory      in Mexico--the best job he could find there.       Quiroz, who plans to go with other migrant workers to see      Fox and Bush speak, said he would tell his president that he      can't live a good life in Mexico for the wages he can get.       ``The main problem in Mexico is the disbalance,'' Quiroz      said. ``The price of products is more than the wages paid.''       UAW local President Bruce Baumhower says he is up against      that too. ``Every one of the companies we've gone in to      bargain with said, `We could move down there and make it      [their product] for nothing.' '' Stories like his distress      Rep. Kaptur, whose constituents still recall the time she      took President Clinton to task for his position on trade,      embarrassing him onstage in 1996 as he stumped for president      in her hometown.       Kaptur--who has yet to hear from the White House about the      trip to her district--won't get an opportunity to speak her      mind when Bush and Fox visit a community center that serves a      largely Latino clientele, and then the University of Toledo,      where the presidents plan to speak about education.       Her feelings haven't changed, though.       ``America's biggest internal conflict was the Civil War,      which was fought over the expansion of the slave system into      the West. All we've done with the trade issue is move the      border,'' she said.       Many of her concerns are shared by Mexican American leader      Baldemar Velasquez, whose Farm Labor Organizing Committee      represents about 7,000 migrant workers. Velasquez said his      members also believe the post-NAFTA economy has meant fewer      decent-paying jobs.       ``People try to paint those who are anti-NAFTA as anti-     Mexican, and it's the exact opposite,'' Velasquez said. ``A      lot of these people can't see the forest through the trees.      Without organized labor you lose that necessary tension      between people driven to accumulate wealth and the workers      who help them do that.       ``In Mexico there is no tension--and if we allow that to      become the standard then we are just going back in history.''       Many credit Velasquez's presence with keeping Toledo's      unions focused on economic disparities, not racial      differences. Toledo, in fact, has been used as a model for      other Midwestern cities grappling with rapidly expanding      Latino populations.       Out in one of the cucumber fields, where the late-harvest      cucumbers have grown too large to be considered premium--     meaning small enough to be pickled whole--Velasquez talked      about economic realities.       Under a hard-fought bargaining agreement won by his      organization, workers get $28 per 100 pounds of premium      cucumbers picked, plus $6.20 an hour minimum wage. In Mexico,      the same yield would earn slightly more than $1 per day.       Velasquez agreed to participate in the presidential visit      despite having turned down invitations to the Clinton White      House out of fear, in his words, of being a prop, a ``wooden      Indian.''       His reason: the chance to talk about general amnesty for      undocumented immigrants.       ``They can't come to town without hearing it from labor,''      he said.       ``And I don't think they can talk about education without      talking about amnesty and workers' rights. When parents don't      have jobs or are underpaid or are hiding from immigration,      those are all fundamental issues when you are talking about      educating a child.''                                  ____                                     House of Representatives,                                Washington, DC, September 5, 2001.     President George W. Bush,     The White House,     Washington, DC.     President Vicente Fox,     Embassy of Mexico,     Washington, DC.       Dear President Bush and President Fox: During this Labor      Day week, and on behalf of our entire community, I extend an      official welcome to you both on your historic journey here      among us. We look forward to your visit and to your remarks.      We also hope you will listen and learn as our citizenry      ``speak truth to power.'' Building on this trip, we look      forward to establishing a working relationship with your      respective Administrations to address continental issues of      mutual concern. Please let me propose the establishment of an      ``Intercontinental Organization on Working Life and      Cooperation in the Americas.''       First and foremost, we seek your leadership and engagement      on the economic and social consequences of NAFTA in both      nations. The serious dislocation of millions of industrial      and agricultural workers, as well as small and medium sized      firms, demands serious and compassionate action by those      sworn to serve their fellow citizens. In our region (Ohio,      Michigan and Indiana) post-NAFTA, over 115,621 good paying      jobs have been lost to the maquiladora zone, where workers      toil for hunger wages and have no job security. Ohio is among      the top five states in our union losing jobs due to NAFTA      (37,694). Nationally, since NAFTA, over 776,030 middle class      jobs have been relocated to the maquila zone. Philips      Electronics in Ottawa, Ohio, the latest plant to announce a      shut down in production, will terminate hundreds of middle      class workers. Spangler's Candy, in Bryan, Ohio, has      announced it will shift some of its candy cane production to      Mexico. Last week in Chicago, Brach's Candy, employing 1,500      with a major segment of Latino-American workers, announced it      is shutting down its century old factory there, and moving      production either to Mexico or Argentina. The displacement of      high paying, middle class manufacturing jobs across the U.S.      is fueled by NAFTA, and will only worsen if the proposed Free      Trade     Area of the Americas agreement ignores the plight of workers.      With NAFTA and FTAA, only investment is given free rein in      our hemisphere. Our goal is ``Fair Trade, Free People.''       Meanwhile, 3,200 multinational firms located in the      maquiladora zone have shaped the modern scourge of the      dreaded sweatshop. Nearly one million Mexicans, largely      women, work in high productivity poverty, with no freely      elected labor representation, no job security. The U.S.-     Mexico border is plagued by alarming rates of      tuberculosis, sewage effluent flowing into drinking water,      moot environmental laws, and crumbling infrastructure that      cannot bear the load being placed on it. Grinding poverty      drives the immigration that is a primary subject of your      visit.       The root causes of the immigration crisis lie in the deep      and continuing disparity between compensation and living      standards of workers on either side of our border. Our      continent needs a common minimum wage and common labor      standards. Trade agreements MUST recognize and include labor      rights in the central bodies of their accords. No nation of      conscience should ignore the plight of the dispossessed, the      worker without representation, the small holders and      campeisinos and indigenous people who have no voice. As the      powerful force of capital moves across borders so must labor      have equal status in any economic accord. Further, NAFTA      remains seriously deficient in providing structural      adjustment assistance to cushion intercontinental economic      integration.       Trade relationships should yield mutually beneficial      economic and social benefits, not a legacy of growing      political instability. Our U.S. trade relationship with      Mexico is becoming increasingly distorted. Before NAFTA, the      U.S. held a $3 billion surplus with Mexico. Post NAFTA, the      U.S. surplus has turned into a growing cumulative deficit of      over $140 billion, with last year's record high of $30      billion. In Mexico, we have witnessed the devaluation of the      peso, wage cutbacks, and now job terminations in the maquias      due to a U.S. economic slowdown. Indeed, northern Mexico has      become the low wage export platform to the U.S. that      opponents of NAFTA predicted. Nearly 90% of maquila      production is exported back to the U.S. (and nearly the same      from our Canadian counterparts) as Mexico becomes a vast      importer of goods from Asia. Long term, this is an economic      relationship that is damaging to our continent. The current      economic arrangement means the workers of Mexico cannot      afford to buy what they make, and their U.S. counterparts      lose their living wage jobs as the downward pressure on      remaining jobs continues unabated. High productivity poverty      with hunger wages in Mexico and displaced U.S. workers do not      good neighbors make. As the slogan reads, justice must come      to the maquiladoras.       In the countryside, the story is even worse. Over 30      million Mexican farmers are being cruelly uprooted from their      historic lands. This is a continental sacrilege of enormous      proportions. Some, understandably, escape across our border.      Some die in the Arizona desert. Others seek shelter in Mexico      City's sprawling metropolis as overextended local services      strain under the crush of rapid population growth. Last year,      over 360 Mexicans seeking refuge or work died at our border.      What kind of cruel economic system is it that tramples on      their humanity and pits then against farmers and workers in      our countryside who have labored for a century to gain      sustenance and a decent way of life, collective bargaining      rights, and dignity in the work place? An Intercontinental      Agricultural Working Committee must be included as a key      component of the Intercontinental Organization I propose.       President Bush, I understand that during your visit to our      community you seek to discuss ``common problems on our      border, problems with drug interdiction, problems with      environmental issues, problems with water and immigration.''      I can assure you that every single one of these problems      arises from a flawed NAFTA agreement that leaves working      people and the social compact out of the investment equation.      It took our nation nearly a century, and a Civil War, to      reject a form of indentured servitude in which workers were      chattel. Our society still bears the scars of that war. In      Mexico, I have witnessed the fear of workers bound to an      economic system in which they hold no independent voice,      where independent collective bargaining for the value of      their work is impossible, and where their hard work and high      productivity yield only more poverty. Here at home, I have      witnessed our middle class workers who have struggled to      build a way of life have the rug pulled out from under them      by forces beyond their control. This surely cannot be your      blueprint for our continent in this new millennium.       Something is seriously wrong when workers do not earn      enough to buy what they make. It troubles me greatly that in      Toluca, Mexico workers who assemble the popular PT Cruisers      for DaimlerChrysler do not earn a living wage; every single      one of the cars they build are shipped to the U.S.      Reciprocally, it bothers me greatly that Toledo's      DaimlerChrysler workers who attempted to bid on some portion      of backlogged PT Cruiser production were summarily turned      down. Since all the production from the Toluca plant is sent      through the backdoor into the U.S., why shouldn't the workers      in both plants be covered by the same collective bargaining      agreement, along with their supplier firms? Otherwise, all      that production yields from a continental standpoint is a      race to the bottom for the workers.       Equally, in the countryside, it troubles me that northwest      Ohio's fresh tomato and pickle businesses are increasingly      threatened by Sinaloa plants and packing sheds. Yet field      workers in both nations have no hope of a better life as      their production is pitted against one another and they      compete for survival wage jobs. Again, our continent needs an      open forum in which to address and grapple with these serious      questions.       Finally, I extend to you both an invitation to travel with      bipartisan delegations from both countries. Let us tour U.S.      and Mexican production sites, industrial and agricultural.      Let us freely hear from the workers. Let us for the sake of      the common good explore openly the dimensions of NAFTA that      must be repaired. Let us do what is just. We should strive      for an intercontinental accord that elevates our people, not      exploits them, that uses the power of economic development      and the marketplace to spur the necessary social and physical      infrastructure to build great nations and treat our people      with respect.       Pope John Paul II captured the essence of the challenge      before us when he wrote:       ``The market imposes its way of thinking and acting and      stamps its scale of values upon behavior.''       ``What is happening is that changes in technology and work      relationships are moving too quickly for cultures to respond.      Social, legal and cultural safeguards are vital.''       ``Globalization often risks destroying these carefully      built up structures, by exacting the adoption of new styles      of working, living and organizing communities.''       ``Globalization must not be a new version of      colonization.''       The Pope stressed that on its course towards globalization,      humanity cannot do without an ethical code which must be      ``wholly independent from financial, ideological or political      partisan views. . . . Humanity can no longer do without a      common code of ethics.''       To this end, I would dedicate my full energies, as would      the people of our community.           Most sincerely,                                                     Marcy Kaptur,     Member of Congress.                          ____________________
