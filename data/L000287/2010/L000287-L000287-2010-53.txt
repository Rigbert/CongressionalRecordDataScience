Madam Speaker, this may be the most important vote that we cast as members of this body. We have a moral obligation today, tonight to make health care a right and not a privilege.  There are those who have told us to start over. There are those who have told us to wait. They have told us to be patient. We cannot wait. We cannot be patient. The American people need health care, and they need it now. On this day at this hour, stand with the American people and not with the big insurance companies. On this day at this moment in this Chamber, answer the call of history, answer the spirit of history and pass health care. Give the American people a victory. Give health care a chance.
