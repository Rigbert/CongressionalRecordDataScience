We will next go with Senator Burris and then Senator Dorgan.  I would note in this debate--and I apologize for my voice; I am recovering from laryngitis--that, one, the Justice Department is not the Department that handles the fairness doctrine. Out of fairness to Mr. Holder, that is not a matter that comes before the Attorney General.  Secondly, I asked Mr. Holder specifically a question about his views on the Second Amendment--because we do not have in Vermont the restrictive gun laws that the people in Oklahoma have supported or the restrictive gun laws the people of Texas or Pennsylvania have supported. We have less restrictive gun laws than any State in the Union. I own many firearms myself. I asked Mr. Holder specifically if he would, in a State without restrictive gun laws, such as Vermont, seek to replace those State laws with more restrictive Federal gun laws similar to those of the many other States represented on the Judiciary Committee, and he said no.  Madam President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.
