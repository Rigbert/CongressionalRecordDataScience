Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton), the very distinguished Representative in which this Capitol is located. I am sure the irony is not lost on her that there are residents of this capital of freedom that do not have full voting participation in this Capitol.
