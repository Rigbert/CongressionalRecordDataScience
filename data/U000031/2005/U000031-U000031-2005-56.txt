Chairman, I want to thank the committee on both sides of the aisle, particularly all of the parties. I just want to explain, when I was in Michigan this last week, over the July 4th recess, I met with my Corps of Engineers as it related to the harbor in St. Joe and Benton Harbor.  They asked that we take steps necessary to lower the depth of the harbor from 21 feet to 23 feet, which would be consistent with the other harbors along Lake Michigan, Holland, as well as Muskegon and Traverse City.  I realize that it is too late now, as the rule has been pending, to offer that as an amendment. And I would just like to receive an assurance from both sides that we will work together in conference to include the appropriate language, so that, at the end of the day, in fact, that we will be able to see this harbor dredged, obviously with the correct appropriation from the proper subcommittee.
