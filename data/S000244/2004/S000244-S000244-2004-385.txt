Speaker, during the course of the debate we have heard a string of red herrings from people who do not wish this bill to pass. I would like to rebut those from the study that the General Accounting Office made on the whole topic of our medical liability crisis.  First, as the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Greenwood) has eloquently stated, patient access to care is being harmed. He recounted the case of a pregnant woman who went to at least two OB/GYN practices to get a doctor to deliver her baby and was told that as a result of the medical liability crisis, they were shutting down the doors to their practice.  The GAO confirmed instances in the five States selected for study where actions taken by physicians in response to malpractice pressures have reducedaccess to services affecting emergency surgery and newborn deliveries. When the baby comes, you cannot wait. When someone has an accident and needs emergency surgery, you cannot wait. And if the malpractice insurance crisis closes down those practices, people are going to be harmed, and they will die, and this bill will stop that.  Secondly, doctors do practice defensive medicine. The GAO report found that in response to rising premiums, ``the fear of litigation research indicates that physicians practice defensive medicine in certain clinical situations, thereby contributing to health care costs.''  The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess) said that if unnecessary defensive medicine does not have to be practiced by reforming our liability laws, Medicare alone will save $50 billion a year, which is more than enough to pay for the prescription drug benefit, whether it is by the GAO study or the OMB study.  Third, insurers are not to blame for skyrocketing premiums. The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Brown) seemed to think they are.                              {time}  1715  But the GAO found that insurers are not to blame. The report states that insurer ``profits are not increasing, indicating that insurers are not charging and profiting from excessively high premium rates,'' and that ``in most States the insurance regulators have the authority to deny premium rate increases they deem excessive.''  Fourth, rising litigation awards are the problem, not insurer investments. What did the GAO say? The GAO found that losses on medical malpractice claims which make up the largest part of insurers' costs appear to be the primary driver of rate increases in the long run.  ``Since 1998, insurers' losses on medical malpractice claims have increased rapidly in some States. However, none of the studied companies experienced a net loss on investments, at least through 2001, the most recent year such data were available. Additionally, almost no medical malpractice insurers overall experienced net investment losses from 1997 to 2001.'' So much for that red herring.  Finally, liability reform does have a real impact. The GAO concludes that data indicate that rates of growth in malpractice premiums and claims payments have been slower on average in States that enacted certain caps on damages for pain and suffering, referred to as noneconomic damage caps, than in States with more limited reforms and that average per capita payments for malpractice claims against all physicians tended to be lower on average in States with noneconomic damage caps than in States with limited reforms.  This bill is a good one, and it ought to be passed.
