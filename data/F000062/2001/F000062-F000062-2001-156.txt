 President, today I am pleased to introduce a resolution to maintain the moratorium on new oil and natural gas leasing activity on submerged lands of the Outer Continental Shelf. I am happy to be joined by Senator Boxer.  With this resolution, we are urging President Bush to continue the existing executive order that places coastline areas of several States, including California, off limits to new drilling. This moratoria was initiated by former President George H. Bush in 1990, and extended through 2012 by President Clinton in 1998.  The timing of this resolution is important, as the impending President's energy plan will focus on drilling for new oil and gas reserves. With this focus, many of us in Congress fear that the Administration may pave the way for new exploration of the Outer Continental Shelf. This would be a tragic mistake that endangers the coastlines of many States, including California, which is one of the greatest environmental treasures in the world.  One oil spill from offshore oil wells almost did destroy the beautiful California coastline. In 1969 an oil spill in Federal waters off the coast of Santa Barbara killed thousands of birds, as well as dolphins, seals, and other animals. Estimates of the amount of oil released range up to 200,000 barrels. Within days, oil spread from California's Channel Islands to the Mexican border, an area of approximately 800 square miles. The people of California were so concerned that shortly thereafter they voted to create the California Coastal Commission.  Since the 1969 spill, there have been more than thirty additional significant oil spills off the California coast. Each spill has imperiled the environment, the economy, and the beautiful landscape of California.  We can try to measure the economic cost of oil spills. For example, the value of our coast as ocean-dependent industry is estimated to contribute $17 million per year to our state economy. But we cannot measure the value placed on our quality of life. In 1991, the California Department of Parks and Recreation found that almost 70 percent of Californians had participated in beach activities, and that 25 percent of Californians had participated in saltwater fishing. We simply cannot endanger this resource for limited production.  There is widespread and bipartisan agreement that oil drilling presents serious environmental dangers, and I urge the President to maintain the moratorium on new oil and gas leasing activity on the Outer Continental Shelf.                          ____________________
