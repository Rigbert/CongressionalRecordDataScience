Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today to pay tribute to a celebrated community servant, Mr. Lawrence B. Alport. On Monday, June 24, 1996, Lawrence's friends and family will gather to celebrate his installation as president of B'nai B'rith District 2. The installation banquet will be held at The Radisson Hotel at Star Plaza in Merrillville, IN.  Since he first joined the organization in 1980, Lawrence has proven to be a great leader within B'nai B'rith. For the past year, Lawrence served as president-elect, as well as a member of the board of governors. Lawrence also served for 3 years as vice president. Lawrence currently serves as vice-chairman for B'nai B'rith's international Community Volunteer Service, and he has held this position for 9 years. Previously, Lawrence served on B'nai B'rith's Membership Cabinet, Fundraising Cabinet, and Leadership Cabinet. In addition, Lawrence served as the president of the Indiana State Association for B'nai B'rith. For B'nai B'rith's America Lodge No. 90, Lawrence served as president, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer.  We are all fortunate to have dedicated people, like Lawrence, involved in the community of Indiana's First Congressional District. In addition to his involvement with B'nai B'rith, Lawrence is a board member of Hoosier Boys Town. He also served as a board member for Northwest Indiana Family Services where he was president for 3 years.  Professionally, Lawrence is the president of David Lawrence Enterprises, Inc., a company he founded in 1993. David Lawrence Enterprises specializes in energy conservation and indoor air quality equipment for manufacturers.  B'nai B'rith is the world's oldest and largest Jewish organization with members in 55 countries. B'nai B'rith has been in existence for over 150 years. District 2 consists of eight surrounding States including Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Kansas, Missouri, Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico. Locally, B'nai B'rith America Lodge No. 90, which covers all of northwest Indiana, sponsors several community events. Lodge No. 90, which has a B'nai B'rith youth organization, has taken children to baseball games and sponsored a brotherhood essay contest for elementary and junior high students. Lodge No. 90 has also sponsored a teddy bear drive to help acquire teddy bears for hospitals.  I offer my heartfelt congratulations to Lawrence and his wife, Jane Harper Alport, on the eve of his installation as president of B'nai B'rith District 2. They can be proud as Lawrence works hard to preserve Jewish culture while improving the quality of life for Indiana's First Congressional District. I sincerely wish Lawrence a long, happy, and successful term.                          ____________________
