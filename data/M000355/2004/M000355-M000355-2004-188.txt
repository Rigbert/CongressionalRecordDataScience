 President, tomorrow morning the Senate will continue to debate on the Senate intelligence reform resolution. Amendments will be offered and debated throughout the day tomorrow. I reminded all of our colleagues a few moments ago that I filed a cloture motion on the resolution. It is our hope that we can complete action on the resolution without having to take a cloture vote. However, in order to ensure that we can complete the Senate's business by Friday, we are scheduled to vote on cloture on Friday morning, if that is necessary.  In addition to the Senate intelligence resolution, the Senate may begin consideration of the FSC JOBS conference report tomorrow.  Senators should, therefore, expect a very busy day tomorrow with rollcalls possible throughout the day.                          ____________________
