President, in 1974, 40 years ago this month, Turkish troops invaded the Republic of Cyprus. By August they had taken control of more than one-third of the island. Turkey's invasion had immediate consequences, such as the confiscation of property and the displacement of Greek and Turkish Cypriots alike.  The invasion has also had more enduring consequences--consequences that are still felt today. The so-called green line, a demilitarized United Nations buffer zone, still cuts a jagged path across the island, dividing one part of the country from the other. It even bisects the capital city of Nicosia. In 1983, Turkish Cypriots declared a separate country in the northern third of Cyprus--a country recognized to this day by Turkey alone.  Vice President Joe Biden visited Cyprus in May, and he spoke of being called the White House optimist for his belief that the best days are yet to come. Well, by that standard, my colleagues here must think me the Senate optimist. But I really do believe that the future is bright for Cyprus and that most Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots want to put aside decades of division and move forward together.  I was pleased to read that leaders issued a joint declaration in February calling the status quo ``unacceptable'', and I am encouraged by the resumption of high-level negotiations on a comprehensive settlement. I think the United States, with its deep ties to Cyprus and Turkey, can play a productive role in facilitating these discussions. I also urge the Government of Turkey to step up and be a constructive partner throughout this process.  It has been my experience that intractable problems rarely have simple or easy solutions, so I am not under any illusions about this. But I have seen what folks can accomplish when they set ideology aside, and I remain a believer in a just settlement that brings an end to 40 years of division and reunites Cyprus.
