  Mr. DeFAZIO. If we adopt the Republican budget late tonight or tomorrow, the Republicans will set a new record: 5 consecutive years of the largest deficits in our Nation's history.  Two weeks ago, the Republicans in the Senate voted to raise the debt limit in the United States of America to $9 trillion. That is the fourth debt increase in 5 years. This majority and this President Bush have added 65 percent to the debt of the United States in 5 short years.  The President has accumulated more foreign debt than the 42 Presidents who preceded him, and this budget is business as usual: borrow money, borrow all of the Social Security trust fund and spend it, in part, on tax breaks for the wealthy.  This budget assumes that we will continue to borrow money to fund yet more tax breaks for the wealthiest among us, despite the Internal Revenue data that came out yesterday showing that their tax breaks benefit those making over $10 million a year by $500,000 a year. Should people who work for wages and salaries be forced to pay debt to give tax breaks to people who earn over $10 million a year? They say yes.                          ____________________[Pages H1567-H1568]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                           REPUBLICAN BUDGET  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
