 I remind all Members that if they wait until the last minute to get their amendments here, they may likely not be considered or adopted simply because of time. Again, if Members are here, come tonight quickly, get your amendments up. We will have a chance to review them and hopefully be able to dispose of them.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
