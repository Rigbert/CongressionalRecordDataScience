President, I am pleased that the Senate will accept my amendment to improve aircraft and passenger safety by encouraging airlines and airline employees to report suspicious activities to the proper authorities.  In addition, this amendment requires the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to share security risk information with the Federal Aviation Administration and airport or airline security officers.  I want to commend Senator Hollings and Senator McCain for their good work on this airport security legislation. I support the Hollings-McCain Aviation Security Act and believe this amendment improves an already excellent bill.  The Leahy amendment provides civil immunity for airlines and airline employees who report information on potential violations of law relating to air piracy, threats to aircraft or passenger safety, or terrorism to the Departmentof Justice, Department of Transportation, a law enforcement officer, or an airline or airport security officer.  This civil immunity would not apply to any disclosure made with actual knowledge that the disclosure was false, inaccurate or misleading or any disclosure made with reckless disregard as to its truth or falsity.  In other words, this amendment would not protect bad actors.  According to press reports, two of the suspected September 11, 2001, terrorists were on an FBI watch list. Both the Secretary of Transportation and the Attorney General, however, testified before Congress that the FBI, the INS, and the Department of Justice do not currently supply these watch lists to the FAA or to the Nation's airline carriers to match up passenger lists with potential threat lists.  It is time for that policy to change. This amendment requires the Attorney General to establish procedures for notifying the FAA of the identity of known or suspected terrorists.  Monday's Wall Street Journal reported that the National Commission on Terrorism has stressed the importance of more effective coordination and dissemination of security information including the FBI's watch list of potential terrorists and their associates.  Indeed, the Wall Street Journal reported:       A government-created task force recommended ways to plug      what historically has been one of the most glaring loopholes      in aviation security: a lack of clear-cut procedures to      circulate timely information about potential threats to      airlines and airports.  My amendment will put those needed procedures into place by requiring the Attorney General, in consultation with the Deputy Secretary for Transportation Security, which is created in the underlying bill, and the Director of the FBI, to establish procedures to notify the FAA and airport or airline security officers, of the identity of persons known or suspected to pose a risk of air piracy or terrorism or a threat to airline or passenger safety.  Finally, the amendment requires the Attorney General to report to Congress on the implementation of the procedures to identify these suspected or known hijackers or terrorists.  I believe the Leahy amendment will improve aircraft and passenger safety and provide the flying public with greater security. Indeed, this amendment has the support of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce among others.  I thank Senator Hollings and Senator McCain for accepting this amendment.  I ask unanimous consent that this article from the Wall Street Journal, entitled, ``U.S. Task Force Proposes Ways For Sharing Security-Risk Data With Airlines, Airports,'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 8, 2001]   U.S. Task Force Proposes Ways for Sharing Security-Risk Data With                            Airlines, Airports                           (By Andy Pasztor)       A government-created task force recommended ways to plug      what historically has been one of the most glaring loopholes      in aviation security: a lack of clear-cut procedures to      circulate timely information about potential threats to      airlines and airports.       The recommendations submitted to Transportation Secretary      Norman Mineta urge, among other things, creation of a      ``federal security agency'' that would ``fundamentally''      improve integration of ``law enforcement and national      security intelligence data.''       The proposed entity, supported in concept by the White      House as well as congressional leaders, would be responsible      for directly passing on such threat information to senior      security personnel at each airline and airport. Officials of      the Federal Aviation Administration have acknowledged that      they only received partial information from the Federal      Bureau of Investigation.       ``We have access to the names that the FBI gives us,'' but      don't ``normally have access'' to the full ``watch list'' of      potential terrorists or their associates assembled by the      bureau, U.S. immigration officials and other law enforcement      agencies, Monte Belger, the FAA's acting deputy      administrator, told lawmakers last month.       Despite extensive debate over giving the FAA access to      certain intelligence data, there was no resolution of that      issue prior to Sept. 11. After the attacks, the FAA      instituted some makeshift security procedures. Before any      commercial jetliner can take off, airlines must check the      names of all passengers against a lengthy and continuously      updated ``watch list'' of names supplies by the FBI.       Paul Bremer, chairman of a blue-ribbon government panel      called the National Commission on Terrorism, has stressed the      importance of more effective coordination and dissemination      of security information.       Since the FBI ``is in charge of catching criminals and      prosecuting them,'' historically it has had some reluctance      to quickly pass on potential evidence to the FAA or airlines.      ``Part of the problem in the FBI is a cultural one,'' Mr.      Bremer has said, adding ``we need to find a way [such      information] can be disseminated'' more rapidly and      predictably.       But in certain of its conclusions, the task force also      appears to have been keenly interested in trying to minimize      delays.       Citing ``an urgent need'' to find more efficient methods of      moving people through the security system as passenger volume      ramps up, the panel recommended ``a nationwide program for      the voluntary prescreening of passengers.'' By issuing      frequent travelers special credentials or checking their      identities and backgrounds before they arrive at the airport,      such travelers would be subjected to less scrutiny. That      would allow security personnel to focus extra attention on      other passengers. Meanwhile, a companion task force appointed      by Mr. Mineta to recommend changes in onboard security      systems stopped short of supporting some concepts previously      proposed by the White House.       Members of this task force said ``while there may be      value'' in installing video cameras designed to show pilots'      activity in the cabin, ``we have no consensus on whether to      proceed with this technology.'' The panel concluded that      calls by President Bush to install double doors to cockpits      were premature. Such a ``design will have limited      applicability to most aircraft in the U.S. fleet'' partly      because there isn't enough room between the current door and      the flight deck to accommodate such a system, the task force      concluded.
