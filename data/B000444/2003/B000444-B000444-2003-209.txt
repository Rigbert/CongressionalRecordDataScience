 And when I say ``a number,'' we have more than one. We are getting time agreements on all the amendments. For the benefit of the Senate, I might tell you quickly of the major amendments that we have and the time agreements: The Durbin-Kerry, et cetera, amendment on global AIDS funding is 10 minutes equally divided. Senator Feinstein has an amendment; it is up to 30 minutes equally divided. Senator Dorgan has an amendment and has agreed to 10 minutes equally divided. Senator Kennedy has an amendment, 30 minutes equally divided. Senator Dodd has one, 20 minutes equally divided; Senator Boxer, 10 minutes equally divided.  The reason I bothered to tell you that is I think we can do this. I think we can meet the objective of the majority leader to get this bill passed. People are being very cooperative. If we move like this, I think we should do it quickly.
