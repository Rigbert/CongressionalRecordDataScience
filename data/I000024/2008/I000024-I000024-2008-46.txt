President, the Senate has been in session all week and held one vote Tuesday and two votes this morning--all procedural votes. We have considered a bill this week concerning the number one issue in America today--the price of energy. Instead, of allowing a full debate on the bill and, most importantly, a full opportunity to allow amendments to actually open up supplies and provide Americans with options, the Democratic majority has closed debate and prohibited any opportunity to amend the bill.  Now, the Senate Democratic majority, after wasting an entire week, is engaged in a stunt to keep the Senate in session this weekend in some false demonstration they are serious about now addressing the issues that concern Americans trying to proceed to legislation to add $1.2 billion for the LIHEAP program. LIHEAP is a federally funded grant program that is implemented by states to give low income people funds to pay home energy bills. Generally, the primary beneficiaries of LIHEAP are users of natural gas, heating oil, and propane, and most of the assistance is confined to the NE United States.  Instead of simply placing more funding into a grant program, we should have used this past week to address increasing energy supplies to meet our long term national energy demands. I have previously opposed simply providing more funding for a grant program which does not address our energy needs, and will not attend the vote tomorrow since I would vote ``no'' so I request this statement appear in the Record, prior to the cloture vote on the motion to proceed.
