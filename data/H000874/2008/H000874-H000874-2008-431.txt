 On Monday the House will meet at 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 5 p.m., and that evening we will receive the State of the Union address from the President.  On Tuesday the House will meet at 10:30 a.m. for morning-hour debate and 12 noon for legislative business. We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. A list of those bills will be announced by the close of business this week.  In addition, we will consider H.R. 1528, a bill to designate the New England National Scenic Trail.  The House will not be in session for the balance of the week in order to accommodate the Democratic Caucus Issues Conference.  I yield back.
