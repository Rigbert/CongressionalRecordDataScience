 The following is what H.R. 2415 does:                               H.R. 2415                Background and Need for the Legislation       The bankruptcy system is currently in a state of crisis. In      recent years, America has witnessed a dramatic explosion in      the number of bankruptcy filings. According to statistics      from the Administrative Office of the United States Courts,      bankruptcies have exploded from 331,000 in 1980 to just under      1.4 million in 1999. It is a matter of serious concern to      Congress that the explosion in bankruptcy comes at a time of      unprecedented prosperity, with low unemployment and high      wages. Unemployment is at an all-time low. Consumer      confidence has been high and the Dow Jones Industrial Average      at one point rose above the 10,000 mark. Thus, the high rate      of bankruptcy filings cannot reasonably be attributed to a      slow economy.       This state of crisis has a significant negative impact on      the American economy. According to the Department of Justice,      creditors lose 3.22 billion dollars annually as a result of      Chapter 7 bankruptcies filed by individuals who could repay      their debts. Obviously, the existence of multi-billion dollar      losses attributable to high levels of bankruptcy filings is a      clarion call for Congress to reform our bankruptcies laws to      require bankrupts who could repay some portion of their debts      to do so.       Given the strong performance of the economy, many feel that      the recent explosion in personal bankruptcy filings is at      least partly attributable to the decreased moral stigma      associated with declaring bankruptcy. See Testimony of      Professor Todd Zywicki, Joint Hearing of the Subcommittee on      Administrative Oversight and the Courts and the Subcommittee      on Commercial and Administrative Law, March 11, 1999;      Testimony of Tahira Hira, Subcommittee on Administrative      Oversight and the Courts Hearing, ``S. 1301, The Consumer      Bankruptcy Reform Act: Seeking Fair and Practical Solutions      to the Consumer Bankruptcy Crisis'' (March 11, 1998);      Testimony of Kenneth R. Crone, Subcommittee on Administrative      Oversight and the Courts Hearing, ``The Increase in Personal      Bankruptcy and the Crisis in Consumer Credit,'' (April 11,      1997); Lee Flint, ``Bankruptcy Policy: Toward a Moral      Justification for Financial Rehabilitation of Consumer      Debt,'' 48 Wash. & Lee L. Rev. 515 (1991); David Gross and      Nicholas Souleses, ``Explaining the Increase in Bankruptcy      and Delinquency: Stigma Versus Risk-Competition''      (Preliminary, 1998); F.H. Buckley and Margaret F. Brinig,      ``The Bankruptcy Puzzle,'' 27 J. Legal Stud. (1998).       In the view of many in Congress, a decreased moral stigma      associated with bankruptcy means that filing for bankruptcy      is no longer viewed as a last resort reserved for financially      troubled Americans who have no other option but to seek debt      forgiveness. As Americans become accustomed to high levels of      consumer bankruptcy, it is only natural that declaring      bankruptcy has lost much of the shame previously associated      with it. Individuals who would have struggled to meet     their financial obligations in the past are filing bankruptcy      today in record numbers. See Judge Edith H. Jones and Todd J.      Zywicki, ``It's Time for Means Testing,'' 1999 B.Y.U. L. Rev.      177. For example, recent studies suggest that almost half of      filers learned about their option to file for bankruptcy from      friends or family. See, e.g., Vern McKinley, ``Ballooning      Bankruptcies: Issuing Blame for the Explosive Growth,''      Regulation, Fall 1997, at 38. At the same time, there have      been strong expressions of concern from the Federal Trade      Commission that attorney advertising is leading consumers to      file bankruptcy without being fully informed.       It is the strong view of the Congress that the Bankruptcy      Code's generous, no-questions-asked policy of providing      complete debt forgiveness under Chapter 7 without serious      consideration of a bankrupt's ability to repay is deeply      flawed and encourages a lack of personal responsibility.       Both H.R. 833 and its Senate counterpart S. 625 proposed      amendments to section 707(b) of the Bankruptcy Code to      require bankruptcy judges to dismiss a Chapter 7 case, or      convert a Chapter 7 case to another chapter if a bankrupt has      a demonstrable capacity to repay his or her debts. HR 2415      maintains the section 707(b) structure. In general, the      agreement embodied in HR 2415 used S. 625 as the base for the      means test. Like S. 625, a presumption arises that a Chapter      7 bankrupt should be dismissed from bankruptcy or converted      to another chapter if, after taking into account secured      debts and priority debts as well as living expenses, the      bankrupt can repay over 5 years the lesser of 25 percent or      more of his or her general nonpriority unsecured debts (but      at least $6,000), or $10,000. This test requires those with      greater debts to pay proportionately more than those with      smaller debts. For example, the cases of debtors whose      unsecured, nonpriority debts are over $100,000 will be      dismissed under the means test (absent ``special      circumstances'' discussed later) if their projected ability      to pay over 5 years is over $10,000, even though that is      considerably less than 25% of their debt. Conversely, the      cases of debtors whose debts in that category are less than      $36,000 will only be dismissed under the means test if their      projected ability to repay over 5 years is over $6,000,      permitting debtors in this category to remain in chapter 7      even though they have the ability to repay a percentage of      their unsecured, nonpriority debts considerably greater than      25%. The debtor can rebut this presumption only by      demonstrating ``special circumstances'' that would clearly      demonstrate that the bankrupt in fact does not have a      meaningful ability to repay his or her debts. It is      not intended that the ``special circumstances'' category      will be interpreted broadly to allow bankrupts to avoid      repayment of financial obligations for reasons unrelated      to finances, income or expenses. Therefore, the      presumption of abuse may only be rebutted, first on a      demonstration that the increases in spending or decreases      in income arise directly from ``special circumstances''      and are justified by those circumstances, second, that      they are reasonable and necessary, and, third, that there      is no reasonable alternative to the expense or income      adjustment. For example, if a loss of income occurred      because a debtor voluntarily elected to waive a bequest or      otherwise reduce income, there would be a reasonable      alternative to the reduction because the debtor could have      not elected, even though there may have been good reasons      to do so. Moreover, the kind of ``special circumstances''      Congress intended would not be present to justify the      adjustment, nor would it be reasonable and necessary.      Therefore, the additional adjustment to income would not      be allowed. Proof that the debtor permitted the reduction      in an attempt to avoid payment of creditors or other      inappropriate intent is not necessary, and a significant      burden is on the debtor to justify the adjustment.       On the other hand, if the debtor was a well paid medical      doctor who prior to bankruptcy changed from a demanding      private practice requiring 80 hours a week to a significantly      less well-paid research staff position with regular nine to      five hours in order to have more time to assist in the care      of a seriously disabled child, there would clearly be      ``special circumstances'' which justified the adjustment, the      income reduction would be reasonable and necessary, and the      special relationship of parent and child would clearly lead      to the conclusion that there was no reasonable alternative to      the adjustment.       General Overview of the Current Consumer Bankruptcy System       Under current law, individuals considering bankruptcy often      proceed under Chapter 7, where the bankrupt will surrender      all assets which do not qualify for an exemption to a      bankruptcy trustee. The bankruptcy trustee then sells the      bankrupt's property and distributes the proceeds to the      creditors. Any deficiency which remains after the sale of      these assets is simply erased (or ``discharged''), and the      bankrupt cannot be required to repay debts which have been      erased during bankruptcy. Chapter 7, often referred to as      ``straight bankruptcy,'' is the oldest and most commonly used      type of bankruptcy proceeding.       Individuals may also declare bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of      the Bankruptcy Code. Chapter 13 provides for the development      of a repayment plan that allows a debtor to repay some      portion of his or her debts. At the end of the repayment      period, the unpaid portion of debt is erased, and a debtor      cannot be required to repay the unpaid portion of the      discharged debt. Unlike Chapter 7, the purpose of Chapter 13      is to rehabilitate financially-troubled consumers by using      future earnings to repay debts in exchange for a discharge of      the unpaid portions of those debts. Two other chapters are      also available to individual debtors, but are only rarely      used by consumers. Chapter 11, usually used by those with      significant assets, permits a debtor to negotiate a plan of      reorganization of the debtor's financial affairs with      creditors, and in some instances force that plan or unwilling      creditors. A discharge is available when the plan is      confirmed. Chapter 12 is available for family farmers.       Earlier Reform Efforts To Reduce Consumer Bankruptcy Abuse       The idea of requiring bankrupts to repay their debts when      they have the ability to do so is not new. This topic has      been the subject of many proposed amendments, from the early      1930s to the current Congress. S. 625 is merely an extension      of this longstanding effort to ensure that bankruptcy is      reserved for those truly in need of debt forgiveness. See      Oversight Hearing on Personal Bankruptcy, Committee on the      Judiciary, Subcommittee on Monopolies and Commercial Law,      97th Cong. 2nd Sess., (1982).       The general structure of the present federal Bankruptcy      Code is the result of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, Pub.      L. 95-598. The 1978 Act was the first major overhaul and      attempt to update comprehensively the bankruptcy law since      passage of the Chandler Act in 1938. 52 Stat. 840 (1938).      Prior to the Chandler Act, individuals in serious financial      trouble usually had no choice but to file for ``straight      bankruptcy'' under Chapter VII, a proceeding similar to      present Chapter 7 under the Bankruptcy Code. However, the      Chandler Act provided small debtors a new, alternative      procedure, the Chapter XIII Wage Earner's Plan, which allowed      an individual to retain nonexempt assets by proposing a plan      to pay his or her existing debts from future income, after      which the wage earner would receive a discharge of any unpaid      balances of his debts. See generally, Dvoret, ``Federal      Legislation, Bankruptcy Under the Chandler Act: Background,''      27 Geo. L.J. 194 (1938).       The debate over Chapter XIII occurred years earlier in      joint hearings before the House and Senate Judiciary      Committees in 1932, during the Seventy-Second Congress. By      the time it was enacted in 1938, Chapter XIII codified      informal practices which had developed without explicit      statutory authorization. In the mid 1930's in Birmingham,      Alabama a former special referee in bankruptcy, Valentine      Nesbitt, first developed a ``repayment option'' which was the      model for Chapter XIII. See Weinstein, The Bankruptcy Law of      1938 (1938).       In 1932, Congress conducted hearings on S. 3866. Section 75      of this bill would have established a repayment plan for wage      earners. Section 75 provided a method for an indebted wage      earner to come into court without being labeled ``a      bankrupt,'' and get the benefit of a court injunction to fend      off creditors while the wage earner arranged to repay his      pre-bankruptcy debts in installments. Section 75, with      certain modifications, eventually became Chapter XIII,      enacted in 1938 as part of the Chandler Act.       Since the 1938 amendments, there have been several      proposals to limit bankruptcy relief to those who lack      genuine repayment capacity. In the 1960s, Congress considered      several such proposals. See H.R. 12784, 88th Cong., 2d Sess.      (1964); H.R. 292, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. (1965); S. 613, 89th      Cong., 1st Sess. (1965); H.R. 1057 & H.R. 5771, 90th Cong.,      1st Sess. (1967). Under these proposals, an individual debtor      seeking relief under the liquidation provisions of the      bankruptcy laws would be denied relief if the court concluded      that he or she could pay substantial amounts of debt out of      future earnings under a Chapter XIII plan.       Importantly, one of these proposals, S. 613, was introduced      by Senator Albert Gore, Sr., the father of the current Vice      President. When he introduced S. 613, Senator Gore indicated      that Chapter 7 resembled a special interest tax loophole,      which the wealthy could use to avoid paying their fair share.      Senator Gore, Sr. also commented on the moral consequences of      a lax bankruptcy system:       ``I realize that we cannot legislate morals, but we, as      responsible legislators, must bear the responsibility of      writing laws which discourage immorality and encourage      morality; which encourage honesty and discourage deadbeating;      which make the path of the social malingerer and shirker      sufficiently unpleasant to persuade him at least to      investigate the way of the honest man.''--Cong. Rec. 905,      January 19, 1965.       Given the current bankruptcy crisis, Senator Gore's words      from over 30 years ago seem prescient.       Following the 1978 amendments, in the early 1980s, Senator      Dole introduced S. 2000 during in the 97th Congress. In the      House of Representatives, Congressman Evans introduced H.R.      4786, which eventually garnered 269 co-sponsors. Congress did      not pass either proposal in the 97th Congress, so these      measure were reintroduced in the 98th Congress as H.R. 1169      and S. 445. As a result of these efforts, Congress created      Section 707(b) of the Bankruptcy Code in 1984 to allow judges      to dismiss Chapter 7 cases if granting relief would      constitute a ``substantial abuse'' of the Bankruptcy Code.      Pub. Law 105-165. The focus of the effort was to require      bankrupts who had the ability to pay a significant percentage      of their debts ``without difficulty''     to proceed under Chapter 13 instead of Chapter 7. However,      the term ``substantial abuse'' was not defined and creditors      and trustees were expressly forbidden from presenting      evidence to a judge that granting relief in a particular case      would result in a ``substantial abuse.''       Despite Congress' intent that section 707(b) would control      inappropriate use of chapter 7 by those with ability to pay,      that section has not been effective. Although many factors      are at work, much of the reason for this ineffectiveness has      been the ingrained point of view that ``honest'' debtors have      a ``right'' to a chapter 7 discharge even when they have      ability to pay. To illustrate, the Fourth Circuit has taken a      ``totality of the circumstances'' approach to determining      whether there is substantial abuse. In re Green, 934 F.2d 568      (4th Cir. 1991)(a ``totality of circumstances'' test is      appropriate when deciding section 707(b) cases in which      ability to repay can be outweighed by other factors, like the      debtor's good faith or honesty). Some bankruptcy judges have      taken the totality of the circumstances approach suggested by      In re Green as a justification for either ignoring ability to      pay completely, or doing so in effect. See In re Adams, 209      B.R. 874 (Bankr. M.D. Tenn. 1997)(Paine, J.)(honest debtor      with ability to repay cannot be dismissed from chapter 7); In      re Braley, 103 B.R. 758 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1989)(Bonney, J.).      Other Circuit Courts have disagreed and insisted that debtors      with ability to pay must do so. In re Kelley, 841 F.2d 908      (9th Cir. 1988); In re Walton, 866 F. 2d 981 (8th Cir. 1989);      United States Trustee v. Harris, 960 F.2d 74 (8th Cir. 1992);      In re Koch, 109 F. 3d 1285 (8th Cir. 1997); In re Lamanna,      153 F. 3d 1 (1st Cir. 1998). A few bankruptcy courts have      followed the direction of these Circuit Courts, In re      Shelley, 231 B.R. 317 (Bankr. D. Neb. 1999)(Minahan, Jr. J.);      In re Cox, 2000 Bankr. Lexis 571 (Bankr. N.D. Fla., May 16,      2000).       It was this evidence which led Congress to conclude that      the complete overhaul of section 707(b) was necessary, with      clear, non-discretionary requirements imposed on the      bankruptcy court to reject the notion that debtors were      entitled to a discharge as a matter of right without regard      to their ability to pay and to assure that in practice those      with ability to pay would not be entitled to chapter 7      relief. In the 105th Congress, the House passed HR 3150 and      the Senate passed S. 1301, two bills which would have      inserted means-testing in section 707(b). A Conference      Committee reconciled the two bills and produced a Conference      Report (H. Rep. 105-794) which passed the House at the end of      the 105th Congress but was never voted on in the Senate.      Senate Report 105-253 provides the legislative history of S.      1301. House Report 105-540 provides the legislative History      of HR 3150.                        The Current Legislation       HR 2415 is the culmination of these efforts and is intended      to both remove unequivocally the bankruptcy court's      discretion with regard to whether a debtor with ability to      pay should be dismissed from chapter 7, and to restrict as      much as possible reliance upon judicial discretion to      determine the debtor's ability to pay. Limited judicial      discretion remains to deal with the hardship case, but that      discretion is not to be abused by lax enforcement of the      standards in HR 2415.       Section 102 of HR 2415 provides that a Chapter 7 case will      be presumed to be an ``abuse'' of Chapter 7 if the debtor has      the ability to repay, in a 5-year repayment plan, 25% of the      debtor's nonpriority unsecured claims (but not less than      $6,000), or $10,000, whichever is less. For purposes of      determining the debtor's repayment ability, section 102      provides that the debtor's monthly expenses shall be      applicable monthly expenses under standards issued by the      Internal Revenue Service (``IRS'') for the area in which the      debtor resides. The IRS standards applicable under section      102 are the IRS ``National Standards,'' ``Local Standards,''      and certain categories of ``Other Necessary Expenses'' which      are specifically listed in the Standards. These Internal      Revenue Service standards are currently used to determine      appropriate living expenses for taxpayers who are required to      repay delinquent taxes. These standards have been developed      by the Treasury Department to assist the Department in the      collection of taxes and, of course, can be revised from time      to time, as needed. These expense categories allow      expenses for housing, food, transportation, and, for      purposes of the means test, certain specified ``other      necessary expenses.''       In order to provide flexibility in appropriate cases of      hardship, Section 102 also provides that in some cases where      the presumption applies the debtor may be able to demonstrate      ``special circumstances'' that ``justify'' additional      expenses or an adjustment to the debtor's income for which      there is no reasonable alternative. In addition, the debtor      must demonstrate that the adjustments are reasonable and      necessary and there is no reasonable alternative to the      expense or income adjustment. If the debtor can make this      showing, the presumption is rebutted. It is not intended that      the ``special circumstances'' test will allow the presumption      of abuse to be rebutted by relying on factors other than      ability to pay.       The presumption of abuse arises due to a financial      calculation assessing a Chapter 7 debtor's ability to pay.      Thus, the presumption of abuse under Section 707(b) may only      be rebutted if the debtor shows changes to expenses or      changes to income not otherwise accounted for in the means      test and that meet all of the requirements of the ``special      circumstances'' test. Other factors are not relevant.       In applying the ``special circumstances'' test, it is      important to note that a debtor who requests a ``special      circumstances'' adjustment is requesting preferential      treatment when compared to other consumers, and it is those      other consumers who, by paying their debts, must assume the      cost of the debts discharged by the debtors seeking the      preferential treatment. It also is important to note that,      because of the protections established for debtors whose      income falls below the median income level, the preferential      treatment provided under the ``special circumstances''      standard primarily benefits higher income individuals.       As indicated earlier, in order to ensure fairness with      respect to the consumers who must pay the cost when others      discharge debts in bankruptcy, it is essential that the      ``special circumstances'' test establish a significant,      meaningful threshold which a debtor must satisfy in order to      receive the preferential treatment. The House/Senate      agreement incorporated in HR 2415 is premised upon the belief      that the relief sought by a debtor who files for bankruptcy      is financial in nature and the debtor's right to obtain      preferential relief under the ``special circumstances''      provision should be assessed based on financial      considerations only. Thus, the agreement is not intended to      allow debtors to continue expenses unless they clearly      demonstrate that they meet the ``special circumstances'' test      for such adjustments.       Under this bankruptcy reform package, the Office of United      States Trustee or bankruptcy administrator is required to      file a motion to dismiss or convert a Chapter 7 case if the      bankrupt's current monthly income equals or exceeds the state      median income and the presumption of abuse applies. If the      Office of United States Trustee or bankruptcy administrator      determines after investigation that such a motion is not      warranted because the presumption of abuse can be rebutted,      then it must file an explanatory statement with the      bankruptcy court detailing why a motion to dismiss or convert      is not appropriate. If private trustees or creditors      disagree, they can commence a motion under 707(b).       Importantly, creditors are now explicitly given the power      to bring 707(b) motions before the bankruptcy court, although      creditors' and private trustees' motions are restricted to      cases in which the debtor's current monthly income exceeds      the applicable state median income. Moreover, HR 2415 gives      Chapter 7 trustees important new financial incentives for      ferreting out bankrupts who have repayment capacity and      provides for appropriate penalties for bankruptcy attorneys      who recklessly steer individuals with repayment capacity to      Chapter 7 bankruptcy, or file schedules which misstate      income, expenses or assets. HR 2415 also contains penalties      for creditors who file inappropriate motions under section      707(b). Thus, contrary to the assertions of some, there are      real and meaningful reasons why creditors will not improperly      use their right to file 707(b) motions.       The new section 707(b) also provides that in addition to      the means test, Chapter 7 debtors' cases may be dismissed if      the filing is not in good faith or the ``totality of the      circumstances'' indicate that granting relief under Chapter 7      would constitute abuse. No inference should be drawn, however      that by referencing the ``totality of the circumstances''      Congress intended to approve the result in In re Green, 934      F.2d 568 (4th Cir. 1991) or similar cases. Such cases are      rejected by the means test reforms and the change in the      standard from ``substantial abuse'' to ``abuse'' in HR 2415.      However, situations in which courts dismiss debtors from      Chapter 7 today clearly continue to be grounds for dismissal      under HR 2415, including such cases as In re Lamanna, 153 F.      3d 1 (1st Cir. 1998). In addition, since the standard for      dismissal is revised to require ``abuse'' rather than      ``substantial abuse'', the courts are clearly given      additional discretion to control abusive use of chapter 7      when that is appropriate.       Congress thus intends that the new section 707(b) provide a      tightly-focused mechanism for identifying bankrupts who have      repayment capacity and sorting them out of Chapter 7, as well      as dealing with other forms of abuse. At the same time, the      new section 707(b) means test contains procedural safeguards      which ensure that any special financial circumstances of a      debtor will be appropriately considered before he or she is      dismissed from bankruptcy or converted to another chapter.       Enhanced Consumer Protections and Credit Card Disclosures       Importantly, HR 2415 retains Title XIX of the Senate bill.      This title amends the Truth in Lending Act (``TILA'') to      require significant new minimum payment disclosures in      connection with open-end credit plans. Among other things, HR      2415 requires credit card companies, on the front of each      monthly statement, to provide:       --a statement that making only minimum payments will      increase the interest costs and the time it takes to repay      the account balance;       --an example showing the length of time it would take to      repay a specified amount if making minimum payments only; and       --a toll-free telephone number which cardholders could call      to receive additional repayment information.       HR 2415 requires the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate a      table that would set forth information for use by credit card      issuers in responding to cardholders who make inquiries      through the toll-free telephone number. Finally, the Federal      Reserve Board is authorized to study the types of information      available to consumers regarding factors qualifying potential      borrowers for credit, repayment requirements, and the      consequences of default, including information related to      minimum payments. The study would include consideration of      the extent to which the availability of low minimum payment      options is a cause of consumers experiencing financial      difficulty.       HR 2415 also amends TILA to require certain applications or      solicitations for credit cards that include an introductory      rate of less than one year, and all promotional materials      accompanying such an application or solicitation, to include      the following relating to introductory rates:       --use the term ``introductory'' in immediate proximity to      each listing of the introductory rate; and       --disclose when the introductory period will end and the      annual percentage rate that will apply at the end of the      introductory period.       In addition, HR 2415 requires a clear and conspicuous      disclosure, in a prominent manner on or with an application      or solicitation, of the rate, if any, that will apply if the      introductory rate is revoked, and a general description of      the circumstances or events that would result in such a rate.       HR 2415 also requires a credit card issuer to clearly and      conspicuously provide disclosures regarding the key features      of the credit plan, such as interest rate and basic fees,      with Internet-based credit card applications and      solicitations. These disclosures must be readily accessible      to consumers in close proximity to the solicitations and      these disclosures must be updated regularly to reflect the      current policies, terms, and fee amounts applicable to the      credit card account. HR 2415 also provides that, if a lender      imposes a late fee for failing to make payment by the payment      due date, the lender must state on each periodic statement      the payment due date (or, if the card issuer contractually      establishes a different date, the earliest date on which a      late fee may be imposed). The lender also must state the      amount of the fee that will be assessed if payment is      received after that date.       Importantly, HR 2415 amends TILA to provide that an open-     end creditor cannot terminate an account prior to its      expiration date solely because the consumer has not incurred      finance charges on the account.       New disclosures are now required in connection with      consumer credit plans secured by the consumer's principal      dwelling in which the extension of credit may exceed the fair      market value of the dwelling. Under the amendment, a creditor      must disclose at the time the creditor distributes an      application to the consumer for such a plan that interest on      the portion of the credit extension that is greater than the      fair market value of the dwelling is not tax deductible for      federal income tax purposes.       The Congress also directs that the Federal Reserve Board      study the existing protections limiting consumer liability      for unauthorized use of debit cards. In addition, the Board      is directed to study the impact that extensions of credit to      college students have on the rate of bankruptcy cases filed.       In addition to these new credit card disclosures, HR 2415      contains several important reforms which will protect      individuals and help them better understand their rights and      remedies. Reaffirmations occur when a debtor agrees to pay a      debt which would otherwise be wiped away in bankruptcy.      Section 524 of the Bankruptcy Code sets the conditions which      must be met before such agreements will be considered legally      binding. The bankruptcy reform package retains the Senate-     passed amendments related to the reaffirmation agreements,      with slight changes affecting only credit union debt.       HR 2415 also requires the Attorney General to designate      prosecutors and investigators to enforce current criminal      statutes designed to protect debtors in bankruptcy court from      deceptive or coercive collection practices as well as      enforcing those same statutes against debtors in appropriate      cases. By committing substantial new resources to fighting      abusive creditor and debtor practices and bankruptcy fraud,      it is intended that the Department of Justice step up      enforcement of these under-used statutes.       The bankruptcy reform package contains a provision which      penalizes creditors who refuse to negotiate reasonable      repayment schedules outside of bankruptcy. Under this      provision, the amount that a creditor may collect in      bankruptcy can be reduced if an approved credit counseling      agency approved under the credit counseling provision of HR      2415 for the judicial district in which the debtor's case is      pending makes a reasonable offer of repayment at least 60      days prior to declaring bankruptcy and the creditor      unreasonably rejects this offer. During Senate consideration      of S. 625, the Department of Justice indicated support for      promoting alternative dispute resolution in this way but then      suggested that the provision be ``clarified'' in such a way      that it will not apply to governmental creditors. See Letter      to The Honorable Orrin G. Hatch, Chairman, Committee on the      Judiciary, April 9, 1999. Thus, if the Congress were to      accept the suggestions of the Department of Justice, non-     governmental creditors would be subject to a tougher standard      than currently contained in the bankruptcy reform package,      but the Internal Revenue Service would be free to avoid      alternative dispute resolution. Given its history in dealing      with taxpayers, it was considered inappropriate to create      such a special exemption for the Internal Revenue Service.              Reducing Abusive Uses of the Bankruptcy Code       As the National Bankruptcy Review Commission correctly      noted, many of the worst abuses of the bankruptcy system      involve individuals who repeatedly file for bankruptcy with      the sole intention of using the automatic stay (i.e., a court      injunction which arises whenever a bankruptcy case is filed).      National Bankruptcy Rev. Comm. Rep., ``Bankruptcy the Next      Twenty Years,'' October 20, 1997 vol. 1, at 262. Accordingly,      HR 2415 contains restrictions on repeat filers and on      multiple owners who serially file. It is expected that these      changes will dramatically reduce the number of inappropriate      bankruptcy filings.       HR 2415 also requires random audits of bankruptcy petitions      to verify the accuracy of information contained in bankruptcy      petitions, and makes debtor attorney's responsible to      diligently inquire into the accuracy of the information      provided on the schedules. Many Members of Congress are      concerned that there is little incentive for individuals to      list all of their assets or fully and accurately disclose      their financial affairs, including their income and living      expenses, when they file for bankruptcy. Of course, such      laxity fosters an environment in which the overall financial      condition of the bankrupt is likely to be inaccurate, with      the result that creditors may receive less than they could      when a bankrupt's financial affairs are accurately disclosed.      Accordingly, the random audit procedures will restore some      integrity to the system, since material misstatements are      required to be reported to the appropriate authorities.                 Enhanced Protections for Child Support       Balanced bankruptcy reform must protect the status of child      support. According to some estimates, more than one-third of      bankruptcies involve spousal and child support orders. And in      about half of those cases, women were creditors trying to      collect court-ordered support from their former husbands.      These support orders are a lifeline for thousands of families      struggling to maintain self-sufficiency.       HR 2415 contains all of the child support provisions of the      Senate-passed version of bankruptcy reform (S. 625),      including provisions closing various serious loopholes which      allowed those who owed child support, alimony and in some      instances other marital dissolution obligations to use the      bankruptcy laws to delay and sometimes defeat payment of      those obligations. HR 2415 also contains a new provision      which requires bankruptcy trustees to notify child support      creditors of their right to use state child support      enforcement agencies to collect outstanding amounts due. In      addition, HR 2415 permits general creditors to disclose the      last known billing address of a debtor who owes child support      or alimony to child support claimants. Taken together, these      changes place child support and alimony claimants in a far      better position under HR 2415 than under current law.                          Business Provisions       HR 2415 contains the small business reform measures from      the Senate passed version of HR 833. Although business      bankruptcy filings are low at this time, several changes to      Chapter 11 are warranted. HR 2415 contains provisions      intended to speed up Chapter 11 for small business debtors,      enact recommendations of the United Nations Commission on      Internal Trade Law regarding transnational bankruptcy and      clarify the treatment of tax claims in bankruptcy.       Importantly, HR 2415 provides new deadlines on tenants      under non-residential leases to decide whether to reject or      assume leases under section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code. Under      current law, once a tenant under a non-residential real      property lease has filed for Chapter 11 relief, it has 60      days to decide whether to accept or reject its lease, with      extensions for cause. Unfortunately, bankruptcy judges have      allowed the exception for cause to swallow the rule. Today,      bankruptcy judges routinely extend the time within which      retail debtors must assume or reject the lease for years,      including until confirmation of the plan. Moreover, while      these tenant-debtors are supposed to pay their rent while the      proceedings continue, they do not always do so and bankruptcy      judges have not always compelled them to do so.       Thus, landlords are often left with significant uncertainty      since they may have no clear indication as to whether a      tenant will continue in a lease and the tenant may not be      current on post-petition rents. It is hoped that the      provisions contained in the current bankruptcy reform      agreement will mitigate the unfairness confronting landlords      of non-residential leases. The House bill provided that an      unexpired lease of nonresidential property will be deemed      rejected if the trustee has not assumed or rejected it by the      earlier of the date of confirmation of a plan or a date that      is no more than 120 days after the date of the order for      relief, with an additional 120 days if granted by the court      for cause. The court, under the House bill, could then grant      an extension beyond 240 days after the date of the order for      relief ``only     upon prior written consent of the lessor.'' The Senate bill      provided that such a lease would be deemed rejected if the      trustee has not acted by the earlier of the date of      confirmation of a plan or the date which is 120 days after      the date of the order for relief. No additional extension is      permitted except ``upon motion of the lessor.'' Both bills,      then, were quite similar, especially in denying bankruptcy      judges discretion in extending the deadline for assuming or      rejecting a lease after an absolute period following the      order for relief--240 days in the former and 120 days in the      latter. Both the Departments of Justice and the Interior      favored a 120 day deadline, with no discretion in the      bankruptcy judge.       HR 2415 provides that an unexpired non-residential real      property lease is deemed rejected if the trustee has not      acted by the earlier of the date of confirmation of a plan or      the date which is 120 days after the date of the order for      relief. The court may extend the 120 day period for an      additional 90 days, prior to the expiration of the 120 day      period, upon motion of either the trustee or the lessor for      cause, for a total of 210 days after the date of the order      for relief. If the court has granted such 90 day extension,      the court may grant a subsequent extension only upon prior      written consent of the lessor. This can be in the form of (1)      a motion of the lessor or (2) a motion of the trustee,      provided that the trustee has a prior written consent of the      lessor. Importantly, HR 2415 clearly retains both bills'      denial of bankruptcy judges' discretion in extending this      date: in no circumstance may the time to assume or reject      unexpired nonresidential real property leases extend beyond      the earlier of (1) the time of confirmation or (2) 210 days      from the time of entry of the order for relief, without the      prior written consent of the lessor--either in the form of a      lessor's motion, or in the form of a prior written consent to      a trustee's motion, to extend the time. Moreover, a lessor's      written consent to one extension beyond the 210 period does      not constitute such consent for a subsequent extension: each      such extension beyond 210 days requires the separate written      consent of the lessor.       Finally, HR 2415 adds language to Section 365 (f)(1) of the      Bankruptcy Code for the purpose of assuring that section      365(f) does not override any part of Section 365(b). HR 2415      provides that section 365(f) is not only subject to Section      365(c), but also to Section 365(b), which is to be given full      effect. Contrary legal interpretations in case law are      overturned.                     Section by Section Explanation                    Title I--Needs Based Bankruptcy     Sections 101-103: Dismissal for Abuse and the Means Test       These three sections expand present 707(b) of the      Bankruptcy Code to require a court to dismiss a chapter 7      petition filed by an individual debtor whose debts are      primarily consumer debts (or with the debtor's consent,      convert to another bankruptcy chapter) if the debtor's case      meets certain standards. Present law already requires that an      individual debtor's case be dismissed if it is a      ``substantial abuse'' and the debtor's debts are primarily      consumer debts, but also creates a presumption against      dismissal and prevents anyone other than the court or the      United States Trustee from raising the issue. There has been      concern that present 707(b) is not effective to prevent      inappropriate use of chapter 7, and in particular debtors who      have ability to repay their debts from using chapter 7 to      obtain a discharge without repaying creditors what they can      afford, needlessly costing consumers who pay their bills in      higher credit prices.       These sections reorganize present section 707(b) to change      the standard for dismissal from ``substantial abuse'' to      ``abuse'' in order to provide strengthened controls against      abusive use of chapter 7. They also replace the presumption      against dismissal from chapter 7 with a presumption of      dismissal if the debtor has ability to pay as determined by a      new means test. The changes are intended to broaden rather      than limit controls on improper use of chapter 7.       The means test.--Section 102 establishes a means test      enforced by required dismissal from chapter 7. To apply the      means test, the debtor must complete revised schedules of      income and expense similar to those now required, but revised      to show net income determined in a particular way and a      calculation of how much the debtor can afford to pay under      the new means test. The means test should for the most part      be self-enforcing. It should be infrequent that a debtor will      fill out the schedule of income and expenses which show that      the debtor has ability to pay, and still file in chapter 7.      Forms should be developed for these revised schedules which      are clear and understandable, and promote accurate and      efficient administration of the means test. The schedules      should be filed with the debtor's petition. It is intended      that the anti-fraud provisions of the bankruptcy and other      laws be applied vigorously by the bankruptcy courts and      others whenever fraudulent completion of the schedules is      apparent.       The means test initially focuses upon the debtor's net      income determined according to standards set forth in these      sections. The debtor's current monthly income is first      determined by averaging the debtor's monthly income for the      prior six months and excluding social security or certain war      reparations income. Next, the debtor's monthly expenses are      determined. These include monthly expenses as specified under      the National Standards and Local Standards issued by the      Internal Revenue Service for the area in which the debtor      resides, and the debtor's actual monthly expenses for the      categories specified as Other Necessary Expenses under those      same standards. The categories specified as Other Necessary      Expenses means only those categories of expense specifically      listed in the Internal Revenue Service Manual at 5323.423(1),      (3) and (4).       It is not intended that additional expenses will be      deductible except as otherwise specified in section 707(b).      For example, an additional allowance is available if      demonstrated to be reasonable and necessary up to 5% of the      monthly allowances for food and clothing categories as      specified by the National Standards. Moreover, actual monthly      expense allowances are specified for certain reasonably      necessary family violence expenses and for reasonable and      necessary continued expenses of supporting an elderly,      chronically ill or disabled family member. The debtor's      monthly expenses for priority debts and secured debts      (including the averaged cost of curing arrearages with      respect to secured debts as permitted in chapter 13) are also      deductible. They are determined based on the average of those      expenses over a 60 month period.       Also allowed are deductions for actual average monthly      expenses that are entitled to administrative expense priority      under the Bankruptcy Code, but never more than 10% of      projected plan payments, as determined under a schedule to be      issued from time to time as necessary by the Executive Office      of United States Trustees. This schedule is to be based on      the standing chapter 13 trustee's fee as allowed from time to      time in each district and should not include other amounts.      Other fee schedules may be provided for cases when a debtor      qualifies for chapter 12 or would have to use chapter 11      because excluded from chapter 13. In applying the 10% cap,      only projected plan payments which are reasonable and      necessary should be considered. Generally, plan payments to      pay secured debt should be excluded from projected plan      payments when calculating administrative expenses, unless      there is a compelling reason for concluding that payment of      the secured debt would be included in the debtor's plan.      Although the administrative expenses may be otherwise      entitled to priority, it is intended that they be accounted      for under this specific administrative expense provision and      not also allowed under the provision for priority expenses.       Actual expenses for private elementary or secondary private      school tuition not exceeding $1,500 per child per year are      also deductible.       Once the monthly expense allowances are determined, they      are then subtracted from current total monthly income to      obtain the debtor's net monthly income. Net income is then      multiplied by 60. If the result is greater than the lesser of      a threshold amount of (1) $10,000 or (2) 25% of the      nonpriority unsecured claims in the debtor's case but not      less than $6,000, there is a presumption that the debtor's      case must be dismissed from chapter 7.       This presumption may be rebutted if there are special      circumstances that justify adjustments to income or expenses      for which there is no reasonable alternative. To claim such      additional expense or income adjustment, the debtor must      itemize, explain and document why the expense or income      adjustment is reasonable and necessary in addition to      meeting the special circumstances test and demonstrates      there is no reasonable alternative to the expenses or      income adjustment. If it is determined that special      circumstances as described do exist, the debtor may      recalculate income and expenses based on the adjustments      and apply the threshold to the resulting net income. The      presumption can only be rebutted by demonstrating that an      expense or income adjustment appropriate under the special      circumstances test causes the debtor's net income to be      below the applicable threshold amount.       An important additional feature of the means test is the      ``safe harbor.'' If the debtor's current monthly income is      less than the appropriate state median income as determined      by current statistical information supplied by the Bureau of      the Census, then only the judge, United States trustee,      bankruptcy administrator, or trustee may bring a motion under      section 707(b). The safe harbor provides further limits      motions against debtors whose current monthly income is less      than the appropriate state median income as determined by      current statistical information supplied by the Bureau of the      Census, in that for such debtors, neither the judge, the      United States Trustee, the bankruptcy administrator, a      private trustee nor a party in interest can bring a motion to      dismiss under the presumed abuse provisions of the means      test. It is expected that the Bureau of the Census will      promptly make available state median income information by      family size for households of 1-4 members based upon      information it collects. For these purposes, a family or      household consists of the debtor and the debtor's dependents,      and in a joint case, the debtor's spouse. The median income      for families larger than 4 persons is determined by taking      the monthly median income for a family of 4 and adding $525      to that figure for each additional family member.       Under subsection (e) of section 102 of HR 2415, creditors      are permitted to report information concerning a debtor's      failure to satisfy the means test or other abuse to the      United States Trustee, bankruptcy administrator, case trustee      or judge assigned the     case, and participate with them in the preparation and      presentation of a motion to dismiss, as in Kornfield v.      Schwartz, 164 F. 3d 778 (2d Cir. 1999). Contacts with the      judge, however, cannot be ex parte.       The bill provides that the Internal Revenue Service      standards relied upon for the means test will be studied by      the Executive Office of United States Trustees, with a report      to the respective Judiciary Committees of both Houses of      Congress within 2 years of the effective date.       Disposable income test.--This section also amends section      1325(b)(2) to define disposable income for cases of debtors      with current monthly income over median income, using the      same basic concepts, to the extent they are applicable, that      are used in applying the means test. It is intended that      there be a uniform, nationwide standard to determine      disposable income used in chapter 13 cases, based upon means      test calculations.       Present law requires that in a chapter 13 plan, all of the      debtor's disposable income be used to pay creditors under the      plan, but does not define the term. This section both      requires (1) that all of the debtor's disposable income be      applied to pay unsecured creditors, and (2) that for debtors      whose current monthly income is in excess of the applicable      median income level, their disposable income be determined      using basic means test concepts which define current monthly      income (section 101(10A)), and allowable expenses (section      707(b)(2)(A)(ii), (iii) and (B)).       To determine disposable income for those over the      applicable median income level, first, current monthly income      as defined in HR 2415 is determined. From that amount,      amounts reasonably necessary to be expended for the      maintenance and support of the debtor or a dependent of the      debtor are deducted. The deductions for the expenses of      providing support and maintenance are to be determined in      accordance with the standards of section 707(b)(2)(A) and      (B). Thus, the debtor is allowed the amounts permitted for      food and housing under National Standards and Local Standards      issued by the Internal Revenue Service. Actual expenses for      other amounts in categories specified as Other Necessary      Expenses are also allowed, just as when applying the means      test. Expenses for secured debts which are paid outside of      the plan should be accounted for as required under      707(b)(2)(A)(iii), and payments for secured debt paid under      the plan should be what is provided in the plan as long as it      is not more than the amount permitted under that same      provision. Priority debt payments under the plan are not      reasonably necessary to be expended and should not be      included in the calculation, since under this provision,      disposable income is determined for the purposes of setting      the amount which must be paid to both nonpriority and      priority unsecured creditors. The means test only determines      the projected amount available to pay nonpriority unsecured      creditors.       The provision also provides for the adjustment of the      determination of disposable income if the debtor has      obligations to pay child support, foster care payments or      disability payments for a dependent child, and for certain      continuing charitable contributions as allowed under present      law. As with the means test, adjustments are also permitted      to income or expenses based on the ``special circumstances''      provisions of the means test.       Once net monthly income is determined, it is then      multiplied by the applicable commitment period to determine      the total amount which the plan must apply over its duration      to pay unsecured creditors. If the plan does not apply all of      disposable income to pay unsecured creditors, the plan is not      confirmable.       Administration of the means test.--Several important      additional provisions assist in the efficient administration      of the means test. Enforcement of the means test is in the      first instance the responsibility of the United States      trustee or bankruptcy administrator for the district in which      the chapter 7 case is pending. The United States trustee or      bankruptcy administrator will be involved in determining      whether debtors have accurately disclosed their income and      expenses, and in preliminarily reviewing debtor's claims that      ``special circumstances'' exist which justify adjustments to      otherwise allowed monthly income and expense amounts. Case      trustees, judges and creditors are also entitled to      investigate means test issues and raise them by motions to      dismiss, or by bringing them to the attention of others      involved in the enforcement process.       When the debtor's chapter 7 petition is first filed, the      court is to review the debtor's income and expense schedule      and determine whether this is a case in which the presumption      in favor of dismissal applies. That will be determinable on      the face of the schedules, since debtors are required to do      the necessary calculations of the means test threshold. If      the presumptions arises, the court is to notify creditors      within ten days after the case is filed that this is a      presumption case.       Next, the United States trustee or bankruptcy administrator      is required to review the debtor's filing to evaluate whether      there should be a motion to dismiss filed. The United Sates      Trustee or bankruptcy administrator is to file with the court      a statement whether the debtor's case would or would not be      presumed to be an abuse under the means test of section      707(b) not later than 10 days after the date of the first      meeting of creditors. Moreover, if the debtor's current      monthly income is over the median income level and the      debtor's net income is more than the means test threshold,      the trustee or administrator must also either file with the      court a motion to dismiss, or a statement why no motion is      being filed. However, if the debtor's gross income is between      100% and 150% of median income, and the debtor's net income      determined in a special short-hand calculation based on core      expenses is under the threshold, the trustee is relieved of      any obligation to file a motion to dismiss. This ``mini      screen'' does not change the substantive requirements of the      means test. Its application is limited and is intended only      to permit the United States trustee or bankruptcy      administrator to use a short-hand method of calculating the      debtor's income available to pay creditors. If the short-hand      calculation of net income indicates that the debtor does not      meet ability to pay criteria, further administration of the      means test is not required. Otherwise, the full means test      calculation will be made to determine whether dismissal or      conversion is appropriate. In other cases, a similar      calculation can be made since the short-hand method of      calculation is one stage of the full means test calculation.       To ensure that debtors and creditors and their respective      counsel do not abuse the process, they are specifically      subjected to the standards of Bankruptcy Rule 9011 with      respect to the claims and defenses debtors and creditors and      their counsel assert in section 707(b) motions. Certain small      businesses with less than 25 employees are exempted from this      requirement. In addition, the accuracy of the schedules the      debtor must file with the petition, and particularly the      statements of assets, debts and income, expenses and means      test calculations, is enforced by a requirement that debtor's      counsel have no knowledge that the schedules are incorrect      after appropriate inquiry. An attorney's inquiry is expected      to be more than a cursory acceptance of the debtor's word and      must be sufficient to verify or disprove any knowledge,      information or belief which would lead a diligent attorney to      doubt the accuracy of the schedules.       Dismissal for abuse.--Dismissal under 707(b) is also      authorized when there is ``abuse''. It is intended that by      changing the standard for dismissal from ``substantial      abuse'' to ``abuse'', stronger controls will be available to      the courts, the United States trustee or bankruptcy      administrator, private trustees and creditors to limit the      abusive use of chapter 7 based on a wide range of      circumstances. The ``bad faith'' and ``totality of the      circumstances'' of the debtor's situation is adopted as an      appropriate standard. It is intended that all forms of      inappropriate and abusive debtor use of chapter 7 will be      covered by this standard, whether because of the debtor's      conduct or the debtor's ability to pay. If a debtor's case      would be dismissed today for ``substantial abuse'' as in In      re Lamanna, 153 F. 3d 1 (1st Cir. 1998), it is intended that      the case should be subject to dismissal under H.R. 2415.      Cases which have decided that a debtor's ability to pay      should not be considered when determining abuse, or can be      outweighed if the debtor is otherwise acting in good faith,      are intended to be overruled. In dealing with ability to pay      cases which are abusive, the presumption of abuse and the      safe harbor protecting debtors from application of the      presumption will not be relevant.       In addition, the standard of abusive conduct is      specifically intended to include consideration of whether a      chapter 7 filing is being used without justification to      secure rejection of a personal service contract.     Section 104. Notice of alternatives       This provision amends Bankruptcy Code section 342(b) to      expand on the contents of the notice which an individual      debtor whose debts are primarily consumer debts must receive      before filing a bankruptcy petition. The content and form of      the notice is to be prescribed by the United States trustee      or bankruptcy administrator for the district in which the      petition is filed, and must contain a description of chapters      7, 11, 12 and 13, review the benefits and costs of each      chapter, the services that are available from a nonprofit      credit counseling agency, and a disclosure of the debtor's      responsibilities in completing a petition with respect to the      accuracy of the schedules and other information provided. It      is intended that this notice will be in an easily understood      form, designed to assist debtors in better understanding the      alternatives for debt adjustment offered by the Bankruptcy      Code, the debtor's responsibilities in seeking such relief,      and as uniform as possible throughout the country.     Section 105. Debtor Financial Management Training Test          Program       The Executive Office of United States Trustees is directed      to develop financial management training curricula and      materials to educate individual debtors in personal financial      management. The materials are to be developed after      consultation with experts. The materials are to be tested in      6 judicial districts over 18 months. At the end of the test,      a report on the results is to be provided to the Speaker of      the House and the President pro tem of the Senate.     Section 106. Credit counseling       Credit counseling is an alternative to filing bankruptcy      for some debtors. It is intended that debtors be fully      informed before they file bankruptcy about this less drastic      alternative to bankruptcy in all instances, but particularly      when they have only received information about their      alternatives from petition preparers or attorneys.       This provision establishes the requirement that before      individual debtors file for bankruptcy, they must be made      aware that credit counseling services are available. Debtors      are not required to actually undergo credit counseling, but      they must be made aware that such alternatives to bankruptcy      do exist. The case of a debtor must be dismissed if it is      filed without meeting that requirement unless the debtor can      demonstrate exigent circumstances which temporarily excuse      satisfying the requirement. It is expected that when courts      do not enforce this requirement sua sponte, the United States      trustee or bankruptcy administrator will bring the matter to      the court's attention by appropriate motion, but any trustee      or other party in interest could do so.       Concern has been expressed that the bankruptcy relief      debtors obtain under present law stops at the discharge,      failing to educate debtors about basic budget management so      they can avoid financial difficulties in the future. Under      this section, individual debtors will be required to attend a      course of instruction in personal financial management      approved by the United States trustee or bankruptcy      administrator for the district in which the petition is      filed. It is intended that the United States trustees and      bankruptcy administrators will strongly promote the      development of effective courses, both through the formal      approval process and informally. If the debtor fails to      attend a required course, the debtor will not be able to      obtain a discharge in either chapter 7 or 13. Provisions      similar to those applicable to credit counseling allow the      United States trustee or bankruptcy administrator to excuse      all filers in a district from the requirement if the trustee      or administrator finds that there are not enough providers of      the courses in the district. Congress intends that this      exemption will not be lightly imposed, and that the trustee      or administrator will use every reasonable effort to see that      there are adequate credit counseling and courses of      instruction available.       Credit counseling agencies and courses of instruction      concerning financial management included in the program must      be approved by the United States trustee or bankruptcy      administrator for the district. This section sets standards      which the United States trustee or bankruptcy administrator      must apply in deciding whether to approve a particular agency      or course. Prior to approval, the qualifications of the      agency or course are to be carefully reviewed by the United      States trustee or bankruptcy administrator. It is intended      that they will require applicants to provide adequate      information about qualifications and programs for this      purpose. Agencies and courses will be initially approved only      for a probationary period of no more than 6 months. After      that, their qualifications and performance will be reviewed      each year by the United States Trustee or bankruptcy      administrator. Review of the United States trustee or      bankruptcy administrator's decision to renew approval for the      first full year term after the probationary period and every      2 years thereafter is available in the United States district      court at the request of any party in interest. In addition,      at any time the district court sitting as a bankruptcy court      can review and disapprove an agency or course of instruction.     Section 107. Schedule of reasonable and necessary expenses       This provision directs the Director of the Executive Office      of United States Trustees to issue schedules of reasonable      and necessary administrative expenses for each judicial      district not later than 180 days after enactment. It is      intended that the administrative expenses for these purposes      include only the chapter 13 trustee's fee as allowed in the      district from time to time, and that the schedules will be      revised as necessary to reflect changes in that fee. Since      the trustee's fee is determined as a percentage of payments      made to creditors, the Director may determine that      the appropriate way to state the schedule is by providing      percentage amounts and a method for determining projected      plan payments. These will generally just be unsecured      debts unless there is a compelling reason to conclude      otherwise.                title ii--enhanced consumer protections     Section 201. Promotion of alternate dispute resolution       This section permits the court, on motion of the debtor and      after a hearing, to reduce a claim based in whole on      unsecured consumer debts by not more than 20% if (1) the      claim was filed by a creditor who unreasonably refused to      negotiate a reasonable alternative repayment system proposed      by an approved credit counseling agency acting on behalf of      the debtor; (2) the debtor's offer was made at least 60 days      before the filing of the bankruptcy petition and provided for      payment of at least 60% of the debt over the repayment period      of the loan, or a reasonable extension thereof; and (3) no      part of the debt under the alternative repayment schedule is      nondischargeable. An approved credit counseling agency means      one approved under the credit counseling provisions of this      Act.       This section applies only to claims which are based on      debts which are wholly unsecured consumer debts. The      provision is also carefully drafted so as only to require      creditors to negotiate, when reasonable, alternative      repayment systems so long as they are reasonable. It does not      require creditors to accept any alternative repayment      proposal, although it is expected that negotiations could      result in reasonable alternative plans being adopted.      Furthermore, the debtor's proposal must provide for at least      60% repayment to the creditor. The debtor's proposal should      not be considered reasonable if it is unlikely the debtor      will be able to make the repayments as proposed.     Section 202. Effect of discharge       A creditor's willful failure to credit plan payments in the      manner required by the plan is a violation of the post-     discharge injunction under section 524(a)(2) if the      creditor's acts to collect and failure to credit payments in      the manner required by the plan causes material injury to the      debtor. However, if a plan has been dismissed, is in default,      or the creditor has not received payments required under the      plan, the failure to credit the payments is not a violation      of the injunction.       This provision also clarifies that it is not a violation of      the post-discharge injunction for a creditor that holds a      claim secured in whole or in part by real property that is      the debtor's principal residence to take actions in the      ordinary course of business to seek or obtain periodic      payments associated with a valid security interest in lieu of      a mortgage foreclosure or other enforcement proceeding not      barred by the injunction. Congress intends this provision to      clarify the law in this area so as to provide a safe harbor      for mortgage lending, but the existence of this clarifying      provision is not intended to suggest that similar action      taken by creditors whose debt is not secured or is secured by      other types of property would be a violation of the post-     discharge injunction.     Section 203. Discouraging abuse of reaffirmation practices       This provision amends section 524(c)(2) of the Code to      provide a clearly understandable disclosure form to explain      the debtor's rights and obligations in the reaffirmation      process. It is intended that a single nationwide form as set      out in the statute will be used for all reaffirmations in all      bankruptcy courts, and that it will be the only disclosure      required in the reaffirmation process. It is expected that      the nationwide form will assist those who teach budgeting and      financial management in secondary schools, provide credit      counseling, or assist those in financial difficulty in      educating consumers about the benefits and disadvantages of      reaffirmations so that debtors who do reaffirm will be better      informed about what they are doing. The provision is also      intended to create a nationwide method of processing      reaffirmations so that companies who must administer      reaffirmations in several areas are freed from special      requirements in particular localities.       The statutory form, in addition to clearly explaining to      debtors what they are doing when they reaffirm, also provides      a form which may be used as the reaffirmation agreement and a      form for the debtor's attorney's certification when the      debtor is represented. Debtors must also fill out a Part D in      which they state their ability to pay the amount being      reaffirmed based upon their income and expenses, including      other reaffirmed debts. If debtors cannot complete the form      showing they have ability to pay the reaffirmed amount, there      is a presumption of undue hardship for a period of 60 days,      and the reaffirmation must be submitted for review by the      court even when the debtor's attorney certifies that the      reaffirmation is in the debtor's best interest. Since income      and expenses for these purposes are those the debtor will      have post-discharge, the standards of income and expense      under section 102 of HR 2415 are not relevant. The debtor's      actual post-discharge income and expenses as the debtor      determines them will control.       Credit unions are permitted to change the form to reflect      that the debtor may fill out a simpler Part D when a credit      union member is reaffirming a debt. The credit union member      only needs to indicate that will pay the reaffirmed      obligation, and there is no presumption of undue hardship or      requirement of review by the judge.       Creditors and debtors must make good faith efforts to      comply with the requirements imposed by this section.      However, there is no intention that errors in completing or      using the disclosure forms or complying with the procedural      requirements of this section will be construed as a violation      when those errors occur in good faith. Under present law,      violations of the reaffirmation requirements are enforceable      only as violations of the post-discharge injunction.      Enforcement of the injunction is an equitable proceeding in      which the equities are weighed, courts take into account the      good faith of the creditor. Under this section, creditors may      accept payments from debtors before and after the filing of a      reaffirmation agreement, and may accept and retain payments      under a reaffirmation agreement which the creditor believes      in good faith to be effective, even though subsequently it is      determined that the reaffirmation agreement is not in fact      effective. For example, if the creditor and debtor agree      that the debtor is responsible to file the reaffirmation      agreement, and the debtor does not do so, the creditor      should be able to accept and retain payments from the      debtor unless it knew the debtor had not in fact filed the      agreement with the court. Likewise, if a debtor indicates      that he or she has ability to pay in Part D, a creditor      can rely upon that statement. Moreover, the requirements      of subsection (c)(2) and those added by this section are      satisfied if the disclosures required under those      provisions are given in good faith. For the purposes of      this section, ``good faith'' is     to be broadly construed as honesty in fact under the      circumstances. The narrow standard of good faith under the      Truth in Lending Act is not intended.       The requirements of present law are continued that debtors      who do not have counsel who will certify that a reaffirmation      is in the debtor's best interest must have the reaffirmation      approved by the court before it can be effective. Otherwise,      a reaffirmation is effective upon filing the completed and      signed statutory form and reaffirmation agreement with the      court.       The provision also directs that United States attorneys in      each district will designate a specific person within their      offices to address violations of criminal law relating to      bankruptcy crimes when they involve abusive reaffirmations or      materially fraudulent statements on schedules.     Subtitle B--Priority Child Support       Bankruptcy law has long recognized the legal and moral      importance of the payment of obligations incurred by a debtor      for the support of his or her spouse and children. As such,      it has striven to avoid having bankruptcy become a haven for      those who would avoid such obligations or an inadvertent      impediment for those who wish to comply with those      obligations. However, the treatment of domestic support in      bankruptcy had developed somewhat haphazardly over time as      new issues and concerns have been raised and addressed      piecemeal. Moreover, the Code had lagged behind in dealing      with the changing legal status of payments made to      governmental entities for such obligations, specifically      whether such payments were to be paid directly to support the      child or family of the debtor, or were to be retained by the      government because the parent or child was receiving public      assistance.       Under current nonbankruptcy law the status of a support      obligation may change rapidly as the recipient moves on or      off government assistance even though the underlying      responsibility to support the child or family is unaltered.      Thus, there is little reason for payments of domestic support      obligations to governmental entities not to be treated      equally with payments of such obligations directly to a      parent or child, or for a debtor to have a lesser duty to      satisfy those debts.       Prior to HR 2415 the principle of favored treatment for all      domestic support obligations had only been partially      recognized in the Code, and there were a number of areas in      which bankruptcy filings impacted domestic matters which were      not dealt with at all.       Accordingly, Congress undertook a comprehensive review of      all aspects of the treatment of domestic support obligations      under the Code to determine how to create a coherent and      consistent structure to deal with such obligations in      bankruptcy.       The following basic principles were employed in the support      amendments contained in these provisions:       1. Bankruptcy should interfere as little as possible with      the establishment and collection of on-going obligations for      support, as allowed in State family law courts.       2. The Bankruptcy Code should provide a broad and      comprehensive definition of support, which should then      receive favored treatment in the bankruptcy process.       3. The bankruptcy process should insure the continued      payment of on-going support and support arrearages with      minimal need for participation in the process by support      creditors.       4. The bankruptcy process should be structured to allow a      debtor to liquidate nondischargeable debt to the greatest      extent possible within the context of a bankruptcy case and      emerge from the process with the freshest start feasible.       There were a number of areas under former law where these      goals were not met. Support and debts in the nature of      support were not treated uniformly in the Bankruptcy Code or      by bankruptcy courts. Conspicuously, debts owed to the      government and based upon the payment of government funds for      the maintenance and support of the children or family of the      debtor were not given the advantages which the Code affords      to debts payable directly to the family of the debtor.      Specifically, support debts assigned or owed to the      government on the petition date have not been entitled to any      priority under section 507(a), have not been protected from      loss of their secured status under section 522(f)(1)(A), and      have been recoverable by the trustee as a preference under      section 547(c)(7)(A). Conversely, support debts which were      not assigned on the petition date were entitled to superior      treatment as provided in sections 507(a)(7), 522(f)(1)(A),      and 547(c)(7)(A).       Because support debts which are assigned to a governmental      entity when a petition is filed may become unassigned during      the course of a Chapter 12 or 13 bankruptcy plan, and vice      versa, the disparate treatment of these debts in the      Bankruptcy Code makes little sense. A family which is in need      of support after assistance terminates certainly should not      lose the advantages the Code gives unassigned support simply      because the support was assigned on the petition date. The      contrary was also true. Governmental entities under former      law received the advantages given to the creditor of      unassigned support when the support became assigned during      bankruptcy. An overriding purpose of Subtitle B is to      eliminate substantially such distinctions in the treatment of      support obligations.       In addition to the disparate treatment of support debts      found in the Code, the courts also drew distinctions with      respect to the dischargeability of support debts owed to the      government and support debts owed to the parent or child of      the debtor. These distinctions were often arcane and      technical. To illustrate, if the debts were owed to the      government and based upon the payment of public      assistance, the dischargeability of such debts turned on      the irrelevant circumstance of when the aid was paid. As a      result, judgment debts for support based upon the payment      of public assistance prior to the date a petition for on-     going support was entered could be discharged while an      arrearage accrued under an on-going order could not, even      when the support debts were based on identical criteria.      And contributing to a lack of uniformity, the decisional      law was not consistent. Moreover, many debts which were      incurred by a debtor based upon the responsibility of a      governmental entity to provide for the support and      maintenance of a child, but which debts were never owed to      the child or family of the debtor directly, could be      discharged. In particular the following were found to be      dischargeable: debts incurred for the costs of maintenance      of a child in a juvenile detention facility; debts      incurred to support a child who was made a ward of the      state; debts for support which had not been reduced to a      judgment at the time the bankruptcy petition was filed;      and debts for child support and maintenance resulting from      the placement of the debtor's children in shelter care      facilities. In all of these situations debtors have the      same legal, equitable, and moral obligations to provide      for the support of their children, but under the      peculiarities of former law they could transfer that      burden to the taxpayers. The domestic support enforcement      provisions of HR 2415 is designed to insure compliance      with those obligations, during and after bankruptcy.     Section 211. Definition of domestic support obligation       To ensure that all debts relating to the support of a      debtor's spouse, former spouse, family or child are given a      similar treatment in bankruptcy, section 211 of HR 2415      provides a sweeping definition for the concept of a      ``domestic support obligation.'' This definition is intended      to clarify the following:       1. The domestic support obligation includes interest on      that obligation as provided under applicable nonbankruptcy      law. Thus, if a State provides for prejudgment or      postjudgment interest on support, such interest is included      in the definition of a domestic support obligation.       2. To be nondischargeable support, the obligation must be      owed to or recoverable by a ``spouse, former spouse, or child      of the debtor or such child's parent, legal guardian, or      responsible relative'' or the debt must be owed to a      governmental unit. As distinguished from former law as      interpreted by the courts, the debt no longer need be owed to      the person or entity filing the claim. It need only be      recoverable by such entity. This definition is meant to      preserve present statutory or decisional law affecting the      dischargeability of debts in the nature of support owed to      attorneys or other persons or entities providing assistance      to the creditor spouse and children in a domestic proceeding.      Nor is there any remaining requirement that the debt be      assigned to a government or recoverable under Title IV-D of      the Social Security Act for the debt to be excepted from      discharge. The debt need only be owed to or recoverable by a      governmental unit. Likewise, the debt does not become      dischargeable simply because the support was ordered to be      paid to the government or a nonparent. Support ordered to be      paid to a legal guardian or responsible relative is also not      dischargeable.       3. As under the former law, to be excepted from discharge      the debt must be ``in the nature of support.'' Unlike the      former law, however, a debt based upon assistance provided by      a governmental unit for the benefit of a spouse, former      spouse or child of the debtor, is now specifically included      as a debt in the nature of support. This classification      applies whether or not the debt incurred by the debtor is      specifically designated as support and whether or not the      spouse, former spouse or child has a separate legal right to      establish a support obligation.       4. Under former law the support debt had to made ``in      connection with a separation agreement, divorce decree, or      other order of a court of record.'' Therefore, it was      arguable that if the debt had not been reduced to an      agreement, decree or order on the date a petition for relief      was filed, it was not excepted from discharge. The new      definition of a domestic support obligation specifies to the      contrary that the debt may be established ``or subject to      establishment before or after an order for relief'' to      qualify as a nondischargeable debt.       5. Finally the definition of a domestic support obligation      continues to exclude support which has been assigned to a      nongovernmental entity, unless the assignment is merely made      for the purpose of collecting the debt. This definition      codifies existing case law.       Having created this definition of a ``domestic support      obligation,'' HR 2415 uses it in twenty specific places. In      so doing, HR 2415 generally treats support related debts      similarly, no matter how the debt arose or to whom the debt      is owed.     Section. 212. Priorities for claims for domestic support          obligations       All domestic support obligation debts are given a first      priority. Within that priority     two categories of support debts are established. Support      debts owed directly to support recipients, as of the date of      the bankruptcy petition, are paid prior to debts owed or      assigned to the government. Therefore all claims filed as      priority 1(A) must be paid prior to claims filed as priority      1(B).       When, however, such claims are filed by a governmental unit      and that unit receives payments on the claim, the subsequent      application and distribution of moneys are governed not by      the claim as it existed on the petition date, but by      nonbankruptcy law applicable to such governmental units.      Thus, receipt of money claimed as a priority 1(A) debt may be      distributed by the government to reimburse itself for the      payment of public assistance if the creditor assigns that      debt to the government postpetition. Likewise, debts which      are assigned to the government prepetition and claimed as      priority 1(B) debts will be distributed directly to the      support obligee if the debt is no longer assigned as of the      date the government received the funds.       Other changes in distribution may also occur. If the      trustee pays a governmental entity on a claim in one month,      and the debtor owes but has not paid a support order accruing      in that month, the governmental unit may credit the payment      to the current month's obligation, not to the claim. The      governmental unit may also credit any payment received on      the claim against newly accrued postpetition judgment      interest, rather than against the principal portion of the      claim. The purpose of these rules relating to governmental      support claims is to allow the distribution of money      received as support in the same manner it would be      distributed if the debtor had not filed a bankruptcy      petition.     Section 213. Requirements to obtain confirmation and          discharge in cases involving domestic support obligations       Section 213 sets up four check points to ensure that      debtors are complying with their domestic support obligations      when they have filed a bankruptcy case under Chapters 11, 12,      and 13.       1. A case can be converted or dismissed at any time if the      debtor does not remain current in the payment of an on-going      support obligation. Under former law the Code did not      explicitly require such payments or mandate an early      termination of a plan when a debtor was not in compliance      with an on-going support order, although some courts used      their discretion to dismiss such cases for ``cause.'' HR 2415      allows the court to convert or dismiss a Chapter 12 or 13      plan for failure of the debtor to pay postpetition on-going      support.       2. To be confirmed a plan must provide for payment of all      past due priority claims for domestic support obligations.      The Code does, however, provide two exceptions. It allows a      creditor the option of accepting less than full payment under      the plan. It also allows a debtor to ``cram down'' a less      than full payment plan for priority support debts which are      assigned to a governmental entity, so long as the plan      provides for payment of all disposable income of the debtor      for the maximum five year period allowed for a plan in      Chapters 12 and 13. However, since these debts will not be      discharged in any event, the debtor will be given a      substantial incentive to propose and complete such a plan.       3. A plan under Chapters 11, 12, and 13 may not be      confirmed unless the debtor has remained current in the      payment of all support first becoming due postpetition. Nor      can a debtor in a Chapter 12 or 13 case obtain a discharge      unless all support becoming due postpetition has been paid.      These provisions are designed to be self-executing, at least      to the extent they do not require affirmative action on the      part of a support creditor to implement them. Payment of      domestic support obligation arrears, in order to receive a      discharge, is required only to the extent ``provided for by      the plan.'' Thus, agreements made at the time of confirmation      to accept less than full payment or the use of ``cram down''      rights possessed by the debtor may allow the debtor to      receive a discharge without full payment of all prepetition      domestic support obligations. Of course, completion of such a      plan would not discharge any remaining domestic support      obligations, but would allow the debtor to be relieved from      other debts covered by the general discharge under the      relevant chapter.       4. HR 2415 allows, but does not require, the debtor to      include in a plan the payment of postpetition interest on a      nondischargeable debt if the debtor is able to do so after      paying other debts. This provision is a departure from former      law which did not allow a claim for interest, unless the      claim was secured, even though interest continued to accrue      on nondischargeable debts. As a result, even if the debtor      provided for full payment of the prepetition support debt,      this debtor would be left at the end of the plan with a      remaining debt for interest. Accordingly, while a debtor will      often not have sufficient income to make postpetition      interest payments, the debtor may wish, if feasible, to make      such payments in order to obtain a fresh start at the      completion of the plan.     Section 214. Exceptions to automatic stay in domestic support          obligation proceedings       HR 2415 also adds additional exceptions to the automatic      stay. Under section 362(a) various activities of creditors      are stayed once a bankruptcy petition has been filed. Under      former law there were exceptions to the automatic stay which      permitted the establishment of paternity, and the      establishment or modification of a support order but they did      not deal with a number of other domestic issues. In addition,      under former law the automatic stay did not apply to the      collection of support so long as it was collected from      property which was not property of the bankruptcy estate.      Since property of the estate included debtor's income in      Chapter 12 and 13 cases, at least until confirmation of the      plan, a support creditor had no way of obtaining either on-     going support or prepetition support arrearages, unless the      obligor/debtor paid these debts voluntarily or the creditor      obtained relief from the stay. These amendments deal with      both issues. They include the following:       1. The existing exceptions are amended to refer to the new      definition of a domestic support obligation. Additional      language is added to clarify that certain other family-     related matters such as custody, divorce, and domestic      violence proceedings may continue to be pursued without      obtaining relief from the automatic stay except to the extent      a divorce proceeding seeks to deal with the division of      estate property. Property division issues in a divorce are      not intended to impinge on the exclusive jurisdiction of the      bankruptcy court over estate assets.       2. Section 362(b)(2)(C) is added to provide for the      withholding of income from property of the debtor or from      property of the estate for the payment of a domestic support      obligation. In this provision Congress has divested the      bankruptcy court of exclusive jurisdiction over the      bankruptcy estate to the extent a debtor's wages are estate      property. Under prior law such withholding would have been      allowed only if it were determined that the debtor's income      was no longer property of the estate. This section      specifically allows the use of estate property to pay support      through the wage withholding process without any bankruptcy      imposed limitation. The purpose of this provision is to allow      income withholding to be implemented or to continue after a      Chapter 11, 12 or 13 petition is filed, just as it would if a      Chapter 7 petition were filed. The income withholding      provisions were enacted to allow compliance with procedures      mandated in the Child Support Enforcement Program, Social      Security Act, Title IV-D. Income withholding applies to the      collection of on-going support and support arrearages. It may      be implemented by court order or through an administrative      process.       3. Use of other support enforcement techniques are also      excepted from the reach of the automatic stay. Under the      amendment, the withholding, suspension, or restriction of      drivers' licenses, professional and occupational licenses,      and recreational licenses under state law as provided in the      Social Security Act is not stayed. Likewise, the automatic      stay does not bar the reporting of overdue support to a      consumer reporting agency as required by the Social Security      Act. Also excepted from the automatic stay is the      interception of tax refunds as required by the Social      Security Act. Thus, refunds which are payable to the debtor      by the State taxing authorities or the IRS, and even refunds      which the debtor intends to include or includes in his or her      bankruptcy estate, may be seized to satisfy support      obligations as required or allowed under State and federal      law without requiring relief from the automatic stay.      Finally, under the enforcement of medical support obligations      as mandated by the Social Security Act is not stayed.     Section. 215. Nondischargeability of certain debts for          alimony, maintenance, and support       This section makes all domestic support obligations non-     dischargeable. The most significant effect of this change is      that all debts owed to a governmental entity which are      derived from payments by the government to meet needs of the      debtor's family for support and maintenance are excepted from      discharge. This change will nullify the holdings cited in      footnotes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7. By amending 523(a)(5) and (15),      all ``domestic support obligations'' as broadly defined in      new section 101(14A) of the Bankruptcy Code are excepted from      discharge.       Section 215 also makes nondischargeable all non-support      debts incurred in connection with a divorce or separation.      Previously such debts may have been determined to be      nondischargeable only if the support creditor brought a      timely proceeding to determine the dischargeability of the      debt and proved not only that the debtor had the ability to      pay the debt but that discharging the debt would result in a      benefit to the creditor which outweighed the detriment to the      debtor. This provision gives debts resulting from the      division of property the same protection from discharge as      support debts.     Section. 216. Continued liability of property       Section 522(c)(1) of the Code, as amended by this section,      incorporates the new definition of a domestic support      obligation into the existing provision which subjects      otherwise exempt assets to debts for nondischargeable taxes      and support obligations. This section expands this principle      to preempt state law and specifically provides that under      federal law such exempt property must be made available to      satisfy a domestic support obligation, notwithstanding state      law to the contrary. The purpose of this provision is to      nullify the Fifth Circuit en banc holding in Matter of Davis,      170 F.3d 475 (5th Cir. 1999), and to reinstate the holding of      the original Fifth Circuit panel.       Section 522(f)(1) allows a debtor to avoid judicial liens      on exempt property, but contains an exception for liens which      secured unassigned child support. This section extends this      exception to domestic support obligations. Therefore, any      judicial lien placed on the debtor's property which secures a      support related obligation, whether assigned or not, may not      be avoided even though the lien impairs the exemption to      which the debtor would otherwise have been entitled.     Section 217. Protection of domestic support claims against          preferential transfer motions       Section 547(c)(7) previously barred the trustee from      recovering, as a preferential transfer, bona fide payments of      an unassigned support obligations. This section extends this      exception to all domestic support obligations.     Section 218. Disposable income defined       This section adds language to the disposable income test      under chapters 12 and 13. The language added to chapter 13      simply repeats language already added by section 102 of this      Act.     Section 219. Collection of child support       This section improves the information available to child      support and alimony claimants when the person who owes      support or alimony files for bankruptcy. In those cases, the      chapter 7, 11, 12 or 13 trustee is to provide both the      support claimant and the State child support collection      agency with information about the filing, and inform the      claimant about the availability of free or low cost      collection services through the State agency. Additionally,      when the debtor is discharged, the trustee is to notify the      claimant and the State agency of the fact of the discharge      and certain information about the location of the debtor. If      a debt has been determined to be nondischargeable or is      reaffirmed, the trustee is also to notify the claimant and      the State agency of the name of the creditor affected.      Creditors whose names are the subject of a notification are      required, when asked, to provide the last known address of      the debtor.     Section 220. Nondischargeability of certain educational          benefits and loans       This provision makes certain student loans offered by non-     governmental creditors nondischargeable.     Section 221. Amendment to discourage abusive bankruptcy          filings       This provision inserts strong new regulation of bankruptcy      petition preparers. It is intended that this regulation be      strongly enforced.     Section 222. Sense of Congress       The sense of Congress is expressed that States should      develop courses on personal finances for use in primary and      secondary education. Consumer credit has become widely      available in our economy. Congress considers it to be of the      greatest importance that educational programs like those      sponsored and promoted by the Jump Start Coalition of      governmental and private entities be encouraged. By educating      children when they are young in the basics of personal      financial management, inappropriate use of consumer credit      can be reduced, and better ability of average citizens to      manage financial crises can be promoted.     Section 223. Additional amendments       This section provides a new 10th priority under section 507      of the Bankruptcy Code for claims based on driving while      intoxicated under influence of drugs.     Section 224. Protection of retirement savings       This provision broadens the exemptions for retirement      savings available under present law to cover all forms of      pensions and savings plans allowed to be exempt from current      income taxation under the Internal Revenue Code. It provides      protection from creditors' claims for tax-favored retirement      plans or arrangements which are not already protected from      creditors' claims under current law. The section carries no      implication that the protection from the bankruptcy estate      afforded to plans by virtue of section 541 of the Bankruptcy      Code as applied in the Shumate decision, and the line of      cases following that decision, or by any provision of the      Bankruptcy Code or other state or federal law that protect      plan assets from creditors, is in anyway reduced. This      amendment to the Bankruptcy Code is in accordance with      longstanding Congressional policy of conserving and      preserving plan assets for use as retirement security for      participants in their retirement years. As such, it is      intended to be in addition to the protections provided by      current law and is not in any way intended to supplant or      supercede protections which exist in current law.       Section 224 covers plans that have received determination      letters from the Internal Revenue Service as well as plans,      such as public plans, that have not received such letters but      are intended to be operated in accordance with ERISA and or      Internal Revenue Code, as applicable. It also covers plan      assets in transit such as when they are directly transferred      by a plan administrator to a plan sponsored by another      employer or to an Individual Retirement Account. The same      protection is provided when the plan assets are distributed      directly to an employee upon termination of employment and      within 60 days of the distribution of the employee transfers      the distributed amount in another qualified retirement plan      or into an Individual Retirement Account.       In addition, the Section provides that if there is an      outstanding pension plan loan to a participant at the time of      bankruptcy filing such loan is not to be discharged or a stay      issued on any withholdings from the wages of the debtor that      are being used to make level repayments of the loan. A stay      of the withholding would result in a default and under the      ERISA rules cause the amount of the unpaid balance to become      taxable income. The ensuing tax liability would take      precedence over unsecured creditors' claims. A plan loan is      actually a special nontaxable distribution which the      participant is expected to return to the plan.       Under the asset limitation provision of this section, the      maximum amount exempt for bankruptcy purposes in an IRA or      Roth/IRA, other than a simplified employee pension under      section 408(k) of the Internal Revenue Code or a simple      retirement account under 408(p) of the Internal Revenue Code,      is limited to $1,000,000, excluding rollover contributions      under 402(c), 402(e)(6), 403(a)(4), and 403(a)(5) of the      Internal Revenue Code, as well as earnings thereon. The      $1,000,000 maximum amount is subject to adjustment under      section 104 of the Code. In addition, the $1,000,000 maximum      amount is subject to increase if the interests of justice so      require.     Section 225. Protection of Education Savings       Section 225 protects certain educational savings in the      event of bankruptcy. Qualified State Tuition Programs      represent a joint effort by the federal government and the      states to encourage saving for post-secondary education.      Congress has expressed a clear interest in encouraging the      post-secondary education of children by permitting      individuals to save exclusively to cover the expenses of      higher education through Qualified State Tuition Programs on      a tax-favored basis. However, Congressional interest in      promoting saving for post-secondary education would be      frustrated if accounts in Qualified State Tuition Programs      are pulled into the bankruptcy estate of the debtor because      of certain rights of the donor.       Therefore, with certain exceptions, section 225 excludes      from a debtor's bankruptcy estate funds and earnings on such      funds contributed to an account established pursuant to a      qualified state tuition program under Section 529 of the      Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (``IRC''). The      funds in these accounts may be used for qualified higher      education expenses (including tuition, fees, books, supplies      and room and board) of a designated beneficiary of the debtor      and cannot be transferred to any person other than a      qualified family member without adverse federal tax and other      consequences. Section 225 would only permit exclusion from      the bankruptcy estate funds in qualified state tuition      programs for a restricted group of designated beneficiaries,      limited to children and grandchildren (including step-     children and step-grandchildren). The provision recognizes      that adopted and foster children fall into this category and      that ``step-grandchild'' is intended to include both the      stepchild of the debtor's child as well as the child of the      debtor's stepchild.       This provision makes clear that, subject to certain      requirements, contributions to these accounts are not to be      pulled into the debtor's estate for bankruptcy purposes. All      contributions and earnings thereon are thus protected except:      (1) contributions made to a program less than 365 days before      the date of filing the bankruptcy petition; or (2)      contributions in excess of $5000 made to a program less than      720 days before filing the bankruptcy petition.       Section 225 includes similar provisions extending      protection to funds placed in education individual retirement      accounts, as defined in Section 530 of the Internal      Revenue Code.     Sections 226-229. Debtor's bill of rights       These four sections, derived from federal law regulating      credit repair agencies, provide for new disclosures and      restrictions on practices with which bankruptcy petition      preparers, attorneys and anyone else who meets the definition      of a debt relief agency must comply. Congress was concerned      that debtors who file bankruptcy be better informed about the      nature and scope of bankruptcy, the different remedies that      are available, and the significance of the step they are      taking, so that they can both better evaluate it, better      understand what is going to happen, and better protect      themselves. It is also the intent that debtors be better able      to negotiate with their attorneys about fees and services      provided. For example, provisions require that debtors be      clearly informed about what services an attorney will provide      the debtor and for what fee.       Bankruptcy petition preparers must comply with these      provisions as well as those imposed under the Code and      section 221 of HR 2415.       Section 226. Definitions       This section defines various terms, including who is an      ``assisted person'', what is ``bankruptcy assistance'', and      who is a ``debt relief agency''. It is intended that these      provisions be broadly interpreted since they define the scope      of the protections which debtors receive under the related      provisions. Authors, publishers, distributors or sellers of      works subject to copyright protection when acting solely as      such an author, publisher, distributor or seller are excluded      from the definition. Thus an attorney who writes a book on      how to file bankruptcy is not a debt relief agency when      promoting or selling the copyrighted book. But when that same      attorney represents debtors filing petitions, the attorney is      a debt relief agency because no     longer acting in the capacity of an author, even if he gives      his clients a copy of the book.       Section 227. Restrictions on Debt Relief Agencies       This section creates a new section 526 of the Code which      proscribes certain practices by debt relief agencies and      provides for enforcement of violations of this section and      new Code sections 527 and 528.       Enforcement is provided for any violations of new Code      section 526, 527 or 528. Intentional or negligent failures to      comply with any requirements of the three sections permit the      debtor to obtain restitution of any fees or charges made by      the agency, as well as actual damages and reasonable      attorneys fees. The same damages are available for      intentional or negligent disregard of the material      requirements of the Bankruptcy Code or Rules. Any contract      for bankruptcy assistance that does not comply with the      material requirements imposed is void, except that the      assisted person can enforce it. State attorney generals are      also empowered to enforce the provisions of these sections,      and the United States District Court are granted concurrent      jurisdiction of any such enforcement proceeding. The court,      the United States Trustee or the debtor may also seek      injunctive relief or civil penalties against intentional      violators or those with a clear and consistent pattern or      practice of violation of any of these sections.       The section also provides that its requirements in new      sections 527 and 528 do not excuse any person from complying      with State laws unless the State law is inconsistent with      those sections. Also specifically preserved from preemption      are any practice of law requirements under State or federal      law if they conflict with the requirements of sections 526,      527 or 528 added to the Code. It is not expected that any of      these new sections will impose upon debt relief agencies      requirements that would force them to violate applicable      unauthorized practice of law restrictions. For example,      providing the disclosures under section 527 should not be the      practice of law, since the content of the disclosure is set      by federal law and does not involve giving a debtor advice.      For similar reasons, the additional information debt relief      agencies are required by section 527(c) with respect to      valuation of assets, completion of the list of creditors and      exempt property should not involve giving legal advice.      However, in the event applicable unauthorized practice rules      proscribe non-lawyers from providing such information, the      provision states that it is only required to the extent      permitted by nonbankruptcy law.       Section 228. Disclosures       This section creates new Bankruptcy Code section 527 which      requires a debt relief agency to deliver to an assisted      person required disclosures either described or set forth in      the section. Within 3 business days after the agency first      offers to provide bankruptcy assistance in a written, face to      face, telephone, internet or similar solicitation or contact,      the agency must provide, the agency must provide a clear and      conspicuous written notice which states that the information      the assisted person provides in the bankruptcy proceeding      must be complete, accurate and truthful, assets and      liabilities must be completely and accurately disclosed and      assets must be valued and income and expenses stated after      reasonable inquiry, and that information provided may be      audited. Before the commencement of the case, the agency must      provide the debtor with the notice required under section      342(b)(1) (as amended by this Act) and an additional      disclosure set forth in the section which explains the      bankruptcy process and relief and what the debtor can expect.      The agency must also instruct the debtor in how to value      assets, how to complete the list of creditors, and how to      determine exempt property. Record keeping requirements are      imposed upon the agency to keep copies of the notices      required under this section for a period of 2 years after      delivery. It is expected that the Bankruptcy Rules will      provide model forms of disclosure and specify further the      time and manner in which these disclosures will be made.       Section 229. Requirements for debt relief agencies.       This section creates a new section 528 of the Code that      regulates agencies' contracting and advertising. The agency      is required to execute a written contract with the assisted      person within 5 business days (but before the petition is      filed) of providing any bankruptcy assistance, and provide      the person with an executed copy. If the agency does not      execute a contract within that period of time, it must      terminate its relationship with the assisted person.       The agency must also disclose in any advertisement that the      services or benefits are with respect to bankruptcy relief.      Congress is specifically concerned that debtors understand      the services they are being offered involve bankruptcy. This      section is intended to prevent agencies from describing their      services ambiguously so as to obscure that the assisted      person will be obtaining bankruptcy relief. A standard form      of disclosure that the services are with respect to      bankruptcy relief is set forth in the section.                Title III--Discouraging Bankruptcy Abuse     Section 301. Reinforcement of the fresh start       Present law makes nondischargeable any fee or charge      imposed by a court for filing a case, motion, complaint or      appeal or related costs or expenses. This section restricts      the provision so that it applies only to matters filed by a      prisoner.     Section 302. Discouraging bad faith repeat filings       This section is intended to strongly limit the practice of      using bankruptcy filings and the automatic stay that arises      under section 362 to abuse the bankruptcy process. Debtors      who file bankruptcy only once in a one year period will not      be affected. However, upon a second filing within one year,      the automatic stay will terminate with respect to the debtor      or the debtor's property on the 30th day after the second      filing. The debtor can seek to have the automatic stay      continued by filing a motion and demonstrating that the      second filing is in good faith, but there is a presumption      that under certain circumstances the second filing is not in      good faith.       Upon the third or an additional filing within a one year      period, the automatic stay does not go into effect at all. On      motion made within 30 days of the third filing, the court may      order the stay to take effect as to some or all creditors.      The party in interest must demonstrate that the third filing      is in good faith, and there is a presumption that under      certain circumstances the third filing is not in good faith.       Clear and convincing evidence must be presented in order to      rebut the presumptions which arise both with respect to the      second and third or later filings.       Conduct covered by this section may also provide an      appropriate ground to dismiss a chapter 7 under section      707(b) as revised by HR 2415.     Section 303. Curbing abusive filings       This provision authorizes in rem orders to prevent abusive      use of bankruptcy filings. The bankruptcy court is authorized      to order that the automatic stay be lifted as to a secured      creditor with respect to the current and all subsequent cases      to which the automatic stay would otherwise apply if the      court finds that the filing of a bankruptcy was either part      of a scheme to delay, hinder, and defraud creditors by means      of transferring all or part of an interest in real property      without the secured creditor's consent or court approval, or      involved multiple bankruptcy filings affecting real property.       Once such an order is issued, it can be recorded by anyone      in the real property records affecting the real property      involved, and recording agencies must accept for recording      and record and index any such order so that it will be notice      to third parties. Such a recorded order is notice to third      parties for 2 years after recording. The court can reimpose      the automatic stay in a subsequent case after appropriate      notice and hearing if good cause or changed circumstances are      shown.       In addition, the automatic stay does not apply at all to      prevent acts to enforce security interests in real property      if the debtor is ineligible for bankruptcy under section      109(g) or the filing violates a court order in a previous      case baring the debtor from refiling.     Section 304. Debtor retention of personal property security       This provision is intended to prevent ``ride through'' in      the situations to which it applies. A ``ride through'' is the      debtor's retention of collateral and maintenance of current      payment obligations over the creditor's objection without      reaffirming. This section and section 305, taken together,      are intended to reverse the results of such cases as Capital      Communications Fed. Credit Union v. Boodrow, 126 F. 3d 43 (2d      Cir. 1997) cert denied, 522 U.S. 1117 (1998).       Under this provision, an individual debtor is not permitted      to retain possession of personal property subject to a      security interest securing the purchase price of that      personal property unless the debtor enters into a      reaffirmation agreement which becomes effective under section      524(c) of the Code, or redeems the property under section 722      of the Code. The debtor is given 45 days after the first      meeting a creditors to take one of those two steps or to      relinquish possession of the personal property to the      creditor. If the debtor fails to complete one of the steps      within the prescribed period, the automatic stay is      terminated with respect to the property whether it is      property of the estate or not, and the creditor may take      whatever action as to the property as is permitted by      applicable nonbankruptcy law. Although the automatic stay      ends upon the expiration of the 45 day period, a creditor is      free to allow a debtor to retain possession of collateral and      accept continued payments by not taking any actions to      collect, since this provision is for the creditor's benefit.       However, the trustee can bring a motion before the end of      the 45 day period asserting that the property is of      consequential value or benefit to the estate. If the court      finds that the retention of the property will benefit      creditors significantly, orders appropriate adequate      protection of the creditor's interest, and orders the debtor      to deliver the property to the trustee, the court may      extend application of the stay for a further reasonable      time to permit the trustee to obtain the benefit for the      estate.       The section also amends section 722 to make it absolutely      clear that the full, complete and immediate cash payment of      the redemption amount to the creditor is necessary for there      to be a redemption. Installment redemptions are not      permitted.     Section 305. Relief from the automatic stay when the debtor          does not complete intended surrender of consumer debt          collateral       Like the previous section, this section is also intended to      prevent ``ride through'' with respect to any property the      section covers. Any personal property of the estate or of the      debtor securing a claim or subject to an unexpired lease is      covered by the section, and in certain instances creditors      will be protected by both this section and the previous      section, in which case the provisions can be applied      cumulatively.       The section provides that the automatic stay terminates if      the debtor fails to timely (1) file a statement of intention      covering the property indicating that the debtor will either      redeem the property under section 722 of the Code, reaffirm      the debt it secures under section 524(c) of the Code, or      assume an unexpired lease under section 365(p) of the Code      (as amended by HR 2415), or (2) take the action specified in      the statement of intention (unless the statement of intention      specifies reaffirmation and the creditor refuses to reaffirm      on the original contract terms). Although the automatic stay      ends upon the expiration of the period for taking action, a      creditor is free to allow a debtor to retain possession of      collateral and accept continued payments by not taking any      actions to collect, since this provision is for the      creditor's benefit.       However, as with the previous section, the trustee can      bring a motion before the end of the period set by section      521(a)(2) asserting that the property is of consequential      value or benefit to the estate, and on similar findings, the      court may extend application of the stay for a further      reasonable time to permit the trustee to obtain the benefit      for the estate.       In addition, this section validates certain clauses which      have the effect of placing the debtor in default by reason of      the occurrence, pendency or existence of a proceeding under      this title, or the insolvency of the debtor.     Section 306. Giving secured creditors fair treatment in          chapter 13       This provision changes the relationship of secured      creditors and debtors in certain situations arising in      chapter 13 proceedings.       First, in order for a debtor's plan to be confirmed, it      must provide that a creditor's lien will continue until the      earlier of payment of the underlying debt under nonbankruptcy      law or the grant of discharge under section 1328. Nothing in      this provision is intended to alter other requirements for      confirmation. Thus if a secured debt will not be fully paid      before the end of the plan, this provision does not authorize      a plan to provide that the lien terminate upon discharge.       Moreover, the plan must provide that if the case is      dismissed or converted without completion of the plan, the      creditor will retains the lien to the full extent permitted      by nonbankruptcy law. It is intended that any benefits      debtors obtain under a plan as against their secured      creditors will be lost unless the debtor fully completes the      plan. In the event a debtor's case is discharged under the      hardship discharge provisions without completion of the plan,      the creditor's lien nonetheless survives unaffected by the      bankruptcy to the extent permitted by nonbankruptcy law.       Second, the extent to which claims secured by purchase      money security interests in personal property are subject to      cramdown to fair market value is limited. It is intended that      cramdown not apply to any collateral described in this      provision during the periods of time specified, and that the      amount of the claim which must be paid under the plan be the      full amount of the claim allowed under section 502 without      application of section 506. Thus, if the debt was incurred      within 5 years prior to filing and the collateral consists of      a motor vehicle acquired for the personal use of the debtor,      the value of the collateral cannot be reduced to the current      fair market value and therefore the amount the plan must pay      under section 1325(5)(B)(ii) over the duration of the plan      must be the amount of the allowed claim under section 502      rather than the allowed secured claim under section 506. A      similar result applies for any other personal property if the      debt was incurred during the one year period preceding the      filing.       Third, terms used in section 1322(b)(2) which limits      cramdown of certain real estate mortgages are defined to make      clear that a debt secured by real estate which is the      debtor's principal residence includes any 1 to 4 family      structure, including incidental property, without regard to      whether the structure is attached to real estate, and      includes condominium or cooperative units and mobile or      manufactures homes or trailers. Incidental property includes      any property commonly conveyed with a principal residence in      the area where it is located.       This provision is intended to reject those cases which have      allowed cramdown of real estate mortgages on the grounds that      the security property is not a ``principal residence'' or      covers property which is not real estate, simply because the      property included multi-family housing, or the mortgage      encumbered incidental property, or covered less traditional      forms of housing such as condominiums, coops or mobile homes      or trailers.     Section 307. Domiciliary requirements for exemptions       This provision limits the state exemptions which debtors      can enjoy in bankruptcy when they have moved into a state      within two years of filing. If a debtor has lived for 2 or      more years in a State immediately prior to filing, the debtor      can use the exemptions allowed by the state where the debtor      resides under section 522 of the Code. If the debtor has      lived in a state for less than 2 years at the time of filing,      then the debtor must use the State exemptions of the State      where the debtor lived 2 years prior to filing if the debtor      lived there all of the 180 days which precede that 2 year      period. If the debtor lived in more than one State during      that 180 day period, the State exemptions of the State      where the debtor lived the longest during that period will      control.       If a debtor has to use a particular State's exemptions, the      law of that State also determines whether the debtor can      elect to use the federal exemptions available under section      522(d) of the Code.     Section 308. Residency requirement       Any home equity acquired within the 7 years prior to filing      is not exempt if: (1) such equity was attributable to      property that the debtor disposed of with the intent to      hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor; and (2) such property      was not an exempt asset. For example, if a debtor disposes of      cash, a non-exempt asset, by exchanging that cash for a      residence with the intention of delaying the payment of a      creditor, such residence would not be exempt from the      bankruptcy estate. It is the intent of Congress that it      should be easier to prove intent to hinder or delay than to      prove intent to defraud.     Section 309. Protecting secured creditors in chapter 13 cases       This provision adjusts the relationship of debtors to      lessors and secured creditors in bankruptcy proceedings.       First, it amends section 348(f) to assure that when a      debtor converts a case from chapter 13 to chapter 7, the      debtor does not retain any benefits of the chapter 13 case      with respect to any secured creditor, unless the full amount      of the secured creditor's claim determined under      nonbankruptcy law has been paid in full, and unless a      prebankruptcy default has been fully cured prior to      conversion. If a debtor converts from chapter 13 to another      chapter and then converts to chapter 7, the courts should      impose similar limitations.       Second, provision is made to allow a debtor and creditor to      arrange for the debtor to assume a personal property lease      rejected or not timely assumed by a trustee. On the other      hand, in a chapter 11 or 13 proceeding, if the plan does not      provide for assumption of the lease, the lease is deemed      rejected as of the conclusion of the hearing on confirmation      and the automatic stay automatically terminates.       Third, in a chapter 13 proceeding, a debtor's plan must      provide that the debtor will make monthly payments if there      are to be periodic payments to a personal property secured      creditor or personal property lessor receiving distributions      under the plan, and those payments must at least be in an      amount sufficient to provide adequate protection. This      provision, however, is not intended to lessen any of the      other protections of secured creditors or lessors provided in      the Bankruptcy Code.       In addition, debtors are required to continue to make      payments to creditors holding claims secured by personal      property and to personal property lessors from 30 days after      the order for relief. These payments are to be made directly      to the creditor or lessor, and the amount of plan payments      which the debtor must make can be reduced by the amount paid      to the creditors or lessors. The debtor must provide an      accounting of these payments to the chapter 13 trustee.     Section 310. Luxury goods       This section provides that certain debts are presumed to be      nondischargeable under section 523(a)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy      Code. Under section 523(a)(2)(A), a debt is nondischargeable      when it is incurred, among other things, by fraud. For      example, fraud can occur when a cardholder misrepresents his      or her intentions by using a credit card when the objective      facts show that the cardholder did not or could not intend to      repay. This bill provides that if a debtor incurs debts to a      single creditor aggregating for purchases on a credit card of      more than $250 for luxury goods or services within 90 days of      filing for bankruptcy, such debt is presumed to be      nondischargeable. This provision recognizes that debtors may      use open end credit to purchase goods and services necessary      for the support of the debtor shortly before bankruptcy,      while identifying presumptively abusive behavior which      warrants making the debt nondischargeable such as purchasing      a significant amounts of items or services not necessary for      the support of the debtor (i.e. luxury goods and services).       A related provision is included with regard to cash      advances. Cash advances under open-end credit plans      aggregating more than $750 within 70 days of filing for      bankruptcy are presumed to be nondischargeable. This language      is carefully drafted to require the aggregation of all cash      advances within 70 days of filing, even if they involve more      than one creditor. Furthermore, there is no requirement to      demonstrate that the cash advances were for ``luxury goods''      since such a requirement would be virtually impossible to      fulfill given the difficulty of accounting for cash. The      behavior itself is sufficient indicia of abuse.     Section 311. Automatic stay       This section provides that the automatic stay under section      362 will not apply in several situations in which residential      tenants     file for bankruptcy. First, the automatic stay will not bar      the continuation of an eviction action pending when the      debtor files for relief. Second, eviction proceedings      commenced after filing are not barred by the automatic stay      if the lease has terminated before or after filing of      bankruptcy. Third, the automatic stay also will not bar      eviction proceedings based on endangement to property or      person or the use of illegal drugs, or to any transfer that      is not avoidable under sections 544 or 549 of the Code.     Section 312. Extension of period between bankruptcy          discharges       The period of time which must elapse between bankruptcies      is increased by this provision. When a chapter 7 proceeding      is involved, the period is increased from six to eight      years. Furthermore, a chapter 13 discharge cannot be      granted if the debtor received a discharge under any      chapter of title 11 within 5 years of the order for relief      in the chapter 13 case.     Section 313. Definition of household goods       Section 522(f) of title 11 permits a debtor to void a non-     purchase money security interest in certain categories of      goods if the property subject to the security interest is      otherwise exempt in the debtor's case. One of the categories      is ``household goods''. This section is intended to clarify      what this term means so that there can be a nationwide,      uniform standard for what can be included in this category,      and so that debtors and creditors alike can know whether a      loan is truly secured or unsecured. It is expected that the      additional clarity will assist debtors in obtaining the      lowest price available for this type of secured credit.     Section 314. Debt incurred to pay nondischargeable debts       If a claim arises from payment of a tax to a governmental      unit other than the United States and the tax that was paid      would be nondischargeable under section 524(a)(1), then the      debt incurred to pay the tax is also nondischargeable.     Section 315. Notice to creditors       This section changes the requirements for providing notice      to creditors and also changes what information they must      provide in the schedules or otherwise as part of a bankruptcy      filing.       Notice.--This section is intended to ensure that creditors      receive actual, meaningful, and timely notice of bankruptcy      filings.       In order to ensure proper processing by a creditor, debtors      will need to include the account number in any required      notice to a creditor with respect to any debt owed to such      creditor. Furthermore, any notice required to be given by the      debtor to the creditor must be done so at an address      specified by the creditor. Creditors will be required to      include the account number and appropriate address in the      last two communications supplied to the debtor within the 90-     day period prior to filing for bankruptcy. However, if any      legal requirement impedes the creditor's ability to      communicate with the debtor at any point during the 90-day      period prior to filing, the creditor's burden will be      satisfied if the appropriate information was included on its      last two communications with the debtor. For purposes of this      section, the creditor's communications with the debtor are      those which deal specifically with an individual debt.      ``Communications'' do not include promotional material or      other communications that do not pertain specifically to a      debtor's debt to the creditor.       Language in the Bankruptcy Code which states that failure      to include the specified information in a notice does not      invalidate the legal effect of such notice is deleted.       Furthermore, if a creditor in an individual chapter 7 or 13      case has specified an address for notice by filing a      statement to that effect with the court, the court and the      debtor are required to use such an address starting five days      after receiving the address. A creditor may file a notice      address with the court to be used generally by the court,      parties in interest and the debtor to provide notice to the      creditor in all cases under chapters 7 and 13. In the event a      creditor has provided different notice addresses by more than      one of the permitted methods, a debtor may use any one of      them, except that a notice address filed in a particular case      shall control.       Notices which are not sent to the appropriate address as      specified by the creditor are not effective until the notice      is brought to the creditor's attention. If the creditor has      designated an entity to be responsible for receiving notices      concerning bankruptcy cases and has established reasonable      procedures so that these notices will be delivered to such      entity, a notice will not be deemed to have been received by      the creditor until it has been received by the designated      entity. Sanctions for violation of the automatic stay under      section 362 of the Code or for the failure to comply with the      turnover provisions in sections 542 and 543 of the Code may      not be imposed if a creditor has not received proper notice.       Tax Return Information.--The section also requires debtors      to provide certain tax return information. By no later than 7      days before the date first set for the first meeting of      creditors, a debtor must provide the trustee, without any      prior request, the debtor's tax return or transcript, or the      case will be dismissed unless the debtor can show that the      failure to file a return is due to circumstances beyond the      control of the debtor. Such circumstances would include that      the debtor did not file a return for the period required, but      not that the debtor could not find the return unless the      debtor in addition showed that a significant, diligent and      timely effort had been made to obtain at least the transcript      of the return from the Internal Revenue Service and it was      not forthcoming. A transcript is a computer generated line by      line statement of debtor supplied information with respect to      a tax return which the Internal Revenue Service will provide      any tax return filer on request.       Once such information is provided the trustee, creditors in      chapter 7 and 13 cases can obtain it by request to the      trustee or through the procedure set forth for creditors to      obtain copies of the petition and schedules from the court.      It is intended that the trustee and the court will make      arrangements for the tax return information the debtor      provides to be made available to the court to satisfy      creditor requests. Creditors can also request the tax return      directly, in which case the debtor must provide it directly      to the creditor or the case will be dismissed, subject to      limitations already discussed.       Debtors are also required to provide tax returns with      respect to the period after filing, or with respect to pre-     filing periods if they are filed with the taxing authorities      after bankruptcy filing. The Director of the Administrative      Office of United States Courts is to develop procedures for      safeguarding privacy of these returns, and to make a report      to Congress no later and one and one half years after      enactment on the effectiveness of these procedures.       Other information. Debtors are required to provide certain      other information, including ongoing income and expense      information, in certain circumstances.     Section 316. Dismissal for failure to timely file schedules          or provide required information       The Fed. R. Bankr. Pro. already provide that schedules must      be filed within 10 days of filing unless an extension is      granted, and many bankruptcy courts have already established      a general practice of dismissing cases when debtors fail to      provide all required information within 15 days of filing,      unless good cause for additional time is shown. Nothing in      this provision is intended to interfere with such      requirements. However, if an individual debtor after such      extensions as the court may grant, has not filed all of the      information required by section 521(a)(1) within 45 days of      filing a petition, the case is automatically dismissed. On      request of the debtor made before 45 days after filing, the      court may grant up to 45 days additional time for the debtor      to file schedules. Once the time period provided under this      section elapses, the court must enter an order of dismissal      within 5 days of request.     Section 317. Adequate time to prepare for hearing on          confirmation of the plan       A hearing on confirmation of a chapter 13 plan must be held      between 20 and 45 days after the first meeting of creditors.      If a plan cannot be confirmed within that period, the court      should take appropriate action to dismiss or convert the      case.     Section 318. Chapter 13 plans to have a 5-year duration in          certain cases       If a debtor's current monthly income is more than the      monthly median income, the debtor's plan must be no shorter      than 5 years, unless the debtor proposes and confirms a plan      which provides for payment in full of all creditors within a      shorter period. The same rules apply to modifications.     Section 319. Sense of Congress regarding expansion of rule          9011 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure       It is the sense of Congress that Rule 9011 should be      applied to the schedules and other documents filed with the      court.     Section 320. Prompt relief from stay in individual cases       Relief from stay proceedings must be finally decided within      60 days after relief is requested, unless the parties agree      to the contrary, or the court for good cause finds it is      necessary to do so, but then only for a specified period of      time. Otherwise, the stay automatically expires as to the      requesting creditor.     Section 321. Chapter 11 cases filed by individuals       This section changes some chapter 11 provisions to bring      the chapter more closely into conformance with chapter 13      when the debtor is an individual.       First, the property of the estate is expanded from present      law to include all property and earnings acquired between the      time of filing and the closing, dismissal or conversion of      the case. Such property is placed under the supervision of      the court and is protected by the automatic stay. Second,      what may be included in a plan is expanded to permit the      debtor to subject future earnings and income to the plan.      Third, the individual debtor's plan must provide either that      it will pay each claim in full or that at least the debtor's      disposable income over the first 5 years of the plan is paid      to unsecured creditors. Fourth, in an individual case, the      discharge is not granted until completion of payments under      the plan. Provision is made for a hardship discharge. Fifth,      modifications of a plan are subject to the same requirements      as an original plan.     Section 322. Limitation       The state law homestead exemption is limited to a maximum      of $100,000 for the home equity acquired within the 2 years      prior to filing. Amounts acquired within the 2-year period      that exceed $100,000, are not exempt from the bankruptcy      estate. Amounts of home equity acquired prior to the 2-year      period are not subject to the $100,000 cap, but     are subject to the relevant state law homestead exemption.      For this purpose, equity acquired in a principal residence      prior to the 2-year period and rolled over into another      principal residence after the 2-year period is not subject to      the $100,000 cap, but is subject to the relevant state law      homestead exemption. This rollover provision does not apply      to the sale of a principal residence in one state and the      purchase of another principal residence in another state.     Section 323. Excluding employee benefit plan participant          contributions and other property from the estate       Amounts which have been withheld from wages of employees      for payment as contributions to retirement plans or health      insurance plans, or received from employees for payment over      to such plans are not property of the estate. It is not      intended that this provision will affect money which has been      paid over and received by the respective plans for the      purposes the withholding or contributions have been made.     Section 324. Exclusive jurisdiction in matters involving          bankruptcy professionals       This section gives the district court exclusive      jurisdiction of any property of the debtor as of the      commencement of the case, of property of the estate, and of      all claims that involve construction of section 327 (on      employment of professional persons) or disclosure rules under      that section.     Section 325. United States Trustee Program filing fee          increase       This section changes the filing fees for chapter 7 and 13      cases, and changes the sharing percentages with respect to      such fees.     Section 326. Sharing of compensation       Section 504 of the Bankruptcy Code restricts the extent to      which those being paid compensation or reimbusement in a      bankruptcy case may share such compensation or reimbursement.      This section creates an exception from those rules to permit      bona fide public service attorney referral programs operating      in accordance with non-Federal law regulating attorney      referral services to share such compensation or      reimbursement.     Section 327. Fair valuation of collateral       This section is intended to make clear that when value is      determined under title 11, it shall be determined based      solely upon what it would cost the debtor to purchase a      replacement considering the age and condition of the      property, without deductions for other costs or expenses of      any kind. In personal, family or household transactions,      replacement value is based upon what a retail merchant would      charge for the property, considering age and condition at the      time value is determined.     Section 328. Defaults based on nonmonetary obligations       The requirements of section 365 are altered so that certain      defaults relating to nonmonetary obligations of the debtor      under an unexpired lease of real property need not be cured.      Furthermore, such defaults are excepted from the ordinary      rules applying to impaired classes. Technical changes are      also made to remove certain provisions relating to       Title IV--General and Small Business Bankruptcy Provisions     Subtitle A--General Business Bankruptcy Provisions     Section 401. Adequate protection for investors       This section creates a definition for a ``securities self-     regulatory organization'' and then provides an exception to      the automatic stay for investigations, orders, or delisting      activities by such an organization involving the debtor.     Section 402. Meetings of creditors and equity security          holders       This section gives the court the authority, for cause, not      to convene a meeting of creditors if there is a prepackaged      plan of reorganization. This would save time and expenses in      those instances where the court determines there would be      little or no meaningful benefit to be derived from a      creditors meeting.     Section 403. Protection of refinance of security interest       This provision alters the preference provisions of section      547 of the Bankruptcy Code with respect to when a transfer is      made for the purposes of that section. A transfer is deemed      made at the time it takes effect if it is perfected within 30      days after it takes effect between the parties. Present law      provides only a 10 day period.     Section 404. Executory contracts and unexpired leases       HR 2415 cures some abuses in the Bankruptcy Code regarding      executory contracts and unexpired leases. HR 2415 amends      Section 365(d)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code. It imposes a firm,      bright line deadline on a retail debtor's decision to assume      or reject a lease, absent the lessor's consent. It permits a      bankruptcy trustee to assume or reject a lease on a date      which is the earlier of the date of confirmation of a plan or      the date which is 120 days after the date of the order for      relief. A further extension of time may be granted, within      the 120 day period, for an additional 90 days, for cause,      upon motion of the trustee or lessor. Any subsequent      extension can only be granted by the judge upon the prior      written consent of the lessor: either by the lessor's motion      for an extension, or by a motion of the trustee, provided      that the trustee has the prior written approval of the      lessor. This provision is designed to remove the bankruptcy      judges' discretion to grant extensions of the time for the      retail debtor to decide whether to assume or reject a lease      after a maximum possible period of 210 days from the time of      entry of the order of relief. Beyond that maximum period,      there is no authority in the judge to grant further time      unless the lessor has agreed in writing to the extension.       HR 2415 also amends Section 365(f)(1) of the Bankruptcy      Code to make sure that all of the provisions of Section      365(b) are adhered to and that Section 365(f) does not      override Section 365(b). Congress made clear, in Section      365(b)(1), that the trustee may not assume an executory      contract or unexpired lease of the debtor, unless the trustee      makes adequate assurance of future performance under the      contract or lease. In Section 365(b)(3), Congress provided      that for purposes of the Bankruptcy Code, ``adequate      assurance of future performance of a lease of real property      in a shopping center includes adequate assurance . . . that      assumption or assignment of such lease is subject to all the      provisions thereof, including (but not limited to) provisions      such as a radius, location, use, or exclusivity provision. .      . .''       Regrettably, some bankruptcy judges have not followed this      Congressional mandate. Under another provision of the Code,      Section 365(f), a number of bankruptcy judges have allowed      the assignment of a lease even though terms of the lease are      not being followed.       For example, if a shopping center's lease with an      educational retailer requires that the premises shall be used      solely for the purpose of conducting the retail sale of      educational items, as the lease provided in the Simon      Property Group v. Learningsmith case, then the lessor has a      right to maintain this mix of retail uses in his shopping      centers, even if the retailer files for bankruptcy.       Instead, in the Learningsmith case, the judge allowed the      assignment of the lease to a candle retailer because it      offered more money than an educational store to buy the      lease, in contravention of Section 365(b)(3) of the Code. As      a result, the lessor lost control over the nature of its very      business, operating a particular mix of retail stores. If      other retailers file for bankruptcy in that shopping center,      the same result can occur. The bill remedies this problem by      amending Section 365(f)(1) to make clear it operates subject      to all provisions of Section 365(b). The legal holding in the      Learningsmith case, and other cases like it which do not      enforce Section 365(b), particularly 365(b)(3), are      overturned.       Thus, this section adds language to Section 365(f)(1) for      the purpose of assuring that Section 365(f) does not override      any part of Section 365(b). The section provides that in      addition to being subject to Section 365(c), Section 365(f)      is also subject to section 365(b) which is to be given its      full effect.     Section 405. Creditors and equity security holders committees       This section is intended to permit small business interests      to obtain representation on creditors' committees even though      no small business would otherwise be selected under the      standards for selecting members of creditors' committees in      the present Bankruptcy Code. Bankruptcy judges are given      discretion to increase the size of a creditor's committee to      place a small business concern on the committee as a fully      voting member if the court determines that the small business      creditor holds claims the aggregate amount of which is      disproportionately large in comparison to the annual gross      revenue of that creditor. Congress intends that this standard      be liberally applied in favor of a small business concern.      For example, a claim that was more than 5% of the net profit      after taxes and debt service of the small business concern      would be disproportionately large, since if the claim is not      paid, it would cause a 5% reduction in profitability, often      the difference between success and failure for a small      business.     Section 406. Amendment to section 546 of title 11, United          States Code     Section 407. Amendment to section 330(a) of title 11, United          States Code     Section 408. Postpetition disclosure and solicitation       This provision permits post-petition solicitation of a      prepackaged plan of reorganization if both the pre-petition      solicitation and the post-petition solicitation comply with      applicable nonbankruptcy law. However, the provision only      applies when the holder of a claim or interest solicited      post-petition has been solicited pre-petition, thus avoiding      different standards being applicable to pre- and post-     petition solicitations. Time is crucial in a prepackaged plan      of reorganization in order to minimize the adverse effects of      bankruptcy on the debtor's business and financial affairs.      When it applies, this section permits avoidance of the time      and expense of going through the disclosure statement process      normally applicable to post-petition solicitations.     Section 409. Preferences       The ordinary course of business defense to preference      recovery is liberalized. As under current law, the debt must      be incurred in the ordinary course. The payment, however,      under the new provision must only be in the ordinary course      or according to ordinary business terms.       A new preference exception is also added in business cases.      Aggregate transfers of less than $5,000 are exempted from      preference recovery.     Section 410. Venue of certain proceedings     Section 411. Period for filing plan under chapter 11       This new provision is designed to deal with the time and      expense of reorganization cases by providing the debtor's      exclusive period to file a plan of reorganization may not be      extended beyond 18 months after the order for relief in the      case. No change is made to current law that permits, for      cause, either the reduction or the extension of the debtor's      initial 120-day exclusivity period, except that the period      may not be extended beyond the new 18 month maximum.       The new provision also provides that, if the debtor files a      plan of reorganization within its applicable exclusivity      period, parties in interest may file a reorganization plan if      the debtor's plan is not accepted by each impaired class      before 180 days after the order for relief, as such date may      be extended for cause up to a maximum of 20 months from the      order for relief in the case.       The new time periods are maximum periods that may not be      extended by the court. They are not, however, minimums.      Debtors will still have to show ``cause'' to extend the      initial 120-day and 180-day periods in section 1121 and any      extensions granted by the court. The establishment of the new      so-called ``exclusivity wall'' is not intended to change the      standards under section 1104 for conversion or dismissal.     Section 412. Fees arising from certain ownership interests     Section 413. Creditor representation at first meeting of          creditors       This section permits either a creditor owed a consumer debt      or any representative of that creditor to appear at and      participate in the meeting of creditors in a case under      chapter 7 or 13 even if the creditor or representative is not      admitted to practice before the court or before the local      federal or state court, notwithstanding any federal or state      rule of practice or statutory provision barring unauthorized      practice of law. It is intended that this provision will      permit non-attorneys to appear at and participate in the      meeting of creditors and any related negotiations entered      into before or after the meeting to facilitate more efficient      and economical participation by creditors in chapter 7 and 13      bankruptcy proceedings.     Section 414. Definition of disinterested person       This provision deletes the per se exclusion of investment      bankers and attorneys for investment bankers from being a      disinterested person. Whether an investment banking firm or      an attorney for an investment banker is disinterested will      depend on an ad hoc application of the definition.     Section 415. Factors for compensation of professional persons       This section permits consideration in setting compensation      of whether the professional is board certified or otherwise      has demonstrated skill.     Section 416. Appointment of elected trustee       This section provides for procedures when a trustee is      elected, and for handling disputes over election of trustees.     Section 417. Utility service       Section 366 of the Code is amended to permit a utility to      refuse to provide service to a debtor under certain      circumstances unless adequate assurance payments are      received.     Section 418. Bankruptcy fees       This provision permits a court to waive filing fees if it      finds that a debtor is unable to pay the fees in installments      and that the debtor's income is under 150 percent of the      official poverty line. The court is expected to examine      carefully the debtor's projected future income over the      period during which installment payments must be made before      concluding that the debtor is truly unable to pay in      installments. The mere fact that the debtor is experiencing      debt difficulty is not, in and of itself, determinative of      whether a debtor can pay in installments. ``Filing fees''      cover any fee which must be paid in order to file a petition      and commence a bankruptcy case under title 11, but not fees      for motions or adversary complaints.     Section 419. More complete information regarding assets of          the estate       This section directs the Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy      Rules of the Judicial Conference to propose for adoption      amended rules and forms directing chapter 11 debtors to      provide information on the value, operations and      profitability of any closely held corporation in which the      debtor has a substantial or controlling interest. This      direction is intended to result in changes to the Bankruptcy      Rules and Forms so that parties in interest will be able to      obtain, on the schedules or otherwise on other disclosures      provided by the debtor full and complete information about      the value of such an interest in a closely held corporation.     Subtitle B--Small Business Bankruptcy Provisions       These provisions effect reforms in chapter 11 cases. They      further two primary goals. First, they are designed to reduce      cost and delay in chapter 11 cases. Second, they are designed      to ensure that the extraordinary protections provided chapter      11 debtors are used to further the public interest, by      limiting those protections to cases in which there is both a      likelihood of successful reorganization and in which the      debtor fully complies with the applicable statutes and rules.       These sections achieve these goals through the following      means:       First, the fast-track plan confirmation rules for small      business cases that were adopted by Congress in 1994 have      been strengthened. Second, the bill simplifies the process of      drafting a plan and disclosure statement to make it easier      for the small business debtor to comply with the fast-track      requirements. Third, the debtor is required to provide      additional information about post-filing operations, and the      Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy Rules is directed to      promulgate forms that will simplify such reporting. Fourth,      the United States trustee is directed to oversee the debtor      in small business cases. Fifth, the bankruptcy courts are      directed to use case-management conferences and scheduling      orders to reduce cost and delay. Sixth, it is made easier to      appoint an independent trustee or examiner and to convert or      dismiss a chapter 11 case in which the debtor is not playing      by the rules or there is little likelihood of a successful      reorganization. Seventh, the bill protects creditors against      repeat filings after a prior chapter 11 case has failed.     Section 431. Flexible rules for disclosure statement and plan       Under current law, the debtor generally files a drafted-     from-scratch plan and disclosure statement, even if the debts      and assets involved are small. This practice is expensive,      and imposes an undue burden on the debtor. Section 1125 of      the Bankruptcy Code is amended to streamline the plan      confirmation process in several ways for small business      debtors. First, it encourages the use of standard-form plans      and disclosure statements. Second, it directs the court to      weigh the cost of providing additional information against      the benefit of such information in determining whether a      disclosure statement provides adequate information. Third, it      provides that a separate disclosure statement is not      necessary if the court determines that the plan provides      adequate information. Fourth, it permits the court to      consider at a single hearing both the adequacy of the      disclosure statement and confirmation of the plan.     Section 432. Definition of small business debtor       Sections 101(51C) and (51D) of the Bankruptcy Code are      amended in two significant respects. First, the debt limit      used to define a small business debtor is increased from $2.0      million to $3.0 million. Second, a debtor with debts within      the limit is treated as a small business debtor whether or      not it elects to be treated as a small business debtor. All      of the provisions applicable to small business debtors are      now mandatory. There are two exclusions from the definition:      (1) cases in which the debtor is primarily engaged in      passive real estate investments; and (2) cases in which      the court has certified that there is an active and      representative committee of unsecured creditors.     Section 433. Standard form disclosure statement and plan       Section 433 directs the Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy      Rules of the Judicial Conference of the United States to      propose standard forms for plans and disclosure statements in      small business cases. Under section 1125 as amended, the      debtor may use either a form approved by the court in which      the case is pending or a form approved by the Rules      Committee. The intent of these provisions is to encourage      experimentation in the use of standard forms. Use of an      approved form does not by itself satisfy the disclosure      requirements. The court must determine that the form provides      information that is adequate in light of the facts of the      case.     Sections 434 and 435. Reporting requirements       New section 308 of the Bankruptcy Code imposes new      reporting requirements on small business debtors, and section      435 of the bill calls for the Advisory Committee on      Bankruptcy Rules to promulgate uniform national reporting      forms. These provisions have three chief aims: (1) to assist      small business debtors in understanding and improving their      businesses through the process of preparing the reports; (2)      to provide the persons interested in a case with information      about that case; and (3) to provide a data base for further      evaluation of the efficacy of chapter 11 for small      businesses. The standard imposed on the Rules Committee in      promulgating uniform national forms is to effect a practical      balance between: (a) the needs of interested parties for      information; (b) ease and lack of expense in preparation; and      (c) ``the interest of all parties that the required reports      help the small business debtor to understand its financial      condition and plan its future.''     Section 436. Duties of trustee or debtor in possession in          small business cases       New section 1116 of the Bankruptcy Code imposes six types      of clear, new duties on small business debtors. The debtor      must: (1) promptly file with the court the best available      financial information about the debtor's business through its      most recent financial statements or federal income tax      return; (2) attend through its responsible individual and      counsel meetings scheduled by the court or the United States      trustee; (3) timely file the schedules and statements of      affairs (with a strict limit on extensions) and financial and      other reports required by law; (4) maintain insurance      necessary to protect the public and the estate; (5) timely      pay all administrative expense tax claims; and (6) allow the      United States trustee at reasonable times after reasonable      notice to inspect the debtor's business premises and books      and     records. These provisions are designed to assist the debtor,      the courts, and the United States trustee in effectuating      expeditious administration of small business cases. They are      based on recommendations of the National Bankruptcy Review      Commission's small business proposal.     Section 437. Plan filing deadline       Section 1121 of the Bankruptcy Code is amended to require a      small business debtor to file a plan within 300 days after      the petition date. This deadline is based on the assumption      that the typical small business debtor can reasonably file a      plan and disclosure statement within 300 days. Any request      for extension of this deadline is an appropriate occasion to      require the debtor to justify the continuation of the broad      injunctive relief the debtor received automatically upon the      filing of the petition. The amendment does this by requiring      the debtor to show that it is more likely than not that the      debtor will confirm a plan within a reasonable time if the      extension is granted.     Section 438. Plan confirmation deadline       This section provides that a plan shall be confirmed by 175      days after the order for relief, unless such time is extended      under section 1121(e)(3) of the Code. If a plan is not      confirmed within the period and the period is not extended,      it is expected that the case will be dismissed or converted,      as appropriate.     Section 439. Duties of the United States trustee       In small business cases, there is rarely an active,      functioning creditor's committee. As a result, the debtor in      possession is generally not subject to the creditor      supervision contemplated when chapter 11 was first enacted.      To fill this void and to provide adequate supervision of the      debtor, section 586 of the Judicial Code is amended to      enlarge the duties of the United States Trustee in small      business cases. One of these duties is to conduct an initial      debtor interview promptly after the order for relief and      before the official creditors' meeting under section 341 of      the Bankruptcy Code. At this meeting, the United States      Trustee should investigate the debtor's viability, ascertain      what the debtor's business plan is, and explain the debtor's      reporting and other compliance obligations. In addition, new      section 1116 of the Bankruptcy Code authorizes the United      States Trustee to visit the business premises of the debtor      and ascertain the status of the books and records and      timeliness of filing of tax returns.       The amendments to section 586 of the Judicial Code also      require the United States Trustee in cases where there are      grounds for conversion or dismissal under section 1112 of the      Bankruptcy Code to ``apply promptly to the court for      relief.'' This duty applies in all chapter 11 cases, not only      small business cases.     Section 440. Scheduling conferences       Section 105(d) of the Bankruptcy Code is amended to provide      that bankruptcy judges are now required to hold status      conferences and enter scheduling orders in chapter 11 cases      whenever that would ``further the expeditious and economical      resolution of the case.'' The change reflects a determination      that bankruptcy judges should assume responsibility for      reducing cost and delay in the chapter 11 cases before them,      and that active case management by the trial judge is a      proven means of cost and delay reduction.     Section 441. Serial filers       This section creates a new section 362(k) of the Bankruptcy      Code that provides that the filing of a chapter 11 petition      does not create an automatic stay if the debtor: (1) is a      debtor in another pending chapter 11 case; (2) was a debtor      in a chapter 11 case dismissed within the previous two years;      (3) confirmed a plan in a chapter 11 case within the previous      two years; or (4) succeeded to the assets of an entity that      was a chapter 11 debtor within the previous two years. A      debtor affected by this provision is not precluded from      filing a chapter 11 petition, and is not precluded from      seeking protection from creditor action. The protections of      section 362(a) do not go into effect, however, unless and      until the debtor makes the required showing regarding the      likelihood of confirming a plan and the reasons a second      chapter 11 case is necessary. The logic of this provision is      that in each of the four identified circumstances there is      sufficient likelihood of abuse to require the debtor to make      some showing before receiving injunctive relief. The      exception to the automatic stay does not apply to an      involuntary petition that is not filed in collusion with the      debtor or its insiders.     Section 442. Expanded grounds for dismissal, conversion, or          appointment of a trustee or examiner       Section 1112 of the Bankruptcy Code is amended to expand      the circumstances in which the bankruptcy court may dismiss a      chapter 11 case, convert the case to another chapter, or      appoint a chapter 11 trustee or examiner. The most salient      characteristic of chapter 11 is its most problematic--the      debtor is protected against all creditor action automatically      upon filing, while remaining in control of all its assets.      Any non-debtor seeking comparable injunctive relief must show      a likelihood of prevailing on the merits of the dispute and      that the equities weigh in favor of equitable relief. Under      current law, a chapter 11 debtor gets what is perhaps the      broadest injunction available under American law, without      making any showing whatsoever. Some courts impose a heavy      burden on any party who, by moving for dismissal of the      chapter 11 case or appointment of a trustee, seeks to deprive      the debtor of that relief.       The amendment to section 1112 is intended to effect a      significant change in the burden of proof governing motions      to dismiss, convert, or appoint a chapter 11 trustee or      examiner. First, the amendment creates an expanded definition      of ``cause'' for such relief. Each type of cause listed      represents a warning sign that the chapter 11 case is not      proceeding properly (e.g., that assets of the estate are      being diminished, that the debtor is not complying with      applicable statutes or rules, or that the debtor is not      moving promptly toward confirmation of a plan of      reorganization). Second, the amendment creates a new shifting      burden of proof. If a creditor establishes one or more of the      specified warning signs, the burden shifts to the debtor to      show: (1) that the debtor is likely to confirm a plan      promptly; and (2) if the basis for relief is the debtor's      failure to comply with an applicable statute or rule, that      there is a reasonable justification for the lack of      compliance, and that the lack of compliance will be cured      within a reasonable time fixed by the court. If the debtor      fails to meet its burden of proof, the court must convert,      dismiss, or appoint a chapter 11 trustee or examiner,      whichever is in the best interest of creditors and the      estate. In substance, the amended section 1112 adopts a      position midway between current chapter 11 law and      traditional injunction practice. The debtor still receives      the protection of the automatic stay upon filing, but the      debtor will now be required to prove up its entitlement to      that injunction in a wide variety of circumstances.       The bankruptcy court should determine whether there is a      reasonable possibility that the debtor will confirm a plan      within a reasonable time in much the same manner the court      would determine whether a party seeking a preliminary      injunction is likely to prevail upon the merits. The      determination is a preliminary one regarding the likelihood      of prevailing in the future, not a final determination on the      merits. The hearing may often be a summary one. The court      need not conduct a miniature confirmation hearing. The debtor      should be required to prove a likelihood that its business is      financially viable enough to pass the feasibility      requirements of section 1129(a)(11), and that it will be able      to pay in full those claims (i.e., secured and priority      claims) that must be paid in full in order to confirm a plan.       If the debtor shows that it is likely to make a      distribution to general unsecured creditors and that those      creditors have no realistic alternative to debtor's plan, the      debtor need not submit additional evidence that general      unsecured creditors will vote to accept the plan in order to      establish a prima facie case. The moving party or any other      creditor may rebut debtor's evidence. The debtor does not      satisfy its burden of proof when unsecured creditors holding      claims sufficient to block acceptance by that class state      their intent to vote against the plan and the debtor cannot      show a likelihood that it will be able to confirm a plan      notwithstanding such rejection.       Attention from the debtor and the court to the economic      viability of the debtor's business is appropriate in all      cases except liquidating chapter 11 cases. A debtor with a      business that is not viable should not be allowed to remain a      debtor in possession under chapter 11, unless it is avowedly      using chapter 11 to confirm a liquidating plan promptly.      Because the likely-to-confirm-a-plan standard turns on issues      of business feasibility as much as on issues of law, the      parties should be permitted to introduce evidence from      accounting and other professionals concerning the viability      of the debtor's business. The likely-to-confirm-a-plan      standard should be applied in the same manner when it arises      in a motion to extend the deadlines provided for in the      amendments to section 1121.       All of the provisions of the amended section 1112 apply to      all chapter 11 cases. This is so even though some of the      listed examples of ``cause'' for dismissal, conversion, or      appointment of a trustee or examiner resemble duties that      under new sections 308 and 1116 apply only to small business      debtors.     Section 443. Study of operation of title 11, United States          Code, with respect to small businesses       Requires the Adminstrator of the Small Business      Administration, in conjunction with the Attorney General and      the Director of the Executive Office of United States      Trustees and Director of the Administrative Office of United      States Courts to conduct a study of small business      bankruptcies and report to Congress how Federal bankruptcy      laws may be made more effective with regard to such      businesses.     Section 444. Payment of interest       This provision continues present law under section      362(d)(3) which provides that the court shall grant relief      from stay to a real estate secured creditor holding security      in a single asset real estate debtor unless not later than 90      days after the order for relief the debtor has either filed a      plan of reorganization that has a reasonable possibility of      being confirmed or commences making interest payments. This      provision permits the debtor to make those interest payments      from rents or other income the debtor holds, and requires      that the interest be at the nondefault interest rate under      the contract with the creditor.     Section 445. Priority for administrative expenses       This section amends section 503 of the Bankruptcy Code to      provide that certain     amounts owed with respect to nonresidential real property      leases become administrative expenses.                Title V--Municipal Bankruptcy Provisions     Section 501. Petition and proceedings related to petition       This section amends section 921(d) of the Code to clarify      that the special rules with respect to commencement of a case      of an unincorporated tax or special assessment district in      that section control over the general rules on commencement      of voluntary cases under section 301 of the Code. As a      conforming change, section 301 is amended to divide it into      two subsections, subsection (a), which provides that a      voluntary case is commenced by the filing of a petition, and      subsection (b), which provides that the commencement of a      case is also the order for relief. Section 301 as amended      will continue to govern the voluntary cases which it now      covers, except those covered by section 921(d).     Section 502. Applicability of other sections to chapter 9       Section 901(a) of the Code, which lists the sections of      title 11 which apply to chapter 9 cases, is amended to      include sections 555, 556, 559, 560, 561, and 562. These      sections provide an exception to the stay of proceedings to      allow the liquidation of various types of securities      contracts. The amendment is necessary to avoid a stay      violation or other complications when certain executory      contracts, municipal bonds, for instance, come due and must      be redeemed.                       Title VI--Bankruptcy Data     Section 601. Improved bankruptcy statistics       It has been obvious for some time that despite the scope      and frequency of bankruptcy relief, organized statistics with      respect to what occurs during and as a result of the      bankruptcy case are not available. It is strongly felt that      there should be a concerted effort by the federal government      to collect, maintain and disseminate broad information about      the bankruptcy system and how it operates. Such information      should include how much debt is discharged in different types      of bankruptcy cases, as well as other information relative to      assessing how well the bankruptcy system is serving both      debtors in need and the wider group of citizens who pay in      higher credit prices for the discharged debt.       This section creates a standardized and centralized method      for collecting relevant bankruptcy statistics for cases      involving primarily consumer debts filed under chapters 7,      11, and 13. The statistics will be collected by the clerk in      each district. The Director of the Administrative Office of      the United States Courts will compile the statistics,      producing a centralized data source. The Director will make      the statistics available to the public. Furthermore, by      October 31, 2002, the Director will make annual reports to      Congress which include the statistics as well as an analysis      of the information.       The Director's compilation of statistics will be      comprehensive. The requirements of the compilation, as      outlined in the new section 159(c), are self-explanatory. It      is intended that the information required under Section      159(c)(3)(H) should also include the cases involving      sanctions imposed on debtor's counsel under Section 707(b) of      the Bankruptcy Code.     Section 602. Uniform rules for the collection of bankruptcy          data       This provision complements Section 601 by requiring the      Attorney General to issue rules requiring the establishment      of uniform forms for final reports filed by bankruptcy      trustees and monthly operating reports filed by chapter 11      debtors in possession. The information that should be      contained in these reports is self-explanatory. The reports      must also be made publicly available for physical inspection      (at one or more central filing locations) and by electronic      access through the Internet or other appropriate media.     Section 603. Audit procedures       This section requires the Attorney General to establish      procedures for auditing the accuracy and completeness of      information supplied by individual debtors in connection with      their bankruptcy cases under chapter 7 and chapter 13 of the      Bankruptcy Code. The audit must be in accordance with      generally accepted auditing standards and performed by      independent certified public accountants or independent      licensed public accountants. However, the Attorney General is      given discretion to develop alternative auditing standards      not later than two years after the date of enactment of H.R.      2415. Should the Attorney General develop alternative      auditing standards, such standards are expected to have      integrity and reliability comparable to generally accepted      auditing standards. It is intended that the Attorney General      in developing auditing standards, and any others who set      procedures or practices to be used in the audits or supervise      them, will in doing so consult with those units in the      Department of Justice which enforce against bankruptcy fraud      and bankruptcy crimes, including the bankruptcy fraud task      force in the Attorney General's office and bankruptcy fraud      and crime units in the United States Attorneys' offices.       The audits are to be performed on randomly selected cases      and should include at least 1 out of every 250 cases in each      Federal judicial district. Audits are required for schedules      of income and expenses which reflect greater than average      variances from the statistical norm of the district in which      the schedules were filed. The aggregate results of the audits      is to be made public and is required to include the      percentage of cases, by district, in which a material      misstatement of income, expenditures or assets is reported.       A report of each audit must be filed with the court and      transmitted to the United States trustee. Each report must      clearly and conspicuously specify any material misstatement      of income, expenditures or assets. In any case where a      material misstatement of income, expenditures or assets has      been reported, the clerk of the bankruptcy court must give      all creditors in the case notice of the misstatement(s).      Where appropriate, the matter could be referred to the U.S.      Attorney for possible criminal prosecution.       Furthermore, the Bankruptcy Code is amended to make it a      duty of the debtor to supply certain information to an      auditor. This section also adds, as grounds for revocation of      a chapter 7 debtor's discharge, a chapter 7 debtor's failure      to satisfactorily explain a material misstatement discovered      as the result of an audit and the failure to make available      all necessary documents or property belonging to the debtor      that are requested in connection with such audit.     Section 604. Sense of Congress regarding availability of          bankruptcy data       This section expresses the sense of the Congress that it is      a national policy of the United States that all data      collected by the bankruptcy clerks in electronic form (to the      extent such data related to public records as defined in      Section 107 of the Bankruptcy Code) should be made available      to the public in a usable electronic form in bulk, subject to      appropriate privacy concerns and safeguards as determined by      the Judicial Conference of the United States. Those privacy      concerns and safeguards should be developed keeping in mind      that the data covered is already of public record.       It is also the sense of Congress that a single bankruptcy      data system should be established that uses a single set of      data definitions and forms to collect such data and that data      for any particular bankruptcy case be aggregated in such      electronic record.                  Title VII--Bankruptcy Tax Provisions     Section 701. Treatment of certain tax liens       The conference agreement follows the House bill. Section      701 makes several amendments to section 724 of the Bankruptcy      Code to provide greater protection for holders of ad valorem      tax liens on real or personal property of the estate. Many      school boards obtain liens on real property to ensure      collection of unpaid ad valorem taxes. Often, governments are      unable to collect despite the presence of a lien because,      under current law, these liens may be subordinated to certain      claims against and expenses of the bankruptcy estate. The      conference agreement would seek to protect the holders of      these tax liens from, among other things, erosions of their      claims' status by expenses incurred under chapter 11 of the      Bankruptcy Code.       Under the conference agreement, subordination of ad valorem      tax liens is still possible under section 724(b). However,      the purposes are limited to paying for chapter 7      administrative expenses and priority claims for postpetition      ``wages, salaries, and commissions'' and claims for      ``contributions to an employee benefit plan.'' Thus,      subordination for the purpose of paying chapter 11      administrative expenses is not permitted. Also, section 701      requires the chapter 7 trustee to utilize all other estate      assets before the trustee could resort to section 724 of the      code to subordinate liens on personal and real property of      the estate.       In addition, the conference agreement prevents a bankruptcy      court from determining the amount or legality of ad valorem      tax obligations if the applicable period for contesting or      redetermining the amount of the claim under nonbankruptcy law      has expired. This addresses those instances where debtors or      trustees use section 505 of the Bankruptcy Code as a means to      have bankruptcy courts set aside these types of taxes, to the      detriment of the local communities that depend on them for      revenue.     Section 702. Treatment of fuel tax claims       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill. The      agreement simplifies the filing of claims by states against      truckers for unpaid fuel taxes by modifying section 501 of      the Bankruptcy Code. Rather than requiring all states to file      a claim for unpaid fuel taxes (as is the case under current      law), the designated ``base jurisdiction'' under the      International Fuel Tax Agreement would file a claim on behalf      of all states. This claim would be treated as a single claim.     Section 703. Notice of request for a determination of taxes       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill. Under      current law, debtors may request that the government      determine administrative tax liabilities under section 505(b)      of the Bankruptcy Code in order to receive a discharge of      those liabilities. There are no requirements as to the      content or form of such notice to the government.       The conference agreement requires that each bankruptcy      court clerk maintain a listing under which government      entities may designate their addresses for service of debtor      requests. If a governmental entity does not designate an      address and provide that address to the bankruptcy court      clerk, any request made under section 505(b) of the      Bankruptcy Code may be served at the address of the      appropriate taxing authority of     that governmental unit. The conference agreement also      provides that governmental entities may describe where      further information concerning additional requirements for      filing such requests may be found.     Section 704. Rate of interest on tax claims       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill with a      modification and a technical correction. Under current law,      there is no uniform rate of interest for payment of tax      claims. Bankruptcy courts have used varying standards to      determine the applicable rate. The conference agreement adds      section 511 to the Bankruptcy Code to simplify the interest      rate calculation. The agreement provides that for all tax      claims (federal, state, and local), including administrative      expense taxes, the interest rate shall be determined in      accordance with applicable non-bankruptcy law and as of the      calendar month in which the plan is confirmed.       The conference agreement modifies the Senate bill to      clarify that the applicable non-bankruptcy law interest rate      would apply to administrative expense taxes, as well as to      all other tax claims.     Section 705. Priority of tax claims       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill with a      modification and a technical correction. Under current law,      in section 507(a)(8) of the Bankruptcy Code, tax claims are      entitled to a priority if they arise within certain time      periods. In the case of income taxes, a priority arises,      among other times, if the tax return was due within 3 years      of the filing of the bankruptcy petition or if the assessment      of the tax was made within 240 days of the filing of the      petition. The 240-day period is tolled during the time that      an offer in compromise is pending (plus 30 days). Though the      statute is silent, most courts have also held that the 3-year      and 240-day time periods are tolled during the pendency of a      previous bankruptcy case.       The conference agreement codifies the rule tolling priority      periods during a previous bankruptcy and adds an additional      90 days. The agreement also includes tolling provisions to      adjust for the collection due process rights provided by the      IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. During any period      in which the government is prohibited from collecting a tax      as a result of a request by the debtor for a hearing and an      appeal of any collection action taken against the debtor, the      priority is tolled, plus 90 days. Also, during any time in      which there was a stay of proceedings in a prior bankruptcy      case or collection of an income tax was precluded by a      confirmed bankruptcy plan, the priority is tolled, plus 90      days. The conference agreement modifies the Senate bill to      apply the priority tolling periods to non-income taxes as      well.     Section 706. Priority property taxes incurred       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill, replacing      the word ``assessed'' with ``incurred'' in the case of real      property taxes. Under current law, many provisions of the      Bankruptcy Code are keyed to the word ``assessed.'' While      this word has an accepted meaning in the federal system, it      is not used in many state and local statutes and has created      some confusion. Replacing the word ``assessed'' with      ``incurred'' in the case of real property taxes in section      507(a)(8)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code eliminates this problem.     Section 707. No discharge of fraudulent taxes in chapter 13       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill. Under      current law, a debtor's ability to discharge his tax debts      varies depending on whether the debtor is in chapter 7      (liquidation) or chapter 13 (income earner plans of      repayment). Chapter 7 contains a much narrower discharge.      Under chapter 7, taxes from a return due within 3 years of      the petition date, taxes assessed within 240 days, or taxes      related to an unfiled return or false return are not      dischargeable. Chapter 13, on the other hand, permits what is      known as a ``superdischarge,'' which allows courts to      discharge these same tax debts.       The conference agreement repeals the superdischarge for      fraudulent and non-filed taxes by amending section 1328(a)(2)      of the Bankruptcy Code. Fraudulent and non-filer claims would      not receive any special treatment. The conference agreement      also repeals the superdischarge for a tax required to be      collected or withheld and for which the debtor is liable in      whatever capacity, such as an employee's share of federal      payroll and trust fund taxes. However, the conference      agreement leaves the superdischarge in place for other tax      claims. Thus, consistent with the IRS Restructuring and      Reform Act of 1998, taxpayers who have complied with a      reorganization plan--which includes paying taxes--would      continue to receive the superdischarge.     Section 708. No discharge of fraudulent taxes in chapter 11       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill with a      modification. Under current law, the confirmation of a plan      of reorganization under chapter 11 discharges the debtor from      all liability. The conference agreement would except, in the      case of corporations, fraudulent taxes, willfully evaded      taxes, and debts for money or property obtained in a false or      fraudulent manner from the broad chapter 11 discharge.      Congress believes the Bankruptcy Code should not encourage      fraud by allowing the discharge of debts incurred through      fraud or false representation simply because those debts were      incurred in a corporate setting.       The conference agreement amends the discharge provisions of      chapter 11 (Bankruptcy Code section 1141(d)) to prevent the      discharge of tax or customs duty tax claims resulting from a      corporate debtor's fraudulent tax returns. It also prevents      the discharge of any unpaid tax obligations that resulted      from a corporate chapter 11 debtor's willful evasion of      applicable tax laws. Further, the conference agreement      modifies the Senate bill to prevent the discharge of any debt      for money, property, services, or credit, obtained by a      corporate debtor in a false or fraudulent manner (applying      section 523(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code to corporate      debtors).     Section 709. Stay of tax proceedings limited to pre-petition          taxes       The conference agreement modifies the Senate and House      bills. Under current law, filing a petition for relief under      the Bankruptcy Code triggers an automatic stay which      precludes the commencement or continuation of a case in U.S.      tax court. This rule was arguably extended in Halpern v.      Commissioner, 96 T.C. 895 (1991), in which the tax court      ruled that it did not have jurisdiction to hear a case      involving a post-petition year. The conferees believe that      Halpern went too far.       In order to address this issue, the conference agreement      specifies that the automatic stay is limited to an individual      debtor's prepetition taxes (taxes incurred before entering      bankruptcy). Thus, the automatic stay would not apply to      cases involving an individual debtor's postpetition taxes.      The agreement allows the bankruptcy court to determine      whether the stay will apply to the postpetition tax      liabilities of a corporate debtor.     Section 710. Periodic payment of taxes in chapter 11 cases       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill with a      modification. Section 710 of the conference agreement limits      the discretion of the debtor and the trustee regarding      treatment of pre-petition tax claims in chapter 11 cases.      Under current law, non-tax claims are paid out over several      years in equal installments. Tax claims must be paid out over      six years from the date of assessment and typically include      interest-only payments in the early years and a balloon      payment at the end.       The conference agreement modifies section 1129(a)(9) of the      Bankruptcy Code by reducing the maximum period of tax      payments from six years from the date of assessment to five      years from the entry of the order for relief and by      specifying that payment should be made in ``regular      installment payments.''       The conference agreement modifies the Senate bill to delete      language regarding the interest rate applicable to      installment payments in chapter 11 cases.     Section 711. Avoidance of statutory liens prohibited       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill. Under the      Bankruptcy Code, trustees may act to keep assets in the      bankruptcy estate even though a statutory lien exists against      the asset. The Internal Revenue Code gives special protection      to certain purchasers of securities and motor vehicles      notwithstanding the existence of a filed tax lien. The      conference agreement amends section 545(2) of the Bankruptcy      Code to prevent trustees from using the tax code provision to      displace an otherwise valid lien. In other words, trustees      could not keep securities or motor vehicles in the bankruptcy      estate if they were subject to a lien under the tax code      provisions.       The conference agreement prevents the avoidance of      unperfected liens against a bona fide purchaser, if the      purchaser qualifies as such under section 6323 of the      Internal Revenue Code or a similar provision of either state      or local law.     Section 712. Payment of taxes in the conduct of business       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill.      Bankruptcy laws and statutes-at-large generally require      trustees and receivers to pay business taxes in the ordinary      course. Other kinds of administrative expenses can be paid      only upon motion after a court order. Some bankruptcy courts      have not permitted debtors to pay post-petition tax      liabilities (those accruing after filing a bankruptcy      petition) prior to the approval of a plan for the bankruptcy      estate. The conference agreement amends section 960 of title      28 of the U.S. Code to provide clear authority to pay taxes      in the ordinary course of business. The agreement also amends      section 503(b) of the Bankruptcy Code to require payment of      ad valorem taxes as an allowed administrative expense tax and      eliminates any requirement to file a request for payment of      any administrative expense taxes.     Section 713. Tardily filed priority tax claims       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill. Under      current law, in chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, tax claims      timely filed are entitled to their full statutory priority.      Late-filed tax claims lose their full statutory priority, but      are entitled to distribution as unsecured claims provided      they are filed before the trustee commences distribution of      the estate. The problem is that a claim filed just before      distribution can significantly delay the process of      distribution due to certifying the validity of the claim and      determining its proper priority.       The conference agreement modifies section 726(a)(1) of the      Bankruptcy Code to require a tax claim to be filed either      before the trustee commences distribution or 10 days      following the mailing to creditors of the summary of     the trustee's final report, whichever is earlier, in order      for the claim to be entitled to distribution as an unsecured      claim.     Section 714. Income tax returns prepared by tax authorities       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill. In      general, taxpayers cannot be discharged from taxes unless a      return was filed. Courts have struggled with what constitutes      filing a return. The tax code authorizes the Secretary of      Treasury to file a return on behalf of a taxpayer if either      (1) the taxpayer provides information sufficient to complete      a return, or (2) the Secretary can obtain sufficient      information through testimony or otherwise to complete a      return.       The conference agreement modifies section 523(a) of the      Bankruptcy Code to provide that a return filed on behalf of a      taxpayer who has provided information sufficient to complete      a return constitutes filing a return (and the debt can be      discharged) but that a return filed on behalf of a taxpayer      based on information the Secretary obtains through testimony      or otherwise does not constitute filing a return (and the      debt cannot be discharged).     Section 715. Discharge of the estate's liability for unpaid          taxes       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill. Under the      Bankruptcy Code, a debtor may request a prompt audit to      determine post-petition tax liabilities. If the government      does not make a determination or request extension of time to      audit, then the debtor's determination of taxes will be      final. Several court cases have held that while this protects      the debtor and the trustee, it does not necessarily protect      the estate.       The conference agreement modifies section 505(b) of the      Bankruptcy Code to clarify that the estate is also protected      if the government does not request an audit of the debtor's      tax returns. Therefore, if the government does not make a      determination of the debtor's post-petition tax liabilities      or request extension of time to audit, then the estate's      liability for unpaid taxes will be discharged.     Section 716. Requirement to file tax returns to confirm          chapter 13 plans       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill with a      modification. Under current law, a debtor may be entitled to      the benefits of chapter 13 (reorganization) even if he is      delinquent in his tax returns. Without access to tax return      information, creditors cannot obtain full information about      the debtor's status. Most districts have established      procedures requiring the filing of returns prior to the      initial meeting of creditors.       The conference agreement amends section 1325(a) of the      Bankruptcy Code (and adds section 1308 to the Code) to      require a debtor to be current on the filing of tax returns      for the four years prior to the filing of a petition in order      to have a chapter 13 plan confirmed. If the returns have not      been filed by the date on which the meeting of creditors is      first scheduled, the trustee may hold open that meeting for a      reasonable period of time to allow the debtor to file any      unfiled returns. The additional period of time may not extend      beyond 120 days after the date of the meeting of the      creditors or beyond the date on which the return is due under      the last automatic extension of time for filing. However, the      debtor may also obtain an extension of time to file from the      court if the debtor demonstrates by a preponderance of the      evidence that the failure to file was attributable to      circumstances beyond the debtor's control.     Section 717. Standards for tax disclosure       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill. Under      current law, before a chapter 11 (business bankruptcy) plan      may be submitted to creditors and stockholders for a vote,      the proponent of the plan must file a disclosure statement in      which holders of claims and interests are given ``adequate      information'' on which they can make a decision as to whether      or not to vote in favor of the plan. A chapter 11 plan's tax      consequences represent an important aspect of that plan.       The conference agreement amends section 1125(a) of the      Bankruptcy Code to require that a chapter 11 disclosure      statement discuss the potential material Federal tax      consequences of the plan to the debtor and to holders of      claims and interests in the case.     Section 718. Setoff of tax refunds       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill. Under      current law, a petition for bankruptcy triggers an automatic      stay of the setoff of any debt owing to the debtor that arose      before the commencement of the case against any debt owed by      the debtor. This automatic stay precludes setoff of a pre-     petition tax refund against a pre-petition tax obligation      unless the bankruptcy court has approved the setoff. Because      the interest and penalties which may continue to accrue are      often nondischargeable, the inability to promptly apply      income tax refunds against tax claims can cause individual      debtors undue hardship.       The conference agreement amends section 362(b) of the      Bankruptcy Code to allow the setoff to occur unless setoff      would not be permitted under applicable tax law because of a      pending action to determine the amount or legality of the tax      liability. In that circumstance, the governmental authority      may hold the refund pending resolution of the action.     Section 719. Special provisions related to the treatment of          State and local taxes       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill,      conforming state and local income tax administrative issues      to the Internal Revenue Code. For example, under federal law,      a bankruptcy petitioner filing on March 5 has two tax years--     January 1 to March 4, and March 5 to December 31. However,      under the Bankruptcy Code, state and local tax years are      divided differently--January 1 to March 5, and March 6 to      December 31. Section 719 of the conference agreement requires      the states to follow the federal convention.       The conference agreement conforms state and local tax      administration to the Internal Revenue Code in the following      areas: division of tax liabilities and responsibilities      between the estate and the debtor, tax consequences with      respect to partnerships and transfers of property, and the      taxable period of a debtor. The conference agreement does not      conform state and local tax rates to federal tax rates.     Section 720. Dismissal for failure to timely file tax returns       The conference agreement follows the Senate bill. Under      existing law, there is no definitive rule concerning whether      a bankruptcy court should dismiss a bankruptcy case if the      debtor fails to file tax returns after entering bankruptcy.      The conferees believe that it is good policy to require that      these returns be filed.       Thus, the conference agreement amends section 521 of the      Bankruptcy Code to allow a taxing authority to request that      the court dismiss or convert a bankruptcy case if the debtor      fails to file a post-petition tax return or obtain an      extension on such a return. The conference agreement provides      that the debtor would have 90 days from the time of the      request to file the return or to obtain an extension, or the      court would be required to dismiss or convert the case.           Title VIII--Ancillary and other cross-border cases       This Title adds a new chapter to the Bankruptcy Code (the      ``Code'') for transactional bankruptcy cases. This      incorporates the Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency to      encourage cooperation between the United States and foreign      countries with respect to transnational insolvency cases.      Title IX is intended to provide greater legal certainty for      trade and investment as well as to provide for the fair and      efficient administration of cross-border insolvencies, which      protects the interests of creditors and other interested      parties, including the debtor. In addition, it serves to      protect and maximize the value of the debtor's assets.     Section 801. Amendment to add Chapter 15 to title 11, United          States Code       Each of the sections of new chapter 15 is discussed in      order.       Section 1501. Purpose and scope of application       The chapter introduces into the Bankruptcy Code the Model      Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (``Model Law''), which was      promulgated by the United Nations Commission on      International Trade Law (``UNCITRAL'') at its Thirtieth      Session, May 12-30, 1997.       Cases brought under this chapter are intended to be      ancillary to cases brought in a debtor's home country, unless      a full United States bankruptcy case is brought under another      chapter. Even if a full case is brought, the court may decide      under section 305 to stay or dismiss the United States case      under the chapter and limit the United States' role to      ancillary case under this chapter. If the full case is not      dismissed, it will be subject to the provisions of this      chapter governing cooperation, communication and coordination      with foreign courts and representatives. In any case, an      order granting recognition is required as a prerequisite to      use the sections 301 and 303 by a foreign representative.       Section 1501 combines the Preamble to the Model Law      (subsection (1)) with its article 1 (subsections (2) and      (3)). It largely follows the language of the Model Law and      fills in blanks with appropriate United States references.      However, it adds in subsection (3) an exclusion of certain      natural persons who may be considered ordinary consumers.      Although the consumer exclusion is not in the test of the      Model Law, the discussions at UNCITRAL recognized that some      such exclusion would be necessary in countries like the      United States where there are special provisions for consumer      debtors in the insolvency laws.       The reference to section 109(e) essentially defines      ``consumer debtors'' for purposes of the exclusion by      incorporating the debt limitations of that section, but not      its requirement or regular income. The exclusion adds a      requirement that the debtor or debtor couple be citizens or      long-term legal residents of the United States. This ensures      that residents of other countries will not be able to      manipulate this exclusion to avoid recognition of foreign      proceedings in their home countries or elsewhere.       The first exclusion in subsection (c) constitutes, for the      United States, the exclusion provided in article 1,      subsection (2), of the Model Law. Foreign representatives of      foreign proceedings which are excluded from the scope of      chapter 15 may seek relief from courts other than the      bankruptcy court since the limitations of section 1509(b) (2)      and (3) would not apply to them.       The reference to section 109(b) interpolates into chapter      15 the entities governed by specialized insolvency regimes      under United States law which are currently excluded from      liquidation proceedings under title 11. Section 1501 contains      an exception to the     section 109(b) exclusions so that foreign proceedings of      foreign insurance companies are eligible for recognition and      relief under chapter 15 as they had been under section 304.      However, section 1501(d) has the effect of leaving to State      regulation any deposit, escrow, trust fund or the like posted      by a foreign insurer under State law.       Section 1502. Definitions       ``Debtor'' is given a special definition for this chapter.      That definition does not come from the Model Law but is      necessary to eliminate the need to refer repeatedly to ``the      same debtor as in the foreign proceeding.'' With certain      exceptions, the term ``person'' used in the Model Law has      been replace with ``entity,'' which is defined broadly in      section 101(15) to include natural persons and various legal      entities, thus matching the intended breadth of the term      ``person'' in the Model Law. The exceptions include contexts      in which a natural person is intended and those in which the      Model Law language already refers to both persons and      entities other than persons. The definition of ``trustee''      for this chapter ensures that debtors in possession and      debtors, as well as trustees, are included in the term.       The definition of ``within the territorial jurisdiction of      the United States'' in subsection (7) is not taken from the      Model Law. It has been added because the United States, like      some other countries, assets insolvency jurisdiction over      property outside its territorial limits under appropriate      circumstances. Thus a limiting phrase is useful where the      Model Law and this chapter intend to refer only to property      within the territory of the enacting state. In addition, a      definition of ``recognition'' supplements the Model Law      definitions and merely simplifies drafting of various other      sections of chapter 15.       Two key definitions of ``foreign proceeding'' and ``foreign      representative,'' are found in sections 101(23) and (24),      which have been amended consistent with Model Law article 2.       The definitions ``establishment,'' ``foreign court,''      ``foreign main proceeding,'' and ``foreign non-main      proceeding,'' have been taken from Model Law article 2, with      only minor language variations necessary to comport with      United States terminology. Additionally, defined terms have      been placed in alphabetical order.       In order to be recognized as a foreign non-main proceeding,      the debtor must at least have an establishment in that      foreign country.       Section 1503. International obligations of the United            States       This section is taken exactly from the Model Law with only      minor adaptations of terminology.       Although this sections makes an international obligation      prevail over chapter 15, the courts will attempt to read the      Model Law and the international obligation so as not to      conflict, especially if the international obligation      addresses a subject matter less directly related than the      Model Law to a case before the court.       Section 1504. Commencement of ancillary case       Article 4 of the Model Law is designed for designation of      the competent court which will exercise jurisdiction under      the Model Law. In United States law, section 1334(a) of title      28 gives exclusive jurisdiction to the district courts in a      ``case'' under this title.       Therefore, since the competent court has been determined in      title 28, this section instead provides that a petition for      recognition commences a ``case'', an approach that also      invokes a number of other useful procedural provisions.       In addition, a new subsection (P) to section 157 of title      28 makes cases under this chapter part of the core      jurisdiction of bankruptcy courts when referred to them by      the district court that will rule on the petition is      determined pursuant to a revised section 1410 of title 28      governing venue and transfer.       The title ``ancillary'' in this section and in the title of      this chapter emphasizes the United States' policy in favor of      a general rule that countries other than the home country of      the debtor, where a main proceeding would be brought, should      usually act through ancillary proceedings, in preference to a      system of full bankruptcies (often called ``secondary''      proceedings) in each state where assets are found. Under the      Model Law, notwithstanding the recognition of a foreign main      proceeding, full bankruptcy cases are permitted in each      country (see sections 1528 and 1529). In the United States,      the court will have the power to suspend or dismiss such      cases where appropriate under section 305.       Section 1505. Authorization to act in a foreign country       The language in this section varies from the wording of      articles 5 of the Model Law as necessary to comport with      United States law and terminology. The slight alteration to      the language in the last sentence is meant to emphasize that      the identification of the trustee or other entity entitled to      act is under United States law, while the scope of actions      that may be taken by the trustee or other entity under      foreign law is limited by the foreign law.       The related amendment to section 586(a)(3) of title 28      makes acting pursuant to authorization under this section an      additional power of a trustee or debtor in possession.       While the Model Law automatically authorizes an      administrator to act abroad, this section requires all      trustees and debtors to obtain court approval before acting      abroad. That requirement is a change from the language of the      Model Law, but one that is purely internal to United States      law.       Its main purpose is to ensure that the court has knowledge      and control of possibly expensive activities, but it will      have the collateral benefit or providing further assurance to      foreign courts that the United States debtor or      representative is under judicial authority and supervision.      This requirement means that the first-day orders in      reorganization cases should include authorization to act      under this section where appropriate.       This section also contemplates the designation of an      examiner or other natural person to act for the estate in one      or more foreign countries where appropriate. One instance      might be a case in which the designated person had a special      expertise relevant to that assignment. Another might be where      the foreign court would be more comfortable with a designated      person than with an entity like a debtor in possession.      Either are to be recognized under the Model Law.       Section 1506. Public policy exception       This provision follows the Model Law article 5 exactly, is      standard in UNCITRAL texts and has been narrowly interpreted      on a consistent basis in courts around the world. The word      ``manifestly'' in international usage restricts the public      policy exemption to the most fundamental policies of the      United States.       Section 1507. Additional assistance       Subsection (1) follows the language of Model law article 7.       Subsection (2) makes the authority for additional relief      (beyond that permitted under sections 1519-1521, below)      subject to the conditions for relief heretofore specified in      United States law under section 304, which is repealed. This      section is intended to permit the further development of      international cooperation begun under section 304, but is not      to be the basis for denying of limiting relief otherwise      available under this chapter. The additional assistance is      made conditional upon the court's consideration of the      factors set forth in the current subsection 304(c) in a      context of a reasonable balancing of interests following      current case law. The references to ``estate'' in section 304      have been changed to refer to the debtor's property, because      many foreign systems do not create an estate in insolvency      proceedings or the sort recognized under this chapter.      Although the case law, construing section 304 makes it      clear that comity is the central consideration, its      physical placement as one of six factors in subsection 304      is misleading, since those factors are essentially      elements of the grounds for granting comity. Therefore, in      subsection (2) of this section, comity is raised to the      introductory language to make it clear that it is the      central concept to be addressed.       Section 1508. Interpretation       This provision follows conceptually Model law article 8 and      is a standard one in recent UNCITRAL treaties and model laws.      Language changes were made to express the concepts more      clearly in terminology which accords with that of the      bankruptcy laws of the United States.       Interpretation of this chapter on a uniform basis will be      aided by reference to the Guide and the Reports cited      therein, which explain the reasons for the terms used and      often cite their origins as well. Uniform interpretation will      also be aided by reference to CLOUT, the UNCITRAL Case Law On      Uniform Texts, which is a service of UNITRAL. CLOUT receives      reports from national reporters all over the world concerning      court decisions interpreting treaties, model laws, and other      text promulgated by UNCITRAL. Not only are these sources      persuasive, but they are important to the crucial goal of      uniformity of interpretation. To the extent that the United      States courts rely on these sources, their decisions will      more likely be regarded as persuasive elsewhere.       Section 1509. Right of direct access       This section implements the purpose of article 9 of the      Model Law, enabling a foreign representative to commence a      case under this chapter by filing a petition directly with      the court without preliminary formalities that may delay or      prevent relief. It varies the language to fit United States      procedural requirements and it imposes recognition of the      foreign proceeding as a condition to further rights and      duties of the foreign representative. If recognition is      granted, the foreign representative will have full capacity      under U.S. law (subsection (b)(1)), may request such relief      in a state or federal court other than the bankruptcy court      (subsection (b)(2)) and may be granted comity or cooperation      by such non-bankruptcy court (subsection (b)(3) and (c)).      Subsections (b)(2), (b)(3) and (c) make it clear that chapter      15 is intended to be the exclusive door to ancillary      assistance to foreign proceedings. The goal is to concentrate      control of these questions in one court. That goal is      important in a federal system like that of the United States      with many different courts, state and federal, that may have      pending actions involving the debtor or the debtor's      property. This section, therefore, completes for the United      States the work of article 4 of the Model Law (``competent      court'') as well as article 9.       Although a petition under current section 304 is the proper      method for achieving deference by a United States court to a      foreign insolvency under present law, some cases in state and      federal courts under current law have granted comity      suspension or dismissal     of cases involving foreign proceedings without requiring a      section 304 petition or even referring to the requirements of      that section. Even if the result is correct in a particular      case, the procedure is undesirable, because there is room for      abuse of comity. Parties would be free to avoid the      requirements of this chapter and the expert scrutiny of the      bankruptcy court by applying directly to a state or federal      court unfamiliar with the statutory requirements. Such an      application could be made after denial of a petition under      this chapter. This section concentrates the recognition and      deference process in one United States court, ensures against      abuse, and empowers a court that will be fully informed of      the current status of all foreign proceedings involving the      debtor.       Subsection (d) has been added to ensure that a foreign      representative cannot seek relief in courts in the United      States after being denied recognition by the court under this      chapter.       Subsection (c) makes activities in the United States by a      foreign representative subject to applicable United States      law, just as 28 U.S.C. section 959 does for a domestic      trustee in bankruptcy.       Subsection (f) provides a limited exception to the prior      recognition requirement so that collection of a claim which      is property of the debtor, for example an account receivable,      by a foreign representative may proceed without commencement      of a case or recognition under this chapter.       Section 1510. Limited jurisdiction       Section 1510, article 10 of the Model Law, is modeled on      section 306 of the Code. Although the language referring to      conditional relief in section 306 is not included, the court      has the power under section 1522 to attach appropriate      conditions to any relief it may grant. Nevertheless, the      authority in section 1522 is not intended to permit the      imposition of jurisdiction over the foreign representative      beyond the boundaries of the case under this chapter and any      related actions the foreign representative may take, such as      commencing a case under another chapter of this title.       Section 1511. Commencement of case under section 301 or 303       This section follows the intent of article 11 of the Model      Law, but adds language that conforms to United States law or      that is otherwise necessary in the United States given its      many bankruptcy court districts and the importance of full      information and coordination among them.       Article 11 does not distinguish between voluntary and      involuntary proceedings, but seems to have implicitly assumed      an involuntary proceeding.       Subsection 1(a)(2) goes farther and permits a voluntary      filing, with its much simpler requirements, if the foreign      proceeding that has been recognized is a main proceeding.       Section 1512. Participation of a foreign representative in            a case under this title       This section follows article 12 of the Model Law with a      sight alternation to adjust to United States procedural      terminology. The effect of this section is to make the      recognized foreign representative a party in interest in any      pending or later commenced United States bankruptcy case.       Throughout this chapter, the word ``case'' has been      substituted for the word ``proceeding'' in the Model Law when      referring to cases under the United States Bankruptcy Code,      to conform to United States usage.       Section 1513. Access of foreign creditors to a case under            this title       This section mandates nondiscriminatory or ``national''      treatment for foreign creditors, except as provided in      subsection (b) and section 1514. It follows the intent of      Model Law article 13, but the language required alternation      to fit into the Bankruptcy Code.       The law as to priority for foreign claims that fit within a      class given priority treatment under section 507 (for      example, foreign employees or spouses) is unsettled. This      section permits the continued development of case law on that      subject and its general principle of national treatment      should be an important factor to be considered. At a minimum,      under this section, foreign claims must receive the treatment      given to general unsecured claims without priority, unless      they are in a class of claims in which domestic creditors      would also be subordinated.       The Model Law allows for an exception to the policy of      nondiscrimination as to foreign revenue and other public law      claims. Such claims (such as tax and social security claims)      have been denied enforcement in the United States      traditionally, inside and outside of bankruptcy. The Code is      silent on this point, so the rule is purely a matter of      traditional case law. It also allows the Department of the      Treasury to negotiate reciprocal arrangements with out tax      treaty partners in this regard, although it does not mandate      any restriction of the evolution of case law pending such      negotiations.       Section 1514. Notification of foreign creditors concerning            a case under title 11.       This section ensures that foreign creditors receive proper      notice of cases in the United States.       As ``foreign creditor'' is not defined term, foreign      addresses are used as the distinguishing factor. The Federal      Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure (``Rules'') should be amended      to conform to the requirements of this section, including a      special form for initial notice to such creditors. In      particular, the Rules must provide for additional time for      such creditors to file proofs of claim where appropriate and      must provide for the court to make specific orders in that      regard in proper circumstances. The notice must specify that      secured claims must be asserted, because in many countries      such claims are not affected by an insolvency proceeding and      need not be filed. Of course, if a foreign creditor has made      an appropriate request for notice, it will receive notices in      every instance where notices would be sent to other creditors      who have made such requests.       Subsection (d) replaces the reference to ``a reasonable      time period'' in Mode Law article 14(3)(a). It makes clear      that the Rules, local rules, and court orders must make      appropriate adjustments in time periods and bar dates so that      foreign creditors have a reasonable time within which to      receive notice or take an action.       Section 1515. Application for recognition of a foreign            proceeding       This section follows article 15 of the Model Law with minor      changes.       The Rules will require amendment to provide forms for some      or all of the documents mentioned in this section, to make      necessary additions to Rules 1000 and 20002 to facilitate      appropriate notices of the hearing on the petition for      recognition, and to require filing of lists of creditors and      other interested persons who should receive notices.      Throughout the Model Law, the question of notice procedure is      left to the law of the enacting state.       Section 1516. Presumptions concerning recognition       This section follows article 16 of the Model Law with minor      changes.       Although section 1515 and 1516 are designed to make      recognition as simple and expedient as possible, the court      may hear proof on any element stated. The ultimate burden as      to each element is on the foreign representative, although      the court is entitled to shift the burden to the extent      indicated in section 1516. The word ``proof'' in subsection      (3) has been changed to ``evidence'' to make it clearer using      United States terminology that the ultimate burden is on the      foreign representative.       ``Registered office'' is the term used in the Model Law to      refer to the place of incorporation or the equivalent for an      entity that is not a natural person.       The presumption that the place of the registered office is      also the center of the debtor's main interest is included for      speed and convenience of proof where there is not serious      controversy.       Section 1517. Order granting recognition       This section closely follows article 17 of the Model Law,      with a few exceptions.       The decision to grant recognition is not dependent upon any      findings about the nature of the foreign proceedings of the      sort previously mandated by section 304(c). The requirements      of this section, which incorporates the definitions in      section 1502 and sections 101(23) and (24), are all that must      be fulfilled to attain recognition.       Reciprocity was specifically suggested as a requirement for      recognition on more than one occasion in the negotiations      that resulted in the Model Law. It was rejected by      overwhelming consensus each time. The United States was one      of the leading countries opposing the inclusion of a      reciprocity requirement. In this regard, the Model Law      conforms to section 304, which has no such requirement.       The drafters of the Model Law understood that only a main      proceeding or a non-main proceeding meeting the standards of      section 1502 (that is, one brought where the debtor has an      establishment) were entitled to recognition under this      section. The Model Law has been slightly modified to make      this point clear by referring to the section 1502 definition      of main and non-main proceedings, as well as to the general      definition of a foreign proceeding in section 101(23).      Naturally, a petition under section 1515 must show that      proceeding is a main or a qualifying non-main proceeding in      order to win recognition under this section.       Consistent with the position of various civil law      representatives in the drafting of the Model Law, recognition      creates a status with the effects set forth in section 1520,      so those effects are not viewed as orders to be modified, as      are orders granting relief under section 1519 and 1521.      Subsection (4) states the grounds for modifying or      terminating recognition. On the other hand, the effects of      recognition (found in section 1520 and including an automatic      stay) are subject to modification under section 362(d), made      applicable by section 15320(2), which permits lifting the      stay of section 1520 for cause.       Paragraph 1(d) of section 17 of the Model Law has been      omitted as an unnecessary requirement for United States      purposes, because a petition submitted to the wrong court      will be dismissed or transferred under other provisions of      United States law.       The reference to section 350 refers to the routine closing      of a case that has been completed and will invoke      requirements including a final report from the foreign      representative in such form as the Rules may provide or a      court may order.       Section 1518. Subsequent information       This section follows the Model Law, except to eliminate the      word ``same'' which is rendered unnecessary by the definition      of ``debtor'' in section 1502 and to provide for a formal      document to be filed with the court.       Judges in several jurisdictions, including the United      States, have reported a need for a     requirement of complete and candid reports to the court of      all proceedings, worldwide, involving the debtor. This      section will ensure that such information is provided to the      court on a timely basis. Any failure to comply with this      section will be subject to the sanctions available to the      court for violations of the statue. The section leaves to the      Rules the form of the required notice and related questions      of notice to parties in interest, the time for filing, and      the like.       Section 1519. Relief may be granted upon petition for            recognition of a foreign proceeding       This section generally follows article 19 of the Model Law.       The bankruptcy court will have jurisdiction to grant      emergency relief under Rule 7065 pending a hearing on the      petition for recognition. This section does not expand or      reduce the scope of section 105 as determined by cases under      section 105 nor does it modify the sweep of sections 555 to      560. Subsection (d) precludes injunctive relief against      police and regulatory action under section 1519, leaving      section 105 as the only avenue to such relief. Subsection (e)      makes clear that this section contemplates injunctive relief      and that such relief is subject to specific rules and a body      of jurisprudence. Subsection (f) was added to complement      amendments to the Code provisions dealing with financial      contracts.       Section 1520. Effects of recognition of a foreign main            proceeding       In general, this chapter sets forth all the relief that is      available as a matter of right based upon recognition      hereunder, although additional assistance may be provided      under section 1507 and this chapter have no effect on any      relief currently available under section 105.       The stay created by article 20 of the Model law is imported      to chapter 15 from existing provisions of the Code.      Subsection (a)(1) combines subsections 1(a) and (b) of      article 20 of the Model Law, because section 362 imposes the      restrictions required by those two subsections and additional      restrictions as well.       Subsections (a)(2) and (4) apply the Code sections that      impose the restrictions called for by subsection 1(c) of the      Model Law. In both cases, the provisions are broader and more      complete than those contemplated by the Model Law, but      include all the restrains the Model Law provisions would      impose.       As the foreign proceeding may or may not create an      ``estate'' similar to that created in cases under this title,      the restraints are applicable to actions against the debtor      under section 362(a) and with respect to the property of the      debtor under the remaining sections. The only property      covered by this section is property within the territorial      jurisdiction of the United States as defined in section 1502.      To achieve effects on property of the debtor which is not      within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States, the      foreign representative would have to commence a case under      another chapter of this title.       By applying section 361 and 362, subsection (a) makes      applicable the United States exceptions and limitation to the      restraints imposed on creditors, debtors, and other in a case      under this title, as stated in article 20(2) of the Model      Law. It also introduces the concept of adequate protection      provided in sections 362 and 363.       These exceptions and limitations include these set forth in      section 362(b), (c) and (d). As one result, the court has the      power to terminate the stay pursuant to section 362(d), for      cause, including a failure of adequate protection.       Subsection (a)(2), by its reference to section 363 and 552      adds to the powers of a foreign representative of a foreign      main proceeding an automatic right to operate the debtor's      business and exercise the power of a trustee under section      363 and 542, unless the court orders otherwise. A foreign      representative of a foreign main proceeding may need to      continue a business operation to maintain value and granting      that authority automatically will eliminate the risk of      delay. If the court is uncomfortable about his authority in a      particular situation it can ``order otherwise'' as part of      the order granting recognition.       Two special exceptions to the automatic stay are embodied      in subsections (b) and (c). To preserve a claim in certain      foreign countries, it may be necessary to commence an action.      Subsection (b) permits the commencement of such an action,      but would not allow for its further prosecution. Subsection      (c) provides that there is not stay of the commencement of a      full United States bankruptcy case. This essentially provides      an escape hatch through which any entity, including the      foreign representative, can flee into a full case. The full      case, however, will remain subject to subchapter IV and V on      cooperation and coordination of proceedings and to      section 305 providing for stay or dismissal.       Section 108 of the Bankruptcy Code provides the tolling      protection intended by Model Law article 2(3), so no      exception is necessary as to claims that might be      extinguished under United States law.       Section 1521. Relief that may be granted upon recognition            of a foreign proceeding       This section follows article 21 of the Model Law, with      detailed changes to fit United States law.       The exceptions in subsection (a)(7) relate to avoiding      powers. The foreign representative's status as to such powers      is governed by section 1523 below. The avoiding power in      section 549 and the exceptions to that power are covered by      section 1520(a)(2).       The word ``adequately'' in the Model Law, articles 21(2)      and 22(1), has been changed to ``sufficiently'' in section      1521(b) and 1522(a) to avoid confusion with a very      specialized legal term in United States bankruptcy,      ``adequate protection.''       Subsection (c) is designed to limit relief to assets having      some direct connection with a non-main proceeding, for      example where they were part of an operating division in the      jurisdiction of the non-main proceeding when they were      fraudulently conveyed and then brought to the United States.      Subsections (d), (e) and (f)j are identical to those same      subsections of section 1519.       This section does not expand or reduce the scope of relief      currently available in ancillary cases under sections 105 and      304 nor does it modify the sweep of section 555 through 560.       Section 1522. Protection of creditors and other interested            persons       This section follows article 22 of the Model Law with      changes for United States usage and references to relevant      Code sections.       It gives the bankruptcy court broad latitude to mold relief      to circumstances, including appropriate responses if it is      shown that the foreign proceeding is seriously and      unjustifiably injuring United States creditors. For response      to a showing that the conditions necessary to recognition did      not actually exist or have ceased to exist, see section 1517.      Concerning the change of ``adequately'' in the Model Law to      ``sufficiently'' in this section, see section 1521 Subsection      (d) is new and simply makes clear that an examiner appointed      in a case under chapter 15 shall be subject to certain duties      and bonding requirements based on those imposed on trustees      and examiners under other chapters of this title.       Section 1523. Actions to avoid acts detrimental to            creditors       This section follows article 23 of the Model Law, with      wording to fit it within procedure under this title.       It confers standing on a recognized foreign representative      to assert an avoidance action but only in a pending case      under another chapter of this title. The Model Law is not      clear about whether it would grant standing in a recognized      foreign proceeding if not full case were pending. This      limitation reflects concerns raised by the United States      delegation during the UNCITRAL debates that a single grant of      standing to bring avoidance actions neglects to address very      difficult choice of law and forum issues. This limited grant      of standing in section 1523 does not create or establish any      legal right of avoidance nor does it create or imply any      legal rules with respect to the choice of applicable law as      to the avoidance of any transfer or obligation.       The courts will determine the nature and extent of any such      action and what national law may be applied to such action.       Section 1524. Intervention by a foreign representative       The wording is the same as the Model Law, except for a few      clarifying words.       This section gives the foreign representative whose foreign      proceeding has been recognized the right to intervene in      United States cases, state or federal, where the debtor is a      party. Recognition begin an act under federal bankruptcy law,      it must take effect in state as well as federal courts. This      section does not require substituting the foreign      representative for the debtor, although that result may be      appropriate in some circumstances.       Section 1525. Cooperation and direct communication between            the court and foreign courts or foreign representatives       The wording is almost exactly that of the Model Law.       The right or courts to communicate with other courts in      worldwide insolvency cases is of central importance. This      section authorizes courts to do so. This right must be      exercised, however, with due regard to the rights of the      parties. Guidelines for such communications are left to the      Rules.       Section 1526. Cooperation and direct communication between            the trustee and foreign courts or foreign            representatives       This section follows the Model Law almost exactly.       The language in Model Law article 26 concerning the      trustee's function was eliminated as unnecessary because      always implied under United States law. The section      authorizes the trustee, including a debtor in possession, to      cooperate with other proceedings.       Subsection (3) is not taken from the Model Law but is added      so that any examiner appointed under this chapter will be      designated by the United States Trustee and will be bonded.       Section 1527. Forms of cooperation       This section follows the Model Law exactly. United States      bankruptcy courts have already engaged in most of the forms      of cooperation mentioned here, but they now have explicit      statutory authorization for acts like the approval of      protocols of the sort used in cases.       Section 1528. Commencement of a case under title 11 after            recognition of a foreign main proceeding       This section follows the Model Law, with specifics of      United States law replacing the general clause at the end to      cover assets normally included within the jurisdiction of the      United States courts in bankruptcy cases,     except where assets are subject to the jurisdiction of      another recognized proceeding.       In a full bankruptcy case, the United States bankruptcy      court generally has jurisdiction over assets outside the      United States. Here that jurisdiction is limited where those      assets are controlled by another recognized proceeding, if it      is a main proceeding.       The court may use section 305 of this title to dismiss,      stay, or limit a case as necessary to promote cooperation and      coordination in a cross-border case. In addition, although      the jurisdictional limitation applies only to United States      bankruptcy cases commenced after recognition of a foreign      proceeding, the court has ample authority under the next      section and section 305 to exercise its discretion to      dismiss, stay, or limit a United States case filed after a      petition for recognition of a foreign main proceeding has      been filed but before it has been approved, if recognition is      ultimately granted.       Section 1529. Coordination of a case under title 11 and a            foreign proceeding       This section follows the Model Law almost exactly, but      subsection (4) adds a reference to section 305 to make it      clear the bankruptcy court may continue to use that section,      as under present law, to dismiss or suspend a United States      case as part of coordination and cooperation with foreign      proceedings. This provision is consistent with United States      policy to act ancillary to a foreign main proceeding whenever      possible.       Section 1530. Coordination of more than one foreign            proceeding       This section follows exactly article 30 of the Model Law.       It ensures that a foreign main proceeding will be given      primacy in the United States, consistent with the overall      approach of the United States favoring assistance to foreign      main proceedings.       Section 1531. Presumption of insolvency based on            recognition of a foreign main proceeding       This section follows the Model Law exactly, inserting a      reference to the standard for an involuntary case under this      title.       Where an insolvency proceeding has begin in the home      country of the debtor, and in the absence of contrary      evidence, the foreign representative should not have to make      a new showing that the debtors in the sort of financial      distress requiring a collective judicial remedy. The word      ``proof'' here means ``presumption.'' The presumption does      not arise for any purpose outside this section.       Section 1532. Rule of payment in concurrent proceeding       This section follows the Model Law exactly and is very      similar to prior section 508(a), which is repealed. The Model      Law language is somewhat clearer and broader than the      equivalent language of prior section 508(a).     Section 802. Other amendments to titles 11 and 28, United          States Code       Other sections of title 11 have been amended to apply      relevant provisions in those sections to chapter 15 and to      specify which portions of chapter 15 apply in cases under      other chapters of title 11.       The key definitions of foreign proceeding and foreign      representative do not appear in chapter 15, but rather      replace the prior definitions of those terms in section      101(23) and 101(24). The new definitions are nearly identical      to those contained in the Model Law but add to the phrase      ``under a law relating to insolvency'' the words ``or debt      adjustment.'' This addition emphasizes that the scope of the      Model Law and chapter 15 is not limited to proceedings      involving only debtors which are technically insolvent, but      broadly includes all proceedings involving debtors in severe      financial distress, so long as those proceedings also meet      the other criteria of section 101(24).       The amendment to section 157(b)(2) of title 28 provides      that proceedings under chapter 15 will be core proceedings      while other amendments to title 28 provide that the United      States Trustee's standing extend to cases under chapter 15      and that the United States Trustee's duties include acting in      chapter 15 cases.       Although the United States will continue to assert      worldwide jurisdiction over property of a domestic or foreign      debtor in a full bankruptcy case under chapters 7 and 13 of      this title, subject to deference to foreign proceedings under      chapter 15 and section 305, the situations different in a      case commenced under chapter 15. There the United States is      acting solely in an ancillary position, so jurisdiction over      property is limited to that stated in chapter 15.       Amendments to section 109 permit recognition of foreign      proceedings involving foreign insurance companies and      involving foreign banks which do not have a branch or agency      in the United States (as defined in 12 U.S.C. section 3103).      While a foreign bank not subject to United States regulation      will be eligible for chapter 15 as a consequence of the      amendment to section 109, section 303 prohibits the      commencement of a full involuntary case against such a      foreign bank unless the bank is a debtor in a foreign      proceeding.       While section 304 is repealed and replace by chapter 15,      access to the jurisprudence which developed under section 304      is preserved in the context of new section 1507. On deciding      whether to grant the Additional Assistance contemplated by      section 1507, the Court must consider the same factors that      had been imposed by former section 304.       The venue provisions for cases ancillary to foreign      proceedings have been amended to provide a hierarchy of      choices beginning with principal place of business in the      United States, if any. If there is no principal place of      business in the United States, but there is litigation      against a debtor, then the district in which the litigation      is pending would be the appropriate venue. In any other case,      venue must be determined with reference to the interests of      justice and the convenience of the parties.                title ix--financial contract provisions       This title addresses recently prominent forms of financial      investments which require special treatment in the insovlency      context. It amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to      provide treatment financial contracts, commodities contracts,      securities contracts, forward contracts, repurchase      agreements and swaps. It also amends the Bankruptcy Code to      provide appropriate treatment for those types of financial      investments. The Securities Investor Protection Act is      amended as well to create an exception from the stay under      that Act for certain financial investment instruments.      Finally, the Bankruptcy Code is amended to deal with certain      specialized aspects of asset securitization.                 title x--protection of family farmers     Section 1001. Permanent reenactment of chapter 12       Under subsection 1001(a) chapter 12 (Adjustment of Debts of      a Family Farmer with Regular Annual Income) is reenacted      effective October 1, 1999. No time limit or termination date      is established for chapter 12 under this provision.      Subsection 1001(b) repeals subsection 302(f) of the      Bankruptcy, Judges, United States Trustees, and Family Farmer      Bankruptcy Act of 1986, which set a now outdated termination      date of October 1, 1998 for chapter 12.     Section 1002. Debt limit increase       This section amends section 104(b) of title 11, United      States Code, providing for annual or biannual adjustments of      the debt limit for family farmers beginning with the      adjustment to be made on April 1, 2001.     Section 1003. Certain claims owed to governmental units       Subsection 1003(a) provides for payment in full of all      claims entitled to section 507 priority unless the claim is      owed to a governmental unit arising from the sale, exchange,      or other disposition of any farm asset used in the debtor's      farming operation. In that case, the claim is treated as an      unsecured claim and the underlying debt is treated the same      if the debtor receives a discharge or the holder of a      particular claim agrees to a different treatment of that      claim. Subsection 1003(b) amends section 1231(d) of chapter      11, providing that any governmental unit'' may provide a      determination regarding the tax effects of a proposed plan      under chapter 12.              Title XI--Health Care and Employee Benefits       This title amends the Bankruptcy Code to deal with the      problems presented when a health care business, such as a      hospital or nursing home, files for bankruptcy under chapters      7, 9 or 11.     Section 1101. Definitions       Section 1101 defines the terms ``health care business,''      ``patients,'' and ``patient records,'' which are added to      definitions section of the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. '101).     Section 1102. Disposal of patient records       Section 1102 adds a new section 351 in subchapter III of      Chapter 3 of title 11 dealing with the protection and      disposal of patient records in a health care business      bankruptcy situation.       The Trustee is required to follow certain procedures with      respect to general and specific notice to patients and      insurance companies regarding patient records, as well as the      transfer and disposal of such records. These procedures are      intended to protect the privacy and confidentiality of an      individual's medical records when they are in the custody of      a health care business that has filed for bankruptcy relief.     Section 1103. Administrative expenses claim for costs of          closing a health care business       Section 1103 amends section 503(b) of title 11, making the      actual, necessary costs and expenses of closing a health care      business, including the cost or expense of disposing of      patient records and transferring patients to another health      care facility, an allowable administrative expense.     Section 1104. Appointment of ombudsman to act as patient          advocate       Section 1104 (a) adds a new section 332 in subchapter II of      chapter 3 of title 11, providing that the court appoint an      ombudsman to act as an advocate for patients of health care      facilities that have filed for bankruptcy. The ombudsman will      monitor the quality of patient care and report to the court      every 60 days regarding the quality of that care. If the      ombudsman determines that patient care is declining      significantly or is otherwise materially compromised, he/she      is to immediately notify the court by motion or written      report, with notice to appropriate parties in interest. The      ombudsman is to treat any information obtained regarding      patients as confidential information. The ombudsman may not      review confidential patient records, without the prior      approval of the court and under restrictions protecting their      confidentiality. Section 1104(b) provides for compensation of      an ombudsman under section 330(a)(1) of title 11.     Section 1105. Debtor in possession; duty of trustee to          transfer patients       Section 1105 amends section 704(a) of title 11, stating      that the trustee is to use all reasonable and best efforts to      transfer patients from a health care facility being closed to      another nearby and comparable health care facility, which      maintains a reasonable quality of care.     Section 1106. Exclusion from program participation not          subject to automatic stay       This section permits the Secretary of Health and Human      Services to exclude the debtor from participation in the      medicare program or other Federal healthcare program without      violating the automatic stay.                    Title XII--Technical Amendments     Section 1201. Definitions       This section makes technical corrections to the definitions      of the Bankruptcy Code, alters the definitions for ``single      asset real estate'' and ``transfer'', and renumbers the      definitions.     Sections 1202--1212. Miscellaneous technical corrections       These provisions make technical changes to the Bankruptcy      Code provisions on adjustment of dollar amounts, extensions      of time, dismissal, bankruptcy petition preparers,      compensation of professionals, conversion, administrative      expenses, discharge, discriminatory treatment, and property      of the estate provisions.     Section 1213. Preferences       This provision overrules Levit v. Ingersoll Rand Financial      Corp. (In re V.N. Deprizio Const. Co.), 874 F.2d 1186 (7th      Cir. 1989). If a transfer is avoided because it was made      during the period 90 days-1 year before bankruptcy to a non-     insider creditor for the benefit of an insider, the transfer      is avoided only with respect to the insider. It is not      avoided with respect to the non-insider creditor, and      neither the transferred property nor its value may be      recovered from the non-insider creditor.     Sections 1214-1217. Miscellaneous technical corrections       These sections make technical changes to the Bankruptcy      Code provisions on postpetition transactions, property of the      estate, municipal bankruptcy and railroad line abandonments.     Section 1219. Discharge under chapter 12       Section 1219 amends section 1228 (which deals with      discharge under chapter 12) of the Bankruptcy Code to correct      erroneous references.     Section 1220. Bankruptcy cases and proceedings       Section 1220 of the of the Act amends section 1334(d) of      title 28 of the United States Code to correct erroneous      references.     Section 1221. Knowing disregard of bankruptcy law or rule       This section amends section 156(a) of title 18 of the      United States Code, which defined ``bankruptcy petition      preparer'' and ``document for filing,'' by making stylistic      changes and by making a correct reference to title 11 of the      United States Code.     Section 1222. Transfers made by nonprofit charitable          corporations       Section 1222 amends section 363(d) of the Bankruptcy Code      to restrict the right of a trustee to use, sell, or lease      property owned by a nonprofit corporation or trust. First,      the use, sale or lease must be in accordance with applicable      nonbankruptcy law and must not be inconsistent with any      relief granted under certain specified provisions of section      362 of the Bankruptcy Code concerning the applicability of      the automatic stay. Second, the section imposes similar      restrictions with regard to chapter 11 plan confirmation      requirements. Third, it amends section 541 of the Bankruptcy      Code to provide that any property of a bankruptcy estate,      where the debtor is a nonprofit corporation (as described in      section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code) may be      transferred to an entity that is not such a corporation, but      only under the same conditions that would apply if the debtor      was not in bankruptcy. The amendments made by this section      apply to cases pending on the date of enactment of this Act.      A limited exception pertains with respect to confirmation of      a chapter 11 plan.     Section 1223. Protection of valid purchase money security          interests       Section 1223 amends section 547(c)(3)(B) of the Bankruptcy      Code extending the applicable perfection period for a      security interest in property acquired by the debtor from 20      days to 30 days after the debtor receives possession of the      property.     Section 1224. Extensions       Section 302(d)(3) of the Bankruptcy, Judges, U.S. Trustees,      and Family Farmer Bankruptcy Act of 1986 is amended by      striking out all references to ``or October 1, 2002,      whichever occurs first'' and ``October 1, 2003, or'' and      ``whichever occurs first''. These changes permanently extend      the bankruptcy administrator program in Alabama and North      Carolina.     Section 1225. Bankruptcy judgeships       This section may be cited as the ``Bankruptcy Judgeship Act      of 2000.'' It authorizes the appointment of additional      temporary bankruptcy judgeships in the districts that follow:       (A) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the eastern      district of California.       (B) Four additional bankruptcy judgeships for the central      district of California.       (C) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the district of      Delaware.       (D) Two additional bankruptcy judgeships for the southern      district of Florida.       (E) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the southern      district of Georgia.       (F) Two additional bankruptcy judgeships for the district      of Maryland.       (G) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the eastern      district of Michigan.       (H) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the southern      district of Mississippi.       (I) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the district of      New Jersey.       (J) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the eastern      district of New York.       (K) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the northern      district of New York.       (L) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the southern      district of New York.       (M) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the eastern      district of North Carolina.       (N) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the eastern      district of Pennsylvania.       (O) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the middle      district of Pennsylvania.       (P) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the district of      Puerto Rico.       (Q) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the western      district of Tennessee.       (R) One additional bankruptcy judgeship for the eastern      district of Virginia.       The section provides that judgeship vacancies in the above      districts resulting from death, retirement, resignation, or      removal of a bankruptcy judge which occur 5 years or more      after the appointment date shall not be filled.       The section also adds that temporary bankruptcy judgeships      authorized for the northern district of Alabama, the district      of Delaware, the district of Puerto Rico, the district of      South Carolina, and the eastern district of Tennessee under      the Bankruptcy Judgeship Act pf 1992 are extended until the      first vacancy resulting from the death, retirement,      resignation, or removal occurs:       (A) 8 years or more after November 8, 1993, in the northern      district of Alabama.       (B) 10 years or more after October 28, 1993, in the      district of Delaware.       (C) 8 years or more after August 29, 1994, in the district      of Puerto Rico.       (D) 8 years or more after June 27, 1994, in the district of      South Carolina.       (E) 8 years or more after November 23, 1993, in the      district of Tennessee.       The section also amends section 152(a)(1) of title 28 of      the United States Code. It adds that each judge shall be      appointed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the circuit in      which such a district is located.     Section 1226. Compensating trustees       This section amends section 326 (Limitation on Compensation      of Trustee) with a new subsection (e) providing that, in a      case where a trustee in a chapter 7 case makes a motion to      dismiss or convert under section 707(b) and such motion is      granted, the court shall allow ``reasonable compensation''      under section 330(a) of title 11 for the services and      expenses of the trustee and the trustee's counsel. The      compensation covers the reasonable costs of preparing and      presenting the section 707(b) motion and any related appeals.      This section also adds a new subsection (f) to section 326      providing that, subject to the limits established in      subsection 326(a), the court shall consider the ``results      achieved'' when determining a trustee's compensation.      Finally, this section amends subsection 1326(b) dealing with      payments under a chapter 13 plan. Specifically, a new      paragraph (3) is added to subsection 1326(b) establishing a      formula limiting the amount a debtor must pay under a plan to      compensate a chapter 7 trustee or trustee's attorney who has      been awarded fees in a chapter 7 case, when that compensation      is allowed under section 326(e).     Section 1227. Amendment to section 362 of title 11, U.S. Code       Amends section 362(b)(18) to exempt from the automatic stay      a special tax or special assessment on real property (whether      or not ad valorem), imposed by a governmental unit, if such      special tax or assessment comes due after the filing of the      bankruptcy petition.     Section 1228. Judicial education       Provides that the Director of the Federal Judicial Center,      in consultation with the Director of the Executive Office of      U.S. Trustees, shall develop materials and conduct such      training as may be useful to the courts in implementing this      Act, focusing in particular on the section 707(b) means test      and reaffirmation.     Section 1229. Reclamation       Subsection (a) of this section amends section 546(c) of      title 11, to allow a seller of goods to reclaim those goods      under certain circumstances and establishing the procedures      and time limits for doing so. This provision was amended in      1994 so as to expand the ability of sellers of goods to      reclaim such goods from a trustee by extending the      reclamation demand period from 10 days to 20 days. The      amendment made by this Act extends this period to 45 days,      subject to certain limitations and requirements. Under      existing law and this amendment, the rights and powers of the      trustee under sections 544(a), 545, 547 and 549 are subject      to the right of a seller of goods that has sold goods to the      debtor in the ordinary course of the seller's business.       Specifically, under the new subsection 546(c)(1), the      seller's rights to reclaim goods which an insolvent debtor      received not later than 45 days after the commencement of the     case is not subject to certain of the trustee's avoiding      powers. However, the seller may not reclaim the goods unless      the seller makes a reclamation demand in writing: (A) not      later than 45 days of the date of receipt of such goods by      the debtor; or (B) not later than 20 days after the date of      commencement of the case, if the 45-day period expires after      commencement of the case. Subsection 546(c)(2) states that a      failure to provide notice in a manner required under      paragraph (1), does not preclude a seller from making a claim      under section 503(b)(8).       As amended, subsection 546(c) contains certain exceptions      to the seller's reclamation rights. First, such rights do not      apply to claims with respect to grain or fish covered in      subsection 546(d). Second, another exception is provided for      priority claims of a governmental unit under subsection      507(c) with respect to an erroneous refund or tax credit.      Finally, reclamation claims are also made subject to the      prior rights of holders of security interests in such goods      or the proceeds of the sale of such goods.       Subsection (b) of this section, amends section 503(b) of      title 11 to add a new paragraph (8) which provides for an      administrative expense allowance for the value of goods      received by the debtor not later than 20 days after filing,      if the goods were sold to the debtor in the ordinary course      of the debtor's business.     Section 1230. Providing requested tax documents to the court       Section 315 of HR 2415 amends section 521 of the Bankruptcy      Code to insert a new subsection which requires the debtor to      provide certain tax documents. In addition, under Rule 2004      discovery, a debtor can be required to disclose tax returns      and other tax information in appropriate cases. If a debtor      fails to do so, this provision provides sanctions.       Subsection (a) withholds a discharge in a chapter 7 case      where the debtor has failed to provide requested tax      documents to the court. Similarly, subsection (b) provides      that the court shall not confirm a reorganization plan under      chapter 11 or chapter 13 unless and until requested tax      documents have been filed with the court. For these purposes,      failure to provide a tax return to the trustee is considered      a refusal to provide it to the court. Subsection (c) provides      that the bankruptcy court must retain all documents submitted      in support of an individual's bankruptcy claim under chapter      7, 11 or 13 for a period of not more than 3 years after the      conclusion of the case. In the event of a pending audit or      enforcement action, the court may extend the time for      retention of the documents beyond the 3 year minimum.     Section 1231. Encouraging creditworthiness       Subsection (a) expresses that it is the sense of Congress      that: (1) some lenders may offer credit to consumers, without      taking all the steps necessary to ensure that consumers have      the capacity to repay the resulting debts; and (2) the      availability of credit may be a factor contributing to      consumer insolvency. Subsection (b) authorizes the Federal      Reserve Board to conduct a study of credit industry practices      with respect to soliciting and extending credit. Subsection      (c) provides that, not later than 12 months after the date of      enactment of this Act, the Board shall make public a report      on the findings of its study of the credit industry. The      Board may then issue regulations that would require      additional disclosures to consumers and take any other      action, consistent with its statutory authority, to encourage      responsible lending practices and greater personal      responsibility on the part of consumers.     Section 1232. Property no longer subject to redemption       This section amends section 541(b) of the Bankruptcy Code      to clarify that pawned, tangible personal property (other      than securities or written or printed evidence of      indebtedness or title) cannot be treated as property of the      bankruptcy estate once the statutory redemption period has      run and the pawned goods have not been redeemed. Thus, pawned      personal property is not part of a debtor's bankruptcy      estate, after the time under the contract for redeeming the      property has expired. This codifies what most courts have      held, and will relieve the courts from the burden of having      to repeatedly rule on whether pawn transactions are subject      to the automatic stay.     Section 1233. Trustees       This section amends 28 U.S.C. 586(d) to allow private      trustees, appointed to a panel under subsection 586(a)(1) or      appointed under subsection 586(b), to obtain judicial review      when they are terminated or cease to be assigned cases.      Judicial review shall be available in the United States      district court for the district for which the panel to which      the trustee was appointed under subsection 586(a)(1) serves,      or the district where a trustee appointed under subsection      586(a) resides. The trustee must first exhaust all      administrative remedies which, if the trustee elects, shall      include a hearing on the record. The final agency decision      will be upheld unless it is found unreasonable and without      cause based upon the administrative record before the agency.      This section also amends 28 U.S.C. 586(e) to allow an      individual appointed under subsection 586(b) to seek judicial      review of a final agency decision to deny a claim for actual,      necessary expenses. Before seeking judicial review, the      individual must exhaust all available administrative remedies      and the final agency decision will be upheld unless it is      unreasonable and without cause based on the administrative      record.     Section 1234. Bankruptcy forms       This section amends 28 U.S.C. 2075 (Bankruptcy rules) by      adding at the end a requirement that a form be prescribed for      the statement required under section 707(b)(2)(C) of title 11      concerning the debtor's current monthly income and the      calculations that determine whether a presumption of abuse      arises under section 707(b)(2)(A)(i). The form may provide      general rules on the content of the statement.     Section 1235. Expedited appeals of bankruptcy cases to courts          of appeals       Subsection (a) of this section strikes the existing      language contained in subsection 158(d) of title 28, United      States Code, and replaces it with language establishing an      expedited appeals process for judgments, decisions, orders,      or decrees issued by bankruptcy judges. Specifically, it      provides that where an appeal of a judgment, decision, order,      or decree of a bankruptcy judge is filed with the district      court, that judgment, decision, order, or decree shall be      deemed to be a judgment, decision, order, or decree of      (``entered by'') the district court 31 days after the appeal      is filed with the district court. This result will occur      unless, not later than 30 days after such an appeal is filed      with the district court, the district court: (1) files its      own decision on the appeal; (2) enters an order extending the      30-day period for cause upon a motion of a party or on its      own motion; or (3) all parties to the appeal file a written      consent that the district court may retain the appeal. An      appeal is to be considered filed with the district court on      the date the notice of appeal is filed, or on the date a      party makes an election under 28 U.S.C. 158(c)(1)(B).       This section also adds a new subsection (e) to 28 U.S.C.      158, providing that the courts of appeals have jurisdiction      over appeals from all final judgments, decisions, orders, and      decrees of district courts under subsection 158(a) and of      bankruptcy appellate panels under subsection 158(b). In      addition, the courts of appeals are granted jurisdiction over      appeals from all judgments, decisions, orders, and decrees of      the district courts entered under the new subsection 158(d),      to the extent such judgment, decision, order, and decree      would be reviewable by the district court under subsection      158(a). An appeal from a district court or a bankruptcy      appellate panel shall be taken in the same manner as civil      appeals are generally taken to the courts of appeals from the      district courts as provided in Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of      Appellate Procedure. The court of appeals, in its discretion,      may exercise jurisdiction over an appeal from an      interlocutory judgment, decision, order, or decree to the      extent provided in paragraph (3) of subsection (e).       Subsection (b) of section 1237 of this Act, merely makes      conforming changes substituting ``section 158(e)'' for      ``section 158(d)'' in three sections of the Code.     Section 1236. Exemptions       This section corrects a cross reference.      Title XIII--Methamphetamine and Other Controlled Substances       This title increases the controls on the manufacture and      sale of certain illegal drugs.                 Title XIV--Consumer Credit Disclosure     Section 1401. Enhanced disclosures under an open-ended credit          plan       This section would amend section 127(b) of the Truth in      Lending Act (``TILA'') to require new minimum payment      disclosures on monthly billing statements sent to      cardholders. Under this section, the front page of each      monthly billing statement must include a new minimum payment      disclosure. The contents of the disclosure will vary      depending upon the level of minimum payments required under      the applicable credit plan and whether the creditor is      subject to enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission      (``FTC''). It is intended that the Federal Reserve Board      (``FRB'') will implement the new disclosures in a manner that      will enable creditors to preprint the disclosures on the      billing statements they send to cardholders.       Disclosures by federally regulated financial institutions.      Financial institutions that are subject to enforcement under      TILA by a federal agency other than the FTC must provide a      minimum payment warning that will vary depending upon whether      the institution's credit plan typically requires a minimum      payment that is 4% or less, or more than 4%, of the      outstanding balance. If the institution's credit plan      requires minimum payments that are 4% or less of the      outstanding balance, the institution will include the      following on the front of the monthly billing statement.       ``Minimum Payment Warning: Making only the minimum payment      will increase the interest you pay and the time it takes to      repay your balance. For example, making only the typical 2%      minimum monthly payment on a balance of $1,000 at an interest      rate of 17% would take 88 months to repay the balance in      full. For an estimate of the time it would take to repay your      balance, making only minimum payments, call this toll-free      number ______.'':       If the financial institution requires a minimum payment of      more than 4% of the outstanding balance, the institution      would make the same minimum payment disclosure with a      different repayment example. Specifically, in such cases, the      institution would indicate that ``[m]aking a typical 5%      minimum monthly payment on a balance of $300 at an interest      rate of 17% would take 24 months to repay the balance in      full.'' However, such an institution may elect to use     the example applicable to plans requiring minimum payments of      4% or less if it chooses to do so.       Federally regulated financial institutions also would be      required to include in the disclosure a toll-free telephone      number that the institution's open-end credit accountholders      may use to obtain information to be published by the FRB      estimating how long it could take to repay a similar      outstanding balance. The toll-free telephone number may be      operated individually by the institution, jointly with other      creditors, or by a third party. The toll-free number may      connect accountholders to an automated device that enables      accountholders to obtain information through use of a touch-     tone telephone or similar device, so long as accountholders      without a touch-tone telephone or similar device are provided      an opportunity to speak to an individual. The FRB is charged      with developing charts or tables showing how long it could      take to repay various balances, assuming the limited number      of repayment assumptions specified in the bill. It is      intended that the FRB, in preparing the charts or tables,      will use the same methodology as that used in calculating the      88-month and 24-month repayment periods set forth in the      disclosures in new paragraphs (11) (A), (B) and (C) of TILA      section 127(b). The FRB charts or tables would be used for      responding to accountholders who call the toll-free telephone      number.       A special rule is established for depository institutions      with total assets not exceeding $250 million. Under this      special rule, such depository institutions are not required      to comply with the toll-free number provision described      above. Instead, such depository institutions are required to      furnish a toll-free number which the FRB shall establish and      maintain itself, or have established and maintained by a      third party, for a period not to exceed 24 months following      the effective date of this Act. Once the FRB (or third party)      no longer maintains the toll-free telephone number,      depository institutions with total assets not exceeding $250      million shall continue to be required to furnish a toll-free      telephone number under this Act.       Disclosures for creditors subject to FTC enforcement under      TILA. Creditors subject to FTC enforcement under TILA would      be required to include the same minimum payment disclosure as      financial institutions who require minimum payments in excess      of 4% of the outstanding balance. However, instead of      including a toll-free telephone number operated by the      creditor (or third party), those subject to FTC enforcement      under TILA would include a toll-free telephone number through      which accountholders could contact the FTC for an estimate of      the time it would take to repay the accountholder's      outstanding balance. In responding to accountholder calls      made to the toll-free number, the FTC will use the same      repayment charts or tables developed by the FRB.       Additional flexibility. In order to provide added      flexibility in making the new disclosures, new paragraph      (11)(D) allows a creditor to use its own repayment example      rather than those specified in subparagraphs (A), (B) or (C)      provided that the creditor's example is based on an interest      rate greater than 17%.       Exemptions from new disclosure requirements. The new      section 127(b)(11) does not apply to charge card accounts      provided that the primary purpose of such accounts is to      require payment of charges in full each month.       Disclosures for creditors providing actual number of months      to repay balance. Under new section 127(b)(11)(J), a creditor      is not subject to new sections 127(b) (11)(A) or (B) if the      creditor maintains a toll-free number which provides open-end      credit accountholders with the actual number of months that      it will take to repay the accountholder's outstanding      balance. In order to qualify for the exemption in      subparagraph (J), the creditor would simply include the      following statement on each billing statement as provided in      new subparagraph (K) (as included in section 1234 of this      Act):       ``Making only the minimum payment will increase the      interest you pay and the time it takes to repay your balance.      For more information, call this toll-free number: ______.''       The toll-free number may be operated individually by the      institution, jointly with other creditors or by a third      party. It is intended that the toll-free number may connect      accountholders to an automated device that enables them to      obtain information through the use of a touch-tone telephone      or similar device, so long as accountholders without a touch-     tone telephone or similar device are provided the opportunity      to speak with an individual.       FRB study. In addition, the FRB has the authority to      conduct a study, if it chooses to do so, to determine the      types of information available to potential borrowers      regarding factors of notifying potential borrowers for      credit, repayment requirements, and the consequences of      default.       Effective date. New section 127(b)(11) of TILA and any      regulations promulgated by the FRB to implement section      127(b)(11) will not take effect until the later of: (A) 18      months after the date of enactment of this Act; or (B) 12      months after the publication of final regulations by the FRB.     Section 1402. Enhanced disclosure for credit extension          secured by a dwelling       This section adds a new disclosure that must be made by      creditors who make either open-end or closed-end loans to      consumers if those loans are secured by the consumer's      principal dwelling. This section provides that, in connection      with credit applications and credit advertisements for such      loans, the creditor must disclose to the consumer that if the      loan exceeds the fair market value of the dwelling, the      interest on the portion of the credit that exceeds the fair      market value is not tax deductible for federal income tax      purposes and that the consumer may want to consult a tax      advisor for further information regarding the deductibility      of interest and charges. This section and any regulations      issued by the FRB to implement this section will not take      effect until the later of: (A) 12 months after the date of      enactment of the Act; or (B) 12 months after publication of      the final regulations by the FRB.     Section 1403. Disclosure related to ``introductory rates''       This section mandates new disclosures regarding      introductory rates on open-end credit card accounts if those      rates will be in effect for less than 1 year (``temporary      rates''). This section provides that an application or      solicitation to open a credit card account which is described      in section 127(c)(1) of TILA must comply with the following      requirements if the account offers a temporary rate:       1. Each time the temporary rate appears in the written      materials, the term ``introductory'' must appear clearly and      conspicuously in immediate proximity to the rate itself.       2. If the rate that will apply after the temporary rate      expires will be a fixed rate, the creditor must disclose the      time period in which the introductory period will expire and      the annual percentage rate that will apply after the end of      the introductory period. This disclosure must be made clearly      and conspicuously in a prominent location closely proximate      to the first listing of the temporary rate. This disclosure      does not apply to any listing of a temporary rate on an      envelope or other enclosure in which an application or      solicitation is mailed.       3. If the annual percentage rate that will apply after the      expiration of the temporary rate will be a variable rate, the      creditor must disclose the time period in which the      introductory period will expire and an annual percentage rate      that was in effect within 60 days before the date of mailing      the application or solicitation. Like the fixed-rate      disclosure, this disclosure must be made clearly and      conspicuously in a prominent location closely proximate to      the first listing of the temporary rate. This disclosure does      not apply to any listing of a temporary rate on an envelope      or other enclosure in which an application or solicitation is      mailed.       4. If the temporary rate can be revoked for reasons other      than the expiration of the introductory period, the creditor      must clearly and conspicuously disclose on or with the      application or solicitation a general description of the      circumstances that may result in the revocation of the      temporary rate and either the fixed rate that would apply      upon the revocation of the temporary rate, or in the case of      a variable rate program, the rate that was in effect within      60 days before the date of mailing the application or      solicitation.       Effective date. This section and any regulations      promulgated by the FRB to implement this section will not      take effect until the later of: (A) 12 months after the date      of enactment of this Act; or (B) 12 months after the      publication of final regulations by the FRB.     Section. 1404. Internet-based credit card solicitations       This section requires that the existing TILA credit card      application and solicitation disclosures must be made in      connection with a solicitation to open a credit card account      via the Internet. It also requires that the new introductory      rate disclosures required under section 1603 of this Act must      be made in connection with Internet solicitations, as      applicable. All disclosures required under this section must      be made in a clear and conspicuous manner. The disclosures      must be readily accessible to consumers in close proximity to      the solicitation to open a credit card account, and updated      regularly to reflect the current policies, terms, and fee      amounts applicable to the credit card account. It is intended      that the disclosures can be made by allowing a consumer to      use a ``link'' or similar method to view the disclosures.      This section and any regulations promulgated by the FRB to      implement this section will not take effect until the later      of: (A) 12 months after the date of enactment of this Act; or      (B) 12 months after the publication of final regulations by      the FRB.     Section 1405. disclosures related to late payment deadlines          and penalties       This section requires that each monthly billing statement      sent to credit cardholders and other open-end credit      borrowers must include a new disclosure if a late payment fee      will be imposed on the borrower for failing to make the      minimum payment by the payment due date. In such cases, the      monthly billing statement must clearly and conspicuously      state the date that the payment is due or, if the card issuer      contractually establishes a different date, the earliest date      on which (or time period in which) a late payment fee may be      charged and the amount of the late payment fee to be imposed      if payment is made after that date (or time period). This      section and any regulations promulgated by the FRB to      implement this section will not take effect until the later      of: (A) 12 months after the date of enactment of this Act; or      (B) 12 months after the publication of final regulations by      the FRB.     Section 1406. Prohibition on certain actions for failure to          incur finance changes       This section prohibits a creditor under an open-end      consumer credit plan from terminating an account of a      consumer prior to its expiration date (e.g., expiration of      the card in the case of a credit card account) solely because      the consumer has not incurred finance charges on the account.      This provision makes it clear, however, that the creditor may      terminate the account if it is inactive for three or more      consecutive months. New section 127(h) of TILA and any      regulations promulgated by the FRB to implement new section      127(h) will not take effect until the later of: (a) 12 months      after the date of enactment of this Act; or (b) 12 months      after the publication of final regulations by the FRB.     Section 1407. Dual use debit card       This section permits the FRB to conduct a study of existing      consumer protections, including voluntary industry rules,      that limit the liability for consumers when a consumer's ATM      card or debit card is used to access the consumer's asset      account without the consumer's authorization.     Section. 1408. Study of bankruptcy impact of credit extended          to dependent students       This section directs the FRB to conduct a study regarding      the impact that the extension of credit to certain students      has on the rate of bankruptcy. Specifically, the study must      examine the bankruptcy impact of extending credit to      consumers who are claimed as a dependent by their parents or      others for federal tax purposes and who are enrolled within 1      year of successfully completing all required secondary      education requirements on a full-time basis in post-secondary      educational institutions. The results of the study must be      reported to Congress within 1 year after the date of      enactment of the Act.     Section 1409. Clarification of clear and conspicuous       This section directs the Board, in consultation with other      federal banking agencies, the National Credit Union      Administration and the FTC, to promulgate regulations,      including examples of model disclosures, to provide guidance      regarding the meaning of ``clear and conspicuous'' as used in      sections 127(b)(11)(A), (B) and (C) and 127(c)(6)(A)(ii) and      (iii) of TILA as added by this Act.      Title XV--General Effective Date; Application of Amendments     Section 1501. Effective date; application of amendments.       The amendments made by the Act take effect 180 days after      the date of enactment, except as provided elsewhere in the      Act. These amendments apply only with respect to cases      commenced after the effective date.
