Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I congratulate Mr. Polis and Congressman Kildee, who is detained at the White House, for offering this amendment.  I appreciate that the majority has accepted it. This will be a temporary provision until such a time as the final rule is adopted. There was never, I don't think, intent to have this sort of a blanket ban on snowmobiles, and this would correct that error by the Forest Service as they go through a deliberative process on where, when, and how snowmobiles will access Federal forest lands on a unit-by-unit basis.
