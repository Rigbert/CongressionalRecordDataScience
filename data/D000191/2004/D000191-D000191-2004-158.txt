Speaker, I am pleased to recognize two important philanthropists who in their generosity to the University of Oregon are making a difference.  Robert and Beverly Lewis attended the University of Oregon in the 1940s. They deserve special recognition for their contributions to cognitive neuroscience. Robert and Beverly Lewis donated $10 million to the University of Oregon for its Brain, Biology and Machine Initiative and in doing so provided the philanthropic version of venture capital to grow this project into a world class center. I take a special interest in the Brain, Biology, and Machine Initiative, a research effort that brings together the university's top scientists in molecular biology, cognitive neuroscience, genomics, optics, and computational science to study how genetic factors affect brain development at the Robert and Beverly Lewis Center for Neuroimaging. It is a project that combines robust competitive federal grants, state support, private philanthropy, and congressional interest funds. It is already yielding compelling research and significant breakthroughs in our understanding of the mind and brain.  Thank you Bob and Beverly Lewis for your commitment to the University of Oregon. You are truly transforming lives.                          ____________________
