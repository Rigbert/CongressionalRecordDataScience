 I will not restate what I said earlier. But it was my hope, following the advice of the senior Senator from Texas, and our expert on this issue, that we would simply take up and pass those portions of the bill that seemed to be noncontroversial.  The proposal of the Senator from West Virginia puts the controversial measure back before us, upon which we will have the cloture vote shortly. Therefore, I object.
