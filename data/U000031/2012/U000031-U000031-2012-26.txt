 I would just note that the projects contemplated under title XVII aren't your usual run-of-the-mill, brick and mortar construction projects. Usually, they are advanced energy projects that require highly specialized equipment, complex components, and they aren't always available domestically. Extending the wind tax credit will be, in fact, part of the larger debate that the House will have as we look at all of the expiring tax provisions, and I certainly look for Mr. Markey's support as we look to extend all of those later on, particularly for his good folks in the State of Massachusetts.  This has been a very long and extensive investigation, and I will tell you that Cliff Stearns, the chairman of our Oversight Subcommittee, has done a very good job as we have tried to get to the very bottom of this mess. It is our job--that of every one of us here--to look wherever we can to find fraud and abuse and mismanagement in any Federal program, to identify it, and then come back and fix it so that it cannot happen again. No more Solyndras. That's what this bill does. It is a credit to the investigatory team and to Mr. Stearns' leadership. We need to defeat this motion to recommit and pass the bill.  I yield back the balance of my time.
