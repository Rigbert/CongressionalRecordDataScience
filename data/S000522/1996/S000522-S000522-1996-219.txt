Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing a resolution that takes up the difficult, complex, and challenging issue of property claims arising from Fascist and Communist era confiscations. Joining me as original cosponsors are Representatives Porter, Wolf, Funderburk, Salmon, Hoyer, Markey, and Cardin and we welcome others who would want to cosponsor the measure. The resolution brings focus to points long raised by Americans who have unresolved property claims and particular issues which were the subject of a hearing on property claims in Central and Eastern Europe held in July by the Helsinki Commission, which I chair.  In convening that hearing, Mr. Speaker, the Helsinki Commission sought to address two specific questions. First, as Central and East European countries privatize and, in some cases, make restitution of, or compensation for, property that had been wrongly confiscated in the past, are the interests of American citizens being adequated protected?  Second, we sought to examine the situation of Holocaust survivors in Central and Eastern Europe. While survivors in the West and in Israel were, in general, able to receive some compensation--primarily from Germany--at the end of World War II, survivors in the East found themselves twice victimized: first by the Nazis, and then by Communist regimes which prevented them from pursuing compensation claims and often prevented them from regaining lands expropriated by the Nazis. Our second question, therefore, was this: Can compensation now be made available to these survivors--in time to help them live their remaining days in dignity?  The Commission received expert testimony from two individuals who lead our Government's efforts in this area: Stuart E. Eizenstat, Undersecretary of Commerce and Special Envoy for Property Claims in Central and Eastern Europe, and Delissa A. Ridgway, Chair of the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission.  Mr. Speaker, our witnesses' testimony, augmented by significant information provided by nongovernmental sources, provided clear answers to our questions. While some progress has been made in every country in Central and East Europe, more progress is needed. Our resolution seeks to send that message to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and, in particular, calls for the urgent return of property formerly belonging to Jewish communities as a means of redressing the especially compelling problems of aging and often destitute survivors of the Holocaust.  Also, in some countries, the rights of Americans are clearly not being adequately protected. I understand, of course, that property restitution or compensation is a very complex subject, and I commend those countries that have sought to address it and sought to correct the past wrongs of Fascist and Communist regimes. But those efforts will fall far short of their mark if they perpetuate a new form of discrimination--discrimination against individuals who dared flee communism and sought refuge here in the United States. Accordingly, this resolution calls for countries to remove from their books restrictions which require claimants seeking compensation or restitution to have the citizenship of, or residency in, the country from which they seek compensation or restitution.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, this resolution would be incomplete if it did not also address the related problem of those financial institutions, notably Swiss banks, which are known to have converted for their own use, financial assets rightly belonging to Holocaust victims. The measure I introduce today calls on such financial institutions to restore this property to it rightful owners. A resolution of this inexcusable wrong is long overdue.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.                          ____________________
