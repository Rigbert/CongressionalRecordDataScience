Speaker, tonight I want to talk about another company in our country and more bad news for America's workers as a result of NAFTA, the $20 billion trade loser. This time the damage comes from Topeka, KS, where workers at the Flexel cellophane plant are being forced to take another pay cut, this time for 11 percent. This was reported in the August 31 issue of the Capital-Journal, which is their local newspaper. That means for a worker in that company making $8.50 an hour they will now have their pay cut to close to $8 an hour, and all this has happened after a wage freeze at that company that has been in effect since 1991. In fact, workers at Flexel have seen their wages drop from $13 an hour 5 years ago now to the current proposal to ratchet them down even more, to $8 an hours.  What has been happening to cause this ratcheting down of U.S. worker wages? Mexican-based cellophane manufacturing plants have been increasing their penetration of the United States market to nearly one-fifth, or 20 percent, of our marketplace, up from only 3 percent 4 years ago. Our workers are being forced again to compete against multinational companies that can set up shop anywhere on the globe in order to seek the lowest wages possible along with no environmental enforcement. In Mexico workers at those relocated cellophane plants earn about 50 cents an hour, and that is where America's wages are headed, my friends, and did you notice that the price of cellophane has not dropped in our grocery stores? You can figure out who is making the money off workers on both sides of the United States-Mexican border.  It is time to cancel NAFTA, go back to the drawing boards and reshape it, and stand up for the hard-working families of our continent who all are being taken to the cleaners, and, if I might quote from a retiree from that particular plant in Kansas, he tells us a little bit about what the story is in that community. He said originally du Pont company built what was then called the Tecumseh cellophane plant and brought it on line in 1958, and back in those years that was the fifth plant in the United States making cellophane.  Mr. Speaker, the news articles I will include in the Record indicate that there are only two left in this country.  This worker went to work for that company in 1964 and retired in 1985. He says when he retired from the plant it was the last plant operating for du Pont in the United States making cellophane. About 1 year later it was sold to this owner, Flexel, out of Atlanta, GA, and when he left the company back in 1985, he was making just over $12 an hour. Mr. Speaker, he wrote me because he was shocked to find 10 years later the workers in that plant were making so much less. He said:       Ms. Kaptur, the imports from Mexico have had an impact on      this plant and its workers, and I'm concerned because I still      have a lot of my friends working there. Unfortunately all      those workers in the United States and the low-paid workers      in Mexico will gain no fairness, they will gain no equity,      because there is nothing in the trade agreement that tries to      compensate for the difference in living standards, political      standards, and environmental standards between these two      adjacent nations.  So, Mr. Speaker, this evening I will be submitting into the Record the entire story of what has happened in Topeka, KS, one community in our country that understands well the impact of footloose multinational corporations and what happens when the Government in Washington falls asleep and fails to protect the workers of this continent.  [The articles referred to are as follows:]               [From the Capital-Journal, Aug. 31, 1995]            Pay Cut of 11 Percent Goes Into Effect on Monday                          (By Morgan Chilson)       An 11 percent pay cut will begin Monday at the Flexel plant      in Tecumseh, company officials told employees Wednesday.       Pay cuts are part of a company-wide plan to reduce costs      because of increased global competition and declining demand      for cellophone, said Gerry Broz, site manager at the plant.       Broz also stated adamantly Wednesday that reports from      employees that company officials walked out on negotiations      with Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union, or      UNITE, last week were ``completely inaccurate.''       ``After almost 10 months of good-faith bargaining and      agreement on most issues, the company submitted a final      proposal last Thursday calling for an 11 percent pay cut and      work-rule changes that would lead to additional cost      savings,'' Broz said.       Broz told employees in meetings Wednesday that Flexel and      the union deadlocked over the issue of wage concessions.       Flexel officials opened financial information to a union      auditor in the spring so employees would understand the      economic difficulties facing the company, Broz said. Despite      that, employees continued to ask for a five to 10 percent      wage increase, he said.       Broz didn't elaborate on what the additional money saving      measures were, but employees highlighted the loss of premium      pay or Sunday time-and-a half pay.       The cuts change several regulations, such as what happens      when an employee goes home from work sick, according to      Randal Carnegie, an employee at Flexel who attended a morning      meeting Wednesday.       ``On the original program, if you get sick and if you work      over two hours and you go home after that two hours, you get      eight hours pay,'' Carnegie said. ``They've done away with      that.''       Carnegie said the company also will no longer pay for      annual physicals for employees. That expense will be out-of-     pocket for the portion insurance doesn't cover, he said.       For employees on full-time disability, the company will not      begin payment of disability pay until after four days and      then only with a doctor's excuse, Carnegie added. Disability      pay did start the first day off work, he said.       Carnegie, who has been working at Flexel for one year,      makes $8.50 an hour at the plant. His hourly wage will drop      to $8.04 an hour under the new cuts.       A source familiar with the negotiating process who spoke on      the condition of anonymity said the average base wage at the      plant has decreased since 1993 to $12.78 per hour. An 11      percent decrease would lower that average base rate to      $11.37.       The plant employs over 240 employees, the source said. The      base wage has gone down from the 1993 average salary of      $13.66 per hour because of lower starting wages, the source      said.       Flexel Corp., based in Atlanta, owns the two remaining      cellophane plants in the United States, the one in Tecumseh      and one in Covington, Ind.       The Covington plant felt its share of cutbacks in April,      when about one-third of the plant's 345 employees were laid      off, according to reports published in the Commercial News in      Danville, Ill.       That newspaper reported 20 salaried and 80 hourly employees      were laid off.       The last time employees were laid off at the Tecumseh plant      was in 1989, when 12 salaried employees and 30 temporary      employees were laid off.       ``We don't want to cut Tecumseh wage roll jobs because we      want to keep Tecumseh production levels high,'' Broz said.      ``So we have no choice but to cut wages.''       Carnegie said many employees believe other cost-cutting      measures weren't researched. For example, he said, workers      currently are paid for lunch shifts and if that policy could      be dropped, it would save the company 2.5 hours per week per      person.       Broz said it is untrue that other cost-cutting measures      haven't been considered.                                                                    ____                      Flexel Workers Face Pay Cut       Mandatory employee meetings today at Flexel Corp. will      determine what options are left for members of the      Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union of America      after negotiations with management came to a halt last week.       Employees of Flexel, one of two remaining cellophane      manufacturing plants in the United States, voted in October      1994 to join ACTWU and then began working with Flexel's      management to negotiate a contract. It never got that far.       Last Thursday, members of the management negotiating team      walked out of negotiations after leaving their only offer on      the table, a source familiar with the negotiations said      Tuesday on condition of anonymity.       Jerry Broze, site superintendent at the Flexel plant in      Tecumseh, said the company would comment today on labor      negotiations.       The source said Flexel's offer involved a reduction of $1.4      million, which amounted to an 11 percent pay cut for      employees. When totaled in with other aspects of the offer,      including no more premium or overtime pay      for working on Sundays, employees would be taking about a 17 percent      cut in pay and benefits, the source said.       ``They basically put this crazy offer on the table and said      it was because of their financial problems,'' said David      Martinez, who has worked at Flexel for 16 years. He began      with the company when it was owned by Du Pont. ``We came      through with a lot of suggestions of things that they could      save money on. They just basically put that offer on and      never negotiated anything in good faith.''       Workers were told the new policies would be instituted      Friday, and many think the mandatory meetings today will      announce that plan.       Martinez said employees haven't received pay raises in more      than four years, which has added to their disenchantment with      management.       Wages were frozen in December 1991 at the average salary of      $13.66 an hour, according to a report in 1993.       Martinez alleged poor corporate management was the reason      for the company's woes.       Martinez cited the purchase of a machine to make rubber      gloves that is boxed and sitting in the warehouse unused as      an example of poor decisionmaking by Flexel.       In previous years, management said the company experienced      financial difficulties because of unfair competition from      Mexico. Mexican companies export cellophane to the United      States without paying a tariff.       In 1991, Lindsey Walters, president of the Atlanta-based      Flexel Corp., said Mexican cellophane plants increased their      penetration of U.S. markets to 18 percent from 3 percent      during the previous four years.                               ____________________
