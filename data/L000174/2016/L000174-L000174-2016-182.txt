President, I am proud to be part of the bicameral and bipartisan introduction for the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crimes Reauthorization Act of 2016. There has been no stronger advocate on this bill than my friend, John Lewis, and I am proud to stand with him on this effort. In 2008, we passed this bill to strengthen the Federal Government's ability to investigate and prosecute unsolved murders from the civil rights era. The bill expires in fiscal year 2017, but it is important that we reauthorize the bill prior to its expiration so that the Department of Justice can continue its work on these unsolved cases, uninterrupted.  More than 60 years ago, Emmett Till, a 14-year-old African-American teenager, was brutally murdered, but no one was ever punished for it. His death was a pivotal--and tragic--moment in the Civil Rights era, and it continues to serve as a reminder that too many families suffer from the unsolved murders of their loved ones during the civil rights era without receiving justice. The way to best serve these families is to provide our Federal Government with the tools it needs to investigate these unsolved crimes, and to hopefully, bring some sense of closure for these families. The bill we are introducing today does just that.  Since the bill's passage in 2008, the Justice Department and others have been assisting families in their quest for justice in resolving these unsolved murders. Specifically, the Civil Rights and Restorative Justice Project of Northeastern University and the Cold Case Justice Initiative at the Syracuse University College of Law have both served as invaluable resources and guides for these families. I thank them for their work on these cases, as well as their input in improving this bill. Besides reauthorizing the bill, we have made some changes to address the issues that the families and the organizations have raised. This bill will improve coordination between the various law enforcement branches and the organizations involved; increase transparency and accountability; and continue to resolve these cases without concern of the legislation sunsetting.  I thank Congressman Lewis for his tireless work on behalf of the families of these victims of unsolved murders from the civil rights era. I also thank Senator McCaskill of Missouri, Senator Burr of North Carolina, and Senator Blunt of Missouri, who have joined us in introducing this bipartisan bill. I hope that Senators Burr and Blunt can convince the Republican Chairman to move this bill through the Judiciary Committee and Republican Leadership to give this bill a vote on the floor.  The road to justice can be long and winding, but we must continue to do our part to help these families obtain justice and closure for their losses.                            ____________________
