Speaker, I am pleased to announce today, the selection of three teens from Northwest Indiana to participate in the Voices Against Violence Teen Conference in Washington, D.C.  Megan Smith, a senior at Chesterton high school was selected along with Darlene Turner and Dawn Yerger, both seniors at Emerson School of the Performing Arts in Gary. These three teens will join over 400 youths from across the country as they work with lawmakers to develop youth violence prevention strategies.  The interest that has surrounded this conference is proof enough to me that our teenagers believe that preventing youth violence is a top priority, and want to be empowered in creating solutions to this emerging national crisis.  These three students represent the very best in our young people and I eagerly look forward to working with them during their trip to Washignton. I have the utmost confidence that these three students will represent Northwest Indiana and the First Congressional District with dignity and leadership.  Megan Smith is a senior at Chesterton High School in Chesterton. Megan ranks first in her class of 439 students. She has excelled in varsity basketball and soccer at Chesterton. Megan is also active in her church, student government, SADD, and Chesterton's academic superbowl team.  Darlene Turner is a senior at the Emerson School of the Performing Arts in Gary where she ranks in the top quarter of her class. Darlene is active in a number of extracurricular activities at school, including the academic superbowl and spellbowl teams, Christians in Action, and the National Honor Society. She is also involved in her community as a church youth leader and a member of the Gary Civic Youth Orcestra.  Dawn Yerger is also a senior at Emerson School of the Performing Arts in Gary. Dawn ranks in the top quarter of her class and is active in extracurricular activities including National Honor Society, Spanish Club, Science Club, and Christians in Action. She is also involved in The Jesus Club, the International Thespian Society, and the Delta Teen Lift Organization.  Congratulations to these three exceptional young ladies and I look forward to their trip to our Nation's Capital.                          ____________________
