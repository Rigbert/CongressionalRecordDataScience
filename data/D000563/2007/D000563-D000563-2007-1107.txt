He has been a stalwart in the effort for Darfur.  I would like to read a sentence to the Senator from Oklahoma and ask him what it means. It is a sentence from the underlying bill, which is an authorization bill. It relates to section 105. Here is what it says:       In addition to any other amounts authorized to be      appropriated for the U.S. Marshals Service, there are      authorized to be appropriated for the U.S. Marshals Service      to protect the judiciary $20 million for each of the fiscal      years 2007 through 2011.  Now I would like to ask the Senator this: If we pass this bill authorizing $20 million to be appropriated to the U.S. Marshals Service to protect judges and then do not appropriate the money for that purpose, how much money will come out of the Federal Treasury going to the U.S. Marshals pursuant to this bill?
