Now, the underlying bill, S. 11, says that the cap on noneconomic losses will be $250,000. So in that instance, is it the position of the Senator that this bill would not preempt Mississippi law; that Mississippi's number would apply even though it is larger than S. 11?  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes. This legislation does not preempt existing or future state laws on noneconomic damages.
