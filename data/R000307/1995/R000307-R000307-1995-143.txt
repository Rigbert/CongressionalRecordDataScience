Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to a very valued member of the committee, the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. LaHood].  (Mr. LaHOOD asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Chairman, I first want to congratulate the chairman of the sometimes powerful Agriculture Committee, the gentleman from Kansas [Mr. Roberts], who has done a magnificent job providing the leadership on this important bill and also to the gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Emerson] for his leadership.  I have a very limited amount of time. I have not met one Democrat or one Republican in all of this House that wants to gut or cut the School Lunch Program. I do not know of anybody who wants to gut or cut the School Lunch Program. For anyone to stand here in the House and proclaim that is just simply not true.  Our proposal will reform the School Lunch Program, will feed hungry children, will provide the nutrition necessary for hungry young people, but it will not gut or cut the program. So I [[Page H3397]] want that message to go out around the country. It is simply not true.  Our proposal will also reform the Food Stamp Program. Americans know that we have a lousy welfare system. It is fraught with abuse and fraud, and Americans want a change.  And we are going to carry out one of President Clinton's campaign promises. We are going to reform welfare as we know it, and we are going to do it by giving back to the people in local communities and States the responsibility and the financial resources to really deal with the problems. We are going to give back to them not only the responsibility but the resources to carry out these programs. Who knows better than people in local communities who the most needy are? Local people do. I ask support for this important legislation.  Mr. de la GARZA. I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to our distinguished colleague, the gentlewoman from New York [Mrs. Malony].
