 I had the privilege many years ago to get on the telephone and call Leonard Boswell. Leonard Boswell was then presiding over the State senate. He tells the story about how his executive assistant came on the floor and said, ``There's a guy named Congressman Hoyer on the phone. Shall I tell him you'll call him back?''  Fortunately, for me, President Boswell at the time said, ``No, I'll talk to him now.'' He turned the podium over to one of his colleagues, and came on the phone and talked to me.  And I said, ``Senator, this is Steny Hoyer. I would very much like you to run for Congress. We think you'd be an excellent Member of Congress, we think you'd be a great candidate for Congress, and we think you could win this seat.''  He said, ``Well, what does Mr. Gephardt think about that?''  It so happened Dick was about 4 feet from me, so I said, ``Well, let me turn this over to him, and he'll tell you what he thinks about it.''  Of course, he echoed my comments.                              {time}  1250  Now, I didn't know Leonard Boswell at the time, but I'd heard wonderful things about Leonard Boswell, not only about his skill as a legislator, but of his decency and his character as a human being; not only his experiences in war, but his service at home as a farmer, as a businessman, as a public representative and as a Senate leader in Iowa. And I want to say that nothing that has transpired over the years that he and I have served together in this body have disabused in any way the extraordinarily positive things that were told to me of Leonard Boswell and why I ought to ask him to come to the Congress of the United States.  He has been a dear and close friend of mine every day he has served. He will remain a dear and close friend of mine until he and I pass from this Earth. He is a salt-of-the-Earth human being. He is someone that the American people, if they knew personally, would say is the kind of person they wanted representing them in the Congress of the United States; or, frankly, in any other body.  Leonard Boswell, thank you. Thank you for serving our country so well, so courageously, so ably, so conscientiously with so much character and decency. You have brought a greater degree of civility and understanding to this institution. It is better for your service. Godspeed.  I thank the gentleman for yielding.
