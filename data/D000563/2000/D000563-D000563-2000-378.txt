It is an incredible suggestion. We have doors leading into the office buildings and into the Capitol that literally hundreds, if not thousands, of people pass through but where there is one security guard. Many believe there should be two at these doors that are the busiest.  Instead of enhancing the Capitol Police so they can do their job and be safe in doing it, the House Republican leadership called for cutting 400 Capitol policemen. That does not sound like good law enforcement and vigorous law enforcement. Just the opposite is true. They are suggesting, for more enforcement of the law, cutting back on the police after we had the terrible tragedy right here in the Capitol not that long ago.
