Chairman, I move to strike the last word simply to say to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), who focuses on the quality of life in our communities more than any other Member of this House and who raises a very important issue. We have also discussed this in our committee. Obviously, there is discussion between ourselves and the authorizing committees. But I want to assure the gentleman that I intend to give this very great attention.  I look forward to working with the chairman on this issue to see if we can come up with language which will encourage, maybe will not go further than that, a better performance with respect to the post office cooperation with local communities to ensure the objectives the gentleman spoke of.
