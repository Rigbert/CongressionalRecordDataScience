 There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From the National Association of Medicaid Directors, Sept. 21, 2017]                    NAMD Statement on Graham-Cassidy       The Board of Directors of the National Association of      Medicaid Directors (NAMD) urges Congress to carefully      consider the significant challenges posed by the Graham-     Cassidy legislation. State Medicaid Directors are strong      proponents of state innovation in the drive towards health      care system transformation. Our members are committed to      ensuring that the programs we operate improve health outcomes      while also being fiscally responsible to state and federal      taxpayers. In order to succeed, however, these efforts must      be undertaken in a thoughtful, deliberative, and responsible      way. We are concerned that this legislation would undermine      these efforts in many states and fail to deliver on our      collective goal of an improved health care system.       1. Graham-Cassidy would completely restructure the Medicaid      program's financing, which by itself is three percent of the      nation's Gross Domestic Product and 25 percent of the average      state budget. Like BCRA, the legislation would convert the      traditional Medicaid program into a per-capita cap financing      system. All states will be impacted by this change,      regardless of their decisions to leverage the Medicaid      expansion option under the ACA. It would also incorporate     Medicaid expansion funding and other ACA health funds into a      block grant, made available to all states. How these block      grants will be utilized, what programs they may fund, and the      overall impact they will have on state budgets, operations,      and citizens are all uncertain. Taken together, the per-     capita caps and the envisioned block grant would constitute      the largest intergovernmental transfer of financial risk from      the federal government to the states in our country's      history. While the block grant portion is intended to create      maximum flexibility, the legislation does not provide clear      and powerful statutory reforms within the underlying Medicaid      program commensurate with proposed funding reductions of the      per capita cap.       2. The Graham-Cassidy legislation would require states to      operationalize the block grant component by January 1, 2020.      The scope of this work, and the resources required to support      state planning and implementation activities, cannot be      overstated. States will need to develop overall strategies,      invest in infrastructure development, systems changes,      provider and managed care plan contracting, and perform a      host of other activities. The vast majority of states will      not be able to do so within the two-year timeframe envisioned      here, especially considering the apparent lack of federal      funding in the bill to support these critical activities.       3. Any effort of this magnitude needs thorough discussion,      examination and analysis, and should not be rushed through      without proper deliberation. The legislative proposal would      not even have a full CBO score until after its scheduled      passage, which should be the bare minimum required for      beginning consideration. With only a few legislative days      left for the entire process to conclude, there clearly is not      sufficient time for policymakers, Governors, Medicaid      Directors, or other critical stakeholders to engage in the      thoughtful deliberation necessary to ensure successful long-     term reforms.       For these reasons, we encourage Congress to revisit the      topic of comprehensive Medicaid reform when it can be      addressed with the careful consideration merited by such a      complex undertaking--as we articulated in our June 26      statement on BCRA.
