 Frank Gaylord, a Granite City resident, was a beloved member of the Barre community. Frank influenced the city and its residents, and the city in turn influenced his art. The local granite quarries of Barre provided ample materials for Frank to hone his sculpting skills.  Frank served his country not just in World War II, receiving a Bronze Star for his service, but also in creating the Korean War Veterans Memorial, his most famous work, which resides on the National Mall in Washington, DC. The memorial is visually striking; Frank captured the movement and feel of war, the 19 figures of diverse American soldiers are shrouded in ponchos and seem to walk endlessly. Frank called the day the memorial arrived on the National Mall as the highlight of his life.  Other examples of Frank's work can be seen in many New England towns, including at the Connecticut capital and in Williston and Montpelier, VT. However, what Vermont will best remember Frank by was his dedication and determination to improve Vermont's own Granite City. Frank's contributions to the Barre Granite Association, as well as to the former Barre Players, will be missed.  Frank's passing is a loss to Vermont, to the community of Barre, VT, and to the Nation. I will always remember Frank when I see his work on the National Mall and throughout Vermont, and how he so beautifully captured our country's spirit.  I ask unanimous consent that the Times Argus article ``He had an arts spirit: Famed Barre sculptor Frank Gaylord has died'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:   He Had an Arts Spirit: Famed Barre Sculptor Frank Gaylord Has Died                          (By Eric Blaisdell)       Barre.--The Granite City lost likely its most famous      modern-day resident with the death of sculptor Frank Gaylord.       Gaylord, 93, died at his daughter's home in Northfield      Wednesday night. Funeral arrangements have yet to be      announced, and are being taken care of by The Hooker and      Whitcomb Funeral Home.       Gaylord created the National Korean War Veterans Memorial      in Washington, DC. Other monuments created by Gaylord include      the Firemen's Memorial in Eugene, Oregon; the Doctor Ashbel      Smith statue in Baytown, Texas; the Policemen's Memorial in      Jacksonville, Florida; the Toledo Mud Hens Monument in      Toledo, Ohio; and the National Little League Monument in      Williamsport, Pennsylvania.       When Gaylord was growing up in Clarksburg, West Virginia,      he recalled in a Times Argus story in 2015, his grandmother      would give him plastic molds into which he would press clay      to make reliefs. That transformed into sculpting clay animals      and then he moved to carving soap, quickly learning how much      material it actually took to make a full sculpture.       As he grew up, Gaylord was initially interested in      taxidermy, which, at that time, was done by sculpting plaster      molds, with the animal skins pulled over them.       Then World War II came along, and Gaylord became a      paratrooper for two and a half years. Gaylord served with the      17th Airborne and fought in the Battle of the Bulge.       After the war, he used the G.I. Bill and ended up at the      Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh, which had both engineering      and fine arts schools. He later transferred to Temple      University's Tyler School of Art, where he focused on      becoming a carver.       In 1951, Mac Durnovich of E.J. Batchelder Co. in Barre      hired Gaylord. So he and his late wife Mary moved to Vermont.      He knew the community's reputation, its rich ethnic heritage,      and its renowned craftsmanship. He said in 2015 he knew he      could learn there.       Master sculptor Giuliano Cecchinelli, of Barre, has known      Gaylord since the 1960s. Cecchinelli said Thursday that Barre      has never had a sculptor like Gaylord.       ``He gave Barre more than Barre asked. . . . He made Barre,      Vermont,'' he said.       Cecchinelli said Gaylord was a perfectionist when it came      to his style of work, which had a more modern flair to it. He      said when he first met Gaylord he could tell right away that      Gaylord had class and that he would achieve what he wanted to      achieve.       Cecchinelli said he owns several pieces of Gaylord's work,      which he keeps in his home.       Sue Higby, executive director of Studio Place Arts in      downtown Barre, has known Gaylord for 15 years. Higby      highlighted his work at her studio in 2015.       ``I'm truly very sorry to hear of his passing and his      integrity as an artist will live on in Barre for years to      come,'' she said.       Higby said Gaylord was a cultural intellectual who loved      theater, dance and the human form. She also said Gaylord,      more than most artists, had the ability to capture in his      work the feeling of a ballet dancer's movement or the      fluttering of a piece of fabric.       Jerry Williams owns and operates Barre Sculpture Studios.      Williams has known Gaylord since the 1980s and at one point      he owned the studio next to Gaylord's.       ``Frank was a mentor to many sculptors, some of them still      operating in town. Some of them have moved on and done other     things. But he was a real valuable part of the sculpture      community in this town. Not just monumental, but the art of      what we're doing,'' he said.       Williams said he will remember Gaylord as someone with a      dry wit who knew how to put things in perspective, such as      how sculptors fit into the art scene. He said because Gaylord      went to art school, he approached sculpting from a different      perspective than those who learned by working in a granite      shed.       ``When I met him I kind of wanted to emulate that part of      him that wasn't ground down by an industry. He still had an      arts spirit,'' Williams said.                          ____________________
