 I want to see the notice. And it was 4:58 the day before.  That is the problem. I do not know exactly how all the counsels work, but I can tell the Senator that on our side time is important. Giving a little bit of time, I think, could go a very long way to solving the problem we are in, officially. so there are no excuses then. The official notice goes out. Who is on the calendar occurs a substantial period before the hearing so we have time to do what we need to do, particularly when I think there were seven judges on this particular calendar, three of them appellate judges, meaning it is a very big and heavy calendar on which to do your work.
