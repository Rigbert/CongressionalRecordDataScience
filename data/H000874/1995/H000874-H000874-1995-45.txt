Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York, my good friend Mr. Flake, for yielding me this time.  I rise in very strong support of this legislation. I rise for a reason in addition to that. The American public is angry with us today, as well, in my opinion, they ought to be.                              {time}  1145  The American public sees, on a very regular basis, the confrontation between Members on this floor and on the Senate floor and between the Congress and the President. They conclude, all too often, that all we do here is fight with one another; that we cannot, as adults, as reasonable, rational representatives of our various constituencies, come together and do things that make sense.   Mr. Speaker, I rise, therefore, to not only note that this legislation is important legislation that will not only commemorate, but will assist the work of one of the great institutions in this country, the Smithsonian Institution. My friend, who is in charge of funding the Smithsonian Institution, in exile, I should say, he and the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Regula] are in charge. The fact of the matter is that it is one of the great institutions of the world, as the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Yates] so well observes.  I want to, therefore, rise and congratulate and express appreciation to one of the very decent and able Members of this House, the gentleman from Delaware [Mr. Castle], the former Governor of the State of Delaware. The gentleman, frankly, is the kind of representative every American wants to have. A thoughtful, hard-working, conscientious, honest individual. Not only in addressing this issue, which is a relatively minor issue, but some of the great issues that confront this House.  The gentleman from Delaware and I have had the opportunity of working together over the last few months on this particular piece of legislation. As he observed, there is a problem. The numismatic community has observed the problem of overissuance of coins and, therefore, the glutting of the market and the threatening of the value of each one of the issues.  The gentleman from Delaware has been concerned about that. The gentleman from New York [Mr. Flake] has expressed his concern about that. The gentleman from New York and the gentleman from Delaware together are individuals who did and do work with one another and on both sides of the aisle to try to make good common sense, and turn that into good public policy. I think they have done that in this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy]. He is the former chairman of this committee and is very interested and knowledgeable about the whole issue of the authorization of the minting of coins. He has addressed this issue, and I appreciate very much, as the gentleman from New York has observed, his agreement to compromise between the 800,000 that the Smithsonian thought was a viable number and the 500,000 that the numismatic committee originally recommended, and then modified their recommendation because of the ability of the Smithsonian to market its coins.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts, the gentleman from Delaware, and the gentleman from New York.  I would close, Mr. Speaker, in support of this legislation by simply mentioning one additional individual. John Berry, formerly of my staff, now works at Smithsonian and he has been very interested in this particular piece of legislation. I thank him for the energy and the tenaciousness that he has shown and congratulate him on the success of the passage of this legislation.
