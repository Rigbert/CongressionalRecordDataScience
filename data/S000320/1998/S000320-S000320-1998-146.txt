 President, I rise in support of the Managers' amendment to the Resolution of Ratification, and of the Resolution of Ratification itself.  Even though the Berlin Wall has crumbled and the Soviet Union has dissolved, NATO remains vital. It is the cornerstone of stability for a continent that is under massive transition. The nations of central and eastern Europe have established democratic forms of government and have deregulated their economies. The accession of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic is the best way to bolster their fledgling democracies and market economies thereby making their newly-won freedom irreversible.  Let there be no mistake: our engagement with Europe since NATO was formed in 1949 has not been without its costs and not without its risks. Our engagement with the new democracies of Central Europe will not be without costs and risks either. The expansion of NATO will most likely antagonize Russia.  More importantly, as a military alliance, we risk obligating the United States military to defend the citizens of distant and unfamiliar lands. In the end, though, we have found it difficult to stay out of these conflicts. Just about anywhere in the world where there is conflict, our military is there.  I believe that disengagement from Europe, as history has repeatedlyshown, would have far-reaching consequences. Therefore, I believe that we have no choice but to go forward with our current commitment to an expanded NATO. The Senate should vote to approve the Resolution of Ratification.  But, like many senators, I remain concerned at the potential financial costs of expansion. As a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I am concerned that the Administration has not yet come to terms with the price of supporting NATO expansion or more generally with the costs of America's position as the sole superpower.  As was the case with Bosnia, there is reason to believe that the Administration is underestimating the costs of expansion in order to make ratification more palatable in the Senate.  Without pouring additional funds into the defense budget, NATO expansion costs that are unaccounted for may hinder the Defense Department's ability to carry out missions in other vital areas of the world and at the same time to modernize the force.  We have heard a number of cost estimates in the course of this debate. We must keep in mind that the new member nations, as the primary beneficiaries of expansion, must devote the resources necessary to shoulder their fair share of the common burden.  And I know that nothing would undermine the support of this body for NATO, or that of the American people, faster than a perception that the new members, or existing members, for that matter, were not living up to their responsibilities in this regard.  I am also concerned about another aspect of NATO expansion--one that has received less attention than the broader strategic issues, but one that is critical to the long-term success of an expanded alliance--namely intelligence and counterintelligence matters.  Here too, after a careful review, I have concluded that the long-term national interests of the United States are best served by a vote in favor of the Resolution. But I would like to encourage Senators to take the time to review the report that I will describe shortly, which is available in classified form in S-407.  An unclassified summary can be found in the Foreign Relations Committee report, Executive Report 105-14, on the Resolution of Ratification.  This report was prepared by the Intelligence Committee staff at the direction of Senator Kerrey, the Committee Vice Chairman, and myself, and submitted to the Committee on Foreign Relations and to the Senate at large.  It contains the staff's assessment of the intelligence implications of NATO expansion.  The report is the culmination of the committee's work over the past year monitoring the progress of the accession process set in motion by the Alliance's decision last July to formally invite Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary to join NATO.  The staff has routinely reviewed the state of the accession negotiations, a process that concluded in December 1997 with the signing of the accession protocols. Committee members and staff have met numerous times with NATO negotiators as well as representatives from the acceding states, both in European capitals and in Washington, D.C.  In preparation for the Senate vote on advice and consent, committee staff held numerous briefings with U.S. and NATO intelligence officials; reviewed documents prepared by the Intelligence Community; and posed numerous questions for the record.  The committee directed the Executive branch--the Central Intelligence Agency, Department of Defense, National Security Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Department of State--to submit a formal report on the intelligence implications of enlargement.  Committee staff also met with members of the Alliance's Interagency Working Group on NATO Enlargement (IWGNE) to discuss integration efforts in the intelligence field.  Finally, committee members and staff traveled to national capitals of the three aspiring members to gain a more detailed, first-hand knowledge of how the civilian and military services of these countries operate, and whether adequate procedures are in place for the sharing of sensitive information with current NATO members.  Once again, I would remind my colleagues that the classified committee staff report is available in S-407 for Senators who may wish to read it.  The Committee has also prepared an unclassified summary of the report's major findings, and I would like to share with my colleagues the highlights.                                overview  The United States, along with its NATO allies, believes that membership in NATO cannot be granted piecemeal.  NATO has thus determined that there will not be a two-tiered security structure within the Alliance. If and when the three accede to full NATO membership, they will share in all rights and obligations, and will be entitled to share in Alliance secrets.  The work undertaken bilaterally and through NATO is geared to ensuring that the three invitees take the necessary steps over the transition or pre-accession period to demonstrate that they can and will guard NATO secrets appropriately once they join in April 1999.  In assessing the reliability of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic in guarding NATO secrets, the following factors are critical:  1. the strength of democratic reforms, with a focus on ministerial and legislative oversight of intelligence services and activities;  2. the degree to which the three countries have succeeded in reforming their civilian and military intelligence services, including the ability of the services to hire and retain qualified Western-oriented officers, and the evolution of political and public support for these services;  3. Russian intelligence objectives directed against these countries, including any disinformation campaigns designed to derail, retard, or taint their integration with the West;  4. counterintelligence and other security activities being pursued by the three countries, and the adequacy of resources devoted to these efforts; and  5. the work underway between the three invitees and NATO to ensure that security standards will be met by the time the three join the Alliance.                           committee findings  As a result of their investigations, the committee staff arrived at a series of key findings.  Their report includes general findings, findings derived from the experience of our respective intelligence agencies working together in both bilateral and multilateral fora; and findings relating to the counterintelligence threat, the pace of reform and the NATO work program for intelligence issues.                            general findings  Perhaps most important, the report makes a point that is obvious but nonetheless bears repeating: any intelligence sharing relationship inevitably involves some risks.  Nevertheless, I believe that the intelligence relationships with Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic will be, on balance, a net plus for U.S. and NATO interests. As many of my colleagues are aware, cooperation with the three countries on intelligence issues began before the idea of NATO enlargement itself took root.  In that respect, sharing intelligence in the NATO context will build on a pattern of bilateral cooperation which has existed for nearly a decade.  Based on the information provided to the Committee, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have proven to be reliable in handling operational information and capable of guarding classified information--some of it extremely sensitive.                        the multilateral context  In the multilateral context, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic have participated in the Implementation Force and the Stabilization Force operations in Bosnia, and have cooperated actively with U.S. intelligence to provide critical force protection information.  The three countries have demonstrated a solid record in the area of information and operational security within the NATO Partnership for Peace Program.  In addition, all three countries value their bilateral links to the U.S. and wish to expand them. They view multilateral intelligence cooperation in NATO as a complement to, not a substitute for, these bilateral intelligence relations.                     the counterintelligence threat  The single most critical intelligence issue we face in inviting Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into NATO is the counterintelligence question.  It is an unavoidable fact that past associations with Soviet intelligence services, together with proximity to Russia, make these countries vulnerable to hostile intelligence activity.  Over time, personnel and generational changes, training, and more robust counterintelligence programs by the three countries should reduce further this vulnerability. But for the time being, the threat is there.  The problem is not one of attitudes. The legacy these countries inherit from 44 years of Soviet domination makes them suspicious of Russian policies and motives.  Indeed, for Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, the problem is not complacency about the foreign intelligence threat, but ensuring a capability to counter it.  Lastly, and to put this issue into perspective, we should recall that Russian and other intelligence efforts to penetrate NATO will continue, irrespective of new Alliance members.                          the record of reform  With respect to the critical issue of reform, all three countries have made significant strides in restructuring, reforming, and redirecting their intelligence services.  More needs to be done to attain greater experience in parliamentary oversight of the services, to secure acceptance by politicians of the need for these services to maintain political neutrality, to retain and promote experienced officers with Western orientation, and to enhance computer security.  As professionalism increases, morale will improve, and the intelligence services will be looked upon as contributing to common security interests. Adequate funding and visible support from the political leadership will be essential to this process.                         the nato work program  The three invitees are continuing to work with NATO in preparation for their final accession.  In cooperation with NATO to date, in a variety of interactions with the U.S. and other current NATO allies, including the sharing of sensitive information through the Partnership for Peace program, IFOR/SFOR, and in bilateral intelligence cooperation, the three invitees have demonstrated solid records in the area of information and operational security.  Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic have undertaken significant steps to conform to NATO security standards and have enhanced personnel and information security practices.  Looking toward accession in April 1999, from a NATO perspective, the intelligence aspects of NATO enlargement appear to be on track. Indeed, the intelligence planning in NATO is currently ahead of the other NATO programs which must be readied for the April 1999 accession date.  NATO and U.S. officials have been reviewing the capabilities and intentions of the three governments to handle sensitive information, and the extent to which the military and intelligence services of these former Warsaw Pact members have distanced themselves from their former mentors.  The NATO Intelligence Board has worked closely with NATO's Office of Security to ensure adequate security measures are developed with new members.  The specific criteria that the Alliance is using to ensure that NATO practices and regulations become standard operating procedures for the three new invitees are based on established security guidelines developed for the Alliance and approved by the member states. Each of the three NATO invitees has thus far achieved or exceeded each criterion set before it, according to the Executive Branch.                    intelligence committee condition  Based on these findings, I together with Senator Kerrey have proposed a condition to the resolution of ratification of the Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty, which is included in the Managers' amendment now before the Senate.  The purpose of the condition is to monitor the progress that the three aspiring members are making in adopting NATO practices and regulations as standard operating procedures in their own intelligence services, and in enhancing their overall procedures for protecting intelligence sources and methods.  To monitor the progress in meeting NATO standards during the transition period up to April 1999, as well as to provide a benchmark following formal accession, the condition requires the President and the Director of Central Intelligence to provide the appropriate committees of Congress with three ``snapshots''--two before and one after formal accession of these countries to the alliance.  The President is required to report by 1 January 1999, on behalf of all the interested agencies, the progress made by the three countries in meeting NATO membership security requirements.  The Director of Central Intelligence is also required to report on or before 1 January 1999, and again not later than 90 days after the date of formal accession of these countries to NATO, on the latest procedures and requirements established in these countries for the protection of intelligence sources and methods, including a comparison of the overall procedures and requirements for such protection in these three countries with those in other NATO member states.  I believe that this condition sets forth a balanced approach to monitoring the progress of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic toward meeting the intelligence and security-related requirements for full NATO membership.  In what I believe is the unlikely event that a serious problem arises with respect to one or more of the prospective members, the reports due on January 1, 1999 will provide both the Senate and the Executive Branch with an opportunity to address and resolve any such problem before final accession.                            final assessment  I would like to close with the following.  In developing an overall assessment of the security risks associated with the inclusion of the three new invitees in NATO, the issue is not only how to ensure that these three countries protect NATO secrets, but also to ensure that the new members, and NATO at large, devote sufficient attention and resources to address the overall non-NATO intelligence threat to the Alliance.  To reiterate, based on the information provided to the Committee, the governments of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary have demonstrated both an intent and an ability to protect the classified military and intelligence information that would be routinely provided them as members of the Alliance.  While past associations make these countries vulnerable to Russian intelligence activity, over time, personnel and generational changes, training, and more robust counterintelligence programs by the three countries should reduce further this vulnerability.  As I noted earlier, cooperation on intelligence issues began before the idea of NATO enlargement took root. In that respect, sharing intelligence in the NATO context builds upon a pattern of cooperation of nearly a decade.  As with other aspects of NATO integration, it will take some time and technical advice and assistance from other NATO members for the governments of these three countries to totally overcome the legacy of their communist past.  As a critical element of such a program, the three governments must devote adequate resources to support professionalized intelligence and counterintelligence services, and must demonstrate their political support for these services' role in safeguarding the democratic political order.  Lastly, by the time the three invitees join NATO, a decade will have passed since the collapse of their communist regimes.  Contacts with the U.S., other allies, and NATO, coupled with continuing modernization programs and priority assistance efforts from current NATO members, should help to ensure that all three countries satisfy membership security requirements by the time of their accession to NATO in April 1999.  In closing, I would like to thank the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms, and theRanking Member, Senator Biden, for including the Shelby-Kerrey condition as part of the Managers' amendment, and for their leadership in ensuring the thorough and expeditious consideration of this historic resolution.
