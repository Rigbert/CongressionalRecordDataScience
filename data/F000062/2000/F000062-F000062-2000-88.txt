 President, I am pleased to introduce this bill today which will provide for the transfer of the Sugar Pine Dam and Reservoir Project in the Central Valley Project to the Forest Hills Public Utility District. I continue to support the transfer of the Bureau of Reclamation projects to the local water districts which operate and benefit from them.  This bill is important in one other way. The language in this bill will correct the financial inequity that affects CVP beneficiaries. Some of the costs of constructing Bureau of Reclamation projects have been allocated to other CVP contractors even though the projects have never been operationally integrated into the CVP. Thus, Irrigation and Municipal and Industrial (M) contractors such as Contra Costa Water District, East Bay MUD, Santa Clara Valley Water District, Sacramento MUD, City of Fresno and a number of others have incurred substantial costs without ever receiving any benefit.  This bill has the bipartisan support of Congressman George Miller and John Doolittle in the House. And I can think of no opposition to assisting Forest Hills Public Utility District and other M contractors with this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
