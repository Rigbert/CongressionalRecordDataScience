President, I suspect my experience is probably similar to that of the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania. Fines, especially in these commercial fraud type things, were seen as the cost of doing business. If you steal $100 million, and you get a $5 million fine, then you stole $95 million. But if they think they are going to go to prison, that is when they think twice. We saw this after Enron and other things that when people actually believe they are going to go to prison, then they start thinking twice.  I am sure this was the experience the Senator from Pennsylvania had. It is the experience I had. Nothing focuses the attention of somebody who is going to want to defraud someone if they think they are going to spend years in a tiny cell. That focuses their attention, and suddenly it is not worth the effort. That is what we want to do here because the people who are being defrauded are the most defenseless.
