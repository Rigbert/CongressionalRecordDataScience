 President, we are in the midst of quite a productive week in the Senate. Yesterday, this body did its part in fulfilling an important promise to our Nation's veterans. We passed the VA MISSION Act by a wide, bipartisan margin.  Having already passed the House, this truly landmark bill will now head to the White House where the President will soon sign it into law.  It will bring more options and greater flexibility to veterans who have spent years driving long distances to the nearest VA care facility, only to face long lines and waiting lists when they got there.  It will bring more peace of mind for veterans of all eras and their families who have faced uncertainty and limitations as their needs for care have evolved.  This legislation continues, expands, and improves the successful Veterans Choice Program that has already helped millions of veterans nationwide, including more than 23,000 Kentuckians last year alone.  Thanks to the stalwart leadership of Chairman Isakson and the Veterans' Affairs Committee, the hard-and-fast time and distance thresholds that kept too many veterans out of the Choice Program will soon be gone.
