 President, the majority leader has generously consented to allow me to make a few observations before I must leave the Chamber.  My view is the majority has literally wasted months in the Chamber trying to tell the private sector what to do instead of providing certainty to help them make investment decisions. This bill we will be voting on cloture on Tuesday will do nothing to create jobs in our country. Most of the factories the Durbin bill is trying to prevent from moving overseas are not traveling overseas to sell back to the American market but are moving there to gain competitive advantage over foreign companies in foreign markets. In doing so, they create more jobs and more opportunity in the United States.
