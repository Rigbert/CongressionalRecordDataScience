 President, I rise today to help Whitley County, KY, mark an impressive milestone. Founded in 1818, the county is commemorating its 200 years of heritage and success with a year full of events and celebrations. I would like to take a brief moment to join them in remembering the unique history of Whitley County.  Although the first meeting of the Whitley County Court was held on April 20, 1818, in the home of one of its earliest residents, Samuel Cox, the area's history extends back to its first exploration as early as 1750. The county was named for Colonel William Whitley, famous for fighting many battles within the area, safeguarding the Wilderness Road, and for his service in the War of 1812. The county seat, Williamsburg, was also named in his honor.  At its founding, the county was home to only 500 residents. Whitley County saw only tepid population growth during its first decades, but after the Civil War, the number of residents quickly increased. With the arrival of the L&N Railroad in 1883, the area flourished with the influx of lumber and coal jobs. Now, Whitley County is home to more than 35,000 Kentuckians.  Among the most remarkable aspects of the area is its picturesque geography. In the Cumberland Mountains, much of the county is included in the Daniel Boone National Forest. A portion of Whitley County's western border also follows the path of the Cumberland River and includes Cumberland Falls, known as the Niagara of the South. As the only place in the Western Hemisphere with regularly visible moonbows, the falls are a major source of tourism.  To celebrate its bicentennial, the county is hosting a wide range of events, focused around the official founding in April, which included a birthday party and the decorating of the downtown Williamsburg in red, white, and blue. The county will also dedicate a historical marker at the site of Samuel Cox's residence. Later in the year, Whitley County will collect items for a time capsule and host a barbeque cook-off.  I would like to join everyone in Whitley County, including Judge/Executive Pat White, Jr., in marking this occasion, and I would like to ask my Senate colleagues to help me commemorate the bicentennial anniversary.                          ____________________
