 President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will create a national promotion, research and information program for Hass avocados. This industry-financed promotion program will help farmers without costing taxpayers any money.  This legislation provides California's 6,000 Hass avocado growers with the ability to achieve together that which would not be possible alone--the establishment of a national program to enhance avocado marketing and consumption. Pooled industry resources create the potential for an impact much greater than what would be possible through a solely state-funded program.  Like producers who have successful national promotion programs, including those for beef, cotton, dairy, eggs, pork and soybeans, producers of Hass avocados are seeking a new vehicle for expanding the consumer market for avocados. A nationwide promotion program would provide the avocado industry with the means to market avocados to a much wider consumer audience, and build demand at a time when the aggregate supply of avocados is rapidly increasing.  California has a long history of state marketing programs for its many diverse agricultural commodities. In fact, the avocado industry has long benefitted from an innovative state grower-funded program administered by the California Avocado Commission.  In recent years, however, increasing imports are supplying a larger share of the U.S. consumer market. In 1998, for example, import levels reached 100 million pounds, or nearly one-third the size of U.S. avocado production. If not offset by increased demand, this rapid escalation of supply will lead to market instability. Given this dynamic, it is only fair that the cost of a national promotion program be shared fairly among importers and domestic producers.  The ``Hass Avocado Promotion, Research and Information Act of 1999'' is a self-help national checkoff program that will allow avocado growers to fund and operate a coordinated marketing effort to expand domestic and foreign markets. The avocado promotion program will be operated at no cost to the federal government and will be funded by U.S. Hass avocado growers and Hass avocado importers.  The key elements of this avocado promotion legislation include: (1) an 11-member Hass Avocado Board comprised of both domestic producers and importers; (2) new programs for the advertising and promotion of avocados to develop new markets; (3) research on the sale, distribution, use, quality or nutritional value of avocados; (4) an up-front referendum of qualified producers and importers during a 60-day period preceding the effective date of the Secretary of Agriculture's implementing order; and (5) an initial assessment rate on Hass avocados on 2.5 cent per pound.  Hass avocados are an integral food source in the United States and are a valuable and healthy part of the human diet. Avocados are enjoyed by millions of persons every year for a multitude of every day and special occasions. The maintenance and expansion of existing markets and the development of new markets and uses for Hass avocados is needed to preserve and strengthen the economic viability of the domestic Hass avocado industry for the benefit of producers and the benefit of other persons marketing, processing and consuming Hass avocados.  Agricultural commodity promotion programs are a proven means of increasing market share for commodities. The Hass avocado growers in my state want to have a program that will help increase their market share of the consumer food dollar. California's Hass avocado growers have made extensive efforts over the last two years to unify the industry, which has resulted in the development of this highly supported national promotion program. The 1996-1997 value of domestic Hass avocado production was $259 million--a substantial market that could be even greater if properly promoted.  This national avocado promotion program is an opportunity for Congress to help an agricultural industry create increased economic activity and job opportunities, with no expenditure of tax collars. I urge you to support this important legislation.                                 ______                                       By
