We are scheduling a hearing on the issue of drones, because I believe the issue raises important questions, legal and constitutional questions. I invite my colleague to join us in that hearing if you wish to testify. I think this is something we should look at and look at closely. That is why this hearing is being scheduled. I believe at this moment it is premature to schedule a vote on this issue until we thoroughly look at the constitutional aspects of all of the questions the Senator has raised today, which are important.  Because of that, I have no alternative but to object.
