 President, today I speak in remembrance of an Iowan who has died in service to his country. A member of the 212th Military Police Company, SSG Shane Koele died on the 16th of March from injuries sustained when his military vehicle ran over a land mine the day before near Shindand, Afghanistan. He was 25 years old and is survived by a wife, Cheryl, a young daughter, Kiley, a mother, Mary Donnenwerth, a father, Keith Koele, and two sisters.  Staff Sergeant Koele grew up in Hartley, IA, and graduated in 1998 from Hartley-Melvin-Sanborn High School. He attended college at Northwestern College and Wayne State before joining the Army. After serving in Iraq for 6 months in 2003, Shane returned home to get married. He was sent to Afghanistan on March 13, 2005.  SSG Shane Koele is remembered by family and friends as a true hero. President Ronald Reagan once said, ``Those who say that we're in a time when there are no heroes, they just don't know where to look.'' Today, we don't have to look far. We have only to remember with pride SSG Shane Koele and all those who have died in courageous service to their country. As his family and friends grieve their loss, I can only offer my prayers and my gratitude.                          ____________________
