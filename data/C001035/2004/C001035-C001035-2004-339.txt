The Secretary of Defense is not required to present the views of the NSA to the President. I think this works in a more collaborative way than we are giving the system credit for.  We have to be careful, while we put in all of these safeguards--and I support the chairman's amendment--that we do not create a situation where it is unclear who is the principal adviser to the President. And that, under our bill, is the national intelligence director.
