 President, this amendment extends the crime law trust fund through 2002 at the funding levels of the budget agreement.  This amendment has the same effect as the Biden-Gramm-Hatch amendment passed by the Senate 98 to 2 on June 27, 1997.  Let me point out just one practical effect of my amendment. The Senate Judiciary Committee reported major youth violence legislation last week--this Hatch-Sessions bill calls for $1.5 billion from the crime law trust fund in 2001 and 2002--this is almost one-half of the dollars to fund a new Republican youth violence block grant.  Now, I do not agree with many of the specifics of this block grant and I look forward to debating these issues on the floor.  But, the bottom line is real simple--if we do not pass this amendment, there will be no trust fund in 2001 and 2002, and so, there will be no youth violence block grant in 2001 and 2002--no matter what form this block grant ultimately takes.  And, it is the same for prisons, 100,000 cops, and violence against women. If we do not pass my amendment, there will be no trust fund in 2001 and 2002, and there will be no more funding for prisons and no more to fight violence against women.  I also want to point out to my colleagues that I believe that there are Budget Act points of order which could be lodged against my amendment. I say that just so all of us are clear about my amendment. I would move to waive such a point of order were it raised. I just want my colleagues to understand this fact as we pass this amendment.  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.                           AMENDMENT NO. 1030   (Purpose: To provide funding for the Community Policing to Combat                        Domestic Violence Program)       On page 29, line 18, insert ``That of the amount made      available for Local Law Enforcement Block Grants under this      heading, 10,000,000 shall be for the Community Policing to      Combat Domestic Violence Program established pursuant to      section 1701(d) of part Q of the Omnibus Crime Control and      Safe Streets Act of 1968: Provided further,'' after      ``Provided,''.                                  ____                           AMENDMENT NO. 1031       On page 65, on line 25 after ``expenses'' insert the      following: Provided further, That the number of political      appointees on board as of May 1, 1998, shall constitute not      more than fifteen percentum of the total full-time equivalent      positions at the Office of the United States Trade      Representative.''
