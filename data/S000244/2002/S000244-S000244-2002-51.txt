The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 5469       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION. 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Webcaster Amendments      Act of 2002''.     SEC. 2. EPHEMERAL ROYALTY RATES FOR ELIGIBLE SMALL                    WEBCASTERS.

(b) Rates for Eligible Small Webcasters.--Section 114(f)(2)      of title 17, United States Code, is amended by adding after      subparagraph (C) the following:       ``(D)(i) Subject to clause (iii) and paragraph (3), but      notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, an      eligible small webcaster may, as provided in clause      (ii)(VII), for the period beginning on October 28, 1998, and      ending on December 31, 2002, or one or both of calendar years      2003 and 2004, elect the royalty rates specified in this      clause in lieu of any other applicable royalty rates:       ``(I) For eligible nonsubscription transmissions made by an      eligible small webcaster during the period beginning on      October 28, 1998, and ending on December 31, 2002, the      royalty rate shall be 8 percent of the webcaster's gross      revenues during such period, or 5 percent of the webcaster's      expenses during such period, whichever is greater, except      that an eligible small webcaster that is a natural person      shall exclude from expenses those expenses not incurred in      connection with the operation of a service that makes      eligible nonsubscription transmissions, and an eligible small      webcaster that is a natural person shall exclude from gross      revenues his or her income during such period, other than      income derived from--       ``(aa) a media or entertainment related business that      provides audio or other entertainment programming, or       ``(bb) a business that primarily operates an Internet or      wireless service,

non-voting stock.       ``(II) For eligible nonsubscription transmissions made by      an eligible small webcaster during 2003 or 2004, the royalty      rate shall be 10 percent of the eligible small webcaster's      first $250,000 in gross revenues and 12 percent of any gross      revenues in excess of $250,000 during the applicable year, or      7 percent of the webcaster's expenses during the applicable      year, whichever is greater.       ``(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (4)(C), payment of the      amounts specified in clause (i) shall be made as follows:       ``(I) Except as provided in clause (iii)(I) and (IV), the      amounts specified in clause (i)(I) for eligible      nonsubscription transmissions made by an eligible small      webcaster during the period beginning on October 28, 1998,      and ending on September 30, 2002, shall be paid in three      equal installments, with the first due by November 30, 2002,      the second due by May 31, 2003, and the third due by October      31, 2003.       ``(II) The amounts specified in clause (i) for eligible      nonsubscription transmissions made by an eligible small      webcaster during October 2002 or any month

an eligible small webcaster      in 2003 or 2004, the transmitting entity may make payments      for 2003 or 2004, as the case may be, on the assumption that      it will be an eligible small webcaster for that year for so      long as that assumption is reasonable.       ``(IV) In making payments under clause (i)(II), the      webcaster shall, at the time a payment is due, calculate its      gross revenues and expenses for the year through the end of      the applicable month, and for the applicable month pay the      applicable percentage of gross revenues or expenses, as the      case may be, for the year through the end of the applicable      month, less any amounts previously paid for such year.       ``(V) If a transmitting entity has made payments under      clause (i)(II) for 2003 or 2004 based on the assumption that      it will qualify as an eligible small webcaster, as provided      in subclause (IV), but the actual gross revenues in 2003, or      the actual gross revenues, third party participation      revenues, and revenues from the operation of new subscription      services in 2004, of the eligible small webcaster and its      affiliates, exceed the maximum amounts provided in clause      (vi)(II), then the transmitting entity shall immediately      commence to pay monthly royalties based on the royalty rates      otherwise applicable under this subsection, and on the third      payment date after the month in which such maximum amounts      are exceeded, it shall pay an amount of royalties based on      such otherwise applicable rates for the whole year through      the end of the immediately preceding month, less any amounts      previously paid under clause (i) for such year.       ``(VI) Payments of all amounts specified in clause (i)      shall be made to the entity designated by the Copyright      Office to receive royalty payments under this section and      shall under no circumstances be refundable, but if an      eligible small webcaster makes overpayments during a year, it      shall be entitled to a credit in the amount of its      overpayment, and such credit shall be applicable to its      payments in subsequent years.       ``(VII) An eligible small webcaster that wishes to elect      the royalty rates specified in clause (i) in lieu of any      other royalty rates that otherwise might apply under this      subsection for the period beginning on October 28, 1998, and      ending on December 31, 2002, or one or both of calendar years      2003 and 2004, shall file an election with the Copyright      Office and serve it on each entity designated by the      Copyright Office to distribute royalty payments under this      section to copyright owners and performers entitled to      receive royalties under subsection (d)(2) by no later than      the first date on which the webcaster is obligated under this      clause to make a royalty payment for such period. An eligible      small webcaster that fails to make a timely election shall      pay royalties as otherwise provided under this section. As a      condition of such election, an eligible small webcaster      shall--       ``(aa) make available to the entity designated to receive      royalties under this section, on request at any time during      the 3 years following the applicable period, sufficient      evidence to support its eligibility as an eligible small      webcaster; and       ``(bb) provide to such entity, by not later than January 31      of the year following the applicable period, an accounting of      its third party participation revenues.

The minimum fees specified      in subclauses (III) and (IV) shall be paid in two equal      installments, with the first due by January 31 of the      applicable year and the second due by June 30 of the      applicable year.       ``(VI) Payments of all amounts specified in this clause      shall be made to the entity designated by the Copyright      Office to receive royalty payments under this section and      shall under no circumstances be refundable.       ``(VII) All amounts paid under this clause shall be fully      creditable toward amounts due under clauses (i) and (ii) for      the same year.       ``(iv) Subject to paragraph (3), but notwithstanding any      other provision of this paragraph, a noncommercial, non-FCC      webcaster may, for the period beginning on October 28, 1998,      and ending on December 31, 2002, or one or both of calendar      years 2003 and 2004, elect the royalty rates specified in      this clause in lieu of any other royalty rates that otherwise      might apply under this section. The royalty rate shall be .02      cents per performance. For the purpose of this clause, the      term `performance' has the meaning given that term in section      261.2 of title 37, Code of Federal Regulations, as published      in the Federal Register on July 8, 2002. Such royalties shall      be payable at the times specified in clause (ii)(I) and (II).      Noncommercial, non-FCC webcasters shall pay a minimum fee,      for any part of calendar years 1998 through 2004, of $500 for      each year in which such performances are made. Such minimum      fee shall be fully creditable toward royalties due for the      same year. For performances made during the period beginning      on October 28, 1998, and ending on December 31, 2002, such      minimum fee shall be paid within 30 days after the date of      the enactment of the Small Webcaster Amendments Act of 2002.

(a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--       (1) in the case of royalty payments from the licensing of      digital transmissions of sound recordings under subsection      (f) of section 114 of title 17, United States Code, the      parties have voluntarily negotiated arrangements under which      payments shall be made directly to featured recording artists      and the administrators of the accounts provided in subsection      (g)(2) of that section;       (2) such voluntarily-negotiated payment arrangements have      been codified in regulations issued by the Librarian of      Congress, currently found in section 261.4 of title 37, Code      of Federal Regulations, as published in the Federal Register      on July 8, 2002;       (3) other regulations issued by the Librarian of Congress      were inconsistent with the voluntarily-negotiated      arrangements by such parties concerning the deductibility of      certain costs incurred for licensing and arbitration, and the      Congress is therefore restoring those terms as originally      negotiated among the parties; and       (4) in light of the special circumstances described in this      subsection, the uncertainty created by the regulations issued      by the Librarian of Congress, and the fact that all of the      interested parties have reached agreement, the voluntarily-     negotiated arrangements agreed to among the parties are being      codified.       (b) Deductibility.--Section 114(g) of title 17, United      States Code, is amended by adding after paragraph (2) the      following:       ``(3) A nonprofit agent designated to distribute receipts      from the licensing of transmissions in accordance with      subsection (f) may deduct from any of its receipts, prior to      the distribution of such receipts to any person or entity      entitled thereto, the reasonable costs of such agent incurred      after November 1, 1995, in--       ``(A) the administration of the collection, distribution,      and calculation of the royalties;       ``(B) the settlement of disputes relating to the collection      and calculation of the royalties; and       ``(C) the licensing and enforcement of rights with respect      to the making of ephemeral recordings and performances      subject to licensing under section 112 and this section,      including those incurred in participating in negotiations or      arbitration proceedings under section 112 and this      section.''.       (c) Direct Payment to Artists.--Section 114(g)(2) of title      17, United States Code, is amended to read:       ``(2) An agent designated to distribute receipts from the      licensing of transmissions in accordance with subsection (f)      shall distribute such receipts as follows:       ``(A) 50 percent of the receipts shall be paid to the      copyright owner of the exclusive right under section 106(6)      of this title to publicly perform a sound recording by means      of a digital audio transmission.       ``(B) 2-1/2 percent of the receipts shall be deposited in      an escrow account managed by an independent administrator      jointly appointed by copyright owners of sound recordings and      the American Federation of Musicians (or any successor      entity) to be distributed to nonfeatured musicians (whether      or not members of the American Federation of Musicians) who      have performed on sound recordings.       ``(C) 2-1/2 percent of the receipts shall be deposited in      an escrow account managed by an independent administrator      jointly appointed by copyright owners of sound recordings and      the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (or      any successor entity) to be distributed to nonfeatured      vocalists (whether or not members of the American Federation      of Television and Radio Artists) who have performed on sound      recordings.       ``(D) 45 percent of the receipts shall be paid, on a per      sound recording basis, to the recording artist or artists      featured on such sound recording (or the persons conveying      rights in the artists' performance in the sound      recordings).''.     SEC. 5. REPORT TO CONGRESS.       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--       (1) eligible small webcasters have economic arrangements      with third parties, as a result of which third parties, many      of them large businesses, realize a significant portion of      the revenues generated from the use of sound recordings in      the services operated by eligible small webcasters; and       (2) as a result of these arrangements, any royalty based on      revenues realized by an eligible small webcaster may result      in recording artists and sound recording copyright owners      receiving a royalty based on revenues that are a fraction of      the total revenues generated from the use of the sound      recordings under statutory license.       (b) Report to Congress.--By not later than June 1, 2004,      the Register of Copyrights and the Comptroller General of the      Untied States shall prepare and submit to the Committee on      the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the      Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate a joint report      concerning--       (1) the economic arrangements among eligible small      webcasters and third parties and their consequences for the      ability of recording artists and sound recording copyright      owners to be compensated appropriately on a percentage of      revenue basis; and       (2) the economic incentives that percentage of revenue      statutory rates create for structuring economic arrangements      among eligible small webcasters and third parties that may be      to the detriment of recording artists and sound recording      copyright owners.       (c) Definition.--In this section, the term ``eligible small      webcaster'' has the meaning given that term in section      114(f)(2)(E) of title 17, United States Code, as added by      section 3 of this Act.     SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.       The amendments made by this Act shall take effect on the      date of the enactment of this Act.
