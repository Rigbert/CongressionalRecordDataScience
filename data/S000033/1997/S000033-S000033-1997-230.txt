 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by high school students from Montpelier High School in Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people:       Mr. Douthat. I would like to thank you for coming to our      school, Congressman Sanders, and we are going to be talking      about some of the U.S. drug policies in South America.       Clinton proposed to spend $16 billion this year on the War      on Drugs. This figure is up from $10 billion spent during the      1980s over the entire decade. 70 percent of the money spent      on drugs is spent on actual prevention and keeping it out of      the country, whether that be through South American programs      or Border Patrol and 30 percent is spent on drug      rehabilitation.       During the Bush Administration he proposed a five-year,      $2.2 billion program for Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru,      and in 1993 he granted $716 million to the South American      nations and Mexico as long as they committed themselves to      reducing their product production and respect for human      rights.       The U.S. also helped to train local police forces in these      countries, to dispute drug trafficking and the destroying of      cocoa. Also we sponsored their rates in any of these      countries.       Although this policy has been in effect for a long time it      really hasn't worked in curbing the influx of drugs into this      country or the use of them once they are in here, and during      this period of time spending has ballooned and the amount of      drugs hasn't gone down. Basically, the only thing that this      has affected now is there are 400,000 Americans in the jail      on drug possession charges and trafficking charges.       Our question is do you think this policy could be used more      effectively in the zero tolerance policy or do you think      there is a better philosophy in and attacks at curbing drug      production and use in the United States if you think that is      a significant problem?       Mr. Belanger. Well we basically got together and when we      were talking, actually it was a little bit ago, we were      thinking of proposals in which in order to cut the spending      that the government could possibly use, so we thought of--we      think it might be actually in the process the government      is considering this, but we are thinking like what      happens, instead of spending like the $16 million--billion      I mean, fighting like the so-called War on Drugs and like      cutting off the supply from the drugs coming up, maybe the      government controlled as in they would--how would you say?       Mr. Douthat. They would sell--the government would be sort      of the handler of drugs, sort like methadone clinics but      modified more than that, not quite suppliers but something      near to that. And we think that is a good idea because really      the only thing that our drug policy has affected in the last      ten years, it is really gotten a lot of South American drug      dealers and drug producers and drug traffickers in this      country quite wealthy.       Mr. Belanger. What we were thinking is if the government      was basically like the pharmacist, like if you had any      addiction whatsoever, you would go to them and like the      government could actually make--I do not know if they would      make money off this, so that is one aspect, but they also      would lower the street value so that the drug dealers      couldn't make a business.       Mr. Douthat. It wouldn't be quite like methadone clinics      and it wouldn't be completely medical. If they did also      supply drugs to non-addicts it would virtually--for one      thing, it would take away the AIDS threat from IV drug users      and also it would make it--drugs have been in cultures for as      long as humanity has existed, so I really do not think it is      realistic to completely curb recreational drug use and it has      been shown through prohibition of alcohol and marijuana and      other drugs that it just doesn't work.       So I think that the government sponsoring it would make it      clean, would make the drugs safer and it would make people      who are occasional users, they wouldn't have to be criminals,      they would be living much more normal lives.       Mr. Belanger. Legalize drugs in the form where the      government would be your supplier, so it is in a more      controlled area, cleaner drugs.       Mr. Douthat. And I think some drugs would have to be      treated differently and I think cocaine and crack and heroine      especially are the ones that are really addictive would have      to be treated differently than the drugs like marijuana.       Mr. Belanger. And maybe as a suggestion to you and the      people you work with, treat like the U.K. and I think it is      Denmark hashish bars, stuff like that and Holland has      basically testers and like as examples like to see how things      have gone over there, and if things have worked well.                               ____________________
