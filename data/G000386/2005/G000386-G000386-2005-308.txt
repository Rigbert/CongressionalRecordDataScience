 President, I am shocked anybody from the other side of the aisle would raise any questions against the policy we have in our bill. This is not a Republican policy. This is not a Bush administration policy. This is a policy that was offered by the previous administration, the Clinton administration. The targeted case management provision of this bill merely codifies that policy that was offered by the Clinton administration. I have a letter I got from the U.S. Psychiatric Rehabilitation Association expressing thanks for the targeted case management provisions:       Your measured steps and considerations of TCM will preserve      the needed services to those who cannot attain housing,      employment, or health care on their own. [We] appreciate your      work in helping to ensure that mentally disabled Americans      have the opportunity to access Medicaid services.  It seems to me this is something that ought to be of the heart and the brain of anybody on the other side of the aisle.
