Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I certainly support her amendment.  Under the previous administration, EPA proposed this stringent water regulation standard in Washington State without utilizing sound scientific data or evidence. In doing so, EPA created regulatory uncertainty and imposed unachievable permit levels on the State, which are costly and nearly impossible for industries to comply with.  I encourage the State, the Tribes, and the EPA to continue to work together to find agreeable standards that improve water quality and human health while, simultaneously, providing clarity to the impacted communities and industries. In the meantime, though, I certainly urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, when humans consume contaminated fish, it results in serious health impacts, such as cancer, organ damage and reproductive dysfunction, or impairment in brain development.  High fish-consuming communities--as I have mentioned, Native American Tribes and Asian-Pacific Islander communities--need the protections afforded by this revised water quality standard.  I would like to, for the Record, again state that this amendment is not supported by the State of Washington or the Tribal communities in the area.  I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Clearly, more work needs to be done. I look forward to having this amendment not pass and for people to get down to doing the serious work that needs to be done to address the gentlewoman's concerns.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. McMorris Rodgers).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it.  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Washington will be postponed.               Amendment No. 47 Offered by Mr. Loudermilk  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 47 printed in House Report 115-830.
