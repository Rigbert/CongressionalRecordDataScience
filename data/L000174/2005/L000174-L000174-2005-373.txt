President, I wish to take a few moments to bring people up to date on where we are on the John Roberts nomination to the Supreme Court.  It is now a little over a week since President Bush made a dramatic evening announcement of his intention to nominate John Roberts to succeed Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on the U.S. Supreme Court. In the Senate, we haven't received this nomination. It has not come up yet. Nonetheless, we are well on the way to preparation for the Senate's process in considering the nomination.  During the past weeks, some of us have met with Judge Roberts. We have urged him to be forthcoming at his upcoming hearing. The Judiciary Committee has already sent him a questionnaire seeking background information. Most importantly, Chairman Specter and I have already begun laying the groundwork for full and fair hearings which we are both committed to holding. I expect that we will soon be able to announce the Judiciary Committee's schedule for those hearings.  Late yesterday, the White House provided some documents from Mr. Roberts' time when he served as special counsel to Attorney General William French Smith during the Reagan administration. None of us had requested these particular documents but, of course, we are always happy to receive anything they want to send. There are at least three categories of documents from Mr. Roberts' years in the executive branch that are relevant to this nomination.  The second group relates to Mr. Roberts' work from 1982 to 1986 as an associate White House counsel under the supervision of White House Counsel Fred Fielding. These are apparently kept in the Reagan Library in California.  Yesterday, in our continuing effort to expedite the process, we sent a letter to the White House asking that the files from those years be made available as quickly as possible, and to help speed it up, we identified by name the files we wished to be priorities. I hope the reported statements by White House officials over the last couple of days indicating they expect it will take 3 or 4 weeks to make these materials available are in error and, instead,they can be made available on a prompt basis, not a delayed basis. Otherwise, it would almost appear--I certainly wouldn't want to suggest the White House would do this--that they are trying to make sure the documents arrive after the hearings and not before them or arrive so close to the time of the hearings, there would be no time to review them. I trust there will be those at the White House who would understand this would be the wrong way to proceed and would actually in the long run end up adding more time to the process.  The third category of files is from Mr. Roberts' work when he was a political appointee in the Justice Department's Office of the Solicitor General. He served as Kenneth Starr's principal deputy during the prior Bush administration. The reason I say these are important, the President said that his work at this time was one of the reasons he selected Judge Roberts as his nominee. Of course, the President has every right to consider whatever reasons for a Supreme Court nominee. Having said that, however, in carrying out our responsibilities, it is appropriate that the Senate also be entitled to the same kind of information that the White House weighed in making its decision about this nomination. In other words, if this work is one of the reasons they say he is qualified to be on the Supreme Court, all the more reason the 100 Members of the Senate should be able to see it and make up our own minds.  Actually, it might be the most informative of the documents we are going to seek. We could get a practical sense of how, when, and why politics and the law intersect for him. I am not expecting to seek production of all the files and the hundreds of matters on which Mr. Roberts worked in those critical years. Nobody is asking for that. Rather, in our effort to cooperate and expedite the process, we are putting together a targeted catalog of documents. I hope we can work with Chairman Specter to send a reasonable bipartisan request for a selected group of those files.  In that regard, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter we sent to the White House yesterday be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                    Washington, DC, July 26, 2005.     Hon. George W. Bush,     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: We are disappointed that the White      House appears to have so quickly moved to close off access by      the Senate to important and informative documents written by      Supreme Court nominee John Roberts while he was at the      Department of Justice. According to news reports today, your      Administration may be preemptively protecting thousands of      documents not even requested yet by the Committee--documents      that could very well hold important information necessary to      evaluate Judge Roberts' judicial philosophy and legal      reasoning.       While many documents are being delivered today from Judge      Roberts' work for Attorney General William French Smith at      the Reagan Justice Department, it is far too early to      determine whether these documents are relevant, adequate, or      even helpful. It may be that this group of documents, along      with the upcoming hearings, will give us enough information      to fulfill our constitutional duty to advise and consent on      this nomination. But it would be premature for either the      Senate or the White House to make that determination now.      Judge Roberts spent some four years working for President      George H.W. Bush, and it may very well be that documents from      that time will be helpful to the Committee as well.       It is our hope that the confirmation process moves swiftly      and smoothly over the coming weeks. We can assure you that no      Senator is attempting to unduly delay the proceedings. We      intend to work with Chairman Specter if and when further      requests for documents or information appear appropriate. But      in the meantime, we believe that judgment should be withheld      on which and how many documents regarding this nominee might      be released to the Senate. The history of past nominations is      varied but clear--each confirmation process is different, and      the type and number of documents shared between the White      House and the Senate has depended on the nature of the      debate, the needs of the Committee, and a cooperative      negotiation between the Senate and the White House. A blanket      statement that entire groups of documents are off limits is      both premature and ill advised.       Finally, it is our understanding that many more publicly      available documents will soon be sorted and delivered to the      Committee. In the interests of speeding up the process, we      have attached a list of the document areas within that group      we feel would be most helpful to the Committee. To the extent      your staff can assist in expediting the delivery of those      documents, we would be grateful.           Sincerely,     Patrick Leahy.     Dick Durbin.     Joe Biden.     Edward M. Kennedy.     Charles Schumer.     Dianne Feinstein.     Russell D. Feingold.
