We not only have a flawed payment system, but home health agencies are struggling under a mountain of burden of unnecessary and onerous regulations imposed by HCFA, imposed by the Clinton administration. In fact, my colleague may be interested to know that earlier this year I chaired a hearing of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations on home health care. We heard firsthand about the financial distress and cash-flow problems that home health agencies across the country are experiencing. In fact, the Senator has talked about the number that have closed in Kansas.  The Senator may already know, but for the benefit of my colleagues who may not be as well informed as the Senator from Kansas, more than 2,300 home health agencies across the country have been forced to close their doors as a result of the regulatory burden and the flawed payment system.  We heard witnesses talk about their frustrations. In fact, the CEO of the Visiting Nurses Service in Saco, ME, termed the Clinton administration's regulatory policy as being one of ``implement and suspend.'' She and others pointed to numerous examples of hastily enacted, ill-conceived requirements along the lines of what the Senatorpointed out--surety bonds, sequential billing, the OASIS system, a host of unnecessary regulatory requirements. What has happened is, no sooner does HCFA impose this burden on these home health agencies and they invest the costs necessary to comply, then HCFA changes its mind and suspends the regulatory requirements and says never mind.
