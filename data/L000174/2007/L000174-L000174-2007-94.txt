President, Senators are waiting to be recognized. I ask unanimous consent--the time allotted to me is 20-some-odd minutes--that when he is recognized, the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Sanders, be recognized for 12 of my 24 minutes. Perhaps while the next Senator is speaking, I will make an attempt to find out how much more time we have so I can report to the Senator from Pennsylvania. I ask unanimous consent that when he is recognized, the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Sanders, be recognized for 12 minutes of my time.
