 But before they do that--I hope to maybe go back and forth--I would like to ask to be able to lock in on this side, realizing that we will probably go the traditional way, back and forth on the bill on both sides, that it would be Senators Nelson, Menendez, Lieberman, Salazar, Durbin, and Kennedy.  What I was going to recommend is we ask people to be able to speak in 15-minute blocks, each one of them speaking for 15 minutes, realizing that if we work it this way, I would imagine the distinguished chairman would want 15 minutes on his side, and go back and forth.  So I would propound that following discussion by Senators Nelson and Martinez, recognizing the significant accomplishment for Florida, we have 15 minutes a side for discussion and that the Senators on our side in the slotted times be Senator Nelson of Florida, Senator Menendez, Senator Lieberman, Senator Salazar, Senator Durbin, and Senator Kennedy.
