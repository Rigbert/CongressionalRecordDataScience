President, we all witnessed from afar the horrors perpetrated in Rwanda a year ago when mostly Hutus massacred an estimated half million Tutsis. Just this past month, there was renewed violence in that country, including the deaths of Hutus implicated in the genocide. I believe many of the deaths in Rwanda during the past year could have been prevented if the international community had acted sooner to protect the thousands of innocent civilians who were mercilessly slaughtered.  Today, a similar situation is brewing in Rwanda's neighboring country, Burundi, where hatred and violence between Hutus and Tutsis over the past several years has intensified and caused tremendous turmoil and death. We regularly receive reports of killings of dozens, hundreds, even thousands of innocent men, women and children. Once again, we face the difficult question of how to respond.  After the catastrophe in Rwanda, inaction now by the international community would amount to nothing less than an assurance to people anywhere who would commit genocide that they need not fear being held to account.  Mr. President, the Central African country of Burundi has a history of ethnic tensions. However, the tensions between the two ethnic groups, Hutu and Tutsi, has more to do with economic status than ethnicity. While the Hutus represent 85 percent of the population, they are primarily impoverished, subsistence farmers. The wealthier, minority Tutsis, raise cattle.  Tensions intensified during German, and later Belgian colonialism. These Western powers allied themselves with the more European-like Tutsis to help manage the colonial government, fortifying Tutsi power. Since Burundi's independence in 1962, the Tutsis have maintained control of the country's wealth, politics, and the military, creating friction between Hutus and Tutsis. These tensions have been used periodically by extremist elements to divide Burundis, causing violent eruptions that pit the two ethnic groups against each other.  In 1993, the assassination of the first democratically elected President, Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu, plunged the country into chaos. Hutus seeking revenge for the assassination ignited a cycle of violence. During the 10-month period following the assassination, nearly 50,000 Burundis were slaughtered, and the Tutsi-dominated military seized power. The slaughter has bred intensified distrust and fear, and further violence on a similar scale is a real possibility.  The President was murdered by Tutsi military extremists who refused to accept the election results. They also were angered by Ndadaye's sensible policy of balancing Hutus with Tutsis in the military. The brewing unrest in Rwanda further contributed to the Burundi Tutsis' fear of losing their identity and power, and led to the coup. The army has propped up Tutsi power in the recent past, and is a key element in deciding Burundi's future. The army is now acting as a de facto government and is becoming increasingly politicized and radicalized.  Extremists on both sides are using the ethnicity card to spread fear and distrust and consolidate their power, making reconciliation more difficult. Former Texas Senator Robert Krueger, now the U.S. ambassador, says Burundi is the most fearful society he has ever witnessed.  The trouble is not limited to Burundi alone. The conflict is a regional crisis. The renewed violence in Rwanda, which we thought was behind us, is spilling over into Burundi, Zaire and Tanzania, which are flooded with refugees. Recently, 70,000 Rwandan refugees and displaced Burundi civilians fled to the borders of Tanzania. Tanzania, already overwhelmed with refugees and displaced persons, closed its borders. Because of the international community's tenuous support, the Tanzanian Government feels it cannot handle the new influx of refugees without more help. Ngara, across the border from Tanzania, is now home to 450,000 refugees, more than double the local Tanzanian population. These camps area a humanitarian nightmare, with disease, massacres and riots a constant threat.  Delays of aid by some donor countries are causing refugee unrest and accusations that the reduced rations are part of a conspiracy by the United Nations and other relief organizations. This type of paranoia is fueling the hardliners' efforts to spread fear and destabilize the country. Even the Central African governments are becoming impatient with the donor community. Citing last year's failure of the international community to stop the Rwandan genocide, some have suggested scaling back the UN presence in Rwanda. Millions of Central Africans displaced by the violence depend on this assistance. The recent seizure of World Food Program trucks headed for Rwandan refugee camps in Burundi illustrate how serious the situation has become.  Despite the sickening brutality, the situation in Burundi is not hopeless. Although little public attention has been given to the frightening developments there, the administration and many humanitarian groups are working to encourage preventive measures to deter another calamity. It is imperative that the United States turn its full attention to Burundi, facilitating strategies to prevent genocide and regional instability.  Ambassador Krueger deserves great praise for reporting the atrocities, at considerable risk to his own safety. The world needs to know the truth about what is happening. We must also promote a sense of hope, confidence, and the possibility for overcoming the fear that threatens to explode into a spiral of violence. The atrocities must be exposed, but we must also put our energies into developing preventive and rehabilitative strategies, to counter the extremists and defuse tensions, and move beyond a short-term relief mentality. The Africans must be centrally involved in this process.  Efforts to support and reassure moderate elements in Burundi is essential. The U.N.'s Special Representative Ould-Abdallah is calling for strengthening the nationwide reconciliation campaign launched a few weeks ago. Moderates including the President, Prime Minister, Cabinet Members, Members of Congress, and party leaders are all actively involved in this campaign. We need to give these leaders political, moral and financial support. [[Page S7574]] Visits to the region by top U.S. officials are a good start. Party leaders have already denounced extremists in their parties.  These efforts at strengthening reconciliation will help focus the peoples' attention on the national debate set to take place in June or July. The debate is an open forum to address the complex issues of promoting and sustaining Burundi's democratic process and government. The National Debate has already begun with the establishment of its Technical Committee. Our strong, visible support for this forum will help discourage and deter the extremists and their hate press from inciting violence and gaining credibility.  We must continue to support the creation of a judicial commission to prosecute human rights violators. We need to help ensure that the army and others are accountable for their actions. We must strongly condemn all violence and assassinations.  We must also support the private voluntary organizations that are doing the lion's share of delivering relief aid. These groups need sufficient personnel, funding and political support to continue their work. Groups such as Parliamentarians for Global Action have helped to facilitate dialogue and begun the reconciliation process. Refugees International has done a tremendous job in focusing public attention on the crisis in Central Africa.  Mr. President, ever since former President Bush spoke of a new world order, the world has been anything but orderly. The threat of Communism has been replaced by shockingly brutal, ethnic conflicts that threaten to spread in the Balkans, the Middle East, Central Africa and elsewhere. In every case, innocent civilians bear the brunt of the violence.  The international community faces a profound, moral choice, in a world in which future man-made catastrophes are inevitable. Preventive measures are always preferable. But if they fail, and the violence in Burundi takes on the character and magnitude of what we witnessed in Rwanda, what will our answer be? Will we stand by in the face of genocide, or will we act to try to stop it? Will we watch passively and cast blame after the blood stops flowing, or will we and others intervene to save innocent lives?  After Somalia, there is no enthusiasm in the Congress for sending large numbers of American troops into the midst of a bloody conflict in Africa or anywhere else, where U.S. national security interests are not obviously threatened. On the other hand, to do nothing is to invite genocide. That is also unacceptable. Our security is our interest. But genocide is everybody's interest, wherever it occurs.  Mr. President, I believe the Rwanda experience compels us to respond differently to future crises of this sort, whether in Burundi or elsewhere. In Rwanda, 5 months after receiving a mandate to act, the U.N. still had no budget, no equipment, no humanitarian coordinator, no political strategy, and no logistical capability to rapidly deploy and sustain a peacekeeping force. As in past peacekeeping operations, the U.N. started from scratch. An estimated $200 million was needed, but only a fraction of that was raised. In the meantime, hundreds of thousands of people were slaughtered, and the international community is now spending hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars to feed and care for refugees, and to deal with the myriad of difficult problems Rwanda faces in the wake of the genocide. Not until the arrival of a small contingent of well-armed French troops, did the mayhem wane.  Peacekeeping, or some combination of peacekeeping and peacemaking, which in Rwanda-like situations I would prefer to call peacekeeping with muscle, could not only have saved thousands of innocent Rwandan lives, it could also have saved money. These should be our goals in the future.  To that end, the United States should vigorously seek international support for establishing a properly trained, fully equipped, U.N. force that can be deployed quickly to provide protection to civilians in Rwanda-like crises. The U.N. is the only overtly neutral organization that can fulfill this responsibility. I am not talking about a standing army, but rather small contingents of troops from a wide range of U.N. member states, specially trained, coordinated and equipped and ready to assemble quickly to respond with overwhelming force in humanitarian emergencies.  The role of such a force would not be nation-building. That is not the work of armies. Its mission would be humanitarian and deterrence. By preventing those who would slaughter thousands of innocent people from access to the targets of their hatred, and by offering those who might be coerced into taking part in genocide a safe haven if they refuse, tensions can be defused and crises averted.  The U.N. Secretary General should have sufficient funds at his disposal to support the early deployment of such a force. It should be further buttressed with a U.N. media capability to publicize its activities, and to counter the kinds of inflammatory radio broadcasts that incited Hutus to commit genocide in Rwanda.  The United States should be prepared to contribute its equipment, and even its troops to participate in such a force, although I believe it is preferable if the troops of the major powers are used in these situations only as a last resort. Nevertheless, there are financial costs and human risks involved, and the United States has an obligation, as the most powerful country, to do its part. That is the price of world leadership.  Mr. President, I am not the first to suggest the establishment of such a U.N. capability. It is not peacekeeping. It is not peacemaking. It is life saving. And it is urgently needed in today's violent, post cold war world.                          ____________________
