Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, the resolution before us today is also a statement on behalf of the Members of this body that we expect better television programming than perhaps what is being offered today to our children and our families to survive the ratings battle. The broadcast networks do spend a considerable amount of time trying to develop sound, family-friendly programming that consumers will watch. Unfortunately, all too often this type of programming does not receive the high ratings necessary to keep those series on the air. This is unfortunate, but the networks should not give up hope or stop trying to improve the quality of their TV offerings.  I am pleased that the House today has an opportunity to consider H. Con. Res. 184. I am hopeful that the other body will soon offer a companion resolution. I would also like to acknowledge the leadership of the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Portman) for bringing this issue to the attention of the Committee on Commerce. I am also hopeful that the Committee on Commerce members will have an opportunity to consider the impact of media outlets on the culture of the Nation in the near future.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Portman).
