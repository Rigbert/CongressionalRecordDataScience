Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute and to honor Kalamazoo Public Schools' recently announced scholarship program: The Kalamazoo Promise. In a single word this program is tremendous. It is difficult to comprehend, but through the extreme generosity of an anonymous donor, or group of donors, every student enrolled in Kalamazoo Public Schools will now have the opportunity of receiving scholarship funding to attend one of Michigan's many superb public colleges.  The Kalamazoo Promise will cover 100 percent of tuition and mandatory fees for graduates who have been enrolled in KPS since kindergarten and whose parents live in the school district. A partial scholarship of between 65 and 95 percent will be given to students who enter after kindergarten and before 10th grade.  This is such terrific news for the folks of the Kalamazoo community. This remarkable scholarship program will promote a better educated work force, a friendly place to do business, and an unprecedented boom to business and economic development.  A college education is the dream of our youngsters, and this great program will turn dreams into reality for literally thousands of students. With the ever rising costs of higher education, the Kalamazoo Promise sets a new incentive for our students to work hard and earn good grades so that they can attend a college of their choice.  I would especially like to thank the donors whose generosity will not only bring the dream of a college education to the future of our students, but will also continue to make Kalamazoo a great place to live. I would like to also congratulate KPS Superintendent Janice Brown on this wonderful gift.                          ____________________
