 President, this is a very complicated amendment. This is in the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. It deals with the truth in lending law. We have not had any hearings on this issue. I would be glad to work with the Senator from Hawaii. We can sit down and see if we can do something on this issue. To bring it up on the Senate floor and try to make it part of the bankruptcy bill and bypass the Banking Committee is something we should not do. I hope we will not. I oppose the amendment.
