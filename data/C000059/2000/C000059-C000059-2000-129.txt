Speaker, I rise today to honor and commend a group of individuals who have dedicated their lives to the Inland Empire's veterans in need. There is no more appropriate time than Memorial Day to recognize the men and women who serve at the Riverside Veterans Center in Riverside, California.  The Riverside Vets Center was established in 1981 and has served over 6500 veterans and their families. At the Riverside Vets Center, veterans receive needed counseling, are involved in outreach programs with local schools and community-oriented volunteer programs, work with homeless veterans and participate in social activities. Recently, a writing group established at the Center by Leonard Reims and several other veterans, created and published a moving and inspiring collection of poems entitled ``Windows to our Souls.''  I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the fine staff whose dedication, passion and commitment ensure that the necessary services are available to these veterans. The current and former members of the staff who have made a major impact on these veterans include: head counselor Thomas ``Buddy'' Hawkins, Max Greenwald, Eleanor Parham, Marion Wilson and Rosendo Reyes.  Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I would also like to give special recognition to Bill Densmore with the Riverside County Vets Service Office, VFW Post 9223 and the Vietnam Vets of America Chapter 47 for their active involvement and support of the Riverside Vets Center.  On behalf of the veterans in California's 43rd District, thank you!                          ____________________
