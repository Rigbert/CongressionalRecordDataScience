President, I rise to speak on legislation I am introducing today that relates to congenital heart disease research. Congenital heart disease is a rapidly growing national health problem. Congenital heart defects are the most common and most deadly form of birth defects, affecting nearly 1 percent of births, approximately 36,000 a year. In fact, a child is born with a congenital heart defect every 15 minutes. A congenital heart defect occurs when heart structures are malformed, missing or in the wrong place. There are over 30 types of congenital heart defects. These defects cause congenital heart disease--cardiovascular problems caused by the birth defect.  The good news is that modern medicine has made major advances in treating heart defects in newborns. In 1950, a child born with a congenital heart defect only had a 20 percent chance of surviving, but today that number has increased to 90 percent. Due to the increase in childhood survival rates, the congenital heart disease population increases by an estimated 5 percent every year.  However, the bad news is that there is no cure for congenital heart disease. Even survivors of successful childhood intervention face lifelong risks, including heart failure, rhythmic disorders, stroke, renal dysfunction, and neurocognitive dysfunction. Sadly, the estimated life expectancy for those with congenital heart disease is significantly lower than for the general population. The life expectancy for those born with moderately complex heart defects is 55, while the estimated life expectancy for those born with highly complex defects is between 35 and 40.  Unfortunately, fewer than 10 percent of adults living with complex congenital heart disease currently receive the cardiac care they need, and many don't know that they should have life-long specialized health surveillance. Even with access to the best care, living with congenital heart disease involves risk. But for people who don't have the medical care or who don't have it promptly, the risks of premature death or disability are much higher.  In 2004, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened a working group on congenital heart disease. This group recommended developing a research network for clinical research, establishing a national database of patients, and creating an outreach education program on the need for continued cardiac care.  Today, I am pleased to introduce the Congenital Heart Futures Act, which builds on these recommendations in several ways. First, the legislation authorizes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, to lead a comprehensive public education and awareness campaign around congenital heart disease. Next, it authorizes a National Congenital Heart Disease Registry at the CDC to track the epidemiology of congenital heart disease and creates an advisory committee to provide expert information and advice to CDC. And, finally, it authorizes congenital heart disease research through NHLBI.  Despite the prevalence and seriousness of congenital heart disease, research, data collection, education, and awareness are limited. The Congenital Heart Futures Act will help prevent premature death and disability in this rapidly growing but dramatically underserved population.  I say to those who are interested in promoting health research, this is an area where we can expend more effort and save more lives. I hope my colleagues will take a look at this legislation which we are introducing today and join me in cosponsoring it.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed int he Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be placed in the Record as follows:                                 S. 621         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives      of the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Congenital Heart Futures      Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:         (1) Congenital heart defects are the most common and most      deadly group of birth defects and affect nearly 1 percent of      all live     births, approximately 36,000 births a year. A child is born      with a congenital heart defect every 15 minutes.         (2) Congenital heart disease is a rapidly-growing      national health problem. Childhood survival has risen from      below 20 percent in 1950 to more than 90 percent today. Due      to the increase in childhood survival, the congenital heart      disease population increases by an estimated 5 percent every      year.         (3) Approximately 800,000 children and 1,000,000 adults      in the United States are now living with congenital heart      disease and require highly-specialized life-long cardiac      care.         (4) There is no cure for congenital heart disease. Even      survivors of successful childhood treatment can face life-     long risks from congenital heart disease, including heart      failure, rhythmic disorders, stroke, renal dysfunction, and      neurocognitive dysfunction.         (5) Less than 10 percent of adults living with complex      congenital heart disease currently receive recommended      cardiac care. Many individuals with congenital heart disease      are unaware that they require life-long specialized health      surveillance. Delays in care can result in premature death      and disability.         (6) The estimated life expectancy for those with      congenital heart disease is significantly lower than for the      general population. The life expectancy for those born with      moderately complex heart defects is 55, while the estimated      life expectancy for those born with highly complex defects is      between 35 and 40.         (7) Despite the prevalence and seriousness of the      disease, Federal research, data collection, education, and      awareness activities are limited.         (8) The strategic plan of the National Heart, Lung, and      Blood Institute completed in 2007 notes that ``successes over      several decades have enabled people with congenital heart      diseases to live beyond childhood, but too often inadequate      data are available to guide their treatment as adults''.         (9) The strategic plan for the Division of Cardiovascular      Diseases at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute,      completed in 2008, set goals for congenital heart disease      research, including understanding the development and genetic      basis of congenital heart disease, improving evidence-based      care and treatment of children with congenital and acquired      pediatric heart disease, and improving evidence-based care      and treatment of adults with congenital heart disease.     SEC. 3. PUBLIC EDUCATION AND AWARENESS OF CONGENITAL HEART                    DISEASE.
