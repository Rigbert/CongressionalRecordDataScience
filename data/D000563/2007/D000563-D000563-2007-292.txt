President, I rise today to honor a great man, Representative George Sangmeister, a great servant of Illinois who passed away on October 9.  George served Illinois in more ways than anyone I know; his was a lifetime of dedicated public work, and honesty. I had the good fortune to work as a staff lawyer in the Illinois State Senate when George was serving there. He was kind and determined, and these traits have shown through his work, his family life, and his long battle with leukemia.  Not surprisingly, George came from a family of dedicated Illinoisans. His father was mayor of Frankfort from 1923 to 1955 and a great political influence on his son. George attended Joliet Junior College before entering the military to serve in the Korean war. He was always proud of his service, and it informed many of his initiatives. He always took time to pay tribute to our warriors and veterans.  After serving in the Korean war, George attended Elmhurst College and earned a law degree from John Marshall Law School. He spent some time in private practice, but was always active in the public realm. He was a volunteer for President Kennedy's 1960 election and eventually returned fulltime to his public service origins.  George started as a magistrate for Will County and then served as the county's district attorney. In 1972, he was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives and then to the Illinois Senate in 1976.  George was a natural. One of his peers recently noted that ``George was one of those individuals who had an unbelievable capability of bringing parties together.'' He was direct yet pleasant; he would stick to his position but never alienated those who disagreed. George was widely known as a man of his word, and a true statesman--traits that are in short supply in too many places.  His integrity and talent led him to become a powerful leader in the State senate, and a respected Member of the House of Representatives. He served three terms in the House from 1988 to 1994, and I was again privileged to work with him during those historical years.  As the cold war wound down, his attentions turned increasingly to our environment, our children, and our ability to adjust to a new world order. He joined me in pushing to ensure that newly independent nations such as Lithuania would be guaranteed an opportunity to prosper. George was keenly aware of our Nation's freedom, independence and our history. He regularly addressed his colleagues on Independence Day, rising to remind us all of our political origins and the things we must be grateful for.  He spoke often on veterans' affairs, the environment, education, and on issues that directly impacted his constituents in Illinois. He was unmovable when it came to fiercely fighting for the constituents that he had served for so many years and in so many ways. Frustrated with national politics, George returned to private practice in 1995, after more than 30 years in public service.  George is survived by his wife Doris, their children George and Kimberly, and four grandchildren. I have expressed my condolences to them in person and assure them now that George's unblemished reputation and service will be long remembered.  George was a great man and a great friend, and I feel that nothing is more fitting than to conclude his presence in the Congressional Record with his own words. They are indicative of a man who maintained his idealism and values throughout life's trials--a man unafraid to speak boldly during dramatic times.       We should begin to worry about educating brilliant children      so that America can face the next challenge. Having served in      the U.S. Army myself, I strongly believe that national      security should be a top priority for the Federal Government.      But national security includes having a strong economy and a      healthy, well-educated work force . . . What is more      important than educating our kids and preserving our      environment? . . . As a people, we were not defeated by Pearl      Harbor or Watergate or Irangate, and we will survive. But, we      must be ever vigilant against the abuse and arrogance of      power, whether it be on Wall Street or on Main Street--     whether it be by big business or by big government. To fail      in our vigilance would mean the death of ``power people.''      And so, let us, as a united people, ``highly resolve that      this Nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom, and      that government of the people, by the people, and for the      people shall not perish from the earth.''                          ____________________
