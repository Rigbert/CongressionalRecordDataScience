President, I am delighted to be joined today by my colleagues, Mike Johanns and Sherrod Brown, in introducing the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act of 2014. We are pleased to be joined by Senators Kirk and Tester as cosponsors. This legislation clarifies the Federal Reserve's authority to recognizethe distinctions between banking and insurance when implementing section 171 of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly referred to as the ``Collins Amendment'' since I wrote this provision of the law.  Before I describe our bill in detail, I would like to provide some background on section 171 and why it is so important that nothing be done to diminish or weaken it.  We all recall the circumstances we faced 4 years ago, as our Nation was emerging from the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression. That crisis had many causes, but among the most important was the fact that some of our nation's largest financial institutions were dangerously undercapitalized, while at the same time, they held interconnected assets and liabilities that could not be disentangled in the midst of a crisis.  The failure of these over-leveraged financial institutions threatened to bring the American economy to its knees. As a consequence, the federal government was forced to step in to prop-up financial institutions that were considered ``too big to fail.'' Little has angered the American public more than these taxpayer-funded bailouts.  That is the context in which I offered my capital standards amendment, which became section 171 of Dodd-Frank. Section 171 is aimed at addressing the ``too big to fail'' problem at the root of the 2008-2009 crisis by requiring large financial holding companies to maintain a level of capital at least as high as that required for our nation's community banks, equalizing their minimum capital requirements, and eliminating the incentive for banks to become ``too big to fail.''  Incredibly, prior to the passage of Section 171, the capital and risk standards for our Nation's largest financial institutions were more lax than those that applied to smaller depository banks, even though the failure of larger institutions was much more likely to trigger the kind of cascade of economic harm that we experienced during the crisis. Section 171 gave the regulators the tools, and the direction, to fix this problem.  It is important to recognize that Section 171 allows the federal regulators to take into account the significant distinctions between banking and insurance, and the implications of those distinctions for capital adequacy. I have written to the financial regulators on more than one occasion to underscore this point. For example, in a November 26, 2012, letter I stressed that it was not Congress's intent to replace State-based insurance regulation with a bank-centric capital regime. For that reason, I called upon the federal regulators to acknowledge the distinctions between banking and insurance, and to take those distinctions into account in the final rules implementing Section 171.  While the Federal Reserve has acknowledged the important distinctions between insurance and banking, it has repeatedly suggested that it lacks authority to take those distinctions into account when implementing the consolidated capital standards required by Section 171. As I have already said, I do not agree that the Fed lacks this authority and find its disregard of my clear intent as the author of section 171 to be frustrating, to say the least. Experts testifying before the Financial Institutions and Consumer Protection subcommittee of the Senate Banking Committee, chaired by Senator Brown, concur that the Federal Reserve has ample authority to draw these distinctions.  Nevertheless, the bill we are introducing today clarifies the Federal Reserve's authority to recognize the distinctions between insurance and banking.  Specifically, our legislation would add language to section 171 to clarify that, in establishing minimum capital requirements for holding companies on a consolidated basis, the Federal Reserve is not required to include insurance activities so long as those activities are regulated as insurance at the State level. Our legislation also provides a mechanism for the Federal Reserve, acting in consultation with the appropriate State insurance authority, to provide similar treatment for foreign insurance entities within a U.S. holding company where that entity does not itself do business in the United States. In addition, our legislation directs the Fed not to require insurers which file holding company financial statements using Statutory Accounting Principles to instead prepare their financial statements using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  I should point out that our legislation does not, in any way, modify or supersede any other provision of law upon which the Federal Reserve may rely to set appropriate holding company capital requirements.  In closing, I want to thank my colleagues, Senators Brown and Johanns, for working so hard with me over many months to help craft the language we are introducing today. I believe our language removes any doubt about the Federal Reserve's authority to address the legitimate concerns raised by insurers that they not have a bank-centric capital regime for their insurance activities imposed upon them. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a letter of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2270       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Re Regulatory Capital Rules: Regulatory Capital,          Implementation of Basel III, Minimum Regulatory Capital          Ratios, Capital Adequacy, Transition Provisions, and          Prompt Corrective Action (RIN 3064-AD95); Regulatory          Capital Rules: Standardized Approach for Risk-weighted          Assets; Market Discipline and Disclosure Requirements          (RIN 3064-AD96); Regulatory Capital Rules: Advanced-         Approaches Risk-Based Capital Rule; Market Risk Capital          Rule (RN 3064-AD87).       Dear Chairman Bernanke, Acting Chairman Gruenberg, and      Comptroller Curry: I am writing to comment on the proposed      rules implementing the Basel III regulatory capital      framework.       As the author of Section 171 (the ``Collins Amendment'') of      the Dodd-Frank Act, I believe strongly that capital      requirements must ensure that firms have an adequate capital      cushion in difficult economic times, and provide a      disincentive to their becoming `too big to fail.' To achieve      this, Section 171 requires that large bank holding companies      be subject, at a minimum, to the same capital requirements      that small community banks have traditionally faced.       During consideration of the Dodd-Frank Act, I supported      modifications to the final language to Section 171 to ensure      a smooth transition to increased capital standards. Among      these modifications were provisions to delay, for five years,      the application of new capital requirements for savings and      loan holding companies (``SLHCs''), and for certain foreign-     owned bank holding companies. See subsections (b)(4)(D) and      (E) of Section 171. These modifications were intended to      allow these entities the time they need to adjust their      balance sheets and capital levels in order to come into      compliance with the new capital standards. The proposed rules      implement the five year delay provided to foreign-owned bank      holding companies by Section 171 (b)(4)(E), but neglect to      implement the nearly identical delay for SLHCs provided by      Section 171 (b)(4)(E). I do not understand why the proposed      rules fail to implement this provision, as required by      Congressional intent and the clear language of the statute.       I am hopeful, too, that in crafting final rules, you will      give further consideration to the distinctions between      banking and insurance, and the implications of those      distinctions for capital adequacy. It is, of course,      essential that insurers with depository institution holding      companies in their corporate structure be adequately      capitalized on a consolidated basis. Even so, it was not      Congress's intent that federal regulators supplant prudential      state-based insurance regulation with a bank-centric capital      regime. Instead, consideration should be given to the      distinctions between banks and insurance companies, a point      which Chairman Bernanke rightly acknowledged in testimony      before the House Banking Committee this summer. For example,      banks and insurers typically have a different composition of      assets and liabilities, since it is fundamental to insurance      companies to match assets to liabilities, but this is not      characteristic of most banks. I believe it is consistent with      my amendment that these distinctions be recognized in the      final rules.       I am hopeful you will keep these concerns in mind as you      continue to implement the Dodd-Frank Act and the proposed      rules referenced above implementing the Basel III regulatory      capital framework.           Sincerely,                                                 Susan M. Collins,     United States Senator.                          ____________________
