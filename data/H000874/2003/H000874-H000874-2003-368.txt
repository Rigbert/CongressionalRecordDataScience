Leader, what happened, as I recall, was Mr. Nickles and Mrs. Clinton agreed on a bill that was then passed overwhelmingly by the Senate in response to our bill and sent here. In fact, some 2\1/2\ months later we adopted a very similar piece of legislation, but only after people had gone off for 4 weeks their extended benefits.  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will yield, I just remind the gentleman that our bill, the House bill, passed overwhelmingly by this House, and the Senate did pass their own bill, but our bills crossed in the night, and the Senate refused to take up our bill.  But be that as it may, the extensions are there, and certainly we are interested in taking suggestions from Members about how we would accomplish this in the shortest period of time. But I must tell the gentleman that the best way to take care of people that are unemployed is to find them a job, and, to do that, pass the job and economic growth package, the energy package, a transportation package and a pension security package.  All the economic development packages that this House has been in the lead on, it would be nice to get them through the other body and to the President so that jobs can be created and people can find a job, rather than have to rely on unemployment benefits.
