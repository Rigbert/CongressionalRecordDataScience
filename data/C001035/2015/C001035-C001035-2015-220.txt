President, Alzheimer's is a terrible disease that takes a tremendous personal and economic toll on the individual, the family, and society. In addition to the human suffering it causes, Alzheimer's costs the United States an estimated $226 billion a year, including $153 billion from the Medicare and Medicaid Programs. These costs will only skyrocket as the baby boom generation ages. Already our Nation's costliest disease, Alzheimer's is projected to cost more than $1.1 trillion if nothing is done to change its current trajectory. It is now estimated that nearly one in two of the baby boomers reaching age 85 will develop Alzheimer's. As a consequence, chances are that members of the baby boom generation will either be spending their golden years suffering with Alzheimer's or caring for someone who has it. In many ways Alzheimer's has become the defining disease of this generation.  If we are to prevent Alzheimer's from becoming the defining disease of the next generation, it is imperative that we dramatically increase our investment in Alzheimer's research. At a time when the United States is spending some $226 billion a year caring for Alzheimer's patients, we are spending less than three-tenths of 1 percent of that amount--under $600 million a year--on research. This makes no sense. We currently spend $4.5 billion a year for cancer research, $3 billion a year for research on HIV-AIDS, and $2 billion for cardiovascular research--all investments that have paid dividends.  Surely we can do more for Alzheimer's given the tremendous human and economic price of this devastating disease. Investments in research for other diseases have yielded tremendous results. We see that with cancer, with HIV/AIDS. Patients have access to new treatments, and death rates for some of these diseases are decreasing. At the same time, mortality due to Alzheimer's is escalating.  Alzheimer's is one of our Nation's leading causes of death, with recent data revealing that each year more than 500,000 deaths are attributable to Alzheimer's and other dementia, 6 times the amount previously estimated. Moreover, Alzheimer's is the only one of our Nation's top 10 deadliest diseases without an effective means of prevention, treatment or a cure.  Fortunately there is promising research that holds hope for Alzheimer's patients and their families. The research community is poised to make important advances through clinical trials and by investigating new therapeutic targets, but adequate funding is critical to achieve this promise. The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease was authorized by the bipartisan National Alzheimer's Act, which I coauthored with then-Senator Evan Bayh.  The national plan has as its primary goal to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease by the year 2025. The chairman of the advisory council that was created by the act, Dr. Ronald Petersen of the Mayo Clinic, has testified before Congress that the United States should be devoting $2 billion a year at a minimum to Alzheimer's research in order to reach that goal.  A dramatic increase in funding for Alzheimer's research will not just save lives, it will also save money. According to a report issued by the Alzheimer's Association last year, a Federal investment of $2 billion a year between now and the year 2025, as recommended by the experts on the Alzheimer's Advisory Council and the scientific community more broadly, would be recouped within the first 3 years after a treatment delaying the onset of Alzheimer's by just 5 years becomes available.  I am therefore pleased to be introducing today, with my colleagues Senators Klobuchar, Mikulski, Warner, Durbin, and Stabenow, a resolution declaring that the goal of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's is an urgent national priority. In recognition of the fact that bold action and considerable increases in funding are necessary to meet that goal, our resolution states that the Senate will strive to double the amount of funding the United States spends on Alzheimer's research in fiscal year 2016 and that we will develop a plan to meet the target of $2 billion over the next 5 years.  Our bill is supported by a number of organizations including the Alzheimer's Association, UsAgainstAlzheimer's, the Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease--or the LEAD Coalition--and the Alzheimer's Foundation of America.  I ask unanimous consent that the letters from these organizations be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                             LEAD--Leaders Engaged                                       on Alzheimer's Disease,                                                February 11, 2015.     Hon. Susan Collins,     Chairman, Special Committee on Aging, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Collins: As executive director of Leaders      Engaged on Alzheimer's Disease (the LEAD Coalition), I write      to thank you for your inspirational leadership in      reintroducing the Senate resolution to strengthen care and      support, encourage greater international collaboration,      incentivize private sector research, double federal      investments in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias      research in FY 2016, and bring annual federal investments to      at least $2 billion by 2020. Your resolution is an important      next step toward each of these vital goals and the LEAD      Coalition will continue to work arm-in-arm with you and your      colleagues to realize the resolution's promise.       There are few more compelling or complex issues to confront      our aging society now and over the coming decades than      Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (including      vascular, Lewy body or frontotemporal dementia). Its place as      a national priority was made clear by the effort you led      resulting in unanimous congressional passage of the National      Alzheimer's Project Act. That law directed creation of the      National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease and, as you      know, the National Plan's goal number one is to prevent and      effectively treat Alzheimer's disease and related dementias      by 2025.       In fact, as your resolution highlights, Alzheimer's disease      and related dementias are an urgent national priority that      impose enormous costs to our nation's health and prosperity,      costs that are skyrocketing. Today, more than five million      Americans have dementia at an annual cost to our economy      exceeding $200 billion. Alzheimer's disease contributes to      the deaths of approximately 500,000 Americans each year,      making it the third leading cause of death in the United      States. If the current trajectory of the disease persists,      between 13 million and 16 million Americans will have      dementia in 2050 and total costs of care are projected to      exceed (inflation adjusted 2014 dollars) $1 trillion      annually. The federal government, through Medicare and      Medicaid payments, shoulders an estimated 70 percent of all      such direct care costs.       Globally, the stakes of American scientific leadership are      higher still. Today, 44 million people have dementia with      annual costs exceeding $600 billion or about one percent of      the world's GDP. If the current trajectory of the disease      persists, upwards of 135 million persons worldwide will have      dementia in 2050. American scientific leadership is nowhere      more urgent than in Alzheimer's disease and related      dementias.       Congress, the President and NIH Director Dr. Francis      Collins have overcome enormous obstacles to increase funding      and prioritization of Alzheimer's disease and related      dementias research over the past several years. The National      Institute an Aging (NIA) and other NIH institutes--such as      the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,      the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and      Bioengineering, the National Institute of Mental Health and      the National Institute of Child Health and Human      Development--are supporting a number of promising research      projects to: understand the genetic risk factors, address the      disproportionate impact on women, African Americans,      Hispanics, and persons with intellectual disabilities; and      pursue cutting-edge but costly and time consuming trials      aimed at preventing or substantially slowing disease      progression by administering treatments much earlier in the      disease process. These resources of time, talent and treasure      are precious and indefensibly scarce. We owe it to the      taxpayers, to the research community and--most of all--to      people living with, or at risk of, Alzheimer's disease and      related dementias to provide adequate and necessary resources      proportionate to the disease burden, unmet medical need, and      our nation's ethical and moral compass.       The broad, diverse, and unified Alzheimer's disease and      related dementias community--working together as the LEAD      Coalition--deeply admires and appreciates your remarkable      leadership on this and so many other issues of vital      importance to our nation's cognitive health, economic well-     being, and global scientific leadership. We look forward to      working with you for passage of the resolution and subsequent      congressional action on each of its goals.           Sincerely,                                             Ian Kremer, Esq.,                                               Executive Director,                                                   LEAD Coalition.                                       ____                                          USAgainstAlzheimers,                                                February 10, 2015.     Hon. Susan Collins,     Chairman, Special Committee on Aging, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Collins: On behalf of USAgainstAlzheimers,      the national movement committed to mobilizing the nation      around the goal of stopping Alzheimer's by 2020, I am writing      to applaud you for recognizing the mounting threat of      Alzheimer's and dementia and for leading the call for the      level of public resources that are necessary to stop this      disease before it destroys our nation's health and finances.       As you are well aware from your extensive history of      leadership against Alzheimer's and dementia, more than five      million Americans are currently suffering from this disease,      and millions more are impacted as family members and      caregivers. Economic estimates suggest that Alzheimer's      disease costs the nation upwards of $200 billion each year,      with about 70 percent of costs shouldered by Medicare and      Medicaid. Direct care costs of Alzheimer's have been found to      be larger than similar costs of cancer and heart disease, and      a groundbreaking 2014 study from Rush University indicates      that more than 500,000 deaths each year are attributable to      Alzheimer's disease, six times more than the levels that have      been reported by the Centers for Disease Control and      Prevention (CDC).       Fortunately, thanks to your leadership several years ago,      our nation has a National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease      that established as goal one preventing and effectively      treating the disease by 2025, a mere 10 years away. As your      resolution recognizes, while we can set bold goals, we simply      will not achieve them absent the appropriation of necessary      resources. I commend you for being a champion in Congress      behind measures to substantially increase the amount of      public resources committed to Alzheimer's disease research so      we can reach the level of $2 billion in annual funding that      multiple experts have estimated as being needed to maximize      our chances of achieving the 2025 goal.       I understand the multiple fiscal challenges confronting the      nation. At the same time, we must recognize that the question      is not whether or not we will pay for Alzheimer's. We are      paying, dearly, today, and we will pay even more tomorrow      unless we redouble efforts to achieve scientific      breakthroughs and develop therapies and means of prevention.      Your resolution outlines a sensible track to achieve the      necessary level of funding within a timeframe during which we      can achieve the necessary impact, and makes clear that      preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease must be a      national priority.       Thank you, again, for your tremendous leadership on behalf      of all Americans impacted by this disease.           Sincerely,                                                George Vradenburg,     Founder and Chairman.                                  ____                                      Alzheimer's Association,                                Washington, DC, February 11, 2015.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Amy Klobuchar,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins and Senator Klobuchar: On behalf of      the Alzheimer's Association and its nationwide network of      advocates, thank you for your continued leadership on issues      and legislation important to Americans with Alzheimer's and      their caregivers. The Alzheimer's Association proudly      supports your most recent Alzheimer's resolution, which      supports the goals of National Plan to Address Alzheimer's      Disease.       The Alzheimers Association is the world's leading voluntary      health organization in Alzheimers care, support and research.      Our mission is to eliminate Alzheimer's disease and other      dementias through the advancement of research; to provide and      enhance care and support for all affected; and to reduce the      risk of dementia through the promotion of brain health. Our      vision is a world without Alzheimer's.       As one of our nation's strongest voices on behalf of      Americans living with Alzheimer's, you know that more than 5      million Americans are living with the disease, and without      significant action, as many as 16 million Americans will have      Alzheimer's by 2050. A 2013 study funded by the National      Institutes of Health (NIH) and published in the New England      Journal of Medicine further confirmed that Alzheimers disease      is the most expensive disease in America. Additionally, as      the baby boomer generation ages, one in eight will develop      Alzheimer's. This explosive growth will cause Alzheimers      costs to Medicare and Medicaid to increase from $153 billion      today to nearly $800 billion in 2050 (in today's dollars) and      threatens to bankrupt families, businesses and our health      care system. Unfortunately, our work is only growing more      urgent.       The passage of the National Alzheimer's Project Act in      2010, and the subsequent release of the National Plan to      Address Alzheimer's Disease, marks a new era for Alzheimers      disease and other dementias. Achieving the first goal of the      National Plan, to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's      disease by 2025, and supporting individuals with the disease      and their caregivers are critical to the success of this      legislation.       The Alzheimers Association deeply appreciates your      continued leadership on behalf of all American's living with      Alzheimer's. If you have any questions about this or any      other legislation, please contact Rachel Conant, Director of      Federal Affairs, at [email protected] or at 202.638.7121.           Sincerely,                                                  Robert Egge,                                         Executive Vice President,                      Government Affairs, Alzheimer's Association.
