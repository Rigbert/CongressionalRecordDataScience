 President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported substitute amendment be withdrawn, the Cassidy substitute amendment at the desk be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and passed, the Cassidy title amendment be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.
