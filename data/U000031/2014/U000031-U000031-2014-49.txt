Speaker, on February 17th, we lost an extraordinary American with the passing of James C. Dowdle, who was 79. I rise today to do something a bit out of character. As many folks know, I am a proud University of Michigan Wolverine. Jim, on the other hand, was a Notre Dame grad. In the Midwest, the Wolverines and Fighting Irish mix, at least in athletics, about as well as the Hatfields and McCoys. In fact, Jim was a physically gifted athlete who played basketball for the Irish. It takes a special individual for me to put aside a rivalry that runs that deep. Jim Dowdle was that unique.  I got to know Jim on a professional level. He was hired by Tribune Company in Chicago in the early 1980s to head its broadcast operations until his retirement in 1999. Tribune Company remains the largest media company headquartered in the Midwest. Of particular interest to me, Jim engineered the Tribune's purchase of the Chicago Cubs from the Wrigley family. As a lifelong, diehard Cubs fan, Jim and I agonized over the team's progress many an afternoon at Wrigley Field. Jim also persuaded legendary Hall of Fame broadcaster Harry Caray to be the Cubs' play-by-play announcer on Tribune's WGN-TV. That powerful combination spread WGN's telecasts throughout the land as cable systems and home satellites grew WGN into a national superstation. What makes the story even more remarkable is that Jim was a proud Irish-American son of Chicago's Southside, that sliver of greater Chicagoland where your allegiance is to the White Sox and whatever team is playing the Cubs. Jim used to say, ``Thank God my father is buried in Calvary Cemetery. If he knew I bought the Cubs, I'm not sure he would talk to me.'' Over the years, Jim gambled on the future of television--investing in little-known cable channels such as the Food Network and others, adding to Tribune's broadcast station holdings, the value of which is now in the billions.  Jim Dowdle's family and civic legacy is just as remarkable. He married his beloved Sally Sayers in 1956 shortly after graduating from Notre Dame. To all, they are known as Honey and Doods. He was the father of five and grandfather of eighteen. At his funeral Mass, nine handsome grandsons, all at least six foot two, dressed in suits and Kelly green ties, served as pallbearers. At the altar, two Catholic monsignors, twelve priests and his godson (a deacon) celebrated his Mass before as many as 1,500 mourners--a powerful, visible testament to a life well led.  Long before I got to know him, Jim had conquered alcohol addiction. For decades, he counseled countless others, often complete strangers. When the word spread that Jim was nearing death, the family received numerous calls and messages from people who wanted them to know how Jim Dowdle had impacted them--saving careers, marriages, and lives. Without those unsolicited testimonials, no one would have known.  A former Marine lieutenant, years later, Jim received the Marine Corps' Semper Fidelis Award. He also received the broadcast industry's highest honor, the National Association of Broadcasters' Distinguished Service Award, as well as the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences' Trustee Award and induction into the Broadcasting and Cable Hall of Fame. A devout Catholic, Jim was a director of Mundelein Seminary's Board of Advisors and Big Shoulders Fund. He served as a former board chairman of Junior Achievement of Chicago, director of Loyola University's Health Systems, director of Robert R. McCormick Foundation, director of Hazelden Chicago, and trustee of Chicago's Museum ofScience and Industry. I mention these. There are more.  Throughout his remarkable life, Jim Dowdle never lost the common touch. He stayed humble. He volunteered. He served. He gave. He never forgot what is truly important in life. I think the Marine's motto aptly describes the great man: ``Semper Fidelis!'' Always Faithful! It was my great privilege to know him and my honor to pay tribute. God bless Jim Dowdle.                          ____________________
