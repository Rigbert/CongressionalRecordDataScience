Mr. Speaker, I rise to convey to the House the extremely sad news that our former colleague from New Jersey, John Adler, passed away earlier today. Congressman Adler recently underwent emergency heart surgery at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital in an attempt to resolve a staph infection. John Adler was 51.  In Congress, John served with distinction on both the Financial Services and Veterans' Affairs Committees. As a New Jersey State Senator for 17 years, John served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and sponsored laws requiring pension forfeitures and mandatory prison for corrupt officials and to require smoke-free places. He also sponsored legislation to address environmental and health issues.  Mr. Speaker, John Adler had a razor-sharp wit, tenacity, an extraordinary sense of humor and a great big smile, and we will miss him. I, along with my colleagues, extend our deepest condolences to Shelley, his wife, and their four sons.                          ____________________
