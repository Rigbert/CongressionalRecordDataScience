President, I concur with my colleague from Connecticut that we need to give special attention to children in Afghanistan and elsewhere who are being put at risk by landmines and unexploded ordnances that are a dangerous byproduct of the civil conflict in that country. Creative ways to teach children about the dangers that landmines and unexploded ordnances pose is critically needed to prevent any more innocent Afghani children from being killed or crippled. I believe that organizations, such as ``No Strings'' which has been mentioned by Senator Dodd, that are prepared to develop novel programs to protect children from the dangers of landmines are worthy of US support. I look forward to working with Senator Dodd in support of funding for such important projects.                  international water security center
