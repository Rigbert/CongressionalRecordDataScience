Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I think everybody in this House knows that when I make an agreement, I keep it. As I said, I think everybody in this Chamber knows that if I make a commitment, I keep it. I agreed not to press the point of order at the beginning of the debate so the gentlewoman could have time, and we agreed that each side would have 15 minutes. She had her 15 minutes and then went on to violate the agreement by taking another 5 minutes.  I am not going to respond in kind or rebut this at all; but the point is, the arguments of the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi) should be made on an authorizing bill.
