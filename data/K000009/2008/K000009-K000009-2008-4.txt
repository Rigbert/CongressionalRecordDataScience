I know how hard Congressman Jim McDermott has worked on this legislation. And I have to say I come to the microphone with a heavy heart, because I obviously did not support the $870 billion for Wall Street, and now we come with $6 billion, 6 precious billion dollars that these people earned and sent into the tax coffers of this country. And we are going to give it back to them as a gift?  I am getting tired as a Democrat of picking up the wreckage across America. When is my party really going to stand up to Wall Street and the outsourcing of jobs? This isn't good enough. This isn't good enough for the people who have sent us here. They have earned it. Those people at Treasury didn't earn it. Wall Street didn't earn it. They squandered our money.  So today, because of Congressman McDermott's leadership, at least we have a lifeline to the people who are paying the tax dollars. They are going to be rerouted to Wall Street and then they are going to send half of it abroad.  I rise in support of this legislation because it is the least we should do, but it isn't the most we should be doing.
