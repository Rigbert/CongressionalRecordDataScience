Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing legislation which will correct a longstanding injustice to the Chugach native people of my great State of Alaska. Twenty-six years ago, Congress passed the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [ANCSA] to settle the aboriginal land claims of Alaska natives. ANCSA, though not perfect, was a bold and innovative approach to settle the issue of native land claims. Its main purpose was to convey lands traditionally used by Alaska natives to a native regional or native village corporation for their use to secure long-term cultural and economic benefits for their shareholders.  In 1980, I worked with many of my colleagues in this body to pass the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act [ANILCA] which, among other things, contained a provision which guaranteed access to Alaska Native corporations to their ANCSA lands. Without this access to their native lands selected under ANCSA, the act itself would become meaningless.  Twenty-six years after the passage of ANCSA, and 15 years since the U.S. Forest Service and the Chugach Alaska Corporation entered into the ``1982 Settlement Agreement'' to convey to Chugach Alaska Corporation their lands and guarantee them access to these lands, the U.S. Forest Service has yet to provide the easements needed for such access. This is unacceptable and will soon produce irreparable harm to Chugach Alaska Corporation.  My legislation will simply direct the U.S. Forest Service to fulfill their commitment to provide Chugach Alaska Corporation access to their ANCSA lands. The U.S. Forest Service is required to process the easement to accomplish access for Chugach Alaska Corporation. There has been considerable delay by the U.S. Forest Service to process this easement. Mr. Speaker, I plan to take this issue up when Congress is back for the 2d session of the 105th Congress and to pass this legislation. Both my colleagues in the Senate, Senator Stevens and Senator Murkowski support this endeavor and will work for passage.                          ____________________
