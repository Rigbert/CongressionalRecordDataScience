Speaker, as the chairman of the Energy and Environment Subcommittee, I am pleased that we are considering H.R. 1753, the Methane Hydrate Research and Development Act of 2000. My friend and colleague on the subcommittee, Mr. Doyle, introduced H.R. 1753 in May 1999, and last October 26, the House unanimously approved a similar version of the bill. The Senate amended the House-passed bill last November, and this revised version of the bill represents a bipartisan agreement with the Senate.  Mr. Speaker, I have the distinct pleasure of serving on both the House Science Committee and the Resources Committee which shared jurisdiction on this bill. I want to thank my friends on Resources for all their hard work in getting H.R. 1753 to the floor. I would especially like to thank Chairman Young and Congresswoman Cubin for their willingness to work with me and the chairman of the Science Committee on this important piece of legislation.  Methane hydrates are ice-like substances found in undersea sediments and in Arctic permafrost. These hydrates will one day provide an abundant supply of clean natural gas if science can discover practical and environmentally sound extraction methods. However, much more research is needed before we can attain that goal. H.R. 1753 brings us closer to the day when we can safely and effectively begin to use this abundant, new source of energy.  This legislation will make funds available to continue research into extracting this clean and bountiful potential source of energy. It also seeks to better coordinate the research efforts of the Department of Energy, the U.S. Geological Survey, the U.S. Navy, the Minerals Management Service, and NOAA.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, which will help secure our energy future. I thank the Chair.
