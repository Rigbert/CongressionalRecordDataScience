 President, additionally for 1 minute, I would like to speak to the issue of healthcare. Some elected officials are proposing radical changes to our healthcare system. These proposals include Medicare for All, Medicare buy-in, Medicaid for All, and expansion of the Affordable Healthcare Act. All of these are versions of completely government-run healthcare.  Americans don't support a government-run healthcare system when they are told about the tradeoffs. Medicare for All would eliminate private health insurance companies. Medicare for All would require middle-class Americans to pay much more in taxes. Medicare for All would threaten the benefits that current Medicare beneficiaries receive, and those people who have paid into the system for a lifetime should not have Medicare, which has been part of the social fabric of America, put in jeopardy by loading more people into it.  Government-run healthcare is a slogan, not an answer.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
