My good friends, Senator Wyden and Senator Grassley, have been trying to do the same thing, and I think Senator Lott from Mississippi. So what I will do is not offer my amendment No. 2933 in favor of the Wyden-Grassley now Inhofe amendment that will be considered. That is my unanimous consent request.
