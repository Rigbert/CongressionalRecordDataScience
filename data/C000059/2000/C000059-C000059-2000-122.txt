Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Speaker, the issue before us today is a fundamental question, should the Internal Revenue Service tax the institution of marriage, not the other issues that were spoken about earlier.  The answer to that is no. In my district alone, 54,000 couples will feel the pain of paying higher taxes, just because they are married, than single people. This is an issue beyond just money, it is an issue of fairness and what is right in America. Americans know what is fair and what is not fair, and this marriage penalty is not fair.  This marriage penalty is also anti-woman. Presently, the Tax Code taxes the income of a second wage-earner, usually the wife, at a much higher rate than if she were taxed as a single person. That is wrong. We should not let some antiquated budget law get in the way of equality for working moms.  Finally, the marriage tax penalty punishes working couples by pushing them into a higher tax bracket. Of these couples, middle-aged families and seniors are hit the hardest.  Mr. Speaker, let us do the right thing. Let us pass this and move on.
