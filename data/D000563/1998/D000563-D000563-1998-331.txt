President, I rise today to pay tribute to a great 20th century American family from the state of Illinois--the J.P. ``Cotton'' Knox family. Through the industrial age, the Great Depression, two world wars, and presidents from Teddy Roosevelt to Bill Clinton, the Knox family has spanned the American Century. We take a moment today to reflect on their history and their contribution to our nation.  It all began with J.P. ``Cotton'' Knox, born November 16, 1880, and his wife Esther Loretta Knox, born April 11, 1885--both in Sangamon County, Illinois. They started courting at the turn of the century, married in 1907 and lived on a small farm west of Curran in Sangamon County where J.P. shucked corn by hand in the moonlight.  During the first quarter of the 20th century, the family grew rapidly. Thomas Dickerson, J.P. and Esther's first child, was born July 8, 1908. James Donald came next on November 24, 1909 and was followed by Kathryn Loretta on May 9, 1912, John Louis on July 23, 1914, Charles Carroll on November 21, 1916, Lawrence William on January 26, 1919, Howard Eugene on March 29, 1921, Paul Edward on January 18, 1923, and Joseph Patrick on February 10, 1925. Each child was born healthy and at home except for Howard Eugene, who was born in the hospital because of a scarlet fever epidemic.  In the second quarter of the 20th century, the family struggled through the Great Depression along with the rest of the nation. Kathryn had grown old enough that she was able to serve as relief pitcher and back-up quarterback for her mother. J.P. was elected Coroner of Sangamon County in 1932 and instilled in his children the importance of voting because it was a duty and a privilege as an American.  Perhaps the most remarkable chapter in the family's history came when the United States entered World War II following the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Thomas, the oldest, was 33 and married with three children when the war began. As CEO of Doyle Freight Lines based in Saginaw, Michigan, he was declared an essential man in an essential industry. The Governor of Michigan appointed him as coordinator of transporting supplies to military bases in certain Midwest states. After the war, he was listed in Who's Who in the Midwest.  The other brothers, one by one, joined the military, even though some could have remained on the homefront. Lawrence, who worked in the FBI in Washington, was exempt from military service but chose to enlist in the Marines. Joseph was the last child left home with J.P. and Esther. He could have applied for a deferment but chose to serve with the approval of his parents. Three weeks after graduating from high school in 1943, he was in the Navy. Carroll was the only brother who did not go overseas, and served as a medical corpsman in the Navy in San Diego, California. Of the seven brothers who served, three were in the Navy, three in the Army and one in the Marines.  J.P. and Esther would have been all alone had it not been for Kathryn and her three children who lived with them when Kathryn's husband joined the Navy. Kathryn provided tremendous support to her parents, who had a lot to worry about with six of their eight sons in harm's way. She kept their morale high until, amazingly, all seven of the Knox boys in the military returned home safely with honorable discharges after the war. Combined, they gave 20 years, six months of service, including nearly 13 years overseas.  The third quarter of the 20th century had just begun when J.P. passed away in 1951. He was eulogized with a one-quarter page editorial by V.Y. Dallman, editor of the Illinois State Register in Springfield, Illinois. Esther passed away in 1972. All nine children were employed in various fields and raising families of their own. Joseph followed in his father's political footsteps, serving several terms as Clerk of the Circuit Court of Sangamon County and Public Health Commissioner for the City of Springfield. To this day, he insists the voters were not voting for him, but rather for the Knox family. His was simply the name that happened to be on the ballot.  In the last quarter of the 20th century, three of the Knox children passed away--Thomas in 1986, Howard in 1987 and Louis in 1993. Six siblings remain--all in reasonably good health.  As the 21st century approaches, we wish the Knox family well and thank them for their service to the country and the state of Illinois. And I ask that my statement be included in the Record so that future generations of the J.P. ``Cotton'' Knox family will know that their forebears were proud to be Americans and proud to serve their nation.                          ____________________
