President, Katherine Paterson is a treasure to Vermont. She is also a close friend to Marcelle and me. And today, at the age of 82, she continues to write with the grace and talent that has made her a two-time National Book Award winner and twice a Newbery medalist.  I have had the honor and good fortune to know Katherine for many years. Her humble and soft-spoken nature belie the power of her writing and her myriad contributions to children's literature.  In announcing that she would be last year's winner of the Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal, the committee noted: ``Katherine Paterson has been writing books that have made a profound difference in children's lives for 40 years. Her work acknowledges life's challenges and difficulties, yet she always leaves her readers with hope.''  I ask that this recent profile of Katherine Paterson, from the Burlington Free Press, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From The Burlington Free Press, Nov. 16, 2014]                  Katherine Paterson's Life in Stories                           (By Sally Pollak)       Montpelier Author's Memoir is a Set of Stories, Many Could      Serve as a Manual for Loving and Raising Kids       In her new book, ``Stories of my Life,'' Katherine Paterson      tells a set of wonderful stories that span her eight decades.       She writes about her young childhood in China, where she      was born, and the mountain resort where she stayed with her      mother and siblings (including a newborn sister) during      wartime in the summer of 1937. Paterson tells about a family      friend who was kissed by Robert E. Lee, and her distant      cousin named Mark Twain. Yes, that Mark Twain. Paterson      writes about taking her sixthgrade class on a field trip to      the Washington zoo; the widow she lived with when she worked      as a missionary in Japan, and her sons' adventures in places      unknown to their mother.       Paterson doesn't write about her first fall in Barre, where      she and her husband moved 28 years ago. The youngest of      Paterson's four children went off to college, and Paterson      had left behind friends in Virginia and Maryland.       ``It rained a lot,'' Paterson said. ``I ate Ben and Jerry's      Coffee Heath Bar Crunch, and read.''       Paterson, who turned 82 on Halloween, is an awardwinning      author who started to write books in the bits of time when      her young children were all asleep. She was able to devote      more time to writing when her four kids were old enough for      school. Paterson's books have won the most prominent honors      in literature, including two Newbery Medals (``Bridge to      Terabithia'' and ``Jacob Have I Loved'') and two National      Book Awards (``The Master Puppeteer'' and ``The Great Gilly      Hopkins.'') Before the Patersons moved to Vermont for John      Paterson's work as a minister, the Patersons knew Vermont as      the place they celebrated their wedding anniversary. They      would drive north from New York's Lake George, where they      spend summers, to eat at Dog Team Tavern. The restaurant in      Middlebury, known for its sticky buns, burned down in 2006.       The ice-cream eating phase in the big brick house in Barre      would give way to book-writing, including books set in      Vermont. Paterson had barely unpacked when she met a woman at      a book signing in Shelburne who began a conversation: ``Now      that you're a Vermonter. . . . '' The woman went on to      inquire if Paterson had an interest in writing a book that      would be meaningful for children of Vermont migrant farm      workers.       This involved getting to know her new home state by      visiting farms and homes, and completing a book on a six-     month deadline (a first). In order to meet the deadline,      Paterson proposed writing an I Can Read Book. ``The Smallest      Cow in the World,'' with illustrations by Burlington native      Jane Clark Brown, was Paterson's first book for new readers.       Decades later Paterson attempted another genre for the      first time: memoir, or memoir-ish.       ``Stories of my Life'' is lively, interesting and generous      of spirit. Its stories are warm and humorous, and connected      to a larger sphere: literature, religion, history. Certain      stories could serve as a manual, a valuable one, for loving      and raising kids.       Still, writing a memoir wasn't part of Paterson's plan.       ``It just seems like such a me, me, me thing to do,''      Paterson said recently at her home in Montpelier, where she      moved last spring. ``I didn't think people nearest and      dearest to me would want to play minor roles in the stories      of my life.''                          kitchen sink stories       The illness of Paterson's late husband, John Paterson, was      a kind of catalyst for Paterson's recently published book.      During his sickness, Katherine Paterson was somehow unable to      start a novel, she said. Instead, she began to write down      stories drawn from her life, what she calls in her book      ``kitchen sink stories.''       These are stories she heard from her mother as a child,      when she washed, dried and put away dishes with her mother      and sister. Paterson's children grew up in a house with a      dishwasher, and some stories went untold in the absence of      that evening chore.       ``I realized there were family stories that my children      didn't know and I should write them down,'' Paterson said.      ``It would be a good thing for the kids and for the      grandchildren.''       The stories are a fascinating collection that take in      family history (great uncles who died in the Civil War);      Paterson's work and travel in Asia; her chance meeting while      at graduate school with the man she would marry; raising a      family with accompanying menagerie--and writing books.       In ``Stories of my Life'' Paterson draws connections      between significant events and people in her own life, and      aspects of her books: a story line, a character, a scene.       She explains that she discovered the ``emotional heart'' of      her first novel, ``The Sign of the Chrysanthemum'' in a      conversation with her oldest daughter, Lin.       Lin was born in Hong Kong; she was two years old when the      Patersons adopted her. There were times when Lin was young      that it was difficult for her parents to get through a      ``curtain'' and reach their daughter, Paterson writes.       From her memoir: ``Lin,'' I yelled, ``how can I help you if      you won't tell me what's the matter?''       She jerked to life, her eyes wide open. ``Why did that      woman give me away?''       Paterson would go on to write a novel built around this      question: ``What must it be like, I wondered, to have a      parent somewhere whom you do not know?''       Later, at a time she was idea-less for a book, she asked      her four children what to write about.       The kids voted for a mystery. Paterson was certain she      wasn't capable of writing one. She describes this in her      memoir: ``Do you think,'' I asked my eager children, ``that      anyone who is regularly beaten at chess by a six year-old has      the kind of brain it takes to plot a mystery story?''       Yet her kids' choice helped Paterson find her way to a      story that involved Japanese puppet theater.       ``So the children and I compromised,'' Paterson wrote. ``I      would try to write an adventure story with as much suspense      as possible.'' The resulting book, ``The Master Puppeteer,''      won the 1977 National Book Award.       Her beloved novel, ``Bridge to Terabithia,'' grew out of      the accidental death of her son David's close friend at age      8. In ``Stories of my Life,'' Paterson discloses that      confronting a different death--her own--made writing      ``Terabithia'' a particular challenge.                              a love story       The story of a strong and loving marriage runs through      Paterson's new book, a partnership that formed in a matter of      months. When John Paterson proposed to Katherine Womeldorf,      he made a promise to always help and support her.       ``John said that he knew I was a strong woman with many      gifts, and he wanted to promise me that he would never stand      in the way of my exercising those gifts,'' Paterson writes in      her new book.       ``It was very memorable,'' Paterson said of the proposal,      talking about the conversation more than half a century      later.       ``I had no idea that I was going to be a writer,'' she      said. ``I had no idea what I was going to do. John thought I      was going to be something.''       John Paterson was a Presbyterian minister who collected      art, played tennis and co-wrote books with his wife. His      death at age 80 in September, 2013, was the central aspect of      the ``most extraordinary'' story of Paterson's life, she      wrote.       The experience, including conversations with      ``compassionate and honest doctors,'' suggested to the      Patersons that a person needn't fight death with the full      arsenal of modern medicine, Paterson said. John Paterson      sought the advice of his wife, and chose to die at home.       ``In our society we have to come to it,'' Paterson said.      ``Death is not the enemy.''       The artist that John Paterson saw in his future wife is      still at work. Paterson is writing a play with a friend, and      awaiting the 2015 release of the film adaptation of ``The      Great Gilly Hopkins.'' The screenplay was written by her son      David Paterson.       ``I had a good life,'' Paterson said. ``Let's face it.''                          ____________________
