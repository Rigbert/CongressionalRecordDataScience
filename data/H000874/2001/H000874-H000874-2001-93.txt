Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, before the gentleman from California (Mr. Waxman), the distinguished ranking member of the Committee on Government Reform, leaves, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Istook) correctly points out that this is a placeholder. As I told the gentleman from California, I opposed the original amendment that was offered. It was defeated in committee. But I believe this is a subject worthy of discussion between now and conference, and I want to assure the gentleman that I will be talking with him as well to get his thoughts on this proposal that OMB has made.  Clearly they believe it is a proposal which will encourage greater efficiencies and effectiveness of management. Whether that is the case or not, we will see. I assure the gentleman that I will discuss it further with him.                              {time}  1245
