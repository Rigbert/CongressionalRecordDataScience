Speaker, tomorrow the House of Representatives under suspension of the rules, that is, a bill with 40 minutes of debate total, no amendments allowed by any Member of the House for any reason, will vote to borrow on behalf of all the American people $51.8 billion to begin the recovery, rebuilding and continuing the aid and assistance efforts subsequent to the disaster of Hurricane Katrina.  Now, it is good that we are reacting and we are going to begin to fund the incredible needs that will arise and have arisen from this disaster. It is the beginning of a long process, and it is probably only a down payment. But some say that we cannot, as the House of Representatives or the legislative branch, examine the causes of the miserable response that caused unnecessary loss of life while recovery efforts are still ongoing.  Some say that we cannot question the work done by the administration and the appointees in place who failed to act adequately. They say that would be unseemly.  But during World War II, Harry Truman, in a Democratic-controlled legislature, chaired a special committee investigating the procurement scandals of a Democratic administration in the greatest crisis of our history, World War II.  We can do both. We can provide aid and assistance, and we can get at the root causes of unnecessary loss of life and unnecessary disaster. We can do that.  There are a number of lessons to be learned. We need to be able to respond better today or tomorrow. Hurricane season is not over yet. We might have another. Another might follow tragically that same path. That might be an incredible disaster. And we are going to have the same people in place, the same procedures in place. That is not going to be enough.  The terrorists are not going to wait. It has been 4 years since 9/11. We still do not have interoperable, secure communications that were identified as a principal problem on 9/11. The Bush administration zeroed them out in this year's budget, and the Congress has not yet seen fit to restore that money. I hope they will do that in one of these emergency spending bills.  Then there are the cuts at FEMA. The aggregate budget for FEMA during the term of the Bush administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has been reduced. We are not quite sure how much yet because we do not have the final numbers on this bill. I guess with this disaster assistance that will not be the case. But in terms of their preparedness and mitigation, it has been reduced.  The Corps of Engineers has hundreds of critical infrastructure problems, including the levee around New Orleans, underfunded and unfunded. I had a dam in my district that was failing, a flood control dam, with the largest cities in the State downstream. And the Corps of Engineers simply said, We do not have the money. Finally they scrambled around and they found the money. But, unfortunately, they were not able to do that in New Orleans for the Corps budget had been dramatically reduced.                              {time}  1800  In fact, the Corps' own people predicted that this could happen because of the underfunding of the ongoing maintenance and the needed improvements in the diking system there, but all's well.  Deputy Press Secretary Trent Duffy said things are on track to privatize Social Security because we are going to borrow so much money for the disaster we are going to need to privatize Social Security. What? The Bush plan for privatization of Social Security requires borrowing more money. That is absurd. Then he says, oh, and the tax cuts are all on track, too. The tax cuts for the wealthiest among us are on track in face of a war and a disaster. Why? Because trickle-down will help the people of New Orleans.  How about Federal investment in the infrastructure that would protect the people of New Orleans and other cities around the United States of America? How about interoperable communications for our first responders across the United States of America? How about more money for disaster mitigation preparedness for FEMA? How about those investments before tax cuts for the wealthiest among us?  But they live on the high ground, and I guess they think they are exempt. They are not exempt. We are all in this together, and there should be some degree of sacrifice and level-headedness downtown. We are going to borrow $52.8 billion tomorrow, adding to the deficit; and they are proposing more tax cuts for people who earn over $300,000 a year and estates over $6 million.  Come on, let us get real. Let us act on behalf of all our people. Let us invest in our country and our people and do a better job against natural disasters and the potential for terrorist attacks. We need some changes. It should be more than 40 minutes of debate, and one or two amendments at least should be allowed.                          ____________________
