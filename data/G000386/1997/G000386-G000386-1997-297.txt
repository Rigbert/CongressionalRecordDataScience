 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate immediately proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations on the Executive Calendar: Calendar Nos. 27 through 33, and all nominations placed on the Secretary's desk in the Air Force, Army, Marine Corps, and Navy.  I further ask unanimous consent that the nominations be confirmed, that the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, that any statements relating to the nominations appear at this point in the Record, that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and that the Senate then return to legislative session.
