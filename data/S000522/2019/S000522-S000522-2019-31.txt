Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.  Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank Anna Eshoo for her leadership throughout many decades on this issue. It was her idea to bring it up on the floor today. I want to thank her for that. Of course she had to work within the leadership to get it done, but I thank her for recommending that.  Mr. Speaker, I want to remind Members that, in 2018, Anna Eshoo and I wrote the Iraq and Syria Genocide Relief and Accountability Act. It was signed by President Trump into law. That provided two things: humanitarian relief for the tens of thousands of Christians and Yazidis fleeing from ISIS; it also provided an accountability piece to collect for, hopefully, utilization in future court cases against the perpetrators of these heinous crimes.  So, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman for that work that we did together and, again, for her leadership on this issue.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
