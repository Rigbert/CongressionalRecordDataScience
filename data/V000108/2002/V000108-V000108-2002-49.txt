Speaker, it is my distinct honor to congratulate the Croatian Sons Lodge Number 170 of the Croatian Fraternal Union, on the festive occasion of its 95th Anniversary and Golden Member banquet, on Sunday, April 28, 2002.  This year, the Croatian Fraternal Union will hold this gala event at the Croatian Center in Merrillville, Indiana. Traditionally, the anniversary celebration entails a formal recognition of the Union's Golden Members, those who have achieved fifty years of membership. This year's honorees who have attained fifty years of membership include: William A. Bursich, Sally Cullen, Lynn Edward Evans, Steve Jack Grdina, Anastasia Kresich, Eugene Krukowski, Michael F. Luketic, Charles Peretin, Stefania Peretin, Dorothea Petrovich, Stephen Ratkay, Dennis Rivich, Frances Staresnick, Peter T. Sut, and Mary Ann Thews.  These loyal and dedicated individuals share this prestigious honor with over 300 additional Lodge members who have previously attained this important designation.  This memorable day will begin with a morning mass at Saint Joseph the Worker Catholic Church in Gary, Indiana, with the Reverend Father Stephen Loncar presiding. The festivities will be culturally enriched by the performance of several Croatian musical groups. The Hoosier Hrvati Adult Tamburitza Orchestra directed by Frank Jovanovich, the Croatian Glee Club ``Preradovic,'' and the Croatian Strings Tamburitzans and Junior Dancers directed by Dennis Barunica will perform at this gala event. A formal dinner banquet will end the day's festivities.  Mr. Speaker, I urge you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Lodge President Betty Morgavan, and all the other members of the Croatian Fraternal Union Lodge Number 170, for their loyalty and radiant display of passion for their ethnicity. The Croatian community has played a key role in enriching the quality of life and culture of Northwest Indiana. It is my hope that this year will bring renewed hope and prosperity for all members of the Croatian community and their families. I am proud to represent these gifted residents of the First Congressional District of Indiana.                          ____________________
