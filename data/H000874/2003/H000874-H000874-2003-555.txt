Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the information he has given to us. I understand we are coming back at 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday and leaving no later than 1 p.m. on Thursday. I know the gentleman's party has its retreat. Ours is this week, as the gentleman knows.  I would ask the leader, Mr. Speaker, he indicates that the conference committee report may come back on Wednesday. If that is the case, does the gentleman have any information as to when the conference might meet?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will continue to yield, Mr. Speaker, parties, both in the minority and the majority in both Houses, are speaking and talking to each other as we meet. Obviously, the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations in the House and the chairman in the Senate will do their own scheduling when the formal conference would be held.  We are hoping that, working with the minority and the ranking Members of both Houses, and working hard through the weekend, as hard as they can, that they will come to some sort of resolution next week. That is the schedule that the House would like to see happen; but we know, as all these things happen, it could leak and we would have to do another continuing resolution for another week. Hopefully, by then all the work would be done.
