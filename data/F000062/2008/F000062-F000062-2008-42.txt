 President, I rise today to introduce legislation to stimulate domestic film production and create jobs. I am pleased to be joined by my colleague from Oregon, Senator Gordon Smith.  Our bill, the Domestic Film Production Equity Act of 2008, would expand a tax deduction, known as the section 199 domestic production incentive, for qualifying U.S. film producers.  In 2008, this deduction will be worth 6 percent of a domestic manufacturer's qualifying production activities. It will increase to nine percent in 2010.  Specifically, our bill would expand the production incentive to allow studios to include wages paid to full-time short-term employees, including U.S. actors, writers, directors, and production personnel in determining the limit on the deduction amount.  The bill will treat films produced by partnerships between several studios as qualified property, each partner must have at least 20 percent interest in a project to qualify.  The bill will deduct income from the licensing of copyrights and trademarks relating to films; and lastly, the bill will deduct income from films and TV programs broadcast over the Internet.  Most film production companies receive only a limited benefit from the production incentive because the industry relies heavily on short-term contract work, and because many films are produced by multiple studios through partnerships.  As a matter of fairness, these domestic production incentives should be extended to fully benefit an industry that employs over 1.3 million Americans.  Filming a movie is different than traditional domestic manufacturing because short-term contract workers, including actors, writers, directors, and production personnel often work full-time on projects; multiple studios often produce one project; studios generate significant licensing fees associated with copyrights and trademarks related to films; and a number of media, including the Internet may be used to view each film or production.  Our bill takes these circumstances into account to modernize this section of the tax code.  The film industry is an important asset to the American economy.  More than 1.3 million Americans work in motion picture and television production.  In 2005, these jobs provided $30.24 billion in wages, with employees earning an average salary of $73,000.  Of these employees, 231,000 were short-term contractors, often working multiple projects each year.  California was the primary location for 365 film productions in 2005. This generated $42.2 billion in economic activity for my State.  Our bill would help studios continue to provide opportunities to these talented actors, writers, directors, and production personnel in America.  Expanding the Section 199 deduction to include these four categories is also a response to the competitive business of captivating an increasingly technology-adept viewing audience.  The film industry, like the music industry, is increasingly seeing their sales move to digital formats via the internet. On iTunes--an online digital music store operated by Apple--around 50,000 movies are rented or sold each day.  Moreover, by not allowing film studios to take advantage of domestic production tax incentives, we risk losing more operations abroad.  For example, Canada currently provides domestic film producers with a tax credit worth 15 percent of qualifying production costs. Foreign studios with operations in Canada may also receive a tax credit worth up to 16 percent of wages paid to Canadian residents.  The film industry plays a unique role in our society.  The world recognizes Hollywood as the center of the entertainment industry. Millions of tourists annually travel from across the globe to visit the sites that embody the golden age of film.  Hollywood film studios are American institutions that continue to produce some of the finest films in the world.  Needless to say, it is critical that studios continue to film in my State and across the country. If not, the golden age of Hollywood and the economic activity it brings may be a part of the past.  We are fortunate to have a vibrant domestic film industry.  This legislation will help ensure that the U.S. entertainment industry continues to be the world leader.  American workers and our economy stand to benefit.  Efforts to expand the production incentive for domestic films have enjoyed broad bi-partisan support. Our bill is similar to a provision included in the tax extenders package which passed the House overwhelmingly by a vote of 263-160 in May.  I am hopeful that the Senate will move quickly to enact this much-needed modernization of the tax code.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3330       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
