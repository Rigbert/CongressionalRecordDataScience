Speaker, it is with great reluctance, because I believe very strongly that the Chair's rulings ought to be upheld, but in this instance, Mr. Speaker, I am compelled, because of the importance of the issue and the closed rule that prevented any amendments, and because I believe, Mr. Speaker, in your ruling you correctly indicated that the Hoyer and Greenwood bill broadens the scope of this bill and broadens the application to procedures beyond what the bill refers to, and for that reason held it not to be germane, I am compelled to appeal the ruling of the Chair.
