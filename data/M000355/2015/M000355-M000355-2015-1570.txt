 President, on another matter, several weeks ago the White House released an unserious budget that would have raised taxes by nearly $2 trillion and increase the national debt by more than $7 trillion. In other words, it was more of the same old tired, failed policies of the past. Hardly anyone took that budget seriously mostly because it was not meant to be taken seriously.  Contrast that with the balanced budget the Senate will introduce this morning. It is a budget that controls spending, reduces the deficit, and improves programs such as Medicaid. It is a budget that will support economic growth and more opportunity for hard-working families while protecting our most vulnerable citizens. It is a budgetthat will allow us to repeal and replace a program that hurts the middle class, ObamaCare. It will allow us to repeal and replace a program that hurts the middle class, ObamaCare.  I thank the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Enzi, for his good work on this sensible budget.  We have heard some talk of shrinking deficits these days. Of course, Republicans are proud to take credit for helping force some fiscal responsibility on the Obama administration, but we know these deficits will soon shoot up dramatically if Washington does not start making more commonsense choices.  The reality is our country still has many tough fiscal challenges to confront. These are not challenges that can just be taxed away. These are not challenges that can be denied away either. But by working together these are challenges we can overcome, and the way we can overcome them is with sensible ideas to get spending under control and make government more efficient, more effective, and more accountable, just as the Senate's budget proposes to do.                          ____________________
