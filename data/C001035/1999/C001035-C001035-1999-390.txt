 A 1997 study showed that only 21 percent of elderly patients were treated with beta blockers after a heart attack, despite evidence that mortality rates are 75 percent higher for those not receiving treatment.  I would note, in contrast, that HMO members in plans that submit data to the National Committee on Quality Assurance are 2\1/2\ times more likely than members of fee-for-service plans to receive beta blockers.  I could go on and on and on. Perhaps the President's own commission said it best. It concluded that excessive procedures--procedures that lack scientific justification--could account for as much as 30 percent of our Nation's medical bills.  Not to mention posing unnecessary risks as well as pain an suffering for those who undergo these unnecessary procedures.  As we can see by these examples and countless more, there may well be valid, indeed, very worthwhile. In fact, there may be very good reasons for the health plan, in some cases, to suggest an alternative treatment to the one the treating physician has initially selected. It may be far better for the patient than the initial recommendation of his or her physician. These examples show that, even if something is consistent with generally accepted principles of professional medical practice, it is not necessarily appropriate high quality care. That should be our goal. Our goal should be to put the patient first and to provide the best quality care to that patient.  The Republican bill deals with the issue of medical necessity through a strong, independent, external appeals process. That is the way to deal with disputes about medical coverage. A Federal statutory definition of medical necessity is unwarranted and unwise.  I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of our time.
