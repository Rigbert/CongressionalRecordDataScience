Just one last point with respect to this technology conference where so many people walked away and thought their privacy was being protected by strong legal protections. General Alexander made additional confusing remarks that were in response to that same question with respect to the protections of law-abiding people.  General Alexander said, `` . . . the story that we [the NSA] have millions or hundreds of millions of dossiers on people is absolutely false.''  Now, I have indicated this morning as well, having served on the Intelligence Committee for a long time, I do not have the faintest idea of what anybody is talking about with respect to a dossier. So Senator Udall and I followed that up as well. We asked the Director to clarify that statement. We asked, ``Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?'' So that, too, is a pretty straightforward question.
