Speaker, if the gentleman from Florida will yield, I want to thank the gentlewoman from California [Ms. Pelosi] and the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Weldon] for taking this time, and I associate myself with Ms. Pelosi who has been a giant in the leadership on the issue of dealings with China, human rights in China, and in the Far East generally, as someone who has been very involved with my colleague on the Helsinki Commission as we focused on the former Soviet Union and Sakharov and other heroes of the Helsinki movement, which articulated principles of recognition of human rights in every Nation.  The former Foreign Minister, now the Prime Minister, articulated the fact that the Helsinki final act adopted a premise that it was of concern to all of us how a nation treated its own citizens. Historically, it has been the premise of nations of how they treated the other nation's citizens might be their business, but how they treated their own citizens should not be of their attention.  The fact of the matter is, of course, our world is a better place because nations, and particularly the United States, has taken a focus on how other nations treat their own citizens.  I will be voting against MFN for China, as I have in the past, with some exceptions, when I join the gentlewoman from California [Ms. Pelosi]. But the fact of the matter is we ought to say in the strongest possible terms, as we did to the Soviet Union, ``If you treat your citizens badly, you will not be able to deal with us on a business-as-usual basis.''  Constructive engagement was not good in South Africa, and I suggest to this administration and previous administrations that constructive engagement, as if we were dealing with nations that adopt our own standards of conduct, should not be the policy of this Government and this Nation.
