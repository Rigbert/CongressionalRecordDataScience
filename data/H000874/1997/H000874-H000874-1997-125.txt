Speaker, I was going to say something, but I think the Speaker has clarified the interpretation the Chair will make. I will say in terms of a record, though I have not had the opportunity of conferring with the gentleman from Connecticut [Mr. Gejdenson] and I have conferred with the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Menendez], it was clearly not the intent of the resolution, as I understand from Mr. Menendez, to obviate any contestant's right to appear on the floor at the time the contest is considered. We agree with the chairman of the Committee on Rules in that regard.
