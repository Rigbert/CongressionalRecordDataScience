 Regardless of religious affiliation or conviction, Catholic sisters have not only nurtured countless hearts, minds, and souls throughout our nation's history, but they have played a vital role in shaping American life. The humble sacrifices, the heartfelt dedication and the tremendous contributions of these women are in earnest need of recognition.  For this reason I have introduced a resolution today honoring the historical contributions of Catholic sisters in the United States.  Since 1727, Catholic sisters have fearlessly and often sacrificially committed their personal lives to teaching, healing, and social action. Joined in unique forms of intentional communal life dedicated to prayer and service, these women have participated in the opening of the West, nursed soldiers during the Civil War, and cared for afflicted populations during the epidemics of the 19th and early 20th centuries.  Catholic sisters established the nation's largest private school system and founded more than 110 U.S. colleges and universities, through which they have educated millions of young Americans.  Moreover, managing organizations long before such positions were even open to women, the bold passion of Catholic sisters established hospitals, orphanages, and charitable institutions. They were among the first to stand with the underprivileged, to educate or to work among the poor and underserved, and to facilitate leadership through opportunity and example.  Since 1980 alone, at least nine American sisters have been martyred. Maura Clark, MM, Ita Ford, MM and Dorothy Kazel, OSU were martyred in El Salvador in 1980. Joel Kolmer, ASC, Shirley Kolmer, ASC, Kathleen McGuire, ASC, Agnes Mueller, ASC and Barbara Ann Muttra, ASC were martyred in Liberia in 1992. And, Dorothy Stang, SNDdeN was martyred in Brazil in 2005. Despite such a horrifying reality, Catholic sisters remain dedicated and courageously spirited.  Across the globe, Catholic sisters continue to provide shelter, food, and basic human needs to the economically or socially disadvantaged and advocate relentlessly for the fair and equal treatment of all persons. They work for the eradication of poverty and racism and for the promotion of nonviolence, equality and democracy both in principle and in action. The humanitarian work of Catholic sisters with communities in crisis and refuge throughout the world positions them as activists and diplomats of peace and justice for those most at risk populations.  These women have offered so much to the world yet their stories have rarely been narrated or honored in our history. Though long overdue, the lives, works and legacies of Catholic sisters will finally be recounted.  I am happy to announce that on May 16th, 2009, a traveling exhibit called ``Women & Spirit: Catholic Sisters in America'' will open in Cincinnati, Ohio. Sponsored by the Leadership Conference of Women Religious (LCWR) in association with the Cincinnati Museum Center, it will tour multiple cities over the next few years.  In continued celebration of the women who have shaped our lives and cultivated our potential, I stand to recognize the Catholic sisters not only for the personal impact they have had within our own lives, but for the extraordinary contributions they have made to the history of the United States.                          ____________________
