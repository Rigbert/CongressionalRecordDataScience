 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a Kentuckian who for many years has displayed a great deal of courage in standing up for what she believes. Louisville native Ms. Johnetta Marshall has traveled the world to fight for the rights of others, and now she's being recognized here at home as the new president of the National Older Women's League, a not-for-profit organization that promotes health, housing, and Social Security issues for women over the age of 50.  Recently, Ms. Marshall traveled to China to march for equality of the sexes at the United Nation's Fourth World Conference of Women. While that trip ended peacefully, some of her journeys have taken a violent turn. One such incident occurred in the Deep South in the late 1950's when Ms. Marshall was pelted with rocks while marching for civil rights. She recently recounted in a story for Louisville's Courier-Journal, that while in Meridian, Mississippi, ``we had to go in the back way at hotels and ride the freight elevator. They made us a dining room in the bedroom rather than have us eat with the rest of the guests.'' While this kind of treatment may have disparaged some, it gave Ms. Marshall a reason to continue her fight for civil rights.  One of the highlights of Ms. Marshall's career came in March of this year, when she was named president of the Older Women's League. Marshall, who served as a member of the board of directors for 6 years, is truly dedicated to the cause and she hopes to put the organization in the public spotlight during her tenure as president. The executive director of the Older Women's League, Deborah Briceland-Betts, says members of the group are delighted that Marshall is now leading them. And they hope she will continue her extraordinary commitment to find creative and effective ways to improve the lives of midlife and older women and their families.  Not only is Ms. Marshall a national leader in the fights for the rights of others, she also worked on behalf of interests in the Bluegrass State. For nearly 20 years, Ms. Marshall was executive director of Louisville's Opportunities Industrialization Centers, Inc., which was responsible for training welfare recipients for jobs. She also served as regional coordinator of the Prichard Committee for Academic Excellence in Lexington, and during that time she worked hard to promote education reform. She was also the director of Senior Services, Inc., executive director of Kentucky's Opportunities Industrialization Center, past president of the Louisville Section of the National Council of Negro Women, and was the first African American woman chair of the March of Dimes' Kentuckiana chapter. And in the 1960's and 1970's, she investigated racism in Ohio, Tennessee, and Kentucky as a member of the Presbyterian Church task force.  As you can tell from her list of accomplishments, Ms. Marshall has had a long and distinguished career, and it does not look like it will slow down anytime soon. Even with the demanding pace of her public advocacy, she still always found time for her real love, her six children whom she successfully raised as a single mother.  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to this outstanding Kentuckian. I also ask that an article from the October 10 Courier-Journal be printed in the Record.  The article follows:       [From the Courier-Journal, Louisville, KY, Oct. 10, 1995]A Pioneering Spirit--Louisville Native Has Marched in the South and in                        China for Rights of Others                         (By Lawrence Muhammad)       Johnetta Marshall won't tell her age but ``pioneer'' is      definitely a title that fits her.       The Louisville native was pelted with rocks while marching      for civil rights in the Deep South in the late 1950s and      early '60s. More recently, she marched for sex equality under      the watchful eyes of government police at the United Nation's      Fourth World Conference of Women in China.       In the '60s, in Meridian, Miss., she recalled, ``we had to      go in the back way at hotels and ride the freight elevator.      They made us a dining room in the bedroom rather than have us      eat with the rest of the guests.''       Decades later, Marshall attended the China conference as      the new president of the Washington, D.C.-based Older Women's      League. Carrying a banner and chanting, she and other      conferees marched onto the conference grounds and into      workshops.       Although no one in her group had trouble with Chinese      authorities, she said, ``there were people with video      cameras. . . . We wanted them to see the banner. But there      was no harassment.''       Marshall, who lives in Jeffersontown, was named president      of the Older Women's League in March. It's a nationwide, not-     for-profit organization that promotes health, housing and      Social Security issues for women over the age of 50.       The appointment caps a career of distinguished service.       For nearly 20 years until it closed in 1988, Marshall was      executive director of Louisville's Opportunities      Industrialization Centers Inc., once a nationwide non-profit      group with headquarters in Philadelphia that trained welfare      recipients for jobs.       She was also the first chairman of the Kentucky Minority      AIDS Council.       Sam Robinson, president of the Lincoln Foundation and also      a founding member of the AIDS council, recalled suggesting      Marshall to the group because of her work with the National      Council of Negro Women and the National Association for the      Advancement of Colored People. ``And when we were ready to      elect officers, everybody looked to her for leadership,''      Robinson said.       Lead she has, also serving stints as a Presbyterian Church      organizer, propagating racial fairness among Southern members      during the 1960s and '70s; as director of Senior Services      Inc. in Louisville; as past president of the National Council      of Negro Women's Louisville section; and as the first      African-American woman to chair the March of Dimes'      Kentuckiana chapter, among other posts.       Last month in China, Marshall led a 32-member delegation to      the Non-governmental Organizations Forum on Women in Huairou.      It was an unofficial gathering held in conjunction with the      U.N. conference in Beijing.       Marshall and her group, co-sponsored by the American      Society on Aging, met officials of the China National      Committee on Aging and China Research Center on Aging and      toured hospitals and welfare homes for the elderly. It was an      effort to promote concerns of older women that past world      forums had inadequately addressed, Marshall said.       For example, women over 65 are disproportionately poor,      spend more on home repairs, more frequently develop breast      cancer and suffer more chronic ailments than older men,      according to an Older Women's League study done in 1993.       The study also showed 60 percent of married women are      widowed and living alone by 75, and 30 percent require home      care, double the percentage for men.       ``Back in the civil-rights days, women were suffering, and      there have been some improvements, but not enough,'' Marshall      said. ``Women can work side by side with men, and maybe have      better skills, but men get more pay. And if you happen to be      an older women, you are counted out completely.''       Marshall clearly would not be counted out. Leading the      local Opportunities Industrialization Center, she smashed the      gender barrier in the early 1980s to head the group's      executive directors association, a male-dominated network of      about 85 OIC insiders.       ``For Johnetta to run for that position, and win it, was      akin to Shannon Faulkner entering The Citadel,'' said Gene      Blue, president of the Phoenix, Ariz., OIC. ``She became a      spokes-person who accompanied the founder, Dr. Leon Sullivan,      at congressional hearings. She had to overcome significant      male egos to preside over all these dudes at meetings and      workshops, which usually got loud and emotional.''       Blue recalled one particular meeting, where ``one of the      most vociferous, a senior executive from a major city, had      the floor and was waxing eloquent. Finally Johnetta, without      even raising her voice, said firmly, `OK, that's enough. Sit      down.' Now, it took most of us by surprise that she would      tell this guy to shut up. But she did, and he sat down.''       Marshall is widely know as a nurturer too. She grew up in      Louisville's Limerick neighborhood, daughter of concrete      finisher John Marshall who died when she was 10, and Emma      Marshall, who supported the family with domestic work.      Marshall had wanted to be a surgeon, but being black and      female in the segregated 1930s and '40s, it was difficult to      aspire to so lofty a vocation.       A divorcee, she raised six children on her own, has four      grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. The fruits of her      labors are plentiful among her children: Samuel is a San      Francisco stockbroker; Charles, a geriatric doctor in Los      Angeles; and John, a supervisor of correctional officers in      Los Angeles County, Glenna is a Louisville graphic artist;      Marilyn, a bookkeeper in Atlanta; and Jo, a computer systems      engineer in Louisville.       Marshall also served as a role model for scores of other      people's children at the Presbyterian Community Center at 760      S. Hancock St.       ``She'd ask questions like, `How are you doing at home? How      are you doing at school?' '' said Ernest ``Camp'' Edwards,      63, an associate executive presbyter for the Presbytery of      Louisville. ``I was sort of mischievous, throwing stuff on      the floor and blaming somebody else, so she always preached      that I should be accountable for my own behavior and not      blame others.       ``That really stuck with me over the years,'' Edwards said.      ``She has a kind of presence and talks to you so that it      makes a difference. I'm a social worker by profession, and,      because of her, I decided to work with people. She was a      `significant other.' and I decided I could be a significant      other.''       Charles Hammond, the 52-year-old mayor of Fairfield,      Calif., first met Marshall at the community center when he      was 14. It was ``where we virtually lived after we got out of      school, and she was one of our youth directors. They      basically kicked our behinds and kept us in line. We'd have      our dances and she'd give us rules--no cursing, no smoking,      treat the ladies like ladies * * * But she always had time      for us. There was never a question that went unanswered. And      that's what we admired about her. Seven days a week, any time      you looked around, there she was, just like our mothers.''               Johnetta Marshall's advice for single moms       Johnetta Marshall successfully raised six children along.      Some now have families of their own, and all pursue rewarding      careers.       ``It wasn't easy then,'' said Marshall, ``and even though      women have more advantages now, it is lots more difficult.''       She offered this advice for today's single mothers:      ``Recognize that you are only one person, that you can never      by a mother and a father. Just be the best role model you      can.       ``As the mother, you instill in your children some ideals      by the way you live. Always be honest and frank with the      children. Don't let them think you can give them the moon      when you can only give them a piece of the earth.       ``And don't give up. You can do it.''
