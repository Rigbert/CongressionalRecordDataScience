The underlying resolution as amended this morning now leaves the vast majority of the homeland security jurisdiction in committees other than in the new homeland security committee. I think that is a mistake. I think, if we are going to take that route, then we have not done the consolidation that the administration has called for.  Perhaps that is the will of this body. I understand these issues are difficult, that committees think they have a special relationship with these agencies. But let's not pretend we are consolidating agencies to parallel the consolidation that we undertook when we created the Department of Homeland Security.  Mr. McCAIN. I ask the Senator from Maine, I am sure she is aware but I think our colleagues should know, that the legislation creating the Transportation Security Administration, under the title ``Functions,'' reads:       The Under Secretary shall be responsible for security in      all modes of transportation including carrying out chapter      449 relating to civil aviation security, related research and      development activities, security responsibilities over other      modes of transportation, be responsible for day-to-day      Federal security screen operations, for passenger air      transportation, interstate transportation. . . .  It goes on and on. It is all security. That is the job of the Transportation Security Administration. That is one of the reasons why it is so named.  So rather than take the Transportation Security Administration and put it under the committee on homeland security and governmental affairs, we leave it in the Commerce Committee.
