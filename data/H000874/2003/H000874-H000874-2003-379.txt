Leader, we are hearing that this bill may be coming to the floor very soon. Can you tell us when we might expect this bill on the floor and again will that be on the floor before the Memorial Day recess?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will yield further, now that the budget resolution has been adopted and we have set aside funds for modernizing the Medicare program and add a prescription drug benefit, the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Energy and Commerce are working very hard to craft a legislative proposal. As the gentleman is very aware and everyone in this House is aware, this is a very difficult issue and it takes a long time to bring parties together. We hope to consider this legislation in the coming weeks, but we really do not have a feel right now as to when we can bring it up. It is difficult to say whether we can have it before the Memorial Day break or not.
