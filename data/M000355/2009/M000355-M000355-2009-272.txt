 This was a man who certainly had an impact both on his community and on the Nation as a whole. It is no exaggeration at all to say that thanks to David, thousands of workers at nuclear plants in this country have safer jobs and healthier lives.  That includes David's coworkers at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Paducah, KY, where for 10 years David served as president of the Nuclear Workers Union. You see, the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant has produced enriched uranium since 1952 and is currently the only operating uranium enrichment facility in the United States.  For much of the Cold War, the Paducah plant produced fissionable material for our country's nuclear arsenal. It also enriched uranium for commercial nuclear reactors, helping to provide the benefits of cleanly generated electric power to millions of people.  Those Kentuckians who worked in the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant played a vital role in America's victory in the Cold War. Unfortunately, their own government did not look out for them as it should have.  About 10 years ago, we learned there were risks associated with working at the Paducah plant, particularly during the early years of its operation. Some workers were exposed to cancer-causing chemicals and radiological hazards. Some would later sicken and even die.  David was tireless in advocating for the workers at Paducah. He was one of them. He put in 33 years as a cascade operator and electrician. His testimony before Congress was key to advancing the effort to care for those who had been harmed by the government's careless treatment. Thanks, in part, toDavid, we created the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program to ensure that our Nation's nuclear workers finally now get the attention they deserve from their government. Medical screening is available to all Paducah workers so they may be tested and treated for any illness they contract as a result of working at the plant. We are working to clean up some of the legacy waste materials left at the Paducah plant.  I also might say my wife Elaine Chao, who served as Secretary of Labor during the Bush years, was deeply involved in setting up this compensation program there at Paducah and she too became a friend of David Fuller's.  David testified before Congress on behalf of his fellow workers, including before a committee I chaired. He served as his union's president for 5 years, longer than anyone before, and never lost an election.  David and I worked side by side for a long time on this issue. He visited my office frequently here in Washington, and on several occasions I was his guest at the Paducah Nuclear Workers Union Hall to meet with and speak to the local membership. In that time, I saw how determined David was to help develop a program that would ensure all current and former plant employees were tested for exposure and that would provide sick employees with the treatment they need and deserve.  Of course, nothing can take the place of a life or good health, but David wanted to see every effort made to provide compensation for the workers and their families. Thanks to his extraordinary work, he lived to see that happen.  I know his tireless service will not be forgotten by his friends and coworkers. Even the Paducah workers who did not get to know David personally know they certainly have him to thank for the justice that was provided to the workers who took on this vital duty.  Elaine and I have lost a good friend. We send our prayers to his wife Katherine Cooper Fuller; his daughters, Julie Fuller Leidecker, Laura Ann Nichole ``Nikki'' Fuller, and Meagen Joan Fuller; his son John David Fuller; his three grandchildren; and many other beloved family members and friends.  Not everyone, after he or she is gone, will be able to show as easily as David that theirs was a life spent helping others. David gave so many the simple gift of time: more time spent with their family, friends, and loved ones.  Sadly, David's family has run out of time with David himself, as he passed away on July 19 at the age of only 62. But I hope they can take some solace in the tremendous work he did on behalf of others. Kentucky has lost a great man. He will not be forgotten.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
