President, I rise in support of the Levin amendment, which establishes a commission to look into the treatment of detainees by our national security forces.  Let me say as an initial point, I am a strong supporter of the McCain-Graham amendment which would clarify the law. But the issues we are confronting today with respect to Abu Ghraib and with respect to other notorious incidents is not simply a failure of law, a failure of lacking legal precedent; it is a failure of leadership and a failure of institutions. Unless we look carefully, objectively, and independently at this leadership and these institutions, we will be bound to repeat the mistakes of the past several years. I urge my colleagues to support the Levin amendment.  What prompts me to support this amendment is the belief and understanding that the treatment of our soldiers on the battlefield is a function of how we treat our opponents. If we do not have high standards of treatment, then we cannot make the moral claim that our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines should be similarly treated.  I understand the nature of our adversaries might reject those claims, might reject standards, but if we reject those standards, then our ability to protect our soldiers is diminished substantially.  I think also one just has to take note of the events of the last several years and understand that not only is there a legal and moral premise to our use of suitable standards of conduct, there is a very practical one.
