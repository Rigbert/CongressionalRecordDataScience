Chair, I think it is important that EPA right the wrong that was caused by the Gold King Mine spill and ensure that the affected States, and the Tribal areas, have the resources they need following the spill.  The FY17 bill included $4 million to work with the States and Tribes on an independent water monitoring plan as authorized by the WIIN Act. Therefore, the proposed level in this amendment would exceed the authorized level. And for that reason, I must oppose the gentleman's amendment.  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
