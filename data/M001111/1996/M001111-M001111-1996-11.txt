 President, I rise today to address my colleagues about a matter that concerns the American public deeply--the well-being of their children.  I have come to the floor myself several times these past 2 years to talk about our children's future. Since January of last year, when the House voted to cut school lunches and other nutrition programs; to this past spring, when I reported on my children's forums in Washington State; to just a month ago, when the Senate finally voted to require hospitals to allow new mothers to spend at least 48 hours in the hospital when delivering a baby, I have been a frequent and avid speaker on issues affecting children and families.  I have always tried to present children's issues in three basic categories: Their health, their education, and their ability to contribute to society in the long term. In my view, those ideas are pretty straightforward: every child has a right to good health; every child has a right to an education; and every child has a right to grow up in strong, nurturing communities. The cycle is simple: a child who is healthy is able to learn; a learned child is able to participate in society; a society of contributing adults is able to uphold its responsibilities to the children. Again, and again, and again.  This has been a very strange 2 years for children's policy. There have been great victories, such as health insurance portability and mandatory maternity care. Threats have been turned aside, such as cuts in school lunches, jeopardizing Medicaid services for children, and elimination of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program. And there have been defeats--reductions in student loans and direct lending, and a radical welfare bill that leaves millions of poor children in limbo.  As we near the end of the 104th Congress, I would like to take a moment to explore some of the highs and lows for children, some of the accomplishments we have made that will help children, and some of the problems we still face, and which will require our continuing attention in the next Congress.  After much wrangling, the fiscal year 1997 Omnibus Appropriations Act continues our investment in young people's well-being in some important areas:  In infant health, the Healthy Start Program has made significant gains against infant mortality in several high-rate communities around the Nation. In spite of initial attempts to cut it, Healthy Start funding was increased from $75 million to $96 million. Healthy Start has proven itself across partisan lines by creating effective models for other communities. And, like many other children's health programs, it is very deserving of an increase.  Also, the maternal and child health services block grant was funded at $681 million. The block grant supports local communities in their efforts to provide many essential health services, including prenatal care, newborn screening, and care for children with disabilities.  Other health areas, such as funding for the National Institutes for Health, and funding for the Ryan White Act, and for AIDS research, also met at least minimum targets in the bill.  Head Start works toward the improvement of the health and education of needy youngsters. Arguably, this program has done more for young children in terms of getting them healthy and ready for school than any other. It demands to be retained and expanded. The level of $3.98 billion in this bill will allow the program to keep pace with inflation. This is good, but this will be an obvious program to expand next year.  In the area of education funding, once Head Start has readied children for school, we must make sure they stay on equal footing with their peers. One way to do this is to assure they have access to educational technology. If we do not continue to give students access to the technology of today, they will not be able to get or hold the jobs of tomorrow. I am glad the appropriations bill continues our investments in new education technology and technology challenge grants.  We have made other positive efforts this year, such as my legislation which will put surplus government computers in schools. But these efforts will be less effective unless we are also investing in new technology, including networking capability, new hardware and software, and teacher training that schools will need to succeed.  The Safe and Drug Free Schools Program also fares better under this bill than I had hoped. This program increased by $56 million, which pays for educational curriculum specifically designed to give students options to the violence and drug use we see young people combat daily in today's society. Every school district in the country gets some of this money, because there is no community in which drugs do not present a threat to the potential of young Americans.  Beyond technology, funding the School-to-Work Program is vital. School-to-Work shows students the connection between what they learn in the classroom and what they must know in the workplace. These programs have been funded at $400 million, which is a $50 million improvement over last year's level. There is no better investment we can make for the 75 percent of high school graduates who do not end up with a college degree.  When it comes to education, we too often forget adult students. In most areas of this bill, we were only able to hold the line, and to survive. But in at least one area that is supported by Members of both parties, we were able to provide a much-needed increase for adult basic education--adult literacy. The students here are some of the most heroic people in our country.  Many adults in this country are unable to read to their own children, or are faced with tests in the workplace that mean the difference between employment and unemployment. It is very difficult for these same adults to go to programs at their local community college, or run by a nonprofit organization, and learn to read. It is truly courageous. As they learn, they get better jobs, they provide better help to their children in school, and they contribute more to our society. This was a great next step; but especially with the welfare bill taking effect now and in the near future, we need to do more.  In areas of citizenship, one of our best investments is Americorps. Americorps builds on the best traditions of the Civilian Conservation Corps, the G.I. bill, and the Peace Corps, by rewarding people for working to improve their communities. It was eliminated in the House version of the VA-HUD bill, so I am glad to see that Americorps programs were returned to their 1996 levels. We should have new investments here, but at least we are continuing our investment.  There are still several areas of this Appropriations Act that do not meet the test of providing at least the minimum basic standards for all young people in this country.  In basic child health, child immunization funding is $20 million lower than the level necessary. To underfund such a vital area, when we have seen outbreaks of measles and other diseases in my State and around the Nation, is a move I do not understand and find troubling. We must move forward, and expand immunization to deal with the needs we know are out there. The prevention we provide, compared to the cost of treating the diseases we allow, is not only cost effective, but also the right thing to do. Additional appropriations would allow us to fund the infrastructure, education, and registries which would get immunizations to the underserved children who need them most.  On education, the huge task before us is in the area of teacher training. Goals 2000 was increased in this appropriations bill, but Eisenhower professional development activities were cut this year. If our schools succeed in the next century in teaching job and thinking skills to students, it will be because of our teachers.  Our current teaching corps is aging and many will soon be retiring. Research shows that for one teacher to learn one new skill that she or he can reproduce in the classroom, they need to spend several hours practicing that skill under supervision of a master teacher.  When I look at the investments we must make to allow young people to be the best possible citizens in our communities, I see that the Senate has again made a mistake. The Summer Youth Employment Program is funded equal to 1996 funding, but here is one area where extra investment truly would pay off with results for our communities. Young people are always telling adults that they do not have anything to do, especially when school is out. Summer Youth Employment helps teach the skills of work and work attitudes that will reduce violence, and improve young people's confidence and self-control. Earlier versions of the bill would have meant 134,000 fewer jobs for young people this summer. When we are all working so hard to keep young people involved and interested in productive activities, this cut is absolutely the wrong thing to do.  Children and young people deserve their Senator's very best decisionmaking. I would argue that children and young people need our attention and best efforts more than any other group of people in our country. What we have done here in this Appropriations Act, is to reject the open assaults on children's programs we saw earlier in this Congress. In order to get beyond a survival level, to a place where we can say we are actually investing in the future, we must expand funding in preventive areas: in access to preventive health services, in the improvement of teacher training, and in the expansion of productive activities for youth.  This Congress has shown that it can muster the foresight and compassion it takes to deal with issues affecting children. This Congress has also made some decisions I fear may have disturbing effects on countless young people. I have worked hard during this Congress, as have others, to do the very best for all of our children. Let us build upon this fiscal year 1997 Appropriations Act, so our actions will be remembered well by this Nation's children when they are old enough to vote.                                 amtrak
