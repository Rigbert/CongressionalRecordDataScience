 We have about 20,000 pages of regulations now issued.  I used them in a speech recently. They were 7 feet tall. We had to put them on a dolly to get it out on the podium.  I would ask my friend and colleague from Kentucky, didn't I read the other day, that even after we do all of the 2,700 page bill, the 20,000 pages of regulations, there still may be 25 or 30 million people uninsured?
