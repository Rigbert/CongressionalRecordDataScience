Mr. Speaker, today I want to bring to the attention of my colleagues the deteriorating conditions in the region of Banja Luka in northern Bosnia. It seems the latest atrocities committed by Bosnian Serb militants, who control the area, are directed at Catholic Church leaders and Catholic believers, who are primarily Croats. These attacks come on the heels of Croatia's efforts to regain control over some of its territory occupied by the Croatian Serb militants since 1991. Around 40,000 Croats still live in northern Bosnia despite significant ethnic cleansing by the Serbs. An estimated 50,000 Croats and hundreds of thousands of Moslems have been expelled from this region alone during the past 3 years.  In one recent incident in Banja Luka, a priest and nun were reportedly doused with gasoline and set on fire in the parish rectory as militants blew up the parish church building next door. This tragic act of barbarity is part of a larger campaign directed against the Catholic community in the diocese of Banja Luka. On May 4, militants forcibly expelled nuns from two convents in the region. Since that time, a total of five churches and one monastery have been destroyed. In all, since the beginning of the war, 40 churches in the diocese have been completely destroyed and another 25 have sustained heavy damage.  The bishop of Banja Luka, Franjo Komarcia, has repeatedly called upon the Bosnian Serb leadership to stop the attacks. These pleas have fallen on deaf ears. Bishop Komarica, in an open appeal, described the current situation in his diocese: ``Fear and panic, for their lives, has overcome the Catholics remaining in the area because they are totally unprotected from the local and newly arrived Serbian extremists. They are virtually [sic] hostages and are faced with the real threat of immediate catastrophe or widespread banishment.'' Bishop Komarica began a hunger strike recently to draw attention to the gravity of the situation faced by the Catholic community in Banja Luka. Late last week, an urgent appeal was sent to the head of the Serbian Orthodox Church urging his intervention to ensure the protection of Catholics in the Serb stronghold. The senseless attacks in Banja Luka have been roundly condemned by Pope John Paul II.  Mr. Speaker, these tragic developments are but the latest examples of the campaign of death and destruction directed against innocent civilians by the Bosnian Serb militants in Banja Luka and elsewhere in Bosnia and Herzegovina.                          ____________________
