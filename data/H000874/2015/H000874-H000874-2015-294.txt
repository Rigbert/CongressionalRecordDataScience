Speaker, I'm pleased to rise in support of H.R. 2795, the First Responders Identification of Emergency Needs in Disaster Situations (FRIENDS) Act, which was introduced by my friend Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas. That her bill is expected to be approved with overwhelming bipartisan support, including from Chairman Mike McCaul of the Homeland Security Committee, ought to surprise no one, because Rep. Jackson Lee has worked tirelessly on behalf of America's first responders to move this legislation through the House. Her legislation would launch a study of best practices and state of preparedness of state and local response agencies with the aim of improving safety and access to lifesaving resources.  This bill recognizes the important role first responders play in communities throughout our country. We must ensure that these men and women have the resources they need to perform their jobs safely and effectively. We've witnessed the courage of first responders, from the September 11 attacks to the Boston Marathon bombings and at last week's deadly shooting in San Bernardino, California. We see it every day all over our nation.  I've been incredibly proud to support first responders as Co-Chair of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, and I want to thank Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee for her work to bring the FRIENDS Act to the Floor. I also want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their support for this legislation in committee and in the full House.                          ____________________
