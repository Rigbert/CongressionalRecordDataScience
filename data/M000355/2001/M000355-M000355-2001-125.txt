 Lincoln):  S. 810. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify the amount of the charitable deduction allowable for contributions of food inventory, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to remedy the shortage of food donations that plagues food banks and other organizations dedicated to ending hunger in America.  It is a sad truth that hunger continues to persist even as our economy has broken records over the past decade. If we take a look at the dynamics of the restaurant industry, new construction, long lines for tables, oversized portions of food, it is obvious that food supply is not the problem.  The problem is waste. America wastes 96 billion pounds of food each year. And in doing so, we allow 31 million people to go hungry. This is unacceptable in a society that has bountiful food resources and an infrastructure of local and national food banks willing to accept donations of surplus food. Perhaps the most awful statistic is that while many of us wait in line to purchase, or to be served, abundant amounts of food, many hungry American families will wait in line at food banks and never receive a meal. Last year we failed to meet more than 20 percent of the demand for food at area food banks. That means, in effect, one out of every five families is sent home hungry,  Why is there such a shortage of donated food? Well, our Internal Revenue Service makes it more economical to throw food away rather than give it away. While the tax code permits restaurants to deduct half of the difference between the cost of donated food and its market value, the IRS often will tell a restaurant that donated food has no market value for deduction purposes simply because the food was not sold through normal retail distribution channels. For instance, a restaurant may have its own extra-stringent ``freshness'' standard where they proudly sell food that has been ``off the grill'' for less than 10 minutes. Well, we all know that this same food, if properly maintained, will remain wholesome for much longer, and that area food banks have a desperate need for such food.  But when the IRS fails to assign an appropriate market value to donated food, the deduction is meaningless. Donating food requires a business to incur additional costs of storage, transportation, and labor. If a business cannot, at the very least, recoup these additional costs, they actually lose money by donating food instead of throwing the food away. What we have then, Mr. President, is an IRS that is effectively administering tax policy that discourages, rather than encourages, private industry from helping to feed needy families. We all learned in church that it's better to give than to receive. Unfortunately, at the IRS, the motto seems to be: it's better to throw away than to give away.  Another reason that excess food fails to reach needy families is that too many businesses are ineligible to deduct food donations because of an outdated restriction in the tax code. Many small restaurants, farms, and franchises are organized as ``s'' corporations, limited liability corporations, or sole proprietorships. The current law, however, limits the deduction to traditional ``c'' corporations. If we are serious about feeding needy families through charitable donations, then the Government needs to enlist a new army of small businesses in the fight against hunger.  To eliminate these two major barriers in the fight against hunger, the Feeding Needy Families Act would define the market value of donated food without penalizing businesses for setting high internal standards. This codifies the decision of the United States Tax Court in Lucky Stores, Inc. v. Commissioner, 95 T.C. 420 (1995), where the court held that the market value of donated bread was the full retail price for purposes of calculating the deduction. The bill also expands the deduction to any entity that is kind enough to expend the effort necessary to donate surplus food, whether it be an ``s'' corporation, a limited liability corporation, or a sole proprietorship. Removing these legal, logistical, and financial roadblocks will go a long way to ensure that excess food flows from table to table rather than from table to trash.  I am pleased to be joined by Senator Lincoln in introducing this important legislation. I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record, following the text of my statement, a copy of the bill. I also would ask unanimous consent that the Record include letters of support from the Salvation Army, USA Harvest, Kentucky Harvest, Northern Kentucky Harvest, the National Association of Chain Restaurants, and the National Restaurant Association.  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 810       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Feeding Needy Families      Act''.     SEC. 2. CHARITABLE DEDUCTION FOR CONTRIBUTIONS OF FOOD                    INVENTORY.       (a) In General.--Subsection (e) of section 170 of the      Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to certain      contributions of ordinary income and capital gain property)      is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:       ``(7) Special rule for contributions of food inventory.--       ``(A) Contributions by non-corporate taxpayers.--In the      case of a charitable contribution of food, paragraph (3)      shall be applied without regard to whether or not the      contribution is made by a corporation.       ``(B) Determination of fair market value.--For purposes of      this section, in the case of a charitable contribution of      food which is a qualified contribution (within the meaning of      paragraph (3), as modified by subparagraph (A) of this      paragraph) and which, solely by reason of internal standards      of the taxpayer, lack of market, or similar circumstances,      cannot or will not be sold, the fair market value of such      contribution shall be determined--       ``(i) without regard to such internal standards, such lack      of market, or such circumstances, and       ``(ii) if applicable, by taking into account the price at      which the same or similar food items are sold by the taxpayer      at the time of the contribution (or, if not so sold at such      time, in the recent past).''       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a)      shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31,      2001.                                       ____                                                      May 1, 2001.     Senator Mitch McConnell,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: I am writing in support of your food donation      bill. It has been my experience over the last 14 years that      there is truly a need in our nation for the effort that is      put forth in this bill. Tragically the average age of      homelessness today is 9 years old. Your legislation will      certainly go a long way in assisting the 120 USA Harvest      chapters in helping feed our nation's less fortunate      children.       The encouragement that this bill will provide those people      and organizations in the food business to partner with USA      harvest is going to make a significant difference in the      quality of life for many millions of Americans.           Very truly yours,                                                      Stan Curtis,      Founder and Chairman USA Harvest.                                  ____                                             Kentucky Harvest,                                    Lexington, KY, April 26, 2001.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of our hunger relief      program, we write to thank you for your plan to introduce the      ``Good Samaritan Tax Act'' in the Senate. By clarifying the      charitable deduction allowable for contributions of food and      extending the deduction to all business entities willing to      donate food, the Good Samaritan Tax Act will help ensure that      our program will have access to additional wholesome food.      This food will be used to continue our fight against hunger.       It is a shame for good food to go to waste. However,      significant costs are associated with the systematic      distribution of food by restaurants to those in need.      Distribution and transportation systems, quality control      assurances, record keeping and compliance systems must be      developed and maintained to safely get food to those who are      in need.       We believe that the Good Samaritan Tax Act will help the      food service industry offset these costs, and therefore      encourage the contribution of their excess food to      organizations such as ours. This additional food will help to      ensure our ability to continue to assist those in need.       Thank you for your support in the fight against hunger.           Sincerely,                                                        Ed Schaub,     Chairman.                                  ____                                    Northern Kentucky Harvest,                                       Covington, KY, May 1, 2001.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: I am writing on behalf of the bill      you plan to introduce named ``The Feeding Needy Families      Act.'' By clarifying the charitable deduction allowable for      contributions of food and extending the deduction to all      business entities willing to donate, the Feeding Needy      Families Act will help ensure that our program will have      access to additional wholesome food.       In fact, Northern Kentucky Harvest will benefit greatly by      your new bill. In the past, many company-owned restaurants      participated in our program where excess food was donated and      distributed to feed the homeless and less fortunate in      Northern Kentucky. However, when these restaurants were sold      to local franchisees, they no longer participated due to the      inability to receive ``credit'' for their food donation to      defray costs associated with the donation. As a result, many      homeless and less fortunate people went without food. This      bill gives us another opportunity to reclaim ``wasted'' food      and give the less fortunate ``hope'' for another day. Your      bill means a great deal to the success of eradicating hunger.       Please support this bill and allow us to make a difference      in our community by trying to overcome hunger.           Sincerely,     William E. Henderson III.                                  ____                                           The Salvation Army,                             Louisville, Kentucky, April 19, 2001.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.

Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of the National Council      of Chain Restaurants, we are writing to express our support      for the ``Feeding Needy Families Act''. This bill, which you      introduce today, provides tax incentives to encourage      business contributions of food items.       The National Council of Chain Restaurants (``NCCR'') is a      national trade association representing forty of the nation's      largest multi-unit, multi-state chain restaurant companies.      These forty companies own and operate in excess of 50,000      restaurant facilities. Additionally, through franchise and      licensing agreements, another 70,000 facilities are operated      under their trademarks. In the aggregate, NCCR's member      companies and their franchisees employ in excess of 2.8      million individuals.       Your legislation is necessary to clarify the charitable      deduction allowance for contributions for food, helping      ensure the nation's food banks and donation centers can      continue the fight against hunger. As welfare reform kicks      in, many people making the transition between public      assistance and independence are turning to charitable food      distribution programs for assistance.       Unfortunately, the IRS is exacerbating the problem with its      interpretation of the charitable donation sections of the      Internal Revenue Code. The code is designed to encourage      charitable donations of food by allowing a deduction equal to      cost plus one-half the difference between cost and fair      market value. However, the IRS maintains that when food      cannot be sold through normal distribution channels (i.e.,      food left over when a restaurant closes for the night), its      retail value is zero and the taxpayer's deduction is limited      to cost only.       Distribution and transportation systems, quality control      assurances, record keeping and compliance systems must be      developed and maintained to safely and efficiently get food      to the needy. These processes involve significant costs. The      ``Good Samaritan Tax Act'' will help the food service      industry offset these costs, and therefore encourage the      contribution of food to the needy, by codifying the fair      market value of donated food. It also extends the deduction      to any trade or business, not just corporations.       We thank you for introducing this common-sense legislation      and offer our assistance to ensure its enactment into law.           Sincerely,                                                   Terrie M. Dort,     President.                                  ____                              National Restaurant Association,                                   Washington, DC, April 25, 2001.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of the 844,000 restaurant      locations nationwide, the National Restaurant Association      offers it's support of the Feeding Needy Families Act, which      would provide more equitable tax treatment for food that is      donated to charities.       As you know, under the current tax code, businesses do not      receive the same tax deduction for charitable donations of      food as they do for other inventory. Food that is not sold      through normal distribution channels is considered by the      Internal Revenue Service to have no market value. In effect,      businesses are penalized and charities suffer because it      makes more economic sense for businesses to discard the food      than to donate it. The Feeding Needy Families Act would      correct this discrepancy in the tax code by allowing      businesses to take deductions on a fair market value basis      rather than just deducting the cost of raw materials.       As I am sure you can imagine, the effort and cost involved      in preparing perishable items to be donated can be      considerable. The food must be carefully collected, packaged,      and transported in a timely manner before it can be      distributed to food banks, soup kitchens, homeless shelters      and other organizations that serve the hungry. Because of the      additional work involved, we are concerned that it creates a      disincentive for businesses to donate food. That is why the      National Restaurant Association supports this legislation as      a means of providing strong incentives for businesses to      donate food--a much needed and valuable commodity.       We appreciate your support in moving this issue forward and      we hope that you will be successful in enacting the bill      without any modifications this year as restaurants are an      important resource in helping the millions of Americans that      do not get enough food to meet their basic needs.       Thank you for supporting the Feeding Needy Families Act and      we look forward to working with you in passing this      legislation.           Sincerely,     Steven C. Anderson,       President and Chief Executive Officer.     Lee Culpepper,       Senior Vice President, Government Affairs and Public      Policy.                                 ______                                       By
