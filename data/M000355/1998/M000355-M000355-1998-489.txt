 President, I thank the Senator from Alabama for his important contribution. It seems to me that it shows real principle. When you have been through a campaign and you have had independent expenditures or issue advocacy--either one--used against you and you didn't like it, but you fully recognize that it is constitutionally protected speech, that is commendable. So I thank the Senator from Alabama for his important contribution to this debate.
