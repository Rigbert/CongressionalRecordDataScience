While I may disagree with them on some parts of this, I do so respectfully because I know how hard they have worked.  In the last Congress, they were able to negotiate some procedural improvements. They reined in some of the worst aspects of previous class action bills. One improvement was to restrict the use of worthless coupon settlements. I strongly support this improvement, which is a targeted provision that goes after a real class action abuse, not one that is just made up by special interests.  Unfortunately, there are other aspects that fail to achieve their intended goals. For example, two narrow exceptions have been negotiated to allow a few local controversies to remain in State court. But the exceptions to removal to Federal court touch on only a thin sliver of the class action cases this bill would affect--only when plaintiffs and primary defendants are from the same State--and even then it will do more harm than good with the complicated formula that will cause costly and time-consuming litigation. So this just increases the cost and increases the litigation.  Another provision seeks to reduce the delay plaintiffs can experience when a case is removed to Federal court by setting a time limit for appeals of remand orders. But no measureis included in the bill to set a timeline for the district court to rule on the actual remand motion. What this means in layman's terms is a party can pluck one of these class actions out of State court and put it in Federal court, and if the Federal court rules against you on a remand, you have a right to appeal. But what do you do if they never rule? The case could sit there year after year and with no resolution. Litigants could die. People who have been harmed could die. People could move away, and nothing happens.  Senator Feingold is going to offer an amendment to set a reasonable time limit for the district court to rule on remand orders. It does nothing to change the bill. It says you cannot pocket veto a case by sticking it away in a federal court docket somewhere. You have to rule one way or the other. We should all embrace that commonsense improvement.  I am also concerned that this bill will deny justice to consumers and others in class actions that involve multiple State laws. The recent trend in Federal courts is not to certify class actions if multiple State laws are involved. This bill, therefore, could force nationwide class actions to Federal court. Once they are removed to Federal court, you have a Catch-22. They have to be dismissed because they involve too many State laws.  If this legislation is really about transferring class actions to Federal court instead of being a pro-business vehicle for simply dismissing legitimate class actions, then the supporters of this legislation should want to solve this real Catch-22 problem. Senator Bingaman has an amendment to do just that. He is a former attorney general. He understands this. I look forward to debating this issue on the Senate floor.  Of course, the legislation covers more than just class actions. Individual personal injury actions, consolidated by State courts for efficiency purposes, are not class actions. Despite the fact that a similar provision was unanimously struck from the bill during the markup of class actions legislation in the Judiciary Committee last Congress, despite the fact that every single Republican, every single Democrat voted to strike this provision, now mass torts are again included in the bill. Again, that makes no sense. Federalizing these individual cases will delay and possibly deny justice for victims suffering real physical injuries. It will be a boon to the makers of Vioxx, but certainly will not help those who took Vioxx.  Mass tort cases are not class actions. They have not been analyzed under rule 23's standards or State law equivalents to rule 23. They are an important means by which groups of injured people have long been able to pursue remedies against those who have harmed them.  Mass tort cases address injuries to citizens' health from dangerous medical products, injuries to their property and their health from environmental disasters, and injuries to their rights and liberties from widespread mistreatment in the workplace. There are entirely different procedural vehicles to reach justice in class actions. They should not be lumped in with class actions. Senator Durbin has an amendment that would leave mass tort actions in State courts where they belong.  I am old enough to remember the civil rights battles of the 1950s and 1960s and the impact of class actions in vindicating basic rights through our courts. The landmark Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education was the culmination of appeals from four class action cases--three from Federal court decisions in Kansas, South Carolina, and Virginia, and one from a decision by the State supreme court of Delaware.  Only the supreme court of Delaware--the State court, not the Federal court--got the case right by deciding for the African-American plaintiffs. The State court justices understood they were constrained by the existing Supreme Court law but, nonetheless, held that the segregated schools of Delaware violated the 14th amendment. Before any Federal court did so, a State court rejected separate and unequal schools.  Today we take that for granted, but it was not because those cases went into Federal court that the civil rights of African Americans were determined; it was because they were in State court. Indeed, many civil rights advocates, including the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, and the National Asian Pacific Legal Consortium, have written to Senators in opposition to this legislation and in support of Senator Kennedy's amendment to exempt civil rights and wage and hour cases from the bill. I am proud to cosponsor his amendment, and I look forward to the debate on it.  The legislation has also been criticized by nearly all the State Attorneys General in this country. I understand that at least 43 of the 50 State Attorneys General have expressed concern that S. 5 could limit their powers to investigate and bring actions in their State courts against defendants who cause harm to their citizens because in certain instances they file suit as the class representative for the consumers of their State.  I expect Senator Pryor, a distinguished former State attorney general himself, to bring this issue to the floor with a clarifying amendment.  Some special interest groups are distorting the state of class action litigation by relying on a few anecdotes in an ends-oriented attempt to impede plaintiffs from bringing class action cases. We should take steps to correct actual problems as they occur. Simply transferring most suits into Federal court will not correct the real problems faced by plaintiffs and defendants.  In fact, this Congress and past Congresses have federalized so many criminal cases that used to be in State courts and dumped them into the Federal courts that it is increasingly difficult to even get a civil case heard in Federal court. So many things are handled by local prosecutors, such as Senator Specter and myself when we were prosecutors, by local law enforcement, but because they are interesting matters, we have succumbed to the temptation to federalize case after case that State authorities have always handled very well. These criminal cases are now in the Federal courts, and the Federal courts are overloaded with them. Now we are going to transfer a whole lot more cases into Federal courts.  Defrauded investors, deceived consumers, victims of defective products and environmental torts, and thousands of other ordinary people have been able to rely on class action lawsuits in our State court system, and there they have sought and received justice. We all know that without consolidating procedures such as class actions, it might be impossible for victims to obtain effective legal representation.  Companies tend to pay their defense lawyers by the hour. They are well paid. Plaintiffs' lawyers in class actions tend to work without pay for the possibility of obtaining a portion of the proceeds, if they are successful. It may well prove uneconomical for counsel to take on cases against governmental or corporate defendants if they must do so on an individual basis. It may be that individual claims are simply too small to be pursued.  Sometimes that is what the cheaters count on; it is how they get away with their schemes. Cheating thousands of people just a little is still cheating, or millions of people just a little creates millions of dollars for one person with nothing to stop them from doing it. Class actions allow the little guys to band together to afford a competent lawyer to redress wrongdoing.  Whether those regular citizens are getting together to force manufacturers to recall or correct dangerous products, or to clean up after devastating environmental harms that endanger their children or their neighborhoods, or to vindicate the basic civil rights to which they are entitled, they are using class actions. Why make it more difficult or costly for them to right those wrongs?  As the New York Times noted in an editorial last week opposing this bill, the real objective of this legislation is ``to dilute the impact of strong State laws protecting consumers and the environment and to make it harder for Americans to win redress in court when harmed by bad corporate behavior.''  We have very strong environmental laws in Vermont, and we are veryproud of them. Now we see this Congress about to say to the Vermont Legislature: We can apply much lesser standards; we will just take it away from any enforcement you already have.  I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times editorial be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Feb. 2, 2005]                         Class-Action Lawsuits       Tort reform is in the eye of the beholder. In the name of      reforming the nation's civil justice system, and with scant      public debate, President Bush and Congressional Republicans      are racing to reward wealthy business supporters by changing      the rules for class-action lawsuits. Their real objective is      to dilute the impact of strong state laws protecting      consumers and the environment and to make it harder for      Americans to win redress in court when they are harmed by bad      corporate behavior.       The proposed legislation, the so-called Class Action      Fairness Act, will be taken up by the Senate Judiciary      Committee on Thursday, with a vote by the full chamber      expected as early as next week. Under the bill's sweeping      provisions, nearly all major class-action lawsuits would be      moved from state courts to already stretched federal courts.      New procedural hurdles and backlogs would be destined to      delay or deny justice in many cases, and to discourage      plaintiffs and plaintiffs' lawyers from pursuing legitimate      claims in the first place.       The proposed lunge to federal courts is so extreme that      cases would be removed to federal courts even when a vast      majority of the plaintiffs were from one state, the claimed      injuries occurred in the state and involved possible      violations of state law, and the principal defendant had a      headquarters elsewhere but did substantial business in the      state.       In a revealing but disappointing move last year, the      measure's proponents rejected a balanced compromise that      would have broadened federal jurisdiction while preserving      the role of state courts in cases that are more local than      national in flavor. Despite some useful provisions aimed at      genuine abuses, the bill would reduce the accountability of      corporations that violate laws protecting employees,      consumers and the environment.       The measure died in the Senate at the close of the last      session. But with President Bush now actively campaigning for      its passage, the juggernaut may be unstoppable, particularly      since some key Democrats, like Senators Charles Schumer of      New York and Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, switched sides      last year to back the bill in exchange for some modest      revisions. The new Judiciary Committee chairman, Senator      Arlen Specter, should at least be willing to entertain a      handful of improving amendments. The most crucial would fix      the bill's Catch-22: plaintiffs filing class-action suits      could be refused a hearing in state court if they came from      several different states, and then bounced out of federal      court because their complaint called for applying the laws of      multiple states.       The ability of ordinary citizens with similar injuries to      band together to take on powerful corporate interests by      utilizing the mechanism of class-action lawsuits is one of      the shining aspects of the nation's civil justice system.      That reality tends to be overlooked amid all the overwrought      spinning by the president and others who are trying to drum      up concern about a litigation ``crisis'' and to pressure      Congress to usurp proper state authority and weaken important      protections for ordinary Americans.
