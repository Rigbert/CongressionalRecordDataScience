Ten years ago he wrote an important and foretelling book, Tapped Out, in which he described the world's looming clean water crisis.  Senator Simon was ahead of the curve. He identified this challenge long before many others, and urged the U.S. to lead on it. It is my privilege to carry forward his vision in the United States Senate today.  I take this responsibility seriously--not only to honor my friend and mentor from Illinois--but more importantly to further this country's leadership in making access to clean water and sanitation possible for people in every part of the world.  In 2005, Congress passed the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act to elevate the position of safe water and sanitation efforts in U.S. foreign assistance.  We have made progress since then. Last year alone, the U.S. helped provide nearly 2 million people with access to a better source of drinking water for the first time. And we helped more than 1.5 million people access better sanitation.  These are encouraging results, but our impact could be much greater. Our current efforts are hindered by limited resources and lack of overall strategy and coordination.  To strengthen U.S. leadership in this area, I am pleased to join with Senators Corker, Kerry and Murray, and Representatives Blumenauer and Payne to introduce new legislation that builds and improves upon the 2005 act.  The Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Enhancement Act of 2008 will increase capacity at USAID and the State Department to implement clean water and sanitation efforts.  It will strengthen local capacity by adding a corps of water experts to USAID missions and by training local water and sanitation managers.  It will foster development of low-cost and sustainable clean water and sanitation technologies for use in priority countries.  In short, it will put the U.S. again at the forefront of assuring access to these most basic needs for millions around the world.  We will not be able to make a sustained difference on the ground with good intentions alone. We need to back up the lofty goals in this bill with resources--money and personnel.  We need to give our development experts the tools and support they need to get the job done well. That is why I've also led an effort in the Senate to increase the number of Foreign Service Officers and to urge the placement of water experts in USAID missions around the world.  This kind of development assistance, helping to build infrastructure and alleviate poverty, is a crucial to our ability to lead and influence other countries.  America's strength resonates not only from its military power but from the power of American ideas and values, from our generosity and diplomacy.  I fear we have lost a measure of that influence in recent years. Our smart power has waned as we've focused our resources and attention elsewhere.  Real leadership from the United States on water and sanitation will help stave off one of the world's looming crises. It will reassert our standing as a leader in the fight against global poverty.  And, once again, Paul Simon was ahead of his time. What element of international development assistance could be more fundamental than ensuring access to clean water and basic sanitation?  We often take water for granted in this country. Turn on the tap, and out it comes--clean, inexpensive and plentiful. Occasionally we hear of water shortages in a handful of states during times of drought. But for the most part, we think little about this crucial resource.  Yet for many people in the world, access to clean water and sanitation are out of reach--and the problem may only get worse.  In the past 20 years, 2 billion people have gained access to safe drinking water and 600 million have gained access to basic sanitation services. This is encouraging progress.  Yet nearly 900 million people still live without clean water, and nearly 2 in 5 do not have access to proper sanitation.  In the past century, global demand for water has tripled, and is now doubling every two decades. Rapid population growth, urbanization, pollution and climate change will add even greater pressures to an already strained system.  This scenario is troubling for a lot of reasons.  First, unsafe water is a serious threat to global health. The World Health Organization estimates that water-related diseases account for about one-tenth of the global disease burden. We lose nearly 5,000 children each day to these diseases, and over 2 million people each year.  We recently expanded our efforts to fight global AIDS--an effort I support--but antiretroviral therapy taken with unsafe water may do more harm than good.  Lack of safe water threatens economic development and political stability. A developing economy cannot grow if its population is too sick to work or if its members are engaged in conflict over water resources, as in Darfur, for example, or in parts of the Middle East.  Nor can an economy grow if its women and girls have to spend many hours each day gathering water rather than engaging in more productive pursuits. The UN estimates that women lose 40 billion working hours each year to carrying water. The economic repercussions are clear.  Water scarcity has a serious impact on the environment, as well. The strain on natural resources will continue as global warming causes glaciers to melt and climate patterns to shift. We can expect key sources of clean water to be altered or eliminated in the process.  So, this is a big problem. But the U.S. is in a position to make a big difference in the lives of the world's poor with strong leadership and investment in global safe water.  U.S. leadership can and will make a difference in this most fundamental development challenge. I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting this effort to refocus our global clean water activities.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3642       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Senator Paul Simon Water for      the Poor Enhancement Act of 2008''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) The Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005      (Public Law 109-121)--       (A) makes access to safe water and sanitation for      developing countries a specific policy objective of United      States foreign assistance programs;       (B) requires the Secretary of State to--       (i) develop a strategy to elevate the role of water and      sanitation policy; and       (ii) improve the effectiveness of United States assistance      programs undertaken in support of that strategy;       (C) codifies Target 10 of the United Nations Millennium      Development Goals; and       (D) seeks to reduce the proportion of people who are unable      to reach or afford safe drinking water and basic sanitation      by 50 percent by 2015.       (2) On December 20, 2006, the United Nations General      Assembly, in GA Resolution 61/192, declared 2008 as the      International Year of Sanitation, in recognition of the      impact of sanitation on public health, poverty reduction,      economic and social development, and the environment.       (3) On August 1, 2008, Congress passed H. Con. Res. 318,      which--       (A) supports the goals and ideals of the International Year      of Sanitation; and       (B) recognizes the importance of sanitation on public      health, poverty reduction, economic and social development,      and the environment.       (4) While progress is being made on safe water and      sanitation efforts--       (A) more than 884,000,000 people throughout the world lack      access to safe drinking water; and       (B) 2 of every 5 people in the world do not have access to      basic sanitation services.       (5) The health consequences of unsafe drinking water and      poor sanitation are staggering, accounting for--       (A) nearly 10 percent of the global burden of disease; and       (B) more than 2,000,000 deaths each year.       (6) The effects of climate change are expected to produce      severe consequences for water availability and resource      management in the future, with 2,800,000,000 people in more      than 48 countries expected to face severe and chronic water      shortages by 2025.       (7) The impact of water scarcity on conflict and      instability is evident in many parts of the world, including      the Darfur region of Sudan, where demand for water resources      has contributed to armed conflict between nomadic ethnic      groups and local farming communities.       (8) In order to further the United States contribution to      safe water and sanitation efforts, it is necessary to--       (A) expand foreign assistance capacity to address the      challenges described in this section; and       (B) represent issues related to water and sanitation at the      highest levels of United States foreign assistance      deliberations, including deliberations related to issues of      global health, food security, the environment, global      warming, and maternal and child mortality.
