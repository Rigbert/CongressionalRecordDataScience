Chairman, I would like to support Congressman DeFazio's amendment and appreciate the chairman's willingness to consider it. Coming from the Midwestern part of the country, we literally have had Mexican trucks end up in our region, how, we don't know, where the driver was actually moving the steering wheel with a vise grip. Now, how does that get to the State of Ohio all the way from the border with Mexico? Something is really broken in the system already. We should not expand anything. We should fix the problem that we have today.  Let me tell you, the sheriffs in Ohio along the turnpike and all of our surface roads are busy dealing with traffic that shouldn't be there in the first place. A lot of those vehicles are carrying illegal narcotics into our region. That border is a sieve. We ought to take care of it.  Mr. Chairman, I support the gentleman's amendment and commend him for offering it here today.
