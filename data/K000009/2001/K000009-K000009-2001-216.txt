Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a remarkable woman in my district, Patricia Posey, who passed from this life on September 12, 2001. Pat lived a life of true riches for 77 years, sowing seeds which rooted deep in our community and which will flower for generations.  A master gardener, her love of this pastime and the beautiful bounty her efforts produced became legendary in West Toledo. Her gardening genius was well recognized, and she was published in several local, regional, and national magazines. Pat enjoyed sharing of her labor of love in the garden by hosting dinners featuring her produce. She was a winner of PBS' Victory Garden contest as well as local contests. Certified by the Ohio State University's Extension Service and the Lucas County Co-Operative, Pat mentored others to become master gardeners as well. Founder of the Toledo Mud Hands Garden Club and member of the American Horticulture Society, Pat's garden was even recognized by the National Wildlife Foundation as a wildlife refuge.  Truly a woman of substance, Pat volunteered for Grace Community Center, Feed Your Neighbor, and Love for Children. Her work as director of Toledo New Careers Program and later 15-year director of Stautzenberger Business College earned her The Golden Nike Award from the Ohio Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs. She enjoyed sewing, cooking and baking, making over 2000 pastries every Christmas and canning dozens of jars of produce from her garden.  Our heartfelt condolences to Pat's son, Joseph, her brothers and sister Barney, Leo, Mel and Alma, grandchildren Samuel and Hannah, great-grandchild Lucas, her nieces and nephews, relatives and friends. I know the memory of Pat will be carried carefully in their hearts and on a sweet Spring day when the earth is fresh and the garden new they will share the moment with her, smiling.                          ____________________
