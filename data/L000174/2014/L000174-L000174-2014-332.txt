 I hope that after we introduce the Personal Data Privacy and Security Act she may wish to become a cosponsor. This would better protect Americans from the growing threat of data breaches and identity theft.  Last year, according to Verizon's report, there were more than 600 publicly disclosed data breaches all over the country.  The recent breach of Target involved debit and credit card data of as many as 14 million customers. That is a reminder that developing a comprehensive national strategy to protect data privacy and cyber security remains one of the most challenging and important issues facing our Nation.  The Personal Data Privacy and Security Act will help meet this challenge, by better protecting Americans from the growing threat of data breaches and identity theft. I thank Senators Franken, Schumer, and Blumenthal for cosponsoring it.  When I first introduced this bill 9 years ago, I thought we very urgently needed privacy reforms for the American people. At that time, the threat to the American people was nowhere near as extensive as it is today.  The Judiciary Committee has favorably reported this bill in the past--Republicans and Democrats have joined together numerous times--but it has languished on the Senate calendar.  I wish to point out some of the dangers to Americans' privacy and our national security posed by data breaches that have not gone away. According to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, more than 662 million records have been involved in data security breaches since 2005. In Verizon's ``2013 Data Breach Investigations Report,'' there were more than 600 publicly disclosed data breaches.  These are just the ones that are publicly disclosed.  The Personal Data Privacy and Security Act requires companies that have databases with sensitive personal information on Americans to establish and implement data privacy and security programs. The bill would also establish a single nationwide standard for data breach notification and require notice to consumers when their sensitive personal information has been compromised. It provides for tough criminal penalties for anyone who would intentionally and willfully conceal the fact that a data breach has occurred when the breach causes economic damage to consumers. The requirement for companies to publicly disclose a breach will also encourage them to implement far better security than many have today.  Protecting privacy rights is of critical importance to all of us, regardless of party or ideology. I hope all Senators will join with this.                       Retirement of Barry Meyer
