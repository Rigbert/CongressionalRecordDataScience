JEFFORDS. I am not proceeding to the bill at this time. I am hopeful and wait patiently with great expectations that at some point after having discussed with you and perhaps communicated with the minority leader that we will be able to move forward with the bill in a way that will utilize the time today effectively so that we can complete this bill by the end of the week. But I do not intend to call it up at this particular moment.
