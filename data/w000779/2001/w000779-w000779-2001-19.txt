President, I come to the floor to talk about a program for vaccinating Americans, particularly as the country heads towards the season when many have the flu.  This is an area I have a great interest in since my days as director of the Oregon Gray Panthers. Obviously, older people are particularly vulnerable. This year, certainly there is going to be considerable focus on the flu vaccination program.  Given the new threats of bioterrorism that have been widely discussed, certainly many are going to be particularly interested in getting the flu vaccination. It is important that we reevaluate how flu vaccinations are provided in light of the unfortunate, significant new health concerns of many Americans.  Certainly the threat of bioterrorism has increased demand for flu shots. In my view, it has caused considerable confusion. In recent days, my office has canvassed State health departments and many senior citizens programs around the Nation. We have found that while no shortage currently exists, there are delays and certainly a substantial amount of misinformation about the various programs and services that are available for older people. There have also been problems with one manufacturer that may be exacerbating delays in getting vaccine doses out to the public.  Even more important, my sense is there isn't yet a clear, understandable system in place for ensuring that high-risk Americans, particularly the Nation's older people, are vaccinated early and first.  My sense is that more needs to be done in addition to prioritizing the concerns of high-risk, vulnerable Americans to put in place a better distribution system for getting out vaccines. There needs to be a better plan to make sure that there are processes in place, if there are problems or snafus of one manufacturer. It is extremely important that there be a uniform message coming from all health officials with respect to the flu vaccine program.  For example, while CDC and others have told Americans to get vaccinated later, others in the health system have urged Americans to get vaccinated quickly against the flu because of the anthrax threat.  Since anthrax has been in the news so much, it is logical for people to think they should get vaccinated immediately. But because people cannot get their shot the day they want it or the day a clinic is scheduled, some people may think there is an immediate shortage.  On the basis of the survey we have just done of the State health departments and many senior citizen centers, it does not appear there is a shortage with respect to the vaccine. But there are delays. There are instances where mixed messages have been sent by public health officials. This has certainly contributed to the confusion that exists.  Under the leadership of Senator Breaux, the Senate Aging Committee has been looking into this issue. At Senator Breaux's request--and let me also state the ranking minority member, Senator Craig, on the Aging Committee has been considerably interested in this in the past as well--our Aging Committee held a hearing that I chaired to look at the flu vaccine program.  We have worked with Secretary Thompson. I think he has made a number of steps that are constructive and have moved the program in the right direction, but certainly there is more to do.  For example, our survey found that in Indiana they received about 10 percent of the order the counties have placed, but it will have 50 to 100 percent of their order in 4 to 6 weeks. And, obviously, if shipments don't arrive on time, don't arrive in line with the plans that the programs and the senior citizen centers are putting out to their members, there is going to be a great deal of confusion.  So as we move to this crunch time for vaccinations, health officials in this country still cannot tell us if all the high-risk patients are being vaccinated, or if there are plans to vaccinate them. I think we need to develop a better system, for example, to track seniors who are in these programs. Many are signed up, and there are others who should be vaccinated early. This can be done if the public health system wants to do it.  So around the country there are concerns. I mentioned Indiana. In the State of Oregon, one large provider of public health clinics has received only about 40 percent of their order.  In Michigan, health officials are concerned that by the time they get the rest of the order they need in December, the public will not come. Doses may actually have to be dumped. So there are a variety of concerns about the flu vaccine program.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article in yesterday's Washington Post be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 15, 2001]                       Longer Lines for Flu Shots          Increase Attributed in Part To Anxiety About Anthrax                            (By Leef Smith)       Regional health care providers are reporting a 20 to 30      percent increase in the number of people lining up at grocery      stores and community clinics for flu shots, and attribute      part of the surge to widespread anxiety about anthrax.       The early symptoms of inhalation anthrax--fever, cough and      muscle pain--resemble those of the flu. As a result, doctors      say, many people are getting vaccinated in hopes of staving      off the flu and thus making anthrax easier to diagnose should      it occur.       ``We're seeing a lot of first-time flu shots,'' said Susan      Randall, a registered nurse and clinical manager for Inova      HealthSource, which is spearheading the Fight the Flu      campaign in Northern Virginia and plans to administer 80,000      flu shots this season. The campaign plans to provide 50,000      shots in Maryland and the District. ``If you ask people why      they're getting the vaccination . . . some will say they're      afraid of anthrax,'' she said.       But Randall said flu is serious enough on its own for      people to consider being inoculated. ``While it's tragic      we've had four anthrax deaths, over 20,000 people die of the      flu each year,'' she said. ``People should take the flu      seriously.''       The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has      issued the same advice, noting on its Web site that numerous      viruses cause flu-like symptoms. The site also discourages      people from getting a flu shot simply to reduce concern about      anthrax exposure.       ``You should get a flu shot to avoid the flu, and the      symptoms of the flu, not to avoid anthrax,'' said CDC      spokesman Curtis Allen. ``They're two different issues.''       Flu seasons begins in November, with cases generally      peaking in January and February.       Health care providers strive to vaccinate high-risk      groups--people 65 and older, those with chronic medical      conditions, medical workers and some pregnant women--by the      end of October. But a delay this year in the delivery of flu      vaccine from manufacturers--some of whom are upgrading their      equipment to increase productivity--has hampered that effort.       CDC officials say there is more vaccine being manufactured      this year than ever before--about 85 million doses--and      insist that there will be enough to meet the rising demand.       A little more than half the supply was sent to distributors      and health care organizations by the end of October, and      another large batch is expected this month. The rest is due      in December, although officials with the Food and Drug      Administration, as well as the CDC, say the timetable could      change.       Because of a supply delay, only about half of the 14,000      high-risk patients treated by Johns Hopkins Community      Physicians, a coalition of 18 private medical practices, have      received their vaccinations. The group had planned to      vaccinate all of its at-risk patients by the end of October.       ``We thought we were so smart,'' said physician Barbara      Cook. ``We put up posters telling people if you're 65 or      older, come in and get your shots. We had to take them all      down because we ran out of vaccine almost immediately.''       Likewise, the Fairfax County Health Department, which      usually aims to begin its vaccination program for high-risk      patients in early November, has received only 10 percent of      the 5,800 doses of vaccine it ordered. While delays are not      uncommon, officials said this year's has forced them to      postpone many of their vaccination clinics.       ``It would be our preference to immunize as early as      possible, but without vaccine, we can't do that,'' said      Rosalyn Foroobar, assistant director of patient care services      for the Health Department. ``Hopefully, we'll be able to      provide [the shots] before the flu season really does hit.      We'll get it. It's just late.''       Even if everyone who wants a vaccination gets one, Randall      of Inova HealthSource isn't sure that will be enough to      prevent panic when flu season strikes in earnest.       ``I think that underlying anxiety out there will cause      people to wonder'' about anthrax, she said. ``Even if they've      gotten a flu shot, I think our emergency rooms are going to      be very, very busy.''
