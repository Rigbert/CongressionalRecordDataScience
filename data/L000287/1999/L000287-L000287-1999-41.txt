Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Watt) for yielding to me. I also want to thank the gentleman for all of his good work. He is a good friend, and he is a great American.  Our flag is worthy of the emotion it stirs deep within us. It is worthy of reverence. I love the flag. We all love the flag. Our flag is worthy to stand, by itself, against the attacks of those who seek to denigrate it and all that it stands for.  Is our flag so weak that it cannot withstand public desecration and attack? Is our flag so weak that we must pass a constitutional amendment to protect it? No, our flag is greater than that.  America, our America, is the free-est Nation on earth. In our America, we have freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of press, freedom of religion. Our Constitution guarantees each of these freedoms.  The Constitution is a sacred document. It is the foundation of our democracy. It is the foundation of our freedom.  Our flag, Old Glory, is worthy of every word of praise and respect that will be spoken here today, tomorrow, and years to come. Throughout the world, the American flag symbolizes freedom, liberty, and the glory of democracy. Old Glory has served as a beacon of hope and opportunity for generation upon generation, not just in the United States, but throughout the world.  But above Old Glory, above a symbol of our liberty, is our sacred Constitution. The Constitution guarantees that we have the freedom to have political belief and express those beliefs openly.  An amendment to our Constitution will not protect Old Glory, it will destroy Old Glory. Because Old Glory is nothing without freedom. When freedom is strong, Old Glory is strong. When we persecute our citizens for expressing political belief, yes, even the burning or desecration of the flag, we weaken our freedom. When freedom is denied, Old Glory dies.  My colleagues, if Old Glory could speak to us today, she would cry for us. She would weep. Today, on the floor of this House, we are attacking freedom. We are attacking the liberties guaranteed in the Bill of Rights.                              {time}  1100  To honor our flag and all that it stands for, we must reject a constitutional amendment. We must embrace not just a symbol of freedom, but freedom itself. To suppress freedom by passing a constitutional amendment is to make a flag stronger than the people and the Nation it represents.  For the sake of our people, our freedoms and our Constitution, I urge my colleagues to reject this well-meaning but unnecessary constitutional amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
