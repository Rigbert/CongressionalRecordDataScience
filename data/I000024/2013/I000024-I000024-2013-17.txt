 Mr. McCAIN. So we send people into combat, and while we dither around here we are going to keep the men and women who are serving in harm's way from getting the benefits they have earned and deserve and are theirs by law. But we are not going to act, at least until January, perhaps.  I know the Senator from Oklahoma has gone on with a very long list about the completion of ships, about the health programs, and about a number of other issues, but I wish to focus for 1 minute on one area with my friend from Oklahoma.  I think all my colleagues are aware, and the American people are aware, there is a serious issue in the U.S. military. It is a very serious issue and it is the issue of sexual assaults. It is theissue the Senator from Oklahoma has spent untold hours in discussions and debate and learning about this issue because it is a terrible thing that is going on in our military today.  Under the leadership of the Senator from Oklahoma and the distinguished chairman of the committee, Senator Levin, we have--and with the participation of every member of the committee, under their leadership--come up with a way to, at least to a significant degree, address this problem in the military.  There are still some controversial aspects of it that are not necessarily either side of the aisle but just a different viewpoint. But I would argue and ask my friend from Oklahoma, is it not true that we have made significant improvements in the Defense authorization bill on the issue of sexual assaults?  These changes, after hearings, after debate, after discussion were put into law and they were agreed to as being very necessary measures to try to bring this terrible situation of sexual assaults in the military under control. I ask my colleague from Oklahoma if this isn't, among many others, an issue that needs to be addressed.
