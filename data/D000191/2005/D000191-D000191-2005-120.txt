 H. Con. Res. 161 authorizes the use of the Capitol grounds for the Millions More March scheduled for October 15, 2005. It will be on the 10th anniversary of the original Million Man March held here in Washington on the Mall in October of 1995. This event was one of the largest ever to be held on the Mall.  Similar to the original march, the themes and programs of this event will focus on unity, spiritual values, education and economic development. It is going to be extraordinarily timely this year in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and some of the conditions we saw in New Orleans.  It will be very relevant to this march, and hopefully the administration and others will be paying attention to the issues and themes raised at this event. The organizers will work with the office of the Architect of the Capitol, the Capitol Police; and the event will be free and open to the public.  I support the resolution and urge its passage.  Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis).
