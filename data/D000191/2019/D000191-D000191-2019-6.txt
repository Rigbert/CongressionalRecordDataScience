Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in strong support of H.R. 2502, the Transparency in Federal Buildings Projects Act of 2019, introduced by the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Palmer).  It is simple, but it is important. It is also common sense and contributes to government transparency.  Mr. Speaker, you know that the Federal Government through the GSA isthe largest lessor or owner of commercial office space in the United States of America.  The program can use some improvement, and this will help shine a light on some of the issues and concerns we have as we look for some reforms in the way we acquire property in the most cost-effective manner for the American taxpayer. Sometimes GSA does things that make little or no sense when they get into lease agreements, like they did with the Department of Transportation, a beautiful new building. We are now going to buy the building for the second time, essentially, by having paid for the lease for a number of years. These things can be done more effectively and more efficiently, and this legislation will help set a path to that kind of cost savings.  It requires the General Services Administration to publish on its website all prospectuses for leasing, design, or construction activity; update the information quarterly, and maintain the information for no less than 10 years in a readable, accessible, and--this is key--a searchable form, not just post it and it is like, oh, sorry, there is no index. It has to be searchable.  Mr. Speaker, this is a good-government bill designed to provide taxpayers with information regarding the GSA's leasing, design, and construction projects for Federal agencies.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.
