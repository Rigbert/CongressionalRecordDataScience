  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, how many times will Congress pretend to be fooled by yet another job-killing trade agreement.  First, there was NAFTA. They told us it would create hundreds of thousands of jobs. Unfortunately, they neglected to say they would be south of the border, and they would be at the expense of American workers.  Then there was the WTO. We are going to level the playing field--yeah, it is at bargain-basement prices--and compete with Chinese workers at 25 cents an hour and unfair trade practices.  Now, the Obama administration has a new paradigm--Korea. ``This is the model for the future. It is going to be great.'' We are already running larger trade deficits with Korea. We have already lost 50,000 jobs.  Now, the last, biggest, worst trade agreement--the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Ironically, a key vote will be over something called trade adjustment assistance. That is right; it is critical. We have to have that because hundreds of thousands or millions of Americans are going to lose their jobs, so we need to retrain them for McDonald's or other high-level jobs. Secondly, of course, the trade adjustment assistance is funded by cutting Medicare.  So this is the critical vote. Ironically, this is it. They have got the votes from corporate America and the Obama administration to jam this thing through unless we kill trade adjustment assistance. We can stop it here today and save America's economy.                          ____________________
