We have a long way to go to match the 205 district and circuit court nominations confirmed during President Bush's first term.  With millions of Americans currently affected by judicial vacancies that the Senate could fill today, now is the time for Republicans and Democrats to work together so that our courts can better serve the American people.  I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1              [From the Los Angeles Times, Oct. 15, 2011]               Judges' Deaths Add to 9th Circuit Backlog                         (By Carol J. Williams)       Five judges from the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals have      died this year, worsening an already critical case backlog      and spotlighting President Obama's inability to put his      judicial choices and stamp on the powerful court.       The deaths of four semi-retired senior jurists and full-     time Circuit Judge Pamela Ann Rymer have intensified concerns      on the aging bench and among judicial scholars that the 9th      Circuit will fall farther behind in what is already the      slowest pace of dispensing justice in the federal courts.       Judges of the 9th Circuit currently sit on twice the number      of cases each year as those of the other 12 federal appeals      courts, according to the Administrative Office of the U.S.      Courts. And it takes an average of 16.3 months for the      court's panels to issue opinions after an appeal is filed,      compared with 11.7 months on average for all circuits. The      9th Circuit has jurisdiction over California and eight other      Western states and is authorized to have 29 full-time      jurists.       ``While we mourn the loss of our colleagues, whom we will      miss as friends, we are alarmed by the loss of judicial      manpower,'' said 9th Circuit Chief Judge Alex Kozinski, who      was appointed to the court by President Reagan. ``A very      difficult situation has been seriously exacerbated, and we      fear that the public will suffer unless our vacancies are      filled very promptly.''       The 9th Circuit is an especially important court because it      helps to define many of the nation's laws on immigration,      sentencing, intellectual property and civil rights, experts      say.       Obama inherited two 9th Circuit vacancies with his      inauguration. Two jurists retired last year. Rymer's Sept. 21      death from cancer created another vacancy. Another vacancy      looms at the end of the year, when former Chief Judge Mary M.      Schroeder plans to take senior status.       Obama has managed to get only one of his picks for the 9th      Circuit confirmed by the Senate. He elevated U.S. District      Judge Mary H. Murguia in 2010 from the Arizona federal court,      leaving that bench with its own manpower crisis after its      chief judge, John M. Roll, was killed in the Jan. 8 shooting      rampage in Tucson.       Obama's other appeals court nominations, Alaska Supreme      Court Justice Morgan Christen and U.S. District Judge      Jacqueline H. Nguyen of Los Angeles, are still making their      way through the contentious confirmation process. Christen      was nominated in May and Nguyen was nominated last month.      Obama has yet to name anyone for the other three 9th Circuit      vacancies, including one that has been open for seven years      because of a dispute between California and Idaho senators      over which state gets to propose candidates to the White      House. Nationally, Obama nominations are pending in 51 of 92      vacancies.       Some judicial scholars speculate that Obama may be having      trouble convincing those he would like to appoint to accept      nominations for fear of derailing their legal careers only to      be rejected by partisan fights in the Senate. Goodwin Liu, a      UC Berkeley law professor twice nominated by Obama, was      forced to withdraw earlier this year when Senate Republicans      again blocked a confirmation vote.       ``What we know is that the nominations haven't been coming      through with the speed we would expect. What we don't know is      whether that is because the president is not asking people or      whether he is being turned down,'' said Arthur Hellman, a      University of Pittsburgh law professor and 9th Circuit      historian. Citing the relatively low pay compared with what a      lawyer can make in private practice and the often withering      interrogations in the confirmation process, he said, ``some      may be saying it's just not worth it.''       Hellman worries that the overwhelmed 9th Circuit judges      will have to cut corners to prevent their case backlog from      further increasing. That could mean less time spent reviewing      each case, holding fewer oral arguments before issuing      decisions or bringing in judges from other circuits who might      be unfamiliar with 9th Circuit law.       A call to the White House press office asking why Obama has      not nominated more judges wasn't answered Thursday. Earlier      in the day, at a session of the Senate Judiciary Committee,      its Democratic chairman blamed Republicans for stalling      judicial appointments by refusing to give consent for      confirmation votes even on candidates voted out of committee      with unanimous support.       ``Millions of Americans across the country are harmed by      delays in overburdened courts,'' said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy      (D-Vt.). ``The Republican leadership should explain to the      American people why they will not consent to vote on the      qualified, consensus candidates nominated to fill these      extended judicial vacancies.''       The committee's ranking member, Sen. Charles E. Grassley      (R-Iowa), countered with a claim that the Senate is ``ahead      of the pace'' compared with the confirmation rate of the      Democratic-controlled Congress during the Bush      administration. His comment followed Thursday's confirmation      vote on three of 30 Obama judicial nominations that      Republicans agreed to bring to a vote.       Even if Obama acts quickly to nominate three more 9th      Circuit judges, the impending 2012 campaign could thwart      Senate approval of those choices, said Michael McConnell, a      Stanford law professor and former judge on the 10th Circuit.       Russell Wheeler, a Brookings Institution fellow and veteran      analyst of the federal courts, said Obama is entering      ``uncharted territory'' with the 9th Circuit vacancies      occurring so late in his term.       Noting that Bush got Senate confirmation of 35 federal      judges in the last 15 months before his 2004 reelection bid,      Wheeler said, ``I doubt Obama will do as well, but      confirmations are not going to stop altogether.''       Some judicial analysts also lament that the administration      hasn't pushed Congress to expand the federal judiciary, as      recommended for more than a decade by the Judicial Conference      of the United States. That policymaking body of the federal      courts has said the 9th Circuit needs at least five more      judges added to its authorized 29 to alleviate its annual      caseload of 12,000-plus filings.       The announcement Tuesday that senior Circuit Judge Robert      Boochever died at his Pasadena home on Sunday was a sharp      reminder of the advancing age of the 9th Circuit bench that      relies on its purportedly retired seniors to shoulder much of      the case overload. Fifteen of the court's judges are over 80,      including two of the 25 active judges and 13 of its 18      seniors. Last year, a third of the court's caseload was      carried by senior judges.       Since criminal appeals can't be delayed because of federal      laws protecting defendants' rights, the burden of delays will      fall on civil cases, said Kozinski.       ``We can ameliorate some of that by relying more heavily on      visiting judges, but we're already doing that quite a bit,''      he said, adding that the help available from outside is      finite. ``Essentially, it's a zero-sum game, so that when you      decrease the number of judges available in the federal      system, you necessarily add more delay somewhere. Shifting      judges around can help even out the burden, but it can't make      up for judges that just aren't there.''  I yield the floor.
