Speaker, I thank the distinguished ranking member for yielding me this time and congratulate my chairman, as always, for trying to do the best job he possibly can under the circumstances and the facts that he is dealing with.  I do not speak in my capacity as whip but as I guess still the ranking member of the Treasury, Postal committee, or whatever capacity I am in, because we have not reconstituted that committee. Mr. Speaker, in the Treasury, Postal committee we included a number of dollars in the supplemental, which would be the subject of the amendment that the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) speaks of and that we would like to offer and we think is critical.  First of all, there was $400 million in there for the emergency first responders. That is a critical figure. All of us are for that. I do not think anybody is opposed to that. As a matter of fact, all of us were for all the dollars that were in this bill. We voted on it, passed it, and it was sequestered by the President. We believe that it is underminding homeland security not to move ahead with these finances at this point in time.  And not only the $400 million for first responders, but I was at the White House today with the leadership and brought up the funding of the election reform bill. The election reform bill was the most significant bipartisan success that we had in the 107th Congress. The chairman was a very important part of passing that and committing ourselves to funding that election reform legislation to make sure that every American vote not only is cast but is counted accurately. There was $400 million in that bill for that objective.  The President agreed today that we ought to fund that. Mitchell Daniels agreed we ought to fund it. I do not say they were for this particular amendment, but they believe that funding is appropriate funding. As a matter of fact, I am hopeful and believe that we will get a higher figure.  In this amendment was $28.5 million for the Secret Service to support the increased cost to protective details and to implement provisions of the PATRIOT Act we passed to secure our homeland. But it needs funding. This $28.5 million would be in that request.  In addition, there were $39 million for the Customs Service Container Security initiative. We have heard recently the vulnerability of our ports and the infrastructure in our ports to boats, ships coming into our ports that may be laden with explosives. Customs needs to have additional resources in order to check this. I do not think anybody disagrees with that proposition. However, it has languished unfunded.  Mr. Speaker, because my time is short, let me mention also, and lastly, $16 million in the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, FLETC, located in Glynco, Georgia. All of us know as a result of the tragedy of 9-11 of the outrage that was committed against this country, that we have made a determination that we are going to upgrade the security of our homeland. One of the ways we are doing that is adding Federal security officers. We are adding them at our airports, we are adding them at our Federal buildings, we are adding them in other places in our Federal infrastructure. We need to train them.                              {time}  1945  This was not anticipated. The demands for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center have, therefore, been substantially increased. But we have not given them the resources to accomplish that training. In doing so, we undermine homeland security. What we are saying is we ought not to wait. We ought to act, and we ought to act now to protect the homeland security.  It is very nice for us to pass bills and say we want to do this. But if we do not fund it, we cannot do it. We are going to be talking about that at the end of this month. I would hope to find a way to allow this amendment to be offered and that we could pass this amendment overwhelmingly because I believe the objectives are supported.
