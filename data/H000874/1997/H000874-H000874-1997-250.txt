Chairman, I rise and I wish I knew what I should say. The policy that the gentleman articulates is a good policy. My colleague from Maryland, Mr. Wynn, has cosponsored this amendment. I have stood for this premise since 1981; that we ought not to inadvertently shut down the people's government; that we ought not to, because we could not reach political consensus, have government shut down. And in point of fact, we never did that until 1995.  My friend and very sincere colleague, whose motives I question not a whit, he is honest in his presentation on this issue, but in 1990 we shut the government down because George Bush was angry that we did not pass, because he did not get his own party's support, a deficit reduction package. So he refused to sign the bill and Federal employees were on the street for 36 hours. That was the longest shutdown prior to 1995.  But in 1995, specifically in April, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Newt Gingrich, said I am going to put our Government at risk and let us see what the President does. He said further that the President clearly cared much more than he and his colleagues about government's operation. So as a policy to threaten and leverage the President of the United States, this Government was shut down for 6 days and then for 22 days. Twenty-eight days. Eight times longer than it had ever been shut down before in history.  And now we have a very well-directed amendment on the floor. I may even vote for it. But I want to tell my colleagues this will not be a vote in which employee unions will score. I tell my colleagues that. Why?
