Speaker, today the President gave a long, rather long speech full of words that really administered a pretty heavy feather duster to the miscreants on Wall Street, the CEOs, the analysts and the others who have been robbing our corporations, our economy, blind. He said he was not going to put up with it anymore. He was going to get tough.  But it is more what he did not say than what he did say that is important. He did not say he would support tough legislation to overhaul the securities firms, the Sarbanes bill. He did go on to say he would support the weaker House version, the one that really would not do anything for pension reform or auditing, the show bills that passed the House here before this thing really imploded, that the Republican majority pushed through. They would still allow corporations to direct their employees to be stuck with stock and would not really fix the problems of auditing and those things.  He did not talk about corporate tax dodges. The phony incorporations of U.S. firms in Bermuda to avoid tens of millions of dollars in taxes. He did not talk about rescinding his order which would allow corporate lawbreakers to get government contracts. He did not say a word about Harvey Pitt, the toothless watchdog of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Now the principal watchdog over America's securities firms and the stock markets and all those financial investments, all of those very complicated, high falooting things which have allowed people to steal hundreds of millions, billions, of dollars, bankrupt companies, put people out of work, steal their pensions and crater the 401(k)s of tens of thousands of American. We have an organization already in place that is supposed to take care of that. The Securities and Exchange Commission.  Earlier this year, just a couple of months ago, the President proposed a zero funding increase for them. Today, he pretended that he had been asking for a long time for more money for the SEC. He has not been, but I am glad that he has been born again in asking for some increase. But the increase he is asking for is a tiny fraction of the money that has been stolen. It will be inadequate to make the SEC the kind of watchdog we want as long as Harvey Pitt is the chairman.  Now, Harvey Pitt is a former securities lawyer. He is so compromised that when he recently met with a firm that was being investigated and he was questioned about it, he said, well, look, you cannot ask me not to meet with firms that are being investigated by the SEC just because I represented them, because then I would not be able to meet with anybody.  This is our watchdog. This is the President's appointee. This is the guy who is going to bring honesty. Come on. If that gentleman is not removed the President is not serious.  Recently the SEC tried to do an enforcement action against Ernst & Young. There were three commissioners present. They heard the evidence and at the end, the evidence was compelling, Ernst & Young should pay a fine. They had committed some improprieties. But guess what? Only one of the three SEC, Securities and Exchange Commission, members could vote because the other two were so compromised that they would have been penalized under law for voting because of their associations with this firm. So the one voted to penalize them, the Clinton appointee. But then an administrative law judge said, you cannot convict these people with one Securities and Exchange commissioner. You have to have more than one.  So here we have a Securities and Exchange Commission which is so compromised with their contacts, with their clients, who have represented all these people robbing America blind that they cannot even vote on enforcement actions. And the President is trying to tell us with his speech today, by God, he is taking care of this problem.  He has not taken care of the problem. He has tried to take care of one problem today and that is the political problem he has, the gathering storm of anger in this country that is beginning to look for someone to blame for the fact that billions of dollars of wealth have evaporated.  Americans are opening their 401(k) statements this month and many of them are shocked, disappointed and, yes, angered. They want to know who is responsible. How could these high-flying companies, how could these CEOs who are paying themselves tens of millions, hundreds of millions of dollars, boards of directors loaning themselves hundreds of millions of dollars, how could they suddenly be worthless? How could their 401(k)s have dropped so much? Because the money was stolen. And because there is no one home to enforce the law.  The Securities and Exchange Commission is the place to enforce the law, and until the President replaces the compromised people on the SEC; he has even got one nominated now, he comes from a securities firm. But as soon as that person gets there, he will not be able to vote on any of these things because they worked on all of these things. These are their buddies, the people they go to the luncheons with, the country club, they go yachting with, they go to their multimillion-dollar homes in Florida with.  We need to clean up this mess. The President had a chance today; he did not take it. Perhaps we can give him another chance again soon. Perhaps the Republican leaders of the House will relent and allow real reforms for pensions, real reforms for securities. Maybe they will undo some of the things they did back in 1995, which essentially exempted these securities firms from prosecution.  We can take some real measures here if there is the will. But there is so much money flooding from these people into politics that I fear we will not get there.  Some of us will continue to speak out. Others will begin to speak out. But will they put their vote where their mouth is? And will the President really put firm steps where his rhetoric is? Not today.  Tomorrow is another day. Americans will be a little madder tomorrow. This will still be going on tomorrow. Let us see what happens then.                          ____________________
