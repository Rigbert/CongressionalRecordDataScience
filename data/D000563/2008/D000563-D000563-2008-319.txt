I ask the majority leader, if we believe that speculation on energy prices is part of the problem, and we have a measure to try to address it, and we say to the Republicans ``offer your version of it,'' are we stopping them from the substance of the amendment that they offer? Are they able, under our proposal, our suggestion, to put whatever they want into their version of the amendment?
