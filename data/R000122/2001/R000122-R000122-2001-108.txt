President, I rise today to join with my distinguished colleagues, Senators Jeffords, Collins, Mikulski, Wellstone and Clinton, in introducing bipartisan legislation that we believe can make a real difference in the lives of health care consumers in this nation. The Health Care Consumer Assistance Act provides grants to States to create, or expand upon, health care consumer assistance, or health ombudsman programs.  In 1997, the President's Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry noted that consumers have the right to accurate information and assistance in making decisions about health plans. One model program, the Administration on Aging's Long Term Care Ombudsman Program, has been highly successful for twenty five years in promoting quality living and health care for nursing home residents nationwide.  Now more than ever, people need this kind of assistance to navigate the health care system. The Health Care Consumer Assistance Act would create a grant program for states to establish private, non-profit, independent entities to operate statewide ombudsman programs. Each state ombudsman program would be a ``one-stop'' source for information, counseling and referral services for health care consumers.  Last summer, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and Consumer Reports magazine released the results of a survey on consumer satisfaction with health plans. This survey is part of a larger project examining ways to improve how consumers resolve problems with their health insurance plans. The survey found that while most people who experienced a problem with their plan were able to resolve them, the majority of those surveyed were confused about where to go for information and help.  Over the past few years, a growing number of states have taken steps to give patients new rights in dealing with their health insurance plans. For example, more than 30 states now have an external review process for residents to appeal adverse decisions by their health plans. While the majority of those surveyed thought the ability to appeal a decision to an independent medical expert would be helpful, only one percent had actually used the process available in many states. In fact, most consumers were unaware this option even existed, much less how to use it.  The legislation we introduce today seeks to remedy this information gap by providing grants to states that wish to establish health care consumer assistance programs. These programs are designed to help make health care consumers more educated and effective as they seek to understand and exercise their health care choices, rights, and responsibilities.  I believe that the Health Care Consumer Assistance Act would compliment a Patient's Bill of Rights that includes a strong appeals process and access to legal remedies. It may, in fact, actually serve to ease the ongoing debate about litigation. By empowering health care consumers with information and effective strategies for making sure they get the care they have paid for when they need it most, the chances that a health-related dispute will end up in court are drastically minimized. When a person is sick and in need of medical care, the last thing they want is to have a protracted legal battle, they simply want the care that will make them better.  Under this bill, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will provide funds to eligible states to create or contract with an independent, nonprofit agency, to provide a variety of information and support services for health care consumers, including the following: educational materials about strategies for health care consumers to resolve problems and grievances; operate a 1-800 telephone hotline for consumer inquiries; coordinate and make referrals to other private and public health care entities when appropriate; and conduct education and outreach in the community.  The concept of a health care consumer assistance program has gained considerable support over the past several years as states have contemplated the patient protection issue and several states have taken steps to create these programs. Governors and state legislatures in many states including, Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, Maryland, Nebraska, Nevada, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Wisconsin have introduced or enacted health care ombudsman legislation. However, a Families USA survey of existing programs has found that while some states have successfully launched their programs, other state initiatives have faltered due to a lack of sufficient funding.  I believe that Americans deserve access to the information and assistance they need to be empowered and informed health care consumers. As the health insurance system becomes more confusing and complex, it becomes critically important that consumers have a place where they can go for counseling and assistance. As health plan options become more complicated, people need a reliable, accessible source of information. State health care consumer assistance programs have proven their ability to meet this challenge. I look forward to working with my colleagues in advancing this important and timely legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 651       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Health Care Consumers      Assistance Fund Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) All consumers need information and assistance to      understand their health insurance choices and to facilitate      effective and efficient access to needed health services.      Many do not understand their health care coverage despite the      current efforts of both the public and private sectors.       (2) Federally initiated health care consumer assistance and      information programs targeted to consumers of long-term care      and to medicare beneficiaries under title XVIII of the Social      Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) are effective, as are a      number of State and local consumer assistance initiatives.       (3) The principles, policies, and practices of health plans      for providing safe, effective, and accessible health care can      be enriched by State-based collaborative, independent      education, problem resolution, and feedback programs. Health      care consumer assistance programs have proven their ability      to meet this challenge.       (4) Many states have created health care consumer      assistance programs. The Federal Government can assist the      States in developing and maintaining effective health care      consumer assistance programs.     SEC. 3. GRANTS.       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services      (referred to in this Act as the ``Secretary'') shall      establish a fund, to be known as the ``Health Care Consumer      Assistance Fund'', to be used to award grants to eligible      States to enable such States to carry out consumer assistance      activities (including programs established by States prior to      the enactment of this Act) designed to provide information,      assistance, and referrals to consumers of health insurance      products.
