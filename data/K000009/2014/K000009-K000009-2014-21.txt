Speaker, I rise on Veterans Day Week to pay tribute to our dear friend and longtime former colleague, Congressman Lane Evans.  An honorable man and Marine Corps Vietnam veteran, Lane was elected in November 1982, and sworn in January 1983 as a member of a large freshman class that comprised the 98th Congress. He hailed from a working-class district and was a son of the working class. So few Members are grounded in that heritage. He was intelligent, committed, a true gentleman, and a patriot.  The economy and social benefit programs consumed the attention of that Congress. Very high unemployment levels hung over our Nation, mired in the aftermath of a very deep recession following the first Arab oil embargo and economic policies of the Reagan administration that did not relieve the dire circumstances of unemployed workers. Extending unemployment benefits occupied that Congress as a lifeline to millions of workers that saw their livelihoods evaporate almost instantaneously. In the spring of 1983, Congress passed the historic refinancing of the Social Security program to assure the system would be sound for generations to come. Lane had fought to be a Member to fight for that, and he was a ``yes'' vote on that historic measure.  During the first decade of Lane's service, we served together on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. After an extended fight, legislation was passed to allow Agent Orange-affected Vietnam veterans to receive benefits as a moral obligation to these veterans who had served. Today, Lane's legacy lives on as we continue to build on the foundation he laid.  During his distinguished career, Mr. Evans led the effort to fight for veterans returning home with PTSD and TBI. His efforts in Congress laid the groundwork for a new chapter in the way American cares for those suffering from mental illness and the stress-related conditions of battle.  Mr. Evans was taken from us far too soon. He was only 63 when he passed away last week after a very long, courageous, and difficult battle with Parkinson's. He will be dearly missed.  Always true to the Marine Corps motto, Lane was ``always faithful.'' May God bless him. May he be elevated to a very high position in heaven. I feel so privileged to have had the opportunity to serve with him as a Member of the 98th Congress and those that followed.                          ____________________
