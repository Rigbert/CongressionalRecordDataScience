Speaker, today I rise to express support for H.R. 3983, the Maritime Transportation Antiterrorism Act. I also want to mention a couple of areas where the bill needs to be improved during Conference Committee consideration. According to the Economist magazine, last October, a discovery at the southern Italian port of Gioia Tauro shook the foundations on which world trade has grown so rapidly in the past half century. A suspected al-Qaeda terrorist was found inside a container. The Egyptian suspect, who later disappeared while on bail, was equipped in comfort for the duration of the container's intended sea voyage from Italy to Halifax in Canada. He carried plans of airports, an aviation mechanic's certificate and security passes. Intelligence sources say other containers similarly outfitted were found at the Italian port.  Had this container actually reached an American or even Canadian port, this suspect would likely have escaped into the interior of the United States. Why? Because many terminal operators have abandoned the practice of inspecting so-called empty containers to ensure that the container is actually empty. They have also abandoned the practice of inspecting container seals, to ensure that no tampering of the container has taken place. It is time for Congress to step in and demand that every terminal operator do their part to enhance the security of American ports, containers, and our communities.  The International Longshore and Warehouse Union testified before the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and made a compelling case for legislation to mandate security checks of containers. Port workers can inspect the outside seal of every container moving through our ports. A broken seal would alert the port facility that the container has been tampered with and that it needs to be carefully inspected before entering a facility or being placed on a vessel. A systematic check of container seals also provides authorities with a record of the parties responsible for placing the seal on any container that may contain a terrorist or contain the means of a terrorist act.  Another equally necessary security measure is the mandatory inspection of so-called empty containers, which regularly move on and off ships each day. Many countries, including Japan, require such inspections because of the increased risk that these ``empties'' pose for the placement of bombs, weapons and contraband. In fact, inspection of empty containers on American docks was the customary practice up until a few years ago when companies decided it cut into profits. We can no longer allow our port facility operators to place profits over the security needs of our country.  H.R. 3983 is a good bill, but it is weak on container security solutions. I hope that provisions providing for security checks of empty containers and the integrity of container seals are considered by the Conference Committee.                          ____________________
