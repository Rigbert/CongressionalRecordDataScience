Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a remarkable woman from my district. Hazel Schweirking Graffeo of Oregon, OH passed away on Tuesday, April 29, 1997. Mrs. Graffeo fought a very courageous 8 year battle with cancer. Although that battle cost her dearly, she never lost her spirit.  Mrs. Graffeo was devoted to her husband and family, and enjoyed cooking for them. She also loved entertaining for others. She was a fan of big band music and enjoyed dancing. She loved reunions and other family activities.  Mrs. Graffeo's generous heart extended beyond her family and friends. She was an active member in the Alba Club, the Oregon Democratic Club, St. Charles Hospital Auxiliary, VFW Post 9816, and St. John Lutheran Church in Williston, OH. Everywhere, she exuded good cheer, strong values, and made others feel welcome.  Mrs. Graffeo is survived by her husband Joe and daughters Sharon, Janet, Janice, and Carolyn, as well as 12 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren. Our sympathies and prayers are with them, but we know that the memory and example set by Hazel Graffeo will give them a measure of comfort. Even as they mourn their loss, may they celebrate her life.                          ____________________
