Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), a distinguished member of the subcommittee who also was robbed of her rights to offer an amendment, as these proceedings were recessed.  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the agriculture appropriations conference report.  The process was unprecedented and heavy-handed. But the substance and the policy and final version reflects the majority leadership's lack of concern for farmers of America.  The summer's droughts and hurricanes have devastated thousands of farming families. In my own State of Connecticut, farmers suffered $41.6 million in losses. The pastures dried up. Fruit dropped. Trees and bushes and dairy production plummeted.                              {time}  1145  Farmers across the country are begging Congress to do something and we must do something. It is our responsibility. It is why we were elected. We come here to give voice to the people that we represent. Our constituents can only conclude from this conference report that we have been silent on their behalf.  This report includes only $1.2 billion in much needed emergency aid. But this is a short-term fix to a long-term problem, the lack of markets promised when the Freedom to Farm bill eliminated the farmers' safety net.  Committee members on both sides of the aisle were ready to address this issue with sanction relief, but the opportunity was snatched away. It is wrong to deny our farmers over $1 billion in new sales abroad, and it is wrong to punish innocent families, children, in other countries who suffer under repressive regimes by denying them food and medicine.  Finally, this report fails to reauthorize the Northeast Dairy Compact. Without that compact, Connecticut's farmers will lose $4.2 million a year as well as the security of stable prices to guarantee safe futures.  We are here to help farmers address short-term disasters and the long-term problems that threaten their survival. The health of our Nation is directly linked to agriculture's future. We must do more. I urge my colleagues to oppose the conference report.
