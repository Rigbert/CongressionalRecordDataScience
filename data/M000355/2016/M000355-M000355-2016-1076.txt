 President, this resolution concerns a criminal case pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania involving Congressman Chaka Fattah, Sr., and others, including an individual named Herbert Vederman. The Department of Justice is seeking trial testimony from Senator Bob Casey about his office's receipt of a letter of support from the Congressman regarding Mr. Vederman's consideration for appointment to a high Federal office.  The government alleges that Congressman Fattah conspired with Mr. Vederman to advocate for Mr. Vederman's appointment in return for Mr. Vederman providing money and things of value to the Congressman.  The indictment does not allege that any action was taken in response to this advocacy, and Mr. Vederman did not receive a nomination for any Federal position. Senator Casey is being called as a witness only because of the fact of his office's receipt of this letter supporting Mr. Vederman.  Senator Casey would like to cooperate with the government's request for his appearance at trial. Accordingly, consistent with the rules of the Senate and Senate practice, the enclosed resolution would authorize Senator Casey to testify and to produce documents at trial. The resolution would also authorize the Senate legal counsel to represent Senator Casey in connection with his testimony.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.
