President, I listened carefully to the statement made by the Republican leader. He talked about the issue of increased costs for colleges, saying the tuition is going up, and we have a student loan issue coming up with interest rates perhaps doubling. It was interesting when the Republican leader said the root cause of the problem is ObamaCare.  Well, it turns out, if we listen to the statements and speeches from the Republican side of the aisle, if a person's car won't start: ObamaCare. Too many popups on your computer: ObamaCare. Basically, it turns out that every problem in America can be traced to ObamaCare. ObamaCare, of course, is the health care reform act.
