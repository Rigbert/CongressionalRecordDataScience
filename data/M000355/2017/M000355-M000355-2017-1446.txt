 President, on another matter, Senators voted on a bipartisan basis yesterday to advance Jay Clayton's nomination to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and soon we will take another vote to confirm him.  As Chairman Crapo noted at Clayton's confirmation hearing, this nominee has an impressive background. His extensive work in the private sector will serve him well as he looks to strengthen our financial markets, thereby supporting American businesses, boosting job creation, and spurring economic growth. I appreciate Mr. Clayton's willingness to take on this important task, as well as his vision, which he outlined at his hearing, to promote fair and transparent practices at the SEC.  I look forward to his confirmation and to his leadership at this agency.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
