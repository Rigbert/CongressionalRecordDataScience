President, a Vermonter who is on active duty in the U.S. Army contacted me recently to let me know of his support for a ban on antipersonnel landmines. He wrote from personal experience, and his comments mirrored those I have received from so many other servicemen and women who have seen first-hand the danger these weapons pose to our own troops.  Here is what he wrote:       In the many training exercises in which I have      participated, landmines were relatively ineffective in      disrupting enemy attacks. Landmines often caused fratricide      casualties     among one's own troops. The locations of the training      landmines were almost never properly recorded. The modern      battlefield is simply too fluid and complex to accurately      keep track of all the landmines that are emplaced. Under      actual combat conditions, these landmines will represent a      certain threat to the lives of U.S. personnel.  Mr. President, compare that to a recent U.S. Army report which concluded that landmines contributed to the high rate of fratricide during recent exercises at Fort Irwin, CA. Air-dropped landmines, the so-called smart mines that the Pentagon claims pose no danger to U.S. troops or civilians, were the biggest single cause of friendly-fire deaths during mock battles. Of the 82 soldiers that were ``killed'' by friendly fire, 45 of them were victims of their own landmines. In one incident, an Army unit drove into its own mines dropped by aircraft, resulting in what would have been 23 deaths in a real war.  Now compare that to our experience in Vietnam, where over 64,000 Americans were killed or injured by landmines. The vast majority of those casualties resulted from U.S. mines, or mines containing U.S. components. In other words, we made the mines and took them over there, and they ended up killing our own people. I wonder how many times history has to repeat itself before we get the message.  A veteran of the Persian Gulf war described the same danger of fratricide. He said:       I spoke to numerous military officers who agreed * * * that      they would never employ scatterables (the air-dropped mines)      in their area of operations, even if those scatterables were      designed to self-destruct after a short period of time. Why?      They were simply not prepared to risk the lives of their      soldiers on the promise that the technology would work as      designed. The fact is that U.S. ground warfare doctrine is      `maneuver' warfare doctrine--highly mobile, able to take      advantage of the terrain, exploit the weakness of the enemy      on the battlefield. A commander who uses anti-personnel      mines--except in the most exigent, Alamo-like situation--     is deliberately reducing his or her battlefield advantage      of speed and flexibility.  Mr. President, despite this, the Pentagon insists that landmines protect our troops. It is the same old story. Years ago, they said we could not do without biological weapons. They said the same about chemical weapons, which they called the most effective weapon history has ever known. They said if we gave up Okinawa that we would irreparably undermine our security in the Pacific. They fought the nuclear test ban. And now they say that landmines, which have consistently plagued our own forces in battle, protect American lives.  I respect our military leaders and I support a defense second to none. But I am losing patience with the Pentagon's arguments. They simply fly in the face of the evidence. Their latest arguments about the need for antipersonnel mines to defend antitank mines wither under close scrutiny. Unfortunately, too many people, including some in the White House, accept the Pentagon's arguments as gospel, and don't ask the hard questions.  From my off-the-record conversations with Pentagon officials it is obvious to me that the real problem is that they do not want to give up a weapon, regardless of how marginal its utility or how dangerous it is to our own troops, because they are loath to encourage so-called arms control activists from trying to ban other weapons that endanger civilians. I understand their fear, because unlike a century ago when the overwhelming majority of war casualties were soldiers, being a soldier in a war today is far safer than being a civilian. The overwhelming majority of war casualties today are civilians.  That is hardly a reason to stay outside of a treaty that offers the best hope for riding the world of a weapon that is both inhumane and militarily unnecessary. When the Pentagon argues that our ``smart'' mines do not cause the humanitarian problem, I ask them to consider that as long as we stay outside the treaty we are part of the humanitarian problem because there will never be an international ban without the United States. And I ask them to consider the evidence. Given the danger our own mines pose to our troops, we should shop using them for that reason alone.                          ____________________
