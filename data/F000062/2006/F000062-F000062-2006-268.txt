 President, I rise today once again with my friend and colleague Senator McConnell to introduce legislation to renew the ban on all imports from Burma for another year.  Our legislation also amends the original Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 to allow the sanctions to be renewed, one year at a time, for up to 6 years.  It is critical that the Congress and the administration send a strong signal to the military junta, the State Peace and Development Council, that our resolve has not weakened and we are still committed to a free and democratic Burma. Unless the SPDC makes ``substantial and measurable progress'' towards a true national dialogue on national reconciliation and recognition of the results of the 1990 elections--decisively won by the National League for Democracy--the import ban must remain in place.  Let us review the facts.  Aung San Suu Kyi, Nobel Peace Prize recipient and leader of the National League for Democracy, remains under house arrest. She has spent the better part of the past 16 years imprisoned or under house arrest.  The human rights situation in Burma is deplorable and demands a clear, unified response from the international community: 1,300 political prisoners are still in jail; according to a report by the Asian human rights group, Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, 127 democracy activists have been tortured to death since 1988; 70,000 child soldiers have been forcibly recruited; the practice of rape as a form of repression has been sanctioned by the Burmese military; use of forced labor is widespread; human trafficking is rampant; and the government engages in the production and distribution of opium and methamphetamine.  Senator McConnell and I coauthored the ``Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003'' which imposed a complete ban on all imports from Burma.  It was overwhelmingly renewed in 2004 and 2005, and now Congress has the opportunity to reauthorize the sanctions for one more year.  But the United States cannot act alone. The United Nations and the international community have a vital role to play.  Along with Senator McConnell and others, we have repeatedly made the case that given the numerous human rights abuses, the spread of HIV/AIDS, the illicit production and trafficking of narcotics, and the trafficking of human beings by the military junta, the situation in Burma should be referred to the United Nations Security Council for debate and appropriate action.  A recent report by former Czech president Vaclav Havel and retired archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa--``Threat to Peace: A Call for the UN Security Council to Act on Burma''--confirms the need for U.N. intervention. It details how the situation in Burma fulfills each of the criteria used for past intervention by the Security Council: overthrow of an elected government; armed conflicts with ethnic minorities; widespread human right violations; outflow of refugees, over 700,000; and drug production and trafficking and the spread of HIV/AIDS.  It is time for the United Nations to act on this report and debate and pass a binding, nonpunitive, resolution on Burma that recognizes the threat the regime poses to the region and calls for Suu Kyi and all prisoners of conscience to be released.  Some may argue that because Suu Kyi remains under house arrest and the Burmese people lack basic human rights and a representative government, the sanctions have failed and it is time to lift the import ban.  I could not disagree more.  First, Aung San Suu Kyi and the democratic opposition continue to support a ban on all imports from Burma.  If we lift this ban now, without any measure of progress towards democracy and human rights, we will turn our backs on them and give comfort to their oppressors.  Second, the international community is coming together to put pressure on Burma.  In July 2005, ASEAN forced Burma to forgo its scheduled rotation as chairman of the organization.  On December 16, 2005, the U.N. Security Council debated the situation in Burma for the first time.  Next week, United Nations Undersecretary for Political Affairs will brief members of the Security Council on his meeting with Suu Kyi, her first meeting with a foreigner since 2004.  Why would we turn back now when the military junta is increasingly isolated and the plight of the Burmese people is on the agenda of the international community?  Indeed, while we are far from our goal of a free and democratic Burma, we are making progress and we should stay the course.  I remind my colleagues that under the provisions of this legislation, we will have the opportunity to debate sanctions on Burma every year. That is how it should be.  Sanctions are not a panacea for every foreign policy dispute. But, when they are backed by a robust international response, they can be effective and they can compel change.  Archbishop Desmond Tutu has rightly said, ``As long as [Suu Kyi] remains under house arrest, not one of us is truly free''.  Today I urge the SPDC to release Aung San Suu Kyi, recognize the 1990 elections, and engage in a true dialogue with the National League for Democracy.  I urge the United Nations Security Council to debate and pass a binding, non-punitive resolution on Burma that recognizes the threat the regime poses to the region and calls for Suu Kyi and all prisoners of conscience to be released.  And, finally, I urge United States Senate to renew the sanctions on Burma for another year.                          ____________________
