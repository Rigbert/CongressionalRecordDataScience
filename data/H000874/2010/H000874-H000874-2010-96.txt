 I have the honor of representing Herb in the Congress of the United States. He was born in Aquasco in April of 1936. In my view, he's a young man. For those of you who are much younger, I want you to know he's still a young man.  Herb, let me say to you, as the Speaker has pointed out, Herb has served with seven Speakers of the House, from Speaker Albert to Speaker Pelosi. For those of you in the Republican Cloakroom, I've had the opportunity to come over to your side, and I love the folks that you have working on your side. Like Herb, they treat us all alike. There are no Republicans or Democrats for them. They're just Members of Congress who serve together and work together on behalf of our country.  Herb, you have been a wonderful friend, and you have made everybody's day brighter every time they come in contact with you. You have been someone who has been so thoughtful, so courteous, so kind that all of us have been advantaged and our lives have been made better by your service. And Herb, as you leave--not our hearts, but this House, at least the Cloakroom--we know that you will hopefully come back from time to time and visit with us, and we will be again enriched with your presence and your demeanor.  We wish you God speed. And we say to you, thank you, good friend.                              {time}  1345                Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore
