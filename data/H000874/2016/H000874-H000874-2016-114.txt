Speaker, I thank the gentleman for protecting us from ourselves. That seems to be somewhat paternalistic, of course.  As I understand it--and I was not there, but it wouldn't have mattered whether I was in the Committee on Rules--it was not done in open session in the Committee on Rules. The Committee on Armed Services voted upon it, and apparently the majority of your side lost, and they don't want us to consider it, and they don't want to subject your Members to voting on it and letting the American people know where you stand.
