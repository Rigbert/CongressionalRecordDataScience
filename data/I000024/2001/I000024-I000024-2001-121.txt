President, the ``information'' referred to in new section 129(b)(1)(B)(iv) of S. 350 pertains to information that indicates that a site presents a threat requiring further remediation to protect public health or welfare or the environment. The committee expects that the Administrator shall use her discretion in determining whether this information is both credible and relevant to the site.  ``Information'' consists of information not known by the State on the earlier of the date on which cleanup was either approved or completed. The ``information'' need not be specific to this site; however, it must be relevant to the site in question. After careful consideration of the quality, objectivity and weight of the ``information'' regarding the site, the Administrator shall decide whether this information is adequate to determine there is a threat to public health or welfare or the environment.  This ``information'' triggers this section only if the Administrator determines that it indicates that such contamination or conditions at the facility present a threat requiring further remediation to protect public health or welfare or the environment. Do the chairman and ranking member agree with this interpretation of ``information?''
