Speaker, on July 16, 2018, I was absent from the House and missed Roll Call votes 329 and 330.   Had I been present for Roll Call 329, on Motion to Suspend the Rules and Pass H.R. 4946, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 1075 North Tustin Street in Orange, California, as the ``Specialist Trevor A. Win'E Post Office'', I would have voted ``Yes.''   Had I been present for Roll Call 330, on Motion to Suspend the Rules and Pass H.R. 4960, To designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 511 East Walnut Street in Columbia, Missouri, as the ``Spc. Sterling William Wyatt Post Office Building'', I would have voted ``Yes.''                          ____________________
