 It says in the bill:       Provided further, That notwithstanding Public Law 105-178      as amended, or any other provision of law, funds authorized      under section 110 of title 23, United States Code, for the      fiscal year 2000 shall be apportioned based on each State's      percentage share of funding provided for under section 105 of      title 23, United States Code, for fiscal year 2000.  That is the formula of TEA 21.
