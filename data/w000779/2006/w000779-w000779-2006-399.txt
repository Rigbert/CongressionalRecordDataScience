President, the Senate has been working away at a lobbying reform bill, which is a good start at curbing the influence of special interests, but that alone is not enough. Everyone knows the root of the problem is money. Money is the oil that runs the engine of a viable campaign for office.  Every single one of my colleagues and I are in a perpetual campaign. Whether you were born a multi-millionaire or come from more humble origins, you are chasing money. Senators are elected or reelected on a Tuesday, sleep in on Wednesday and by Thursday they are back on the phone, dialing supporters for contributions to fuel the next campaign.  I do not believe Senators should have to operate this way. I believe the people send Senators to the Capitol to resolve their and the Nation's problems; I don't believe they send us to the United States Senate to spend all our time calling donors for support.  Senators are here to do the people's business, and that's why Senator Graham and I are introducing the first bipartisan bill that would let Senators focus on what the voters of our States sent us here to do. This would be the first serious step toward shutting the door on the 6-year stockpiling of campaign contributions. Our bill would amend the Senate rules to prohibit incumbent Senators from raising money until 18 months prior to their re-election. An exception to this ban would be triggered if an opposing candidate or group targeted a Senator with more than $100,000 in paid advertisements. Such a targeted campaign would free an incumbent Senator from the prohibition on soliciting contributions. Likewise, the ban would not apply to contributions to retire campaign debt.  I have long admired the system used in many European countries for keeping campaigns focused on a short but intense period. That would require an amendment to the Constitution, an avenue that time and again has proved too difficult to navigate. Short of a Constitutional amendment I believe the new approach Senator Graham and I are offering could prove viable.  Campaign finance reform is much like nuclear disarmament: everyone is for it but few are willing to take the first step unilaterally. I believe that those of us who are already here in the Senate bear the responsibility to take that first step.  Our proposal aims not just to treat the symptoms of scandal and corruption; it aims to cure the overall disease by going after the endless race for money in politics. Our bipartisan approach enjoys the support of a number of groups, including Common Cause, Democracy21, US PIRG and Public Citizen.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2434       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Senate Campaign Reform Act      of 2006''.     SEC. 2. LIMITATION ON SOLICITATION OR ACCEPTANCE OF                    CONTRIBUTIONS.       Paragraph 1 of rule XLI of the Standing Rules of the Senate      is amended--       (1) by inserting ``(a)'' after ``1.''; and       (2) by adding at the end the following:       ``(b)(1) A Member of the Senate, or officer or employee of      the Senate, shall not solicit, receive, direct, or authorize      the acceptance of a contribution with respect to a political      committee authorized by or affiliated with a Senator at any      time other than during the period beginning on the date that      is 18 months prior to the date of the next general election      for the office held by such Senator and ending on the date of      such election.       ``(2) This subparagraph shall not apply for the period      beginning on the date in which a candidate opposing a Senator      receives contributions or makes expenditures in excess of      $100,000.       ``(3)(A) This subparagraph shall not apply in any case in      which a Senator is targeted (by name or office) in broadcast      advertisements paid for by an individual or group that is not      affiliated with any candidate for the Senate, but only to the      extent that contributions do not exceed the amount paid by      the individual or group for such advertisements.       ``(B) Contributions permitted by subclause (A) shall be      used for the sole purpose of responding to such      advertisements, and funds remaining at the conclusion of such      response shall be returned to the individual contributors      (based on the percentage of the total amount contributed).       ``(C) Not later than 30 days after the date on which a      response is made under subclause (B), the Senator shall      submit for review to the Select Committee on Ethics of the      Senate the amount raised, copies of the advertisements in      question, and the dates and outlets on which the      advertisements were run.       ``(4) This subparagraph shall not apply to any authorized      committee of a Senator who is a candidate for an office other      than Senator, but only if such committee is established for      the purpose of running for such other office and no      contribution accepted by the committee is used for the      purpose of running for the office of Senator.       ``(5) Any term used in this subparagraph which is also used      in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 331 et      seq.) shall have the meaning given such term under such      Act.''.                                 ______                                       By
