Unfortunately, we have not done our part to raise the minimum wage, but I would go to the point that the Senator from Massachusetts raised.  Last week I went to a summer feeding program for children who ordinarily get school lunches. These are struggling families in my city of Chicago. I sat down at a table with a young African American girl, second grader, named Sharya, and I said to her: ``What did you have for dinner last night?'' She said: ``Well, my mom was working late and she got home after I went to sleep. I had a bowl of cereal for dinner.''  The point I am making to the Senator, and I ask him if he would return and tell us the impact, here is a young girl being raised by a mother who is probably working two jobs because we will not increase the minimum wage. The point being made by the Senator from Massachusetts is, we are not talking about welfare recipients; we are talking about working people who get up and go to work every day to sometimes two jobs. Sometimes they are invisible to our lives. These are the people who are washing the dishes in the kitchens, busing the tables, and cleaning our rooms.  I ask the Senator from Massachusetts, is this not first and foremost a family issue in terms of dignity for working families and people who are trying to keep their kids well fed and clothed and keep them together? I ask the Senator from Massachusetts, how in this great nation, when we are giving away trillions of dollars in tax cuts to the weathiest people in this country, can we not afford 50 cents or a dollar an hour for people who are struggling to try to keep their families together?
