President, let me just comment that many editorial writers around the country that normally are more of a liberal persuasion came out and editorialized in favor of the Republicans and the fact that we recognized that we have a system that was going into bankruptcy. I ask unanimous consent that these be printed in the Record, the two editorials from the Washington Post that made this very clear. The names of the editorials are ``Medagogues'' and ``Medagogues, Cont'd.''  The last sentence of the second editorial reads, ``The Democrats have fabricated the Medicare-tax cut connection because it is useful politically. It allows them to attack and duck responsibility, both at the same time. We think it's wrong.'' And America thinks it is wrong.  There being no objection, the editorials were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 18, 1995]                               Medagogues       Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole accused the Democrats and their      allies yesterday of conducting a campaign based on distortion      and fear to block the cuts in projected Medicare spending      that are the core of the Republican effort to balance the      budget in the next seven years. They're right; that's      precisely what the Democrats are doing--it's pretty much all      they're doing--and it's crummy stuff.       There's plenty to be said about the proposals the      Republicans are making; there's a legitimate debate to be had      about what ought to be the future of Medicare and federal aid      to the elderly generally. But that's not what the Democrats      are engaged in. They're engaged in demagoguery, big time. And      it's wrong--as wrong on their part now as it was a year ago      when other people did it to them on some of the same health      care issues. Then, they were the ones who indignantly      complained.       Medicare and Medicaid costs have got to be controlled, as      do health care costs in the economy generally. The federal      programs represent a double whammy, because they, more than      any other factor, account for the budget deficits projected      for the years ahead. They are therefore driving up interest      costs even as they continue to rise powerfully themselves.      But figuring out how to contain them is enormously difficult.      More than a fourth of the population depends on the programs      for health care; hospitals and other health care institutions      depend on them for income; and you cut their costs with care.      Politically, Medicare is especially hard to deal with because      the elderly--and their children who must help care for them      to the extent the government doesn't--are so potent a voting      bloc.       The congressional Republicans have confounded the skeptics      who said they would never attack a program benefiting the      broad middle class. They have come up with a plan to cut      projected Medicare costs by (depending on whose estimates you      believe) anywhere from $190 billion to $270 billion over the      seven-year period. It's true that they're also proposing a      large and indiscriminate tax cut that is a bad idea and that      the Medicare cuts would indirectly help to finance. And it's      true that their cost-cutting plan would do--in our judgment--     some harm as well as good.       But they have a plan. Enough is known about it to say it's      credible; it's gusty and in some respects inventive--and it      addresses a genuine problem that is only going to get worse.      What the Democrats have instead is a lot of expostulation, TV      ads and scare talk. The fight is about ``what's going to      happen to the senior citizens in the country,'' Dick Gephardt      said yesterday. ``The rural hospitals. The community health      centers. The teaching hospitals. . . .'' The Republicans      ``are going to decimate [Medicare] for a tax break for the      wealthiest people, take it right out of the pockets of senior      citizens. . . .'' The American people ``don't want to lose      their Medicare. They don't want Medicare costs to be      increased by $1,000 a person. They don't want to lose the      choice of their doctor.''       But there isn't any evidence that they would ``lose their      Medicare'' or lose their choice of doctor under the      Republican plan. If the program isn't to become less generous      over time, how do the Democrats propose to finance it and      continue as well to finance the rest of the federal      activities they espouse? That's the question. You listen in      vain for a real response. It's irresponsible.                                                                    ____               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 25, 1995]                           Medagogues, Cont'd       We print today a letter from House minority leader Richard      Gephardt, taking exception to an editorial that accused the      Democrats of demagoguing on Medicare. The letter itself seems      to us to be more of the same. It tells you just about      everything the Democrats think about Medicare except how to      cut the cost. That aspect of the subject it puts largely out      of bounds, on grounds that Medicare is ``an insurance      program, not a welfare program,'' and ``to slash the program      to balance the budget'' or presumably for any purpose other      than to shore up the trust fund is ``not just a threat to . .      . seniors, families, hospitals'' etc. but ``a violation of a      sacred trust.''       That's bullfeathers, and Mr. Gephardt knows it. Congress      has been sticking the budget knife to Medicare on a regular      basis for years. Billions of dollars have been cut from the      program; both parties have voted for the cutting. Most years      the cuts have had nothing to do with the trust funds, which,      despite all the rhetoric, both parties understand to be      little more than accounting devices and possible warning      lights as to program costs. Rather, the goal has been to      reduce the deficit. It made sense to turn to Medicare because      Medicare is a major part of the problem. It and Medicaid      together are now a sixth of the budget and a fourth of all      spending for other than interest and defense. If nothing is      done those shares are going to rise, particularly as the      baby-boomers begin to retire early in the next century.       There are only four choices, none of them pleasant.      Congress can let the health care programs continue to drive      up the deficit, or it can let them continue to crowd out      other programs or it can pay for them with higher taxes.      Or it can cut them back.       The Republicans want to cut Medicare. It is a gutsy step.      This is not just a middle-class entitlement; the entire      society looks to the program, and earlier in the year a lot      of the smart money said the Republicans would never take it      on. They have. Mr. Gephardt is right that a lot of their plan      is still gauzy. It is not yet clear how tough it will finally      be; on alternate days you hear it criticized on grounds that      it seeks to cut too much from the program and on grounds that      it won't cut all it seeks. Maybe both will turn out to be      true; we have no doubt the plan will turn out to have our      other flaws as well.       They have nonetheless--in our judgment--stepped up to the      issue. They have taken a huge political risk just in calling      for the cuts they have. What the Democrats have done in turn      is confirm the risk. The Republicans are going to take away      your Medicine. That's their only message. They have no plan.      Mr. Gephardt says they can't offer one because the      Republicans would simply pocket the money to finance their      tax cut. It's the perfect defense; the Democrats can't do the      right thing because the Republicans would then do the wrong      one. It's absolutely the case that there ought not to be a      tax cut, and certainly not the indiscriminate cut the      Republicans propose. But that has nothing to do with      Medicare. The Democrats have fabricated the Medicare-tax cut      connection because it is useful politically. It allows them      to attack and to duck responsibility, both at the same time.      We think it's wrong.
