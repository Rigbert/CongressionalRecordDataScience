Speaker, I regret that I cannot agree with the previous speaker. I think the tone of this debate is good, but the process is terrible. Mr. Lantos, the ranking member of the committee, attempted to participate in making this a truly bipartisan resolution.  Now, I am one of those who has consistently supported the policies of our government and who supports success in our efforts in Iraq. I think that is in the best interests of America, certainly in the best interests of the Iraqi citizenry and the best interests of civility in the Middle East. However, I am saddened by the continued partisanship with which this issue is handled.  Mr. Lantos and I and Ms. Pelosi offered a resolution which congratulated the Iraqi people, noted their courage, noted their determination to reach for democracy. That is what this effort is about. There was no attempt at bipartisanship. That was rejected out of hand, not even allowed as an amendment. That is not the way we bring our country together. That is not the way we strengthen our resolve. That is not the way we show the world that we are of, if not exactly one mind, of one objective.  I thank my friend for yielding me time. I thank him for his efforts. I generally agree with the propositions set forth in the resolution, but I am not sure I am going to vote for it because I am deeply grieved by the continuing failure to try to bring this House together on this issue and to bring this country together on this issue and to ensure that together we go forward to achieve success.
