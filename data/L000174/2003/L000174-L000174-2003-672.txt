The President campaigned on a platform of uniting, not dividing. It is wrong because our country needs us to build consensus and we should work together especially in these most challenging times. These are the years of Republican filibusters of judicial or executive branch nominees: 1968, 1980, 1980, 1980, 1987, 1987, 1993, 1993, 1993, 1994, 1994, 1994, 1994, 1994, 1994, 1995, 1998, 2000, 2000.  For Republicans to claim that they have never filibustered a circuit court nominee is just incorrect. For them to claim that they have never ``successfully'' filibustered a lifetime or short-term appointee's nomination is also incorrect. The debate on Mr. Estrada's nomination is important.  I think in the debate on this nomination, this is not a nomination that unites rather than divides. Certainly within the Hispanic community itself, highly respected members of the Hispanic community oppose Miguel Estrada.
