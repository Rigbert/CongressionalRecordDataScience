Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I too want to thank the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Michaud) and the staff, Pat Ryan, chief of staff and general counsel, and Mary Ellen McCarthy who has done a very good job, and Kingston Smith on my right here. This is truly an effort to try to write legislation that really will make a difference. These four bills, and some of the others that are pending which will soon be before the body, really do advance the ball on behalf of our veterans.  I thank them for their cooperation and their partnership on this. That is what it is all about, ``to try to care for him who has borne this Nation's battle, and for his widow and for his orphan,'' to quote President Lincoln.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
