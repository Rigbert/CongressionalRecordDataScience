Chairman, although I am not opposed to the amendment, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition so I may comment.  The CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oregon?  There was no objection.  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I strongly support this amendment and both its objectives, the Nationally Significant Freight and Highway Projects, under section 1111 of the rules, and the National Scenic Areas. I am quite familiar with the area mentioned by Representative Walden and the very scenic $1 tolled one-way Bridge of the Gods. It is a critical link. If it is not repaired or replaced, it is quite a long drive in either direction. This eligibility is potentially critical to getting Federal partnership in that project. There are other areas around the country which suffer from similar problems. I recommend this amendment to my colleagues.  I yield back the balance of my time.
