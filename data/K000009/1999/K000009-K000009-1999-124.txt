Coburn) put three projects in this bill. There are actually five projects he put in the bill, totalling well over $1 million. My feeling is that if he wants to eliminate $1 million from the bill, let him eliminate the projects for Oklahoma.  Frankly, this Member would not eliminate projects for Oklahoma, but let me say what the projects are:  Expanding wheat pasture research, $285,000; integrated production systems for horticulture crops, $180,000; preservation and processing research for fruits and vegetables, $226,000. That is just $691,000 for those three projects alone under the very account that he is now trying to cut for global climate research, which affects every farmer in this country and their future.  So I would just say that I think the gentleman is maybe not quite knowledgeable enough about these accounts, because in fact, why would he add funding to a bill and to a set of accounts that he is trying to cut? Why would he not cut his own projects, rather than trying to cut a project that deals with the entire Nation's needs?  My apologies to the State of Oklahoma, because they deserve a voice here. I would not have recommended that their particular projects be cut. But the fact is the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Coburn) sent a letter.  THE CHAIRMAN. The time of the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) has expired.
