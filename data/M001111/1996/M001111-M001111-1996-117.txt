 President.  Once again, I urge my colleagues to vote for this very simple amendment. It will allow our women who serve in our military overseas to use their own private funds to get a safe, legal abortion in our military facilities overseas.  We have talked a lot about the women in our military, but this also affects the wives and the daughters of our servicemen who serve overseas. They, too, should have the ability to have a safe, legal procedure.  I have heard that no complaints have been filed. But I tell my colleagues that this puts a woman in a very serious position, if she does complain, and she is in the military. It could have career implications. And it could have personal implications. It does not surprise me that the Senator from Indiana has not heard of any complaints. But I assure you, this does put women's lives in jeopardy. It puts obstacles in front of them that clearly violate their equal protection under the law. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield back my additional time.
