Chairman, I appreciate the recognition, and simply rise to accept the gentlelady's amendment.  This has been a collaborative effort. And I would want to also congratulate the gentlewoman from California and all of her subcommittee members for their very good and strong leadership in rationalizing the nuclear weapons complex and bolstering the nuclear nonproliferation programs at the National Nuclear Security Administration.  The fact is, the gentlelady in particular has exercised great leadership in the issues of nonproliferation, making sure we have an appropriate and rationalized weapons complex, and that again, we are very deliberative as far as what the long-term nuclear policy of this country is. And again, I also appreciate her very early interjection into the work of this subcommittee, and her cooperation as well as her staff's cooperation. And again, it is my pleasure, on behalf of the subcommittee, to accept her amendment.
