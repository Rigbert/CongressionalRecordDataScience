Chairman, as ranking member on the Helsinki Commission who has served with the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) for approximately 18 years, I want to thank the gentleman also for his willingness to work with us in conference regarding the Helsinki Commission budget.  The OSCE region is of vital interest to the United States, and this work that we do is critical. The Commission truly provides good value for the dollar, and hopefully will be provided the resources necessary to fulfill its legislative mandate.  I join the gentleman from New Jersey (Chairman Smith) in thanking the gentleman from Kentucky (Chairman Rogers) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Serrano) for their focus on this issue.
