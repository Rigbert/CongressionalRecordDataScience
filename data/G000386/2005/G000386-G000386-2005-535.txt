 President, obviously, I thank Senator Baucus for the personal comment he made about my upcoming birthday. More importantly, once again, we have had such smooth working relationships on these two very important bills. Our staffs have cooperated very closely. There has been some compromise but not a lot because I think we are all going in the same direction.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, pursuant to the remarks I made and the remarks Senator Baucus has made, that the Committee on Finance be discharged from further consideration of S. 1696 and that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.
