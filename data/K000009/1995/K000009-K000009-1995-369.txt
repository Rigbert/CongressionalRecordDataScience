Speaker, I rise today to pay respectful tribute to a young man from my district who has made the ultimate sacrifice, giving his life in service to our country in a foreign land. Justin Aaron Harris, a Marine Sergeant, was tragically killed last week when his helicopter went down at sea after hitting a ship off the coast of Mogadishu. He died on February 19, 1995, leaving a wife, Chantay, and a young son, Justin, Jr., his parents, Peggy and Joe, a sister, Julie Morrison, brothers, Joe, Jeffrey, Jerry, and Javan Harris and scores of relatives and friends who mourn the loss of a promise-filled life cut short. We offer them our hearts in empathy as they face this deep tragedy. We hope that his vision for America and his devotion and belief in service to our nation and oppressed people around the world will make this cross a little easier to bear. We pray the memories his family and friends shared in his too-brief life will sustain them all. Justin knows as we all know, the price of freedom is not free. He laid down his life in service to us.  A poem was read at his memorial service, held in his hometown of Toledo, Ohio on February 25, 1995. The author apparently unknown, it symbolizes Justin's and his family's faith and offers a meaning to his passing, helping all to understand and to gain strength:                                I'm Free     Don't grieve for me, for now I'm free     I'm following the path God laid for me.     I took his hand when I heard Him call     I turned my back, and left it all.     I could not stay another day     To laugh, or love, or work, or play     Tasks left undone must stay that way     I found that place at the close of the day.     If my parting has left a void,     Then fill it with remembered joy.     A friendship shared, a laugh, a kiss     Oh yes, these things I too will miss.     Be not burdened with times of sorrow     I wish you sunshine of tomorrow.     My life's been full, I savored much     Good friends, good times, a loved one's touch.     Perhaps my time seemed all too brief.     Don't lengthen it now with undue grief.     Lift up your heart and share with me . . .     God wanted me now     He set me Free!  Justin Aaron Harris, age 23; always remembered, always honored, always loved.                          ____________________
