Speaker, today I bid farewell and best wishes to Jim Barnette, the incomparable Energy and Commerce Committee General Counsel.  When I became Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, everyone told me I needed someone like Jim Barnette to serve as General Counsel. He served under three Chairmen before me and, though he was no longer in government service, his legacy of jurisdictional tenacity and seemingly limitless institutional knowledge remained.  Not content with a mere likeness, I informed Jim I was revoking his leave of absence and he was to report for duty promptly. Much to my delight, like any true public servant, he obliged.  As a veteran of the procedural, political, and policy battlefield, there was no one better suited to take the reins as General Counsel for the Committee when I began my tenure as Chairman at the outset of the 112th Congress.  Jim styles himself a country lawyer, but he brings a level of experience and wisdom to our Committee that is quite simply unmatched on Capitol Hill. He helped assemble and mentor the strongest team on Capitol Hill, building a backbone for our Committee staff that will stand the test of time.  He is a General Counsel in the fullest sense of the title: a faithful counselor to Members and staff and a forceful advocate for the issues before the Committee.  He has been a trusted partner, an expert negotiator, a skilled tactician, and a true friend. I wish Jim and his wife Chelo well, extending my sincere thanks for the year they set aside that allowed me to bring Jim back to the Committee. As we say at the Energy and Commerce Committee, Jim is the best.                          ____________________
