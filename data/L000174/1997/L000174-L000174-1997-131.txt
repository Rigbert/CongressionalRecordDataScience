 I am delighted that the Senate majority leader has decided to take up the nomination of Judge Frank M. Hull to be a U.S. Circuit Judge for the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Since 1994, the nominee has been a United States district judge for the Northern District of Georgia and prior to that she was a judge for the Superior Court of Fulton, County in Georgia. The ABA has unanimously found her to be well-qualified, its top rating. With the strong support of Senator Coverdell and Senator Cleland, this nomination has moved expeditiously through the committee and is being confirmed by the Senate. I congratulate Judge Hull and her family and look forward to her service on the Court of Appeals.  I am also delighted that the Senate majority leader has decided to take up the nomination of Judge Henry Harold Kennedy, Jr. to be a U.S. district judge for the District of Columbia. Since 1979, the nominee has been an associate judge for the District of Columbia and prior to that he was a U.S. magistrate. The ABA has unanimously found him to be well-qualified, its top rating. With the strong support of Senator Thurmond and Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, this nomination has moved expeditiously through the committee and is being confirmed by the Senate. I congratulate Judge Kennedy and his family and look forward to his service on the district court.  With these confirmations the Senate will raise to 11 the number of Federal judges confirmed this year and exceed, for the first time this year, the snail-like pace of confirming one judge per month. The Senate pace will rise to an anemic 1.2 judges per month. Meanwhile, vacancies have continued to mount and the delays in filling vacancies continue to grow.  It is discouraging to once again have to call attention to the fact that of the 61 nominations sent to the Senate by the President some 40 nominees are pending before the Judiciary Committee--nominees who have yet to be accorded even a hearing during this Congress. Many of these nominations have been pending since the very first day of this session, having been renominated by the President after having been held up during last year's partisan stall.  The committee has not yet worked through the backlog of nominees left pending from last year. Several of those pending before the committee had hearings or were reported favorably last Congress but have been passed over so far this year, while the vacancies for which they were nominated over 2 years ago persist. The committee has 12 nominees who have been pending without action for more than a year, including 7 who have been pending since 1995.  There is no excuse for the committee's delay in considering the nominations of such outstanding individuals as Professor William A. Fletcher, Judge James A. Beaty, Jr., Judge Richard A. Paez, Ms. M. Margaret McKeown, Ms. Ann L. Aiken, and Ms. Susan Oki Mollway, to name just a few of the outstanding nominees who have all been pending all year without so much as a hearing. Professor Fletcher and Ms. Mollway had both been reported last year. Judge Paez and Ms. Aiken had hearings last year but have been passed over so far this year.  We continue to fall farther and farther behind the pace established by the 104th Congress. By this time 2 years ago, Senator Hatch had held 8 confirmation hearings involving 36 judicial nominees, and the Senate had proceeded to confirm 35 Federal judges.  Those who delay or prevent the filling of these vacancies must understand that they are delaying or preventing the administration of justice. We can pass all the crime bills we want, but you cannot lock up criminals if you do not have judges. The mounting backlogs of civil and criminal cases in the emergency districts, in particular, are growing taller by the day.  I have spoken often about the crisis being created by the 103 vacancies that are being perpetuated on the Federal courts around the country. At the rate that we are currently going this year, more and more vacancies are continuing to mount over longer and longer times to the detriment of greater numbers of Americans and the national cause of prompt justice. We are not even keeping up with attrition.  Chief Justice Rehnquist has repeatedly acknowledged the crisis being posed for the Federal judiciary and, I believe, for all Americans. The Chief Justice has called the rising number of vacancies ``the most immediate problem we face in the federal judiciary.'' The Courts Subcommittee heard on Thursday afternoon from judges from the second and eighth circuits about the adverse impact of vacancies on the ability of the Federal courts to do justice. The effect is seen in extended delay in the hearing and determination of cases and the frustration that litigants are forced to endure. The crushing caseload will force Federal courts to rely more and more on senior judges, visiting judges and court staff.  The Attorney General spoke recently about the ``vacancy crisis that has left so many Americans waiting for justice'' noting that vacancies are up at a time that filings are up, caseloads are increasing, backlogs are increasing, and we are experiencing an ``unprecedented slowdown in the confirmation process'' that has ``very real and very detrimental impacts on all parts of our justice system. She spoke about the hundreds of appellate arguments being canceled, the Federal judges who go for entire years without hearing a single civil case. She said: ``Quite simply without enough judges, our laws will become empty promises and `swift justice' will become an oxymoron, and without the independence they need to uphold those laws, our judges will become hostages to politics instead of being the guardians of our principles.''  In July I received a copy of a letter sent to President Clinton and the Republican leader of the Senate by seven presidents of national legal associations. These presidents note the ``looming crisis in the Nation brought on by the extraordinary number of vacant federal judicial positions'' and the ``injustice of this situation for all of society.'' They point to ``[d]angerously crowded dockets, suspended civil case dockets, burgeoning criminal caseloads, overburdened judges, and chronically undermanned courts'' as circumstances that ``undermine our democracy and respect for the supremacy of law.'' I agree with these distinguished leaders that we must without further delay ``devote the time and resources necessary to expedite the selection and confirmation process for federal judicial nominees.'' The President is doing his part, having sent us 61 nominations so far this year with more on the way. The Senate should start doing its part.  In choosing to proceed on these two nominees, the Republican leadership has chosen once again to skip over the nomination of Margaret Morrow and to delay action on six other outstanding nominees who were reported at the same time as those fortunate enough to be selected for consideration by the Senate this week.  I want to turn briefly to the long-pending nomination of Margaret Morrow to be a district court judge for the Central District of California. Ms. Morrow was first nominated on May 9, 1996--not this year but May 1966. She had a confirmation hearing and was unanimously reported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee in June 1996. Her nomination was, thus, first pending before the Senate more than a year ago. This was one of a number of nominations caught in the election year shutdown.  She was renominated on the first day of this session. She had her second confirmation hearing in March. She was then held off the Judiciary agenda while she underwent rounds of written questions. When she was finally considered on June 12, she was again favorably reported with the support of Chairman Hatch. She has been left pending on the Senate Executive Calendar for more 3 months and has been passed over, again.  This is an outstanding nominee to the District Court. She is exceptionally well qualified to be a Federal judge. I have heard no one contend to the contrary. She has been put through the proverbial ringer--including at one point being asked her private views, how she voted, on 160 California initiatives over the last 10 years.  She has been forced to respond to questions about particular judicial decisions. I find this especially ironic in light of the Judiciary Committee's questionnaire in which we ask whether anyone involved in the process of selecting the nominee discussed with her ``any specific case, legal issue or question in a manner that could reasonably be interpreted as asking how you would rule on such case, issue, or question.'' We try to ensure that the administration imposes no litmus tests and does not ask about specific cases.  The committee insisted that she do a homework project on Robert Bork's writings and on the jurisprudence of original intent. Is that what is required to be confirmed to the district court in this Congress?  With respect to the issue of ``judicial activism,'' we have the nominee's views. She told the committee: ``The specific role of a trial judge is to apply the law as enacted by Congress and interpreted by the Supreme Court and Courts of Appeals. His or her role is not to `make law.' '' She also noted: ``Given the restrictions of the case and controversy requirement, and the limited nature of legal remedies available, the courts are ill equipped to resolve the broad problems facing our society, and should not undertake to do so. That is the job of the legislative and executive branches in our constitutional structure.''  Margaret Morrow was the first woman president of the California Bar Association and also a past president of the Los Angeles County Bar Association. She is an exceptionally well-qualified nominee who is currently a partner at Arnold & Porter and has practiced for 23 years. She is supported by Los Angeles' Republican Mayor Richard Riordan and by Robert Bonner, the former head of DEA under a Republican administration. Representative James Rogan attended her second confirmation hearing to endorse her.  Margaret Morrow has devoted her career to the law, to getting women involved in the practice of law and tomaking lawyers more responsive and responsible. Her good works should not be punished but commended. Her public service ought not be grounds for delay. She does not deserve this treatment. This type of treatment will drive good people away from government service.  The president of the Woman Lawyers Association of Los Angeles, the president of the Women's Legal Defense Fund, the president of the Los Angeles County Bar Association, the president of the National Conference of Women's Bar Association and other distinguished attorneys from the Los Angeles area have all written the Senate in support of the nomination of Margaret Morrow. They write that: ``Margaret Morrow is widely respected by attorneys, judges and community leaders of both parties'' and she ``is exactly the kind of person who should be appointed to such a position and held up as an example to young women across the country.'' I could not agree more.  Mr. President, the Senate should move expeditiously to consider and confirm Margaret Morrow, along with Anthony Ishii, Katherine Hayden Sweeney, Robert F. Droney, Janet C. Hall, Joseph F. Bataillon, and Robert C. Chambers to be district court judges.                          ____________________
