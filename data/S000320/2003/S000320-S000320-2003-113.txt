 President, I rise today in honor of Mrs. Nancy Gardner Sewell, a library media specialist/coordinator and head librarian at Selma High School in Selma, AL. After 36 years of exemplary commitment and dedicated service to the Selma City school system, Mrs. Sewell plans to retire on October 18, 2003.  Mrs. Sewell is an educator, media specialist, civic leader, and strong advocate for children. Since 1993, she has tenaciously served the City of Selma, AL, as the first black female elected to its city council. Mrs. Sewell is multi-talented and has excelled in every avenue of her life, as indicated by the numerous honors and awards bestowed upon her by her peers and community. She has never been content with the status quo. Each endeavor throughout her rich life has been met with new and innovative ideas, insurmountable energy, and the ability to motivate people.  Born and raised in Alabama, Mrs. Sewell married her college sweetheart, retired Coach Andrew A. Sewell, and became the mother of three children, Terri, Andrew, and Anthony. Her distinguished educational background includes a bachelor of science degree from Alabama State University, a masters degree from Purdue University, and advanced course work in other graduate studies at Atlanta University and the University of Alabama.  Among many of Mrs. Sewell's outstanding achievements and honors, she pioneered the development of elementary libraries in the Selma City Schools, was instrumental in maintaining accreditation status for their libraries, implemented the ``Accelerated Reader's Program,'' revitalized the Selma-Dallas Youth and Government Council, and lobbied for grants to improve literacy through school libraries, just to name a few.  Alabama is honored to be home to Mrs. Sewell. It is no secret that she is a woman who, day in and day out, goes above and beyond the call of duty. She is to be commended for all of her extraordinary efforts on behalf of Selma, AL, and everyone whose life she has touched.                          ____________________
