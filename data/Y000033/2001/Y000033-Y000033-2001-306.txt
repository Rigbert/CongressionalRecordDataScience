Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the language found on page 31, beginning on line 9 and continuing to line 10 which begins ``Notwithstanding section 3037(l)(3) of Public Law 105-178, as amended.''  This language waives the statutory distribution of funds specified in TEA-21 for the Job Access and Reverse Commute Grants program and explicitly supersedes existing law. This language clearly constitutes legislation on an appropriations bill in violation of clause 2 of rule XXI of the rules of the House of Representatives.
