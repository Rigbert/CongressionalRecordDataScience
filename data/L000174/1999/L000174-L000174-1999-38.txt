President, if I could take a moment to comment, I compliment Senator Lincoln for her comments. I totally agree with her. There was a long and difficult conference. It was the Intellectual Property Communication Omnibus Reform Act--a long and difficult conference. We had a lot of give and take. We had conferees from two Senate committees. It became a Rubik's Cube, where everybody had to give something. We got it through, and it passed. I believe my friend said the vote in the House was 411-8. In my little State, we have 70,000 homes with satellite dishes that will be left dark if we don't get this. There are 12 million nationwide.  I hope we can do this before we go out. The heavy lifting has already been done. It was done in the committee of conference. The distinguished Senator from Arkansas made very clear throughout that whole time the needs of her constituents, as have other Senators. I hope that whether they are sitting in a farmhouse in Vermont, a home in Arkansas, or anywhere else, if on New Year's Eve they want to watch the festivities by satellite, they can do that. I compliment the Senator.
