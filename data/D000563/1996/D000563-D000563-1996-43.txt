Speaker, let me join the chorus of Chicagoans, Illinoisans, and fans everywhere in saluting our world champion Chicago Bulls. The Seattle Supersonics were a worthy team, but 1996 was the year of the Bulls: a regular season record of 72 victories, a playoff record of 15 wins and 3 losses.  Why were they so successful? The greatest coach in the NBA, Phil Jackson, the man who proved that Zen can win; the greatest player in the history of the sport, Michael Jordan, whose athletic ability is only surpassed by his class; and a great team, with playersfrom Australia, Canada, Croatia, and Mars. The 1996 Chicago Bulls made America proud: four championships in 6 years, and more to come.                          ____________________
