Mr. Speaker, there is nothing more important than giving every child a chance for good education. Our economy is changing and technology is more important than ever. We must prepare our students to compete in a growing, global economy. That is why Democrats want to strengthen our public schools, build and renovate more than 5,000 schools, reduce the class size to 18, hire over 100,000 teachers, and ensure that every child has a chance to get ahead in our society.  What do Republicans propose? Just yesterday the majority leader came to this floor and suggested draining funds from our public schools for private school vouchers. This plan would weaken our public schools; it would help the few and deprive the many. That is the Republican plan. It is not right, it is not fair to the majority of our students, it is the wrong road to travel.  Mr. Speaker, we must support strong public schools for every student in America.                          ____________________
