Water takes a special place in the Catholic Mass, recalling the holiest moments of Christian celebration. Jesus blessed the water and then blessed the people with that water. The women who carried water would gather at the well. Others would be drawn to conversation with them, and from their gatherings, community came to be built, gently and progressively, conversation, one by one. Ancient history rarely recorded women's words. We know now, it should have. We know their faithfulness at the well sustaining those they loved. All life needs water.  Manette in so many ways was a Biblical woman, in our time. She was faithful, a Christian of the Catholic variety, strong, vital, wise and--as we all know now, courageous--carrying her water jar with sparkling eyes, a broad smile, humor and generosity. She gave you an extra portion. Her wisdom, born of faith, hard work and ethnic and gender sensitivity was an endless fountain for those who could appreciate it.  She ministered to all who crossed her path. And importantly, she plowed her own path to seek those who others might not know. She did so unselfishly, with a rare spirit of self-giving. She worked hard, at every worthy task she undertook. She was a laboring woman who labored with love.  As a child at her father and mother's side, she would rise at 4 am to accompany her dad as he opened the family restaurant called Najaim's and then Manette's. She hated that early rise but she learned to fill water glasses of countless people of all ages and stations. No one was a stranger at the Seady fountain. She learned about community at a young age. She was comfortable with people, most especially from Delta. She never wanted to leave them. She reminisced last week about the beauty of Delbert Dunbar's gardens, the Democratic women's club, St. Casper's and Father Ed. When I asked her, ``Manette, what especially did you want me to share with those who will gather to celebrate your life?'' She replied: ``Tell them how we worked to help the seniors.'' The idea for creating for our country The Senior Farmer's Market coupons was formed here, where it now serves 23,000 seniors in northwest Ohio, well as millions across our nation. She delivered communion to shut-ins, befriended individuals--Dorothy Biddle, Edwina Mattimore, Mary Turi, Nona Sue-Mack, Clarence Seifert--carrying her water jar. She influenced the younger generation, including members of our Congressional staff here today: Steve, Sue, Theresa and Karen among them.  Theresa has written:       It is just so hard to imagine life without our Manette . .      . the Fulton County Fair (she loved the ribbon chips and      getting tacos from J & A Taco Wagon from Defiance), having      dinner at Byblo's and looking at Christmas lights (Manette      asked Sue and me to be mystery judges for the Chamber's      Christmas light contest) . . . none of that will be the same.      She loved her community, her family, and had such a warm      heart.  Now, I have met thousands upon thousands of people in my own life. But there has been only one Manette, my sister-friend, The ``Blessed Woman of Delta with the Water Jar''. There is much I did not know about her family. I was reminded yesterday, her father ran for the Mayor of Delta, Of course, Manette ran for the Fulton County Recorder. Each took representative government a step forward.  As a representative of our Congressional office in Fulton County, she stayed in touch with hundreds of people. She let us know what their concerns were. She took her duties very seriously. She practiced the route to events twice the day before. She planned every moment at every event. She left nothing to chance. She always worked hard, a laboring woman who provided her own sustenance, cared for her parents, working 28 years at Aunt Jane's Foods, and upon its closure, as an Administrative Assistant at the Fulton Mill Service.  In her beautiful memory, Manette Ann Zogby Seady, we ordered a U.S. flag flown over the Capitol for a loving, generous, hardworking daughter, niece, cousin, godmother, beloved friend, devout woman of the church, and patriotic citizen for all time. She made her passage with grace and coverage. At twilight on the day of her passage, her cousin recalls she saw a rainbow through the trees, but there had been no rain. Truly, Manette was a ``Blessed Woman At the Well.''                          ____________________
