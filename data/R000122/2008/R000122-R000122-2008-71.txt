President, let me commend the Senator from Ohio for his very thoughtful and very persuasive remarks about a crisis that is gripping almost every family in this country. We are in an extraordinarily daunting moment in our history, and I was disappointed, to say the least, when our colleagues on the Republican side blocked consideration of the Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008. Every household in this country is beginning to recognize the specter of decreasing house prices, and for many it is not just a looming potential, it is a reality, and it is forcing them to consider very difficult choices in their own family lives.  We have had a situation over the last 8 years in which the income of working families has been stagnant, and in contrast, prices for items that are essential, such as energy and food and health care, have gone up dramatically. Families across this country have been squeezed by flat incomes and rising prices. But there was one point of hope and confidence, a foundation, at least, for their hopes going forward, and that was the value of their home because it was appreciating. Now that has reversed dramatically, and there are estimates that if nothing is done, if the administration continues to block efforts through their colleagues here in the Senate and the House, we could lose somewhere up to 30 percent of the value of homes throughout the UnitedStates, from their peak several years ago to the trough that is anticipated. That would mean the loss of $4 to $6 trillion in household wealth--a staggering figure. It is a figure that, from a macroeconomic standpoint, would have huge ramifications.  But let us step down to the actual effects on a family. What does it mean? Well, it means your senior in high school who was planning on going to a prestigious college is not going there.
