Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute to respond briefly, and I think it needs to be responded to.  The Taiwan Relations Act made it very clear in section 3 that there is no ambiguity about the policy. It is veryclear to make available to Taiwan such defense articles and defense services in such quantity as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability.  Nobody in their right mind or in their wildest dreams would ever conceive of Taiwan attacking the mainland. It is all about a credible deterrence so that that dialogue between Beijing and Taipei can go forward, and that is why I think that this law has been so important in helping to maintain that protective cocoon, if you will, so that this dialogue again could go forward without an invasion from the People's Republic of China.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
