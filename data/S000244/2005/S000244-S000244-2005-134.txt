Chairman, I yield myself the balance of the time.  Mr. Chairman, two of the 9/11 hijackers overstayed their visas. Under the current law, that is just a civil ground of inadmissibility. I think that that should be some type of a crime so that at least they can be detained.  The businessperson who inadvertently overstays their visa because the flight is canceled, no problem; no prosecutor is going to prosecute that person because of it. I see some games being played here. The people who are saying that this bill is too harsh want to keep these penalties as felonies. I do not know why that is. I think it will be much better to make them misdemeanors, because at least, that way, we do not have to have the taxpayers pay for a lawyer to defend them if they do not have any money. And we do not have to have the space to incarcerate them in Federal penitentiaries.  This amendment makes the bill workable. I believe it is a good amendment. I urge its adoption.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
