Chairman, the gentleman is correct. The FAA does conduct some of the research projects and activities authorized by this legislation at the technical center in New Jersey.  Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Chairman, as the gentleman may be aware, this facility, located in the congressional district which I represent, is the FAA's premier research and development center. Perhaps the gentleman is also aware that this facility has performed and is performing cutting-edge research and testing in the areas of advanced air traffic control and navigation technology, airport security, fire safety technology and runway safety and pavement durability systems.  Mr. Chairman, I should note for the Record that the Hughes Technical Center maintains and operates the only configuration managed lab in the world capable of testing new equipment and systems without disrupting or compromising the safety of air traffic. In other words, these labs allow the FAA to test all equipment and systems in an environment that is identical to the actual air traffic control facilities so we know how the equipment will work together and otherwise function with existing systems before it is fielded.  This work and capability is largely responsible for the unparalleled record of aviation safety in this country.  For purposes of clarification, Mr. Chairman, I ask the gentleman if there is anything in the bill to require consolidation of the functions and activities of the Hughes Technical Center with any other Federal Aviation Administration facility?
