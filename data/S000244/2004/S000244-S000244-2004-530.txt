Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, the amendment in the nature of a substitute to S. 1920 made in order by the rule replaces the text of that bill with the text of H.R. 975, the bankruptcy bill passed by the House by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 315-113 on March 19, 2003.  The administration has without qualification endorsed this legislation. Nevertheless, this bill has languished in the other body now for almost a year. The question that has been asked is, why are we engaged in what admittedly may appear to be a redundant undertaking? While the other body is often described as the saucer in which the coffee cools, H.R. 975 has become nearly frozen in that proverbial saucer.                              {time}  1345  Today I seek to reignite congressional consideration of bankruptcy reform.  Some of my colleagues may also ask, ``Why now? What's the rush?'' There are many answers. A major reason is that the current bankruptcy system is broken, and it gets worse every day that we fail to act. Bankruptcy filings continue to break record after record, straining the system's resources. The proliferation of bankruptcy filings is not just a temporary event, but part of a consistent upward trend. In 4 years, the number of bankruptcy filings has jumped by 150 percent to nearly 1.7 million cases as of fiscal year 2003.  Another reason has to do with the growing extent of fraud and abuse in the current bankruptcy system. Bankruptcy relief should be available to honest debtors, but current law allows, if not encourages, dishonest debtors to file abusive bankruptcies that overburden the system. According to the Justice Department, bankruptcy fraud and abuse is ``serious and far-reaching.''  While some debtors fraudulently conceal assets, others try to discharge debt despite their ability to repay their obligations. The current system is overburdened and ill equipped to aggressively detect and deter identity theft and other basic forms of bankruptcy fraud, let alone more creative schemes such as the so-called ``credit card bust-outs.'' The Justice Department reports that debtors are obtaining credit cards despite having little or no income, incurring huge debts, paying those debts with worthless checks, and then filing for bankruptcy relief to discharge their massive liabilities. We need to give our law enforcement agencies and the judiciary the tools necessary to fight fraud and abuse in the bankruptcy system.  A third reason, I admit, has to do with money. According to some analyses, the increase in consumer bankruptcy filings has significant adverse financial consequences for our Nation's economy and the economic well-being of our citizens. For instance, it has been estimated that in 1997 alone, more than $40 billion of debt was discharged as a result of bankruptcy cases. These losses, according to one estimate, translate into a $400 annual ``tax'' on every household in our Nation in the form of higher prices and higher interest rates. For the sake of our family farmers, we ought to relieve them of this $400 tax so that they can do a better job in producing food and fiber for our Nation's tables as well as for export.  More importantly, there are moral reasons for supporting the need for bankruptcy reform. The current system allows deadbeat parents to use bankruptcy to avoid their child support obligations. Likewise, it permits corporate criminals to use bankruptcy to shield their mansions from the claims of those whom they have defrauded.  Let me be perfectly clear. If this bill is voted down in the substitute amendment that has been made in order by the Committee on Rules, deadbeat parents will have a better opportunity to use bankruptcy to escape their court-ordered child support enforcement obligations. That means that the people who are opposing this move are giving these deadbeat parents a get-out-of-obligation-free card so that they can stiff their custodial former spouses. We plug that loophole.  Furthermore, this bill plugs the so-called ``homestead exemption'' that has allowed corporate criminals to be able to use bankruptcy to shield their assets and huge mansions in the States that have unlimited homestead exemptions from bankruptcy and leave employees in the lurch, employees that could use those assets to be able to allow them to find new jobs as a result of a corporation going bankrupt as a result of executive and management abuse.  Perhaps among the most important reasons to support bankruptcy reform is that it will help some of the most needy and deserving members of our society. As the title of the bill indicates, these reforms are not just about preventing abuse, but they also provide long overdue consumer protections. For example, domestic support claimants will receive very much-needed, special protections under this legislation. These reforms will ensure that families with pensions and education IRAs will not have to use these assets to pay creditors. Those protections will not be there if this bill is voted down.  As part of their monthly credit card billing statements, consumers will be given more meaningful disclosures about the consequences of making minimum monthly payments. It will require the appointment of an ombudsman to serve as a watchdog for patients in health care facilities in bankruptcy. It more than doubles employee priority wage claims.  If this bill is voted down, those that vote ``no'' turn their back on all of these improvements. These are just a few examples of the many benefits that consumers will finally be able to enjoy once bankruptcy reforms are enacted.  I urge my colleagues to move forward with bankruptcy reform. This is a comprehensive bill. It is a good bill. It does not hurt the ability of somebody who is truly down and out to be able to file for bankruptcy and get their discharge and start anew. But what it will do is plug the loophole of those who wish to use the Bankruptcy Code as a financial planning tool, a financial planning tool that ends up stiffing every family that pays their bills on time and, as agreed upon, $400 a year in a hidden tax. That is a hidden tax that the lack of bankruptcy reform has stuck on all of our constituents who ought to be our special interest.  I urge my colleagues to support the enactment of the amendment in the nature of a substitute to S. 1920.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
