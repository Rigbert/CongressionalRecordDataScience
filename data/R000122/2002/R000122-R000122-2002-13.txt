President, today I am proud to be joined by my colleague Senator Fitzgerald in introducing the Private Well Testing Assistance Act of 2002. This legislation seeks to protect the health of our Nation's rural families by providing Federal assistance to State health and environmental agencies for sampling of drinking water wells near suspected areas of groundwater contamination.  More than 15.1 million households are served by private drinking water wells in the United States. At times, these wells are affected by serious groundwater contaminants, including industrial solvents, petroleum, nitrates, radon, arsenic, beryllium, chloroform, and gasoline additives such as MTBE.  While private well owners generally are responsible for regular testing of drinking water wells, cases of serious or potentially widespread groundwater contamination often require State agencies to conduct costly tests on numerous wells. Many of these sites are included in the Environmental Protection Agency's Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Information System, or CERCLIS, for which Federal funding is available for initial site assessments, but not for subsequent regular sampling to ensure that contaminants have not migrated to additional household wells.  With many State budgets across the country in fiscal crisis, State governments often do not have the resources to provide regular, reliable testing of wells in proximity to suspected areas of contamination. By authorizing EPAto provide up to $20 million per year to assist State well testing programs, subject to a 20 percent State match, the Private Well Testing Assistance Act will create an incentive for states to improve well monitoring near both new and existing areas of groundwater contamination.  I urge my colleagues to help ensure the health and safety of American families that rely on groundwater for their drinking water needs by supporting this legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3127       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Private Well Testing      Assistance Act''.     SEC. 2. ASSISTANCE FOR TESTING OF PRIVATE WELLS.       Part E of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300j et      seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:     ``SEC. 1459. ASSISTANCE FOR TESTING OF PRIVATE WELLS.       ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       ``(1) more than 15,100,000 households in the United States      are served by private drinking water wells;       ``(2) while private well owners generally are responsible      for regular testing of drinking water wells for the presence      of contaminants, cases of serious or potentially widespread      groundwater contamination often require State health and      environmental agencies to conduct costly tests on numerous      drinking water well sites;       ``(3) many of those sites are included in the Comprehensive      Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability      Information System of the Environmental Protection Agency,      through which Federal funding is available for testing of      private wells during initial site assessments but not for      subsequent regular sampling to ensure that contaminants have      not migrated to other wells;       ``(4) many State governments do not have the resources to      provide regular, reliable testing of drinking water wells      that are located in proximity to areas of suspected      groundwater contamination;       ``(5) State fiscal conditions, already in decline before      the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, are rapidly      approaching a state of crisis;       ``(6) according to the National Conference of State      Legislatures--       ``(A) revenues in 43 States are below estimates; and       ``(B) 36 States have already planned or implemented cuts in      public services;       ``(7) as a result of those economic conditions, most States      do not have drinking water well testing programs in place,      and many State well testing programs have been discontinued,      placing households served by private drinking water wells at      increased risk; and       ``(8) the provision of Federal assistance, with a State      cost-sharing requirement, would establish an incentive for      States to provide regular testing of drinking water wells in      proximity to new and existing areas of suspected groundwater      contamination.       ``(b) Definitions.--In this section:       ``(1) Administrator.--The term `Administrator' means the      Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, acting      in consultation with appropriate State agencies.       ``(2) Area of concern.--The term `area of concern' means a      geographic area in a State the groundwater of which may, as      determined by the State--       ``(A) be contaminated or threatened by a release of 1 or      more substances of concern; and       ``(B) present a serious threat to human health.       ``(3) Hazardous substance.--The term `hazardous substance'      has the meaning given the term in section 101 of the      Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and      Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601).       ``(4) Pollutant or contaminant.--The term `pollutant or      contaminant' has the meaning given the term in section 101 of      the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and      Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601).       ``(5) Substance of concern.--The term `substance of      concern' means--       ``(A) a hazardous substance;
