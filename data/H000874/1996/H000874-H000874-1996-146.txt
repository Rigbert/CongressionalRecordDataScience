Chairman, I rise in strong support of this amendment and am very pleased that the chairman saw fit to accept it. I am one of those who believes that our policy, whether it deals with trade or any other facet of international relations, ought to reflect our commitment to human rights. Of course our commitment to human rights ought to be particularly keen when it comes to the most vulnerable people in our world, and that is our children.  America itself suffered and from time to time still suffers from the abuse of children. We talk about child abuse, this is child abuse. This is the utilization of children for economic gain, while substantially damaging their health and robbing them of their childhood and ruining their lives. America, among the nations, ought to stand tallest and most strongly raise the issue that we will not be complicit in this treatment or maltreatment of children.  I congratulate the gentleman from Massachusetts. No voice has been stronger in this Congress or in this country on behalf of the rights of those who have been disenfranchised and discriminated against and undermined in this health and in their quality of living than has the voice of the gentleman from Massachusetts, Joe Kennedy, and I am pleased to be allied with him in this amendment and thank him for his leadership and offering of this amendment.
