I will conclude my part of this by first saying that I thank my colleagues for joining me.  If I said we were dealing with an industry--the for-profit colleges and universities--that has 10 percent of the high school graduates in America attending and 44 percent of all the student loan defaults, it might raise some question. If I said that at least 90 percent of the revenue these for-profit colleges and universities receive is often from the Federal Treasury, a Federal subsidy--sometimes more than 90 percent, which is the point we are making here--and if I said that many of these schools are literally exploiting our veterans and servicemembers, I think that is a clarion call for Members of Congress to stand up and first do something to protect the men and women in uniform and the veterans and second to make sure taxpayers' dollars are well spent.  This Corinthian College collapse is an indication of how we can lose $1.4 billion a year for a worthless college system, for-profit college system.  If I said at the end of the day that I don't know what the term ``crony capitalism'' means--I will go and look it up after this speech, but it looks to me as if they are calling themselves private schools. They might as well be Federal agencies and, as such, should be held accountable.  I thank my colleagues for joining me.
