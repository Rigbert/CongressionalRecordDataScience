 President, this month my friend Mickey Miller will retire from Nolin Rural Electric Cooperative Corporation, Nolin RECC, after 45 years at the organization, including more than a quarter century as its president and CEO. Mickey has dedicated his career to providing reliable, cost-effective energy services to Kentuckians in nine counties with integrity and innovation. I would like to take a moment to reflect on his remarkable career in our Commonwealth.  From LaRue County, Mickey graduated from the University of Kentucky with a degree in agriculture economics and marketing. During his time at Nolin RECC, Mickey has championed a great deal of growth and advancement. In fact, the cooperative's membership has more than tripled, providing vital services to Kentucky families and employers and fueling development in the region.  Mickey's contributions extend beyond his work with Nolin RECC. As the chairman of the Kentucky Council of Cooperatives and the director of the Kentucky Association of Electric Cooperatives, Mickey has been a strong advocate for affordable and reliable electricity programs throughout the Commonwealth. He also has served on the board of the United Utility Supply Cooperative, providing for the needs of communities across 19 States. Previously, Mickey led energy cooperatives throughout the Nation as the chairman of Touchstone Energy.  In addition to his many business successes, Mickey has also committed himself to the betterment of his community. As an executive board member of the Lincoln Heritage Council of the Boy Scouts of America, Mickey is dedicated to helping prepare the next generation to excel. He also worked to encourage economic growth in his community through his involvement with the Elizabethtown--Hardin County Industrial Foundation.  I would like to particularly recognize one part of Mickey's work for his community: saluting our Nation's veterans. Supporting the Honor Flight Kentucky program, Nolin RECC, under Mickey's leadership, along with other Kentucky cooperatives, enabled 43 World War II, Korea, and Vietnam veterans to travel to Washington, DC, last year to see the memorials built to honor their service. I am grateful for the work of Honor Flight Kentucky, which gives many veterans their only chance to visit our Nation's Capital, and I applaud the efforts of community leaders like Mickey for making these trips a possibility for our heroes.  Given Mickey's dedication to these many causes and his passion for rural communities, it is no wonder that he has been honored with several awards recognizing his service to many of these organizations. From the Touchstone Energy Distinguished Service Award to the Boy Scout Hardin County Distinguished Citizen Award, Mickey is widely praised for his professional accomplishments and his service to his community.  Although I am sure everyone at Nolin RECC is sorry to see him go, I know they will join me in thanking Mickey for his many years of dedicated service to Kentucky's rural communities. I wish him a relaxing retirement with his wife of 46 years, Barbara, his daughters, Jennifer and Carmen, and his grandsons, Craig and Mason. I encourage my Senate colleagues to help me congratulate Mickey Miller on a remarkable career of service to Nolin RECC.                          ____________________
