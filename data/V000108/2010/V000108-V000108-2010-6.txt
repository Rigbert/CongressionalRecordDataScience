 Reverend Scott has dedicated his life to the service of his community and fellow citizens in northwest Indiana. Before joining the church, Randy spent 37 years of his life as a member of the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Local 374, in Hammond, Indiana.  After his retirement, Reverend Scott was touched by the Holy Spirit and realized that his life was destined for a higher purpose. He put his life in the hands of the Lord, who directed him to become a shepherd of His flock. Twenty-four years ago, Reverend Scott began ministering with the United Pentecostal Church International. Reverend Scott became the assistant pastor at the Pentecostals of South Lake Church in Merrillville, Indiana, where he has effectively ministered to the congregation for the past 20 years, enriching all those who pass through the doors. Reverend Scott has also dedicated himself to the Merrillville Clergy Association, where he has served as president for the past 3 years.  Reverend Scott is joined here today with his wife, Connie, and his daughter, Lydia.  It is my honor to welcome a man who encompasses so many of the wonderful qualities and experiences of the people of northwest Indiana, and I would like to personally thank Reverend Scott for offering this morning's prayer.                          ____________________
