President, I thank Senators Shelby and Sarbanes because we cannot really entertain amendments that affect these titles until we have them done. We are anxious to get the other two titles on the bill.  I will repeat our plea for people to come over with their amendments because the Senator from Indiana has agreed that he would set his amendment aside when people come down, with the understanding we would return to his amendment upon completion of those amendments.  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
