President, I am pleased that the Senate today has taken up and passed bipartisan legislation to make a number of improvements to the way in which the Copyright Office functions, to clarify areas in copyright law that have become unclear, and make technical changes to current law. The Copyright Office provided important recommendations that are included in this legislation, and I thank them for their input and guidance on these issues.  The changes made by this legislation are commonsense improvements that will make the copyright system more efficient. Bills such as this underscore the point that when Congress works together in a bipartisan, bicameral fashion, we can pass good pieces of legislation. I appreciate the Senate acting quickly to pass this bill, and I look forward to the President signing it into law.                          ____________________
