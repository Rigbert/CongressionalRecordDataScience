 President, I ask that a letter from the Society for Human Resource Management in support of the SAVER bill be printed in the Record.  The letter follows:                                                 Society for Human                                          Resource Management,                                 Alexandria, VA, November 6, 1997.     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: On behalf of the Society for Human Resource      Management, SHRM, I am writing to enthusiastically endorse      the Savings Are Vital for Everyone's Retirement (SAVER) Act,      which recently passed the U.S. House of Representatives under      suspension of the rules. This bipartisan legislation may be      considered on the Senate floor very soon. SHRM is the leading      voice of the human resource profession, representing the      interests of more than 89,000 professional and student      members from around the world.       Today most individuals are able to retire in a fashion that      meets their needs. On average, workers retire earlier and      live longer than in the past. However, a number of trends in      the economy and workplace suggest that it will become      increasingly difficult for American workers to meet their      needs for adequate retirement income. The U.S. population is      aging rapidly and the elderly live longer. The retirement of      the baby boom generation will impose severe pressure on      Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. It is clear that a      coordinated strategy is needed.       That is why this legislation is so critical. This      legislation directs the Department of Labor to maintain an      ongoing education and outreach program to the public to      educate America about the need to save more. The SAVER Act      also convenes a National Summit on Retirement Savings to be      held by April 15, 1998 and every four years thereafter. The      summit would bring together experts from the employee      benefits and retirement arena, and give lawmakers access to      the research and recommendations of experts so that America      can meet the challenges ahead. This bipartisan legislation      should be actively supported by all member of the Senate.       Thank you for your consideration of this key legislation.      SHRM looks forward to working with the full Senate to see      this legislation passed in 1997.           Sincerely,                                                  Deanna R. Gelak,     Director, Governmental Affairs.                          ____________________
