President, I rise to congratulate the Rhode Island Department of the Reserve Officers Association of the United States (RIROA) on the 75th Anniversary of its founding.  The Reserve Officers Association was established in 1922 to link together Reserves from each of the armed services. The fighting force of the 21st century is a joint force, yet Rhode Island's Reserves implemented this concept 75 years ago when the Army, Navy Reserve, and National Guard joined together to form the RIROA.  The purpose of the Reserve Officers Association is to support a military policy for the United States that will provide, promote, and develop the execution of adequate national security. The RIROA has dedicated itself to this purpose and to bringing all military services closer in a common bond. The RIROA is a leading proponent of developing strong Reserve forces in each of the uniformed services to work for the welfare of citizen soldiers in Rhode Island and the interests of the national security of the entire country.  The Reserves are essential members of the national security force, facing greater challenges than ever before. Today's military is leaner, yet the number of missions has steadily increased. Therefore, the services are relying more and more on reserve forces to carry out the task of protecting the U.S. and its principles. Reservists are not only an integral part of any mobilization overseas, but are increasingly on the front lines of protecting the home front from terrorist acts, information warfare, and attacks on our critical infrastructure.  With over 85,000 members nationwide, and over 600 members from Rhode Island, today's Reserves are a significant and vital part of the United States' military force. The United States military would not be the finest fighting force in the world without the commitment and professionalism of the Reserves, an integral part of the Total Force.  I commend the Reserves' commitment to the nation's defense, and I salute the dedicated members of the RIROA on this historic occasion.                          ____________________
