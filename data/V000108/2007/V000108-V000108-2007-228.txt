Greene for his bravery and his willingness to fight for his country. Corporal Greene was assigned to A Company 2nd Battalion, 87th Infantry Regiment, 10th Mountain Division out of Fort Drum, New York. In an unfortunate accident, Corporal Greene lost his life on Saturday, April 28, 2007, at Forward Operating Base Tillman in Afghanistan. His sacrifice for his country will forever be remembered by a community that has been struck hard by the devastating loss of one of its own.  A native of Springfield, Ohio, Jeremy graduated in 2001 from Shawnee High School inSpringfield, Ohio. Jeremy is remembered as being the adventurous type, always enjoying activities like rock climbing and rapelling. Based on his desire to participate in exciting activities, even as a child, it came as no surprise that he would eventually choose to join the military. In 2004, Jeremy enlisted in the United States Army and began his next adventure.  Corporal Greene felt tremendous pride for his country, and it will never be forgotten that he was willing to endanger his own life to protect the lives of his fellow citizens. His courage and heroism will always be remembered, and his sacrifice will forever live in the hearts and minds of those for whom he battled. Corporal Greene enlisted in the United States Army being fully aware that danger could arise in any situation. He accepted this so the freedoms and values he treasured could be enjoyed by men, women, and children around the world.  For his efforts, Corporal Greene was awarded several military medals and honors, including: the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, to name a few. In addition, to further exemplify his dedication and patriotism, Corporal Greene was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star Medal.  Although he loved his unit and his country, Jeremy treasured his family above all else. He is survived by his father, Richard Greene, of Springfield, Ohio, his mother, Cindy Greene (Mike White), of Oxford, Indiana, and two brothers, Mickey and Christopher Webster, as well as his loving nieces, Zoe, Sierra, and Jordan, whom Jeremy adored. Jeremy also leaves to cherish his memory many other friends and family members whose lives he has touched.  Madam Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring a fallen hero, United States Army Corporal Jeremy R. Greene. He will forever remain a hero in the eyes of his family, his community, and his country; thus, let us never forget the sacrifice he made to preserve the ideals of freedom and democracy.                          ____________________
