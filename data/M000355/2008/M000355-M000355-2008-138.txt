 President, I know everybody is anxious to leave. Very briefly, voting for cloture on this bill will take us off of the single most important issue in America.  The American people are clamoring for legislation that brings down gas prices, and our leadership friends on the other side want to dismiss this issue instead of taking it head on with bold action.  We want to address the issue of gas prices, and the important thing is to stay on the subject. I strongly urge a ``no'' vote on this motion.
