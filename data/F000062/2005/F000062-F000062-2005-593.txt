 President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New York.  We are both members of the Judiciary Committee. We had an opportunity to discuss and debate this amendment in the Judiciary Committee.  Senator Schumer's amendment is a critical amendment. Essentially, when this body in 1994 passed the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, we said that individuals should be able to go into clinics without being obstructed.
