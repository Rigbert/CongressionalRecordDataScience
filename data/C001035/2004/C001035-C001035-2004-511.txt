President, today Senator Wyden and I are introducing the Homeland Security Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Protection Act of 2004. It has been a pleasure to work with my colleague from Oregon on this legislation to strengthen protections for civil rights and civil liberties. In the wake of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, during his joint address to Congress, the President called on all Americans to ``uphold the values of America and remember why so many have come here. We're in a fight for our principles, and our first responsibility is to live by them.''  In response to the need to safeguard our homeland, Congress enacted the Homeland Security Act of 2002 thatcreated the Department of Homeland Security, the most significant government restructuring in more than 50 years. But in focusing our attention on protecting the homeland from future terrorist attacks, we also must ensure that we do not trample on the very values that the terrorists seek to destroy. In enacting the Homeland Security Act, Congress understood the importance of providing checks and balances to protect civil rights and civil liberties. To this end, Congress created within the Department three positions devoted wholly or in part to ensuring respect for civil liberties as the Department carries out its mandate to protect our homeland. These positions are the Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, the Privacy Officer, and the Department's Inspector General. These three officials have crucial roles in assessing actions of the Department that may affect personal privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties.  The nature of the mission of the Department of Homeland Security makes safeguards especially important. The Department is now our country's biggest law enforcement agency. It has more Federal officers with arrest and firearm authority than the Department of Justice. In addition, DHS law enforcement personnel have contact with thousands of people every day. In this post 9/11 world, DHS law enforcement personnel must be especially sensitive to maintaining civil liberties as they work to strengthen security and detect and deter terrorist attacks.  I am pleased that the leadership of the Department recognizes the fundamental importance of protecting the rights of all of us while fighting terrorism. Under the leadership of Secretary Ridge, the new Department of Homeland Security has won praise for its commitment to the protection of our freedoms. Secretary Ridge has provided the Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and the Privacy Officer with the tools they need to be effective. These officials have functioned at the senior level, regularly providing advice to the Secretary and his deputies. The Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, the Privacy Officer and the Inspector General have met regularly with organizations concerned about civil liberties, privacy, human rights, and immigrant rights and have been responsive to their concerns.  It is time for Congress to build on the foundation Secretary Ridge has laid in protecting civil rights and civil liberties. I believe the Homeland Security Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Protection Act of 2004 does exactly that.  The bill would write into law the activities of the Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. As enacted, the Homeland Security Act did not clearly define the duties of that position. Over the past year, however, a strong Officer, with the support of the Department's leadership, has charted an important course for his office. The Officer has worked closely with the senior leadership of the Department. He has assisted in the development of departmental policies to ensure that civil liberties are given due consideration. He has overseen compliance with constitutional and other requirements relating to the rights and liberties of individuals affected by the Department's programs. He has coordinated with the Privacy Officer to ensure that overlapping privacy and civil rights concerns are addressed in a comprehensive way. And he has investigated alleged abuses of civil rights and civil liberties.  None of these activities is expressly addressed in the statutory language creating the Department, and there is no assurance in the law that future Officers for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties will work so energetically to carry out these vital duties. It is time for the law to catch up with practice, and the Homeland Security Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Protection Act ensures that goal.  The bill also clarifies that the Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties as well as the Privacy Officer should report directly to the Secretary, and requires coordination between those officers to ensure an integrated and comprehensive approach to the important issues they address.  The Homeland Security Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Protection Act of 2004 strengthens the ability of the Department's Inspector General to safeguard civil rights and civil liberties by requiring the DHS Inspector General to designate a senior official to coordinate investigation of abuses, ensure public awareness of complaint procedures, and coordinate his or her work with the Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. This position is similar to one Congress created in the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice.  Finally, the Homeland Security Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Protection Act of 2004 amends the mission statement of the Department of Homeland Security to ensure that actions taken by the Department to protect the homeland do not diminish civil liberties and civil rights. This important revision places into the statutory language that the protection of civil rights and civil liberties is crucial in this time of heightened security.  The battle against terror will last for many years, perhaps decades. During that long struggle, we must continue to secure our nation against future attacks, but at the same time protect those American values that define our free society. The Homeland Security Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Protection Act of 2004 will strengthen the protection of civil rights and civil liberties and will help to ensure that that protection will continue in the years to come.
