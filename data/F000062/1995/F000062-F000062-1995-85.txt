 This project is even more cost effective and compelling today and reflects creative land use planning and promising joint development opportunities. The bay area congressional delegation has rallied around this important project. A similar colloquy occurred in the House with Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Frank Wolf. Our efforts here today represent an important reaffirmation of the value of local and regional planning and decision making, a focus consistent with the goals of ISTEA and more likely to ensure timely and cost-effective project completion. I look forward to working with you, Chairman Hatfield, in making certain that the plan for the Tasman west extension is financially sound and continues to enjoy the broad-based support it has in the past.
