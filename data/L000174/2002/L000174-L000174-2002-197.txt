 I witnessed the devastating effects of domestic violence early in my career as the Vermont State's Attorney for Chittenden County. Today, a growing number of homeless individuals are women and children fleeing domestic violence. More than half the cities surveyed by the U.S. Conference of Mayors in 2000 cited domestic violence as a primary cause of homelessness. Shelters offer short-term assistance, but are overcrowded and unable to provide the support needed. Transitional housing allows women to bridge the gap between leaving a domestic violence situation and becoming fully self-sufficient.  A transitional housing grant program was last authorized for only one year as part of the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act in 2000. This program would have been administered through the Department of Health and Human Services and provided $25 million in FY2001. Unfortunately, funds were never appropriated for the program, and the authorization has now expired.  The grant program established in the bill I am introducing today would be administered through the Department of Justice, in consultation with the Departments of Health and Human Services and Housing and Urban Development. This program would have the benefit of a wide range of expertise in the three departments, and has enormous potential to improve people's lives.  This new grant program will make a big impact, in many areas of the country, availability of affordable housing is at an all-time low. There are many dedicated people working to provide victims of domestic violence with resources, such as Rose Pulliam of the Vermont Network Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, but they can not work alone. We should all be concerned with providing victims of domestic violence a safe place to gain the skills and stability needed to make the transition to independence. This is an important component of reducing and preventing crimes that take place in domestic situations, ranging from assault and child abuse to homicide, and helping the victims of these crimes. I urge the Senate to take prompt action on this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
