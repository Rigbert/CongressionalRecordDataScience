I salute the Senator from Minnesota, myfriend, Senator Paul Wellstone, and our colleague, Senator Domenici from New Mexico, for their leadership on this issue. It is a classic illustration of another problem facing American families which this Congress has refused to address. The problem is very straightforward.  An internist from Springfield, IL, came to see me and said, ``Senator, I am literally afraid to put in a patient's record that I am giving them medication for depression because the insurance company will then label them as `victims of chronic depression,' a mental illness, and discriminate against them when it comes to future health insurance coverage.''  That is outrageous. Mental illness is an illness, it is not a moral shortcoming. These people can and deserve to receive the very best care. Unless and until the Senator from Minnesota and others of like mind prevail in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, we will continue to discriminate against the victims of mental illness. That is something this Congress can do something about. We will leave here today or tomorrow, again, with that unfinished item on the agenda.
