President, before the Senator leaves, let me just clarify something. It is a very rare occasion that the good Senator from Alabama and I disagree on anything. It just doesn't happen. In this particular case, this is the exception. Let me kind of outline how I think the system works. I don't chair the Finance Committee. I don't chair the Budget Committee. I do not serve on either one of them. I do chair the Environment and Public Works Committee.  When we put together the bill--and this particular bill has been 3 years in the making--it is very similar to what we had last year except it is a lower funding level which should satisfy, to a greater degree, the Senator from Alabama. But when we come up with a bill, the procedure is to go to the Finance Committee. We did that, and we have several Finance provisions in there. Senators Grassley and Baucus spent a long time. While people keep saying the offsets are not realistic, they could be right, but the ones who can properly evaluate the offsets are the ones who proposed the offsets, and that is the job of the Finance Committee.  I want to say this because the Senator from Alabama and I are ranked as two of the most conservative Members of the Senate. I have said often there are two areas where conservatives spend money; one is national defense and the other is infrastructure. That is what we are supposed to be doing here. I wish to clarify that I will be opposing the amendment because I believe the Finance Committee has done their job. I have heard both the ranking member and the chairman talk about this, and they have convinced me that they have done their work. We will have to wait and see.
