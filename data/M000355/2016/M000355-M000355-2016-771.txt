 President, I wish to congratulate a distinguished Kentuckian who is an accomplished doctor and who works to save lives and heal the sick in eastern Kentucky. Dr. Houshang Khorram practiced as a pediatrician for 50 years at Appalachian Regional Healthcare in Middlesboro, KY, and he retired this past January after his five decades of service.  Dr. Khorram originally studied medicine in Iran, attending the Shiraz Medical Science University. He knew from the beginning of his medical career that he wanted to specialize in pediatrics. After taking pediatrics specialty classes in Iran, he came to America;first to Baltimore, MD, and then, in 1965, to Kentucky. He has been a proud resident of the Bluegrass State ever since.  In his time at Appalachian Regional Healthcare, Dr. Khorram served as chief of the pediatric department, chief of medical staff, and president of the board of directors at the Daniel Boone Clinic. In his time as a physician, he has seen many advances in medical technology and implemented them in his practice.  I want to congratulate Dr. Khorram for his five decades of service at the top of the medical field and wish him well upon the occasion of his retirement. I know he will have as much success in whatever endeavor he chooses next as he has had in his chosen field. I am sure his wife, Toby, and their two children are very proud of him, and Kentucky is glad to have benefitted from his work and service.  An area publication, the Middlesboro Daily News, recently published an article highlighting Dr. Khorram's life and career. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Middlesboro Daily News, Feb. 12, 2016]                         Decades of Dedication                          (By Kelsey Gerhardt)       Appalachian Regional Healthcare in Middlesboro is a place      where lives are saved, babies are born and broken bones are      set. Dr. Houshang Khorram has seen it all in his 50 years as      a pediatrician.       Khorram's story starts during his time as a student at      Shiraz Medical Science University in Iran.       ``I loved kids. I've always loved kids and that's how I      knew what I wanted to do,'' said Khorram.       He completed his pediatrics specialty classes in Iran and      came to America to work at Johns Hopkins Hospital in      Baltimore, Maryland for a couple of years.       In 1965, Khorram started working for the ARH in Floyd      County, Kentucky and moved to the Middlesboro ARH five years      later. He has lived and worked in Middlesboro ever since.       ``Actually, I came here to live for just six months, but      I'm still here. I love the people and I love the area and I      love nature so there are a lot of things that have kept me      here,'' said Khorram.       He has seen many advances in the medical field, including      technology and equipment which he believes have not only      benefited pediatrics, but the way in which doctors are able      to care for patients.       ``So much that we have now, we didn't have it 10 or even 20      years ago. CT scans, MRI's, sonograms have helped a lot and      now it's easier to make a diagnosis and it's more reliable,''      said Khorram.       Khorram retired from ARH on January 1 and received a      special award for his time. Throughout his decades at ARH,      Khorram served as the chief of the Pediatric Department,      chief of Medical Staff and the president of the board of      directors at the Daniel Boone Clinic.       If given the opportunity to start all over again, he      undoubtedly would.       ``I encourage my kids to go into the medical field. It's a      great place to be and I would go back, go again to medical      school if I could,'' laughed Khorram.       He enjoys hiking and reading pediatrics books in his free      time. Since retirement, he is looking forward to having time      to spend with his grandchildren.       Khorram has been married to his wife Toby for 54 years. He      acknowledges her sacrifices and support that have allowed him      to be a doctor. Together they have two children.                          ____________________
