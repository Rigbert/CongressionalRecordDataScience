 President, yesterday, I spoke on S. 2285. I now ask unanimous consent that an ARCO letter concerning gas prices be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                         ARCO,                                   Los Angeles, CA, April 5, 2000.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: Thank you for your phone call on      Friday, March 31, regarding gasoline prices in California.      During that conversation, you inquired regarding the status      of ARCO's gasoline inventory. I have outlined below some      statistics that were not available to me when we talked.       Currently, ARCO's inventory of CARB gasoline is at our      operating target. Total industry gasoline inventories on the      West Coast appear to be recovering. The last weekly West      Coast gasoline inventory report showed an increase of 1.5      million barrels over the previous week, which was the low      point of the year.       With respect to the issue of gasoline prices, no one can      predict the future. However, crude oil prices have been      coming down over the last few weeks as a result of the recent      OPEC meeting. Spot prices also appear to have peaked. Barring      some unforeseen circumstances, we can assume that retail      gasoline prices will follow suit.       I hope you find this information helpful.           Sincerely,                                                  Mike Bowlin,                                                      Chairman and                                          Chief Executive Officer.
