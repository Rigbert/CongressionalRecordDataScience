Might be good if you are a multinational corporation and looking for cheap labor elsewhere and looking for ways to profit. But not to further the future and the economic prosperity of our own Nation.  The administration is very proud they finally struck a deal on the Mexico bailout. Great deal: $20 billion, $20 billion up front from the United States of America. Mr. Kantor, the special trade representative, is downright proud that we were able to get this deal. And it is a really bad deal for people on both sides of the border, it is an incredibly bad deal for the people of Mexico. It is expected that it will cause a recession in Mexico, it will drive interest rates up to 50 percent in Mexico, it will cause businesses to fold in Mexico because most of them have adjustable loans so their rates are going up dramatically and quickly.  Banks will fold in Mexico. And wages are now at 40 percent of the level of 1980, despite the increases in productivity.  Well, maybe it is a good deal on our side of the border and that is why he is so happy. Well, maybe not.  First off, $20 billion at least. We do not know how much money the Federal Reserve has secretly shipped to Mexico, how much we are involved in the funds coming from the international institutions.  But it is a lot of money. And money that could have been spent productively here at home.  But beyond that we have some analysis now, analysis by DRI McGraw Hill, a private consulting firm in Lexington, Massachusetts. It says that U.S. exports to Mexico will drop by $10 billion this year, leading to a loss of 350,000 U.S. jobs. So we are going to pay $20 billion of our taxpayers' money to ship 350,000 family-wage jobs to Mexico. Now that is a great policy.  But they tell us do not worry, it is all short term, it all will get better. In fact, Chase Manhattan has a memo and it says quite frankly they can fix the problems down there in Mexico, they just have to do a couple of things. The government will need to eliminate the zapatistas to demonstrate their effective control of the national territory and of security policy, if they want to encourage further investment in Mexico.                              {time}  2210  It seems Chase Manhattan is pretty upset that they wagered--and that is what this is about--wagered a huge amount of money in Mexico trying to get obscene rates of return. Now they are upset that the junk bonds they bought have turned truly to junk and are worthless.  These are policies that are not in the long-term interests of the United States of America, nor the people of Mexico. It is time that we began to get straight about our trade policy in this country.  I introduced legislation earlier this year to repeal the benighted NAFTA Agreement, and at the time people thought, ``Well, that is a pretty far-out thing.'' I would say, given the events since then, given the massive bailout, given the huge loss of jobs we now admit we are going to suffer into the indefinite future, is it not time to revisit that agreement?  It is not good for people on either side of the border. It causes tremendous harm.  Let us rip it up and start over again.                          ____________________
