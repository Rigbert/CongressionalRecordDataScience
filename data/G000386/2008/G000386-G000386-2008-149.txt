  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: [From American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, Feb.                                11, 2008]            How George Bush, Big Spender, Destroyed Nirvana                         (By Kevin A. Hassett)       If you could go back in time to President George W. Bush's      inaugural address and add one economic statement, what would      it be? For me, there is an obvious answer.       If Bush had promised in January 2001 that the baseline of      government spending that he inherited when he took office      would be the cap during his term, then we would have a big      budget surplus today. It would have been easy to do. He just      had to say: ``I will not spend one penny more than President      Bill Clinton planned to. I will veto any bill that tries      to.''       I have written before in this space that Bush has outspent      Clinton by a mile. With government spending still out of      control, the gap between where we are and where a disciplined      nation could have been is getting bigger and bigger.       With a recession looming, the policy implications of the      spending explosion are serious. If a deep recession occurs,      we will have less wiggle room.       To see how different the world could have been, I gathered      data from a number of sources and ran an alternative history.      In that wishful place, government spending was set equal to      the spending envisioned by the Congressional Budget Office in      the January 2001 long-run forecast, plus the spending for the      war in Iraq and to fight terrorism. This simulation assumes      that the war would have happened in spite of Bush's spending      promise, and wouldn't have induced him to seek cuts      elsewhere.       The difference between that spending path and the one we      are on is huge. Today, we expect federal spending in 2008      will be $2.9 trillion. According to the alternative history,      spending would be $2.5 trillion.                            Surplus Fantasy       With spending at the lower level, we would have a surplus      of $152 billion if revenue were equal to what it is currently      projected to be.       Running the simulation forward, the gap between revenue      gets wider and wider. By 2017, we are scheduled to spend      almost $1 trillion more than we would have if we had stuck to      the Clinton baseline. With the low spending baseline we would      have a surplus in 2017 of $1.1 trillion, instead of the $151      billion surplus that's currently forecast.       Think of it this way. If we now had the lower spending      levels that Bush inherited, we could extend his tax cuts,      repeal the alternative minimum tax, enact the current      stimulus package, and still have a 10-year budget surplus of      $1.9 trillion. And, remember, that allows spending to be      adjusted up for the Iraq war and the war against terrorists.       Many observers might say this scenario is unrealistic. The      2001 long-run forecast covered both discretionary and      mandatory spending. No administration, the argument might go,      could have held the line on the growth of Medicare and Social      Security spending.                             Hold the Line       There are two responses to that.       First, a president could always demand that spending be      capped and that discretionary spending be reduced to offset      unexpected increases in mandatory outlays. Social Security      might be the third rail of American politics, but it might      not be.       It has been changed before. Why couldn't it be changed      again? Families do that all the time. If Johnny needs braces,      then you take fewer trips to the restaurant.       The second response is perhaps more powerful. Let's see      what happens when we allow mandatory spending to go up as it      did. This lets Bush have his prescription-drug benefit, which      is now part of mandatory spending.       If we had held the line on everything else that is      discretionary, we could have had the prescription-drug plan,      the Iraq war and the war against terrorists. We could have      kept all the Bush tax cuts, made them permanent, repealed the      AMT and added the stimulus package and still ended up with a      balanced budget from 2008 to 2017.                             Bloated Uncle       It makes you sick to think about it. All that money wasted      on ethanol and bridges to nowhere has accumulated into a pile      that massive. Uncle Sam ate a whopping helping of apple pie      every day for seven years, and now he is obese.       This is important to bear in mind as we move forward to the      general election. We don't have a deficit because of Iraq, or      the tax cuts, or the drug benefit. We have a deficit because      the government grew fat. We can't fix that with tax      increases. Uncle Sam must go on a diet.       A simple way to start would be this: Whoever is elected      president this November should pledge that he or she won't      spend $1 more than we currently plan to. If Bush had done      that seven years ago, we would be in a different world.
