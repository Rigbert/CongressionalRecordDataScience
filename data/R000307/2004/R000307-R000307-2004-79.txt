President, I fully agree with the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and I am very proud to serve on that committee, as well as privileged being the chairman of the Intelligence Committee.  We discussed this at great length. All members of these committees discussed it at great length. We have a responsibility to the American people tofully investigate this and to publicly, when we can, when we are not dealing with any classified information, tell the American people what they should know and have a right to know. We are proceeding in that fashion. We are taking this very seriously, which is why I am trying to summarize now for the Senate and for all those who may be interested in this issue precisely what we have done to date in regard to the Intelligence Committee.  The Senator is exactly right, he has taken the lead in the Armed Services Committee with the appropriate people within the military, and I thank him for his contribution.
