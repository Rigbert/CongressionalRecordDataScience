Meanwhile, the very bill that this issue is in is stalled. We passed it weeks ago, months ago here in the House; and it went over to the Senate. The leadership of this institution could bring that bill up here so we could vote on this whole prescription drug issue andwhether our people can bring these pharmaceuticals in from other countries like Canada if they are safe and of similar quality. Where is the bill? Even the conferees, the people here in the House who are supposed to sit down with the Members of the Senate to go over this provision, have not been appointed, even though the bill was passed here and it has been passed there. We have got plenty of time today. We have got all day tomorrow. We should have done it weeks ago. We wasted yesterday; we wasted the day before yesterday. I just wanted to affirm what the gentleman is saying and as ranking member on the subcommittee that has jurisdiction over the Food and Drug Administration, we are waiting. We are waiting for this Republican leadership to do its work.
