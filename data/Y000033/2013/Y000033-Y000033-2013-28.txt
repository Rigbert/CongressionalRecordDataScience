Mr. Speaker, my fellow colleagues, this is an important piece of legislation. When you vote against this legislation, you are voting against the first Americans. Every one of you in this room is an immigrant. We made a trust relationship with American Indians to take care of them, provide for them, and a trust relationship we should fulfill.  You say this won't go anywhere. Very frankly, we should have done this a long time ago. We should set up a system because of the trust system that they are front-end loaded for their health care primarily. We have a system now that does not work. They have to hold their hand out and beg; and a lot of you on that side, all of you will say, Don't say too much. Take your blanket and your half a beef and go home and be quiet. No other minority would be treated that way. This health system has to be fixed. We have an opportunity to fix it now. We should fix it now.  When people stand up and say, I support the American Indian, the first Americans, you are not really supporting them. You are paying lip service. You are paying lip service. That is all you have been doing for all these years ever since Columbus landed on these shores. And you broke treaty after treaty after treaty, both sides of the aisle. I have been under eight Presidents, and they pay lip service. They pay lip service.  The President will have a big first American conference, the fifth one, and all they do is tell them again is, Be quiet. Take your blanket and half a beef and go home.  For those who talk about the minority, this is the first minority. Yes, I get a little emotional about this because I have 10 American Native grandchildren. I have two beautiful American Native children that have given me those 10 grandchildren, and I had a wife that was, in fact, one of the first Americans, and I am proud to be associated with that. We should vote ``yes'' on this bill.
