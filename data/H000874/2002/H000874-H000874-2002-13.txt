All of us appreciate your service, that is clear. I think you are emblematic of the fine service that is given by those of you who do not get to speak on this floor, those of you whose names do not scroll across the screen, those of you who work anonymously but so effectively on behalf of the American public. Terry, I wanted to add my thanks and the thanks of all the Members of this side of the aisle, along with Tom on behalf of all the Members on that side of the aisle, because you work not in a partisan sense but you work for this institution to ensure that the people's House functions as the people would like. As Tom Davis said, we will miss you. You have served your country well. God bless you.                          ____________________
