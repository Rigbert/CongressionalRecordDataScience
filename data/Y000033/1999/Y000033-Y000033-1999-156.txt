Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I would just like to remind the gentleman from California (Mr. Farr), who just spoke, who is a dear friend of mine, that the landowner in Yellowstone did not request that participation in the World Heritage Program. In fact, she opposed it and unfortunately she was not listened to.  In our hearings in New York, we had people that came to the committee and said that, yes, the Federal Government was trying to implement Heritage sites in their districts and they adamantly opposed it. It is happening right today in Lake Champlain.  So what I am just suggesting is as much as I admire the sincerity of the gentleman, I would like to have him look at some of the records.  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Hansen).  (
