Speaker, I join today with my colleagues, Congressmen Jerry Lewis, Duncan Hunter and David Dreier, to pay tribute to a most wonderful person, former Member of Congress, friend and great American--Victor ``Vic'' V. Veysey--who passed away at 85 last month.  Calvin Coolidge, America's 13th President, once said, ``No person was ever honored for what he received; honor has been the reward for what he gave.'' and Vic Veysey gave much during his years of public service and teaching.  A member of the House of Representatives from 1971 to 1975, Vic Veysey made a great impact in a short amount of time upon the Imperial Valley, California and the nation. In fact, I attribute an internship in his Washington, D.C. office for piquing my own interest in politics. It was 1973, during Vic Veysey's second term and the Senate Watergate hearings. It was an incredible time in American politics. More impressive, though, was how Vic ran his congressional office: he took time to understand his constituents, and their problems, and to do his homework, learning the issues and knowing how the issues would affect his constituents.  He is probably best known for his lifelong commitment to education, youth and democracy. Veysey graduated from Caltech in 1936 with a Bachelor of Arts in Civil Engineering and from the University of Harvard Business School in 1938 with a MBA in Industrial Management. The next natural course was to teach, which Vic did for 11 years at Caltech and Stanford. At Caltech, he worked on different rocket projects during World War II and aspects of the atomic bomb, Project Camel.  Vic Veysey then returned to his roots and began his political career--running and winning a seat on the Brawley School Board, where he was instrumental and a founding trustee in establishing the Imperial Valley College. In 1962, Vic was elected to the California State Assembly, where he served four terms (1962-1971). My colleague, Mr. Lewis of California had the honor to work with Vic Veysey during his assembly days, before they were both elected to the U.S. House of Representatives.  After leaving Congress, Vic Veysey served as assistant secretary of the Army during the Ford Administration. His love of education remained, however, and he returned to California to assume the directorship of Caltech's Industrial Relations Center, becoming a director emeritus for the Industrial Relations Departent upon his retirement.  Vic is survived by his wife of 60 years, Janet, three sons, a daughter, nine grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.  Mr. Speaker, looking back at Vic's life, we see a life dedicated to public service and education. An American whose gifts to the Imperial Valley and California led to the betterment of those who had the privilege to come in contact or work with Vic. Honoring his memory is the least that we can do today for all that he gave over his 85 years of life.                          ____________________
