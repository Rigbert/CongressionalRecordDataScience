 President, I do not know if you know anyone who has climbed to the top of Mount Everest, but I am told it is quite an undertaking. It apparently took Sir Edmund Hillary several weeks to do it back in the 1950s. I am told my friends across the aisle could have scaled Everest almost 300 times in the nearly 4 yearsthat have gone by since they last passed a budget.
