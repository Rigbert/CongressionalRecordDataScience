 President, I want to thank the subcommittee for its hard and diligent work on this bill. In particular, I appreciate the earmark of $500,000 for the Coordinated Tribal Water Quality Program for fiscal year 1997.  This program began in 1990 when the 26 tribes and tribal organizations in Washington State came together with a cooperative intergovernmental strategy to accomplish national clean water goals. As a result of Federal court decisions, the State of Washington has recognized the tribes as comanagers of water quality in the State. This program has been an effective tool for leveraging scarce public funds to create viable, watershed-based water quality protection plans.  It is my understanding that the $500,000 earmark in the committee report is not intended to preclude the Coordinated Tribal Water Quality Program from receiving the needed additional $2 million from the Environmental Protection Agency's existing funds under section 104(b)3 of the Clean Water Act.
