President, I have come to the Chamber this morning to address an issue, which is familiar to many Americans but one on which they may not know the details, the important life-or-death information.  Yesterday, a Federal court in Birmingham, AL, found for four plaintiffs and against a company known as Metabolife International of San Diego and awarded the four plaintiffs $4.1 million for strokes, heart attacks suffered by the plaintiffs as a result of ephedra diet pills. These diet pills and Metabolife are pretty well known across America. You can hardly go into a drugstore, gas station or a convenience store and not run into this little familiar container, Metabolife 356, ``an herbal formula to enhance your diet and provide energy.'' Unfortunately, this apparently innocent looking product has caused a great deal of physical injury and death.  I received today from my State of Illinois, near my hometown of Springfield, a report from the Logan County coroner, Chuck Fricke, a report on the sad death of a young man named Sean Riggins, a 16-year-old who died on September 3 of this year. Sean Riggins was the picture of health, a high school football player and wrestler. He was the apple of his parents' eye. He wasjust an all-around good kid. But he wanted to get ready for the game, and he wanted to be prepared. He wanted to do his best.  Someone told Sean Riggins that one of the best ways to be a better athlete was to go down to the local convenience store or the local gas station and buy a product known as Yellow Jacket--I hold it in my hand, an herbal dietary supplement for extreme energy--so he would be ready for the big game. He took that herbal supplement called Yellow Jacket that contained the same ephedra as Metabolife's product. His heart started racing, and he died.  The coroner did an autopsy, which I will ask be included in the Record. He said he was an otherwise very healthy young man, just a young boy, 16 years old, healthy, an athlete. He took this herbal supplement, and he died.  Let's just pause a moment to raise some questions many Americans may not even consider. When you go into a drugstore, or any store, and you see for sale an over-the-counter drug or something like an herbal dietary supplement, do you assume that the Federal Government has investigated this drug, that they have taken a look at it to decide whether it is safe and effective as advertised? Most people would assume that.  Frankly, throughout history--at least for since 1938--we have created standards in America where the Food and Drug Administration basically requires companies that want to sell drugs over the counter or by prescription to prove that the drugs are safe and to prove that they are effective. If you can't prove that in clinical trials, you can't sell that drug in America.  That is pretty simple. It is something we take for granted, but it is something we should not take for granted.  In 1994, Congress passed the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, which changed the law when it came to certain products. It said when it came to dietary supplements, nutritional supplements, they did not have to meet that same test of safety and efficacy before going to market. Instead, they could claim what they wanted to. They could put the product on the market, and the law was rather unclear as to what obligation they had beyond that.  Frankly, the Food and Drug Administration and the Government of the United States have failed American families, have failed American consumers when it comes to nutrition supplements and dietary supplements because, as we have found with these supplements containing ephedra, deadly combinations of chemicals are being sold to children and to unsuspecting adults across America without any Government intervention.  Rarely does our Government step in. The Federal Trade Commission will step in when they believe the advertised claims for some of the products are not true. They will bring an action. Occasionally, the Food and Drug Administration, when prodded by Congress, will go after the manufacturer of these Yellow Jacket because they are marketed as ``an alternative street drug.'' But when it comes to the basic responsibility of our Government to American consumers, the system fails for ordinary consumers. We expect consumers to be a chemist, to have a degree in biology, to understand the impact of a drug on their body, because we are not going to take on that responsibility for them as a government to make sure only safe products are sold.  In this case, when it comes to dietary supplements and nutritional supplements, our Government is absent without leave. We are in a situation where people across America, unsuspecting, believe they are helping themselves to reduce their weight, to avoid obesity, to be healthier individuals by taking dietary supplements which are, in stead, dangerous to their health.  Let me make one thing very clear: I got up this morning and took my vitamin. I do that every day. I don't believe I should have a prescription or need one to fill a vitamin. That is a basic choice I have made. A multivitamin, vitamin C--whatever it happens to be--that is my decision. And it should be. But when it comes to these combinations of drugs and dietary supplements, we are talking about something more complicated and more potentially dangerous than vitamin C or a multivitamin. We are talking about a combination of chemicals being sold to the American people which is dangerous and can possibly kill.  How can I say that these are dangerous? Because these ephedra compounds contain caffeine and other stimulants. Why is that important? Because ephedra, in and of itself, gets your body moving faster and your heart pumping, and caffeine does the same thing. Sean Riggins died because of that--a 16-year-old boy died because he took this Yellow Jacket pill and washed it down with Mountain Dew, a soft drink containing caffeine. Put all that together, and this poor young man's life was snuffed out by a product that was sold over the counter.  Incidentally, are there warning labels on the Yellow Jackets for those high school kids who want to consider the danger that might be associated with taking these pills? Yes. You have to strip the label off the bottle, and you will find it written in faded print on the back. I am sure that 15- and 16-year-old kids are not stopping to read this fine print to decide whether or not it is a danger.  Just this last week, I drove from Chicago to Springfield. I stopped at a gasoline station halfway to fill up in Pontiac. I went in and, lo and behold, Yellow Jackets were for sale right there in front. And you don't have to buy a big bottle. You can buy them for a buck and a half and get three or four of them.  I went to a junior high school in my hometown of Springfield, and I asked the students there: Has anybody ever heard of Yellow Jackets, ephedra? Yes. Over half the kids did. These were eighth graders.  So I would say to parents across America who think, as I do, that drugs are a serious problem, here is a drug for sale that can kill your son or daughter. They know about it, and you don't.  We know now that it is dangerous. We have to do something about it.  Let me tell you what I have done. I have had two hearings as chairman of the Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management to look into this particular issue. To my knowledge, it is the first public hearing held on so-called dietary supplements and nutrition supplements since it was passed. The information which came out is startling. Take a look at this chart. Ephedra is far more deadly and dangerous than most dietary supplements. Of all the adverse events reported to FDA for dietary supplements, 60 percent of the deaths were for ephedra products; 81 percent of the strokes were for ephedra products; 68 percent of the myocardial infarctions, heart attacks were for ephedra products. These are serious consequences from an over-the-counter drug unregulated by the Government, such as Metabolife.  Dietary supplements adverse events are disproportionately for ephedra. Ephedra adverse events occur when people get sick after taking one of these supplements and they call the company and say: What happened? There is something wrong here.  Look at this. In terms of the percentage that are directly related to ephedra, over 40 percent in the year 2001. Then we asked the company. First Metabolife said: We really haven't received many adverse events that are worth noting. And then we started pushing them a little harder, saying we want to get all the information, to find out what they have received. Because of a case filed in court, they disclosed over 14,000 adverse event reports--something they kind of overlooked. Yesterday, they said, yes, we skipped another 1,400 or 1,500 or so. We will send those to you as well. What do we find in the adverse reports on Metabolife and other companies that are being gathered on ephedra?  Here I have an example of one of their adverse event reports. It looks like a doodle pad. This is not a formal report, where you would note that a product for sale in America has caused adverse events, serious health problems for American citizens. If you go through this whole thing that was disclosed by Metabolife, at the bottom it says ``mild stroke.'' This person said: I took your pill and had a mild stroke. What is wrong with your product?  They are not even disclosing these things until they are forced to go tocourt. Here we have a 25-year-old person who had a stroke as a result of taking ephedra diet supplements. The information is very clear. That information was so compelling that this court yesterday in Alabama did what our Federal Government hasn't done. This court in Alabama, and a jury, listened to the evidence on these dietary supplements and said that this company is guilty of selling a dangerous product, endangering the lives of individuals, and entered a verdict of $4 million against Metabolife.  There are people on the floor--you will hear this for the next several months--who will argue we should be closing the courthouse doors to this type of lawsuit, that we should not allow people to go to court to recover against companies that are literally endangering their lives. They will talk about plaintiff trial lawyers, and contingency fees, and so forth. But the fact is, were it not for the court system and the attorneys going into court representing people like these four in Alabama, nothing would be done to stop these companies like Metabolife from selling deadly products.  Something else you might find interesting. The two-week trial, according to this press report, was notable for one bizarre twist--Metabolife's president and cofounder, Michael Ellis, refused to have his deposition taken or to answer questions posed by the plaintiff's attorneys, asserting his fifth amendment right. The judge allowed the plaintiff's attorneys to question an empty chair. The attorneys asked question after damaging question to which the judge replied on Ellis' behalf that Ellis, president of Metabolife, was asserting his fifth amendment right not to incriminate himself.  According to the attorney, it made a damning impression. The guy didn't even have the gumption to defend his product and he took the fifth on the safety of the product. What product? This one, Metabolife 356, which you can find for sale all over America.  Now, what we have to do is acknowledge there is a Government responsibility here with the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as the FDA. I contacted Secretary Tommy Thompson after these hearings and after it became clear these dangerous products are being sold across America, endangering the lives of children and unsuspecting people all across America, and that the Federal Government and the FDA failed miserably in their responsibility to protect American consumers.  I wrote Secretary Thompson on August 6 and I said to him in the opening sentence:       The danger associated with dietary supplements containing      ephedra has become well documented. I believe our Government      has a special responsibility to make an immediate      determination on whether they pose a hazard to the American      consumers. It is within your authority to take the step and      suspend the sales of these supplements until their safety is      clearly and scientifically established.  I have spoken to Secretary Thompson about this on three separate occasions. We have exchanged correspondence. I have been in contact with people in his agency and in the FDA, and I stand to report today that nothing has been done, short of raiding the offices of the company that makes Yellow Jackets, to find out if they violated the law. The Secretary and FDA have refused to acknowledge the danger of this product, refused to take action to protect American consumers. I am calling on Secretary Thompson today, and I will continue to call on him to take the action necessary to protect American consumers. There is absolutely no other recourse we can consider.  Is this a radical suggestion, that we would ban the sale of products containing ephedra? No, it is not. Let me be more specific. On January 9 of this year, Canada--the Canadian health authority, known as Health Canada--banned the sale of many of these products in Canada. Why? When we elicited testimony from them, from the consumer group in Canada, they said the evidence was compelling and overwhelming that these drugs, when sold as nutrition supplements, were killing Canadian citizens. So in January they banned the sale of the product, like Metabolife, in Canada.  Within weeks, the American Medical Association sent an appeal to the FDA to do exactly the same thing in the United States--ban the sale of these products to protect Americans. But nothing has been done.  Let me tell you something else that is curious. I don't know that this has ever happened in the history of this country. Over 20 different States have enacted their own State laws restricting the sale of products containing ephedra.  Think about that for a second. It is usually the Federal Government that shows the leadership when it comes to protecting people against dangerous drugs and substances sold. In this case, exactly the opposite is the case; the States have seen the adverse consequences, the States understand the danger, and the States are moving ahead of the Federal Government. How bad is this, that our States are leading when it comes to national health standards, and the Federal Government is silent? And why?  I think there are two reasons. First, this industry--the dietary supplementary industry--is a big political player. When I called for this hearing on ephedra products, and particularly Metabolife, to investigate these adverse event reports and the cases that were showing up in court, I will tell you this: In 20 years of service on Capitol Hill, I have never faced more political pressure in my life. I have taken on the big tobacco companies and other pretty big players. On this one, all of a sudden, my colleagues were saying: Dick, are you sure you want to have a hearing about Metabolife? Do you realize what a big political player they are and this industry is? Do you realize how good they have been to our party? Do you realize this person and that person is associated with them?  I thought to myself, what in the world have I gotten into here? What I thought was a common investigation has become a big political deal. I went ahead with it, and I am glad I did. Frankly, the evidence that came out of there was overwhelming.  Do you know that in exchanges at military bases across America, the Armed Services have banned the sale of these same products that are being sold in convenience stores, gas stations, and drugstores across America to children and unsuspecting people? There is a ban on military bases because they know that service men and women using them for energy, or to lose weight, have had terrible health consequences.  The evidence continues to mount. Incidentally, these are the same products that have been banned by major sports organizations. Athletes cannot take these products containing ephedra, legally, if they want to participate in the Olympics, or professional football or collegiate athletics.  So you have the accumulated evidence about the danger of this product, and our Government fails to act. Why? It is because of the political clout of this industry and, secondly, the bureaucracy. The bureaucracy in this town moves so slowly that, frankly, the American people should stand up and object in the most strenuous terms. To think we have waited some 8 years for regulations to come out of the FDA about dietary and nutritional supplements. To think that the people who want to sell Metabolife, or want to sell these Yellow Jackets, can put ingredients on the back of these bottles that, frankly, don't mean a thing to anybody--even a chemist, unless you are really into herbal medicine. Cola nut extract? What will that do? I guess it is loaded with caffeine, which with ephedra, is going to cause danger. And here is ginseng, so forth and so on. You can read these and you might say the average consumer would not have a clue as to what they are putting into their body.  Did I mention that in 1983 the FDA banned the sale of any combination of ephedrine and caffeine? You cannot buy an over-the-counter drug legally that contains ephedrine and caffeine. That has been the case for 19 years.  But do not worry you can still go out to the gas station and buy them as a dietary supplement such as Yellow Jackets or Metabolife. They have it all in there. How is that possible? We ban the sale of the product in drug stores, and yet we let it be sold to children in gas stations as dietary supplements. And that is a fact.  If you take a look at the number of organizations that have banned this, not just Canada, and not just the recommendation of the American MedicalAssociation, and not just over 20 States that have restricted its sales, but major sports organizations, you come to the inescapable conclusion that this is a dangerous product, and yet it is sold to Americans. The Food and Drug Administration sits on its hands doing very little.  What is at issue, I am afraid, is now a growing philosophy that we hear from this administration of ``let the market work this out.'' The market worked it out for Sean Riggins, a 16-year-old high school football player, who lost his life because the marketplace would not restrict the sale of the product.  Recently, I attended a high school reunion. I will not put on the record which one it was, but believe me, I am getting up there. I ran into a friend of mine who sells products in gas stations in California. I talked to him about these Yellow Jackets and ephedra. He said that is the biggest moneymaker in gas stations. It has a 100-percent markup.  He said: There is nothing else I sell in the gas station that is as profitable as these Yellow Jackets. There is nothing like it. This is a big winner. That is why we put it at the cash register.  I said: Are you worried about the impact this will have on kids?  He said: If this was dangerous, the Government would take it off the market.  We know it is dangerous, and this Government, under the Clinton administration, as well as under the Bush administration, has failed to take the necessary action to regulate the sale of this product to make certain this product is safe and effective for American consumers and if unsafe to take it off the market.  I call on Secretary Thompson today--and I will continue to--to take action to protect Americans. Do not allow another boy to die in another town in America. Do not let some unsuspecting 12, 13, 14 or 15-year-old lose his or her life because we failed to act, because we are cowered by the political muscle of groups like Metabolife because we are afraid we would somehow be meddling in the marketplace if we came in and told the consumers the truth about the danger of this drug and the fact it is not safe.  It is time for Secretary Thompson and the Food and Drug Administration to accept their responsibility. To do less is to endanger the lives of unsuspecting Americans. I call on those who are in the business of running drugstores, gas stations, and convenience stores to have a conscience. Take these products from the front of the cash register and at least put them on the back counter, if not take them out completely. Make certain that kids cannot get their hands on them and misuse them; so they cannot get a buzz on them with the beer they managed to get their hands on or a caffeinated soda or cannot take them before a football game and end up dead like this poor young man in Lincoln, IL.  This is, I believe, a moral imperative. I am hopeful that those across America who understand how valuable the lives of our children are and how important it is for our Government to stand up and protect American citizens will do something and do it quickly.  I ask unanimous consent that the material to which I referred be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         Logan County Coroner,                                     Lincoln, IL, October 9, 2002.     Hon. Richard Durbin,     Dirkson Senate Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Durbin: It is with great pleasure and honor to      have testified on the ill effects of Ephedrine, Yellow      Jackets and their related cousins on October 8 at your      committee hearing.       Your knowledge and presentation allowed the Riggins and      myself to be more at ease, if that is possible, in telling      Sean's story. Your genuine concern for your constituents      championing a just cause even before our tragedy was very      apparent.       After landing in Bloomington, Illinois we were made aware      of the FDA's move on NVE by Peoria's Channel 31, and the      Bloomington Pantagraph. We can only hope our message is      received by parents, students, teammates, and the general      public before another individual is stricken.       Your staff of Anne Marie Murphy, Joe Shoemaker, Brian and      Erica were extremely helpful, courteous and professional. We      can't thank you enough.       We held Sean's inquest at 3:00 p.m. today in Lincoln.       We will be ever vigilant on this cause. Please feel free to      contact us if you ever need further statements.           Sincerely,     Charles W. Fricke,                                             Logan County Coroner.     Kevin and Debra Riggins.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln). The Senator from Alabama.
