 Gerald Donovan comes from a long line of public servants and the importance of serving one's community was instilled in him at a young age. His grandfather, Wesley Stinnett was mayor of Chesapeake Beach from 1956 to 1963. After his grandfather passed away, Donovan's father served out his term. In 1976, Gerald was elected to the town council and, after 7 years of service, Donovan followed in the footsteps of his father and grandfather and became mayor in 1983.  Under Mayor Donovan's leadership, Chesapeake Beach has thrived--becoming a vibrant small town that has witnessed an improved quality of life and an increased sense of community. Mayor Donovan has worked to make the small town a great place to stay and visit. His tenure has seen the addition of a water park, beach trolleys, new housing, and a beautification initiative, all of which have won him grateful neighbors and constituents. New development has been matched with an updated infrastructure with everything from a boardwalk and new sidewalks to a new, clean wastewater treatment system.  Given the town's location on the Chesapeake Bay, it is unfortunately often in the path of potentially destructive weather events. In recent years it has been impacted by several hurricanes and a tornado. In every case, Mayor Donovan has stood ready to tackle cleanup and lend a hand to neighbors and businesses touched by disaster.  Mayor Donovan has managed to carry through initiatives that have a tangible positive effect on the daily lives of his constituents, raising overall revenue for the town. He has demonstrated what is possible with ingenuity, managing to leave a town surplus of over 50 percent of the town's overall annual budget.  Despite announcing his retirement, Mayor Donovan continues to look to the future, recently announcing that he is moving forward in an attempt to remove Chesapeake Beach from dependence on the grid and tap into wind and solar power as renewable, money-saving energy sources for the town.  Madam Speaker, Gerald Donovan's service to the Chesapeake Beach community goes beyond his duties as its mayor. He also contributed to the development of Chesapeake Beach through charity and enterprise.  With his brother Fred, Mayor Donovan co-owns the Rod 'N' Reel Restaurant, a popular meeting place and a great place to have a seafood dinner. For over 25 years, the restaurant has hosted the Celebration of Life Cancer Gala, an event created to honor the life of Gerald's father. The annual gala attracts an average of 1,500 people, raises more money for the American Cancer Society than any other event in all the State of Maryland. Not only that, but in his true devotion to the State, 60 percent of the funds raised goes to support research initiatives taking place in Maryland.  Madam Speaker, Mayor Gerald Donovan has made a tremendous mark on the community of Chesapeake Beach and the State of Maryland. I ask my colleagues to join me in applauding him on his many accomplishments and wishing him the best as he ends his career as an elected official.                          ____________________
