 President, bankruptcy reform will happen. Our cause is right and just, and average Americans are strongly supportive of restoring fairness to the bankruptcy system.  I am going to yield the floor now. Before I do, I thank Senator Biden, who is next to speak on this subject. If it had not been for Senator Biden working with us in a bipartisan way to get bankruptcy reform, it would never have passed by the wide margin of 84-13. He is a sincere person working on this. He has contributed immensely to it.  I yield the floor.
