Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, my amendment provides a transition period to scale the program back slightly, making it more effective. We keep the level of current employees, 120, constant for the first year, and have a gradual reduction in the years following.  If the gentleman has modified his amendment by changing the word ``first'' to ``third,'' which would allow the bill to take effect before the report is issued, then I would accept his amendment.
