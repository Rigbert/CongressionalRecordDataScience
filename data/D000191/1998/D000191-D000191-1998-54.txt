Chairman, reclaiming my time, I have tremendous respect for the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Yates). I think the problem that we are having here, to address his concerns, is between some of us on the authorizing committee who have held hearings on the Forest Service budgeting and accounting practices and feel that money is being moved around in ways that are not accountable and being spent in ways that are not provided for under law; that we are not getting the full bang for the buck of the K-V Fund's investment on the ground in environmental restoration because it is being diverted on overhead that is not just legitimately overhead for the K-V program.  Certainly, there is legitimate overhead for the program. But other more general overhead purposes of the Forest Service, which I would agree, since the Forest Service, as I said earlier, is not getting enough funds in many other programs.                              {time}  1800  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. Pease). The time of the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) has expired.  (By unanimous consent, Mr. DeFazio was allowed to proceed for 2 additional minutes.)  Mr. DeFAZIO. So I would say to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Yates) that I think we have some essential grounds for agreement, but the problem is I see the Forest Service doing things like the argument over purchaser road credits last year. I could come to the floor and list project after project they were doing purchaser roads credits, which truthfully had little to do with the timber sales that they were conducting, but they were meritorious recreation, road, and environmental projects and restoration flood damage repair that they could not otherwise pay for.  So I think the bottom line we keep coming back to is there is not enough money to fulfill their missions, particularly their mission as it relates to the environment.
