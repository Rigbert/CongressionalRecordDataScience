 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m. on Thursday, September 29. I further ask that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time of the two leaders be reserved, and the Senate proceed to executive session and continue consideration of Calendar No. 317, John Roberts to be Chief Justice of the United States; provided further that the time until 10:30 be equally divided between the two leaders or their designees.
