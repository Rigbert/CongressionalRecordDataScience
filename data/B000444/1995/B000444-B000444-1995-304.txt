 We like that opportunity.  Lastly, the list from the cement manufacturers to the highway people, it seems like 100 years ago when I first got here in 1973 and was on the committee that the Senator is now the ranking member. Then every one of those interests were against anything that had to do with transportation other than highway. They always will, they always were, they always will be, and they always have. They were [[Page S 8771]] against the ISTEA provision that is related to transportation other than highways. They are against anything that does not lay cement, macadam, or concrete. It is real simple. Do not blame them. It is all there, the naked self-interest which is the way this place runs. OK, but the idea that they are against this, they never have been for anything at all progressive that related to any mode of transportation other than laying concrete, so help me goodness.  I yield the 10 seconds I probably have left.
