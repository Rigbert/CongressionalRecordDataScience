These students, who are members of Marshwood's Advanced Placement U.S. Government and Politics class, earned first place for the Northeast Region during this competition that tested their knowledge of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. I am so proud of them as I know howhard they worked to achieve this ranking.  Under the direction of their dedicated and talented teacher, Mr. Matt Sanzone, the class spent the school year studying the history and principles of American democracy in preparation for the competition. Each student developed a broad understanding of the Constitution. The class also divided into smaller units to analyze in depth specific constitutional concepts.  The Marshwood team met its first challenge in March when it won the State-level competition and earned the right to represent Maine in the National Finals. Through simulated Congressional hearings, they demonstrated their knowledge of the Constitution before a panel of Maine Supreme Judicial Court justices, constitutional scholars, lawyers, and public officials.  The team's keen interest in our democracy serves as an example to other students in Maine and around the country. I know that these students will use the lessons they have learned in the classroom and in competition to guide them throughout their lives, to inspire others, and to be grateful for the rights and freedoms we enjoy as Americans. I congratulate these talented students from Maine on their extraordinary achievement.                          ____________________
