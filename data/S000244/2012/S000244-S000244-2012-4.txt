I would like to talk about a tax that was labeled a ``tax'' in the Affordable Care Act when it was passed in 2010.  The act amended Internal Revenue Code section 4980(d), and it imposed a tax of $100 per employee per day on any employer who did not follow any mandate of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. There was no conscience exemption, and there was no religious employer exemption; $100 per employee per day is $36,500 per year. That means that a parochial school with 50 employees has to pay a tax of $1,825,000 each year.  The only way to repeal this tax today is to pass this bill. If this bill is defeated and does not become law, we have put all religious employers out of business.
