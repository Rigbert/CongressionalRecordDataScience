 This is about the sanctity of the ballot and about the right of voters not to vote in an election if they choose. This amendment mandates a single voter error rate for all machines and all systems of voting.  Each State will be forced to calculate how many voter errors are allowed, divide that number by the number of precincts, and tell poll workers in those precincts how many errors each is allowed; all of this under threat of Department of Justice prosecution.  Those poll workers will closely monitor undervotes and overvotes, and when they approach their maximum allowable number, they will be forced to plead with voters to cast a vote or to change votes they have already made; all of this under threat of Department of Justice prosecution.  I say to my colleagues, especially the Senators from Oregon and Washington, if their home State uses paper ballots, mail-in ballots, or absentee ballots, this amendment will fundamentally alter, if not eliminate, those systems of voting. There is no way to control voter error unless one is face-to-face with the voter.  This is an amendment that essentially unravels this legislation. I strongly urge its defeat.
