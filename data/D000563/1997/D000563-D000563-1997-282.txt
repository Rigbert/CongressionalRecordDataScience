President, for more than 5 years now, the tobacco companies have said repeatedly, ``We do not want to sell our products to kids.'' They have bought full page ads in the Washington Post, the New York Times, and the Wall Street Journal, saying that they adamantly oppose the sale of tobacco to kids.  I don't know many kids who read the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, or the Washington Post. What the tobacco companies have been doing is creating a sham that they are serious about reducing sales to kids.  Let's take a look at the record. From 1991 to 1996, the percentage of children who use tobacco increased by almost 50 percent. This means that, at the same time the tobacco companies have been saying they are dedicated to reducing the illegal sales of tobacco to kids, more and more children have been buying the tobacco products those companies sell.  That is not an accident. This multi-billion dollar industry is made up of tobacco companies that design their marketing and advertising to lure new customers into this addiction. The fact that more and more children are smoking is clear evidence that the tobacco companies have failed, once again, to tell the truth. They need these new, young customers to prop up their profits as older customers die or quit using tobacco. And they continue to do what it takes to secure a new generation of young people who are becoming hooked on their products.  Today, I am introducing, along with Senator Frank Lautenberg and Congressman Henry Waxman, a new piece of legislation that says the only honest way to approach the reduction of tobacco sales to children is to make the tobacco companies put their profits on the line.  The NO Tobacco For Kids Act says we will do a survey of the tobacco products for sale and find out how many children are using those products and what brands they are using. Then, each year, we will update that survey to see which products continue to be purchased by children. Those companies that continue to sell their products to children will face a fine of $1 a pack on all their sales if they don't reduce the number of children using their brands in steps to reach a reduction of 90 percent over the next 6 years. Since current childhood users will cycle out of the underage population over that time, this measure will give the tobacco companies a chance to show whether they are serious about reducing the use of tobacco products by kids.  Unless the tobacco companies have their profits on the line, we will continue to get cheap talk from them about stopping sales to kids. This bill puts teeth into the campaign to stop selling tobacco products to children. It sets a very simple standard for the tobacco companies: stop selling cigarettes and spit tobacco to children, or pay the consequences.  In the past, every child hooked on tobacco was a new profit center for the tobacco industry. This legislation totally reverses the incentives for marketing to children. When this measure becomes law, every new child who picks up a cigarette or pockets a can of spit tobacco will become an economic loss to the company whose products the child chooses. With that reversal, the tobacco companies will have a strong economic incentive to stop marketing to children.  Mr. President, this legislation could be one the simplest yet most effective steps we can take to reduce teenage tobacco use. I invite my colleagues to cosponsor the NO Tobacco For Kids Act and help us put in place clear performance standards for the tobacco industry to stop selling their products to minors.  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of this bill and the text of the bill appear in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 828       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(b) Performance Standards for New Manufacturers.--Any      manufacturer of a tobacco product which begins to manufacture      a tobacco product after the date of the enactment of this Act      shall ensure that the number of children determined to have      used the manufacturer's tobacco products in each annual      performance survey conducted after the manufacturer begins to      manufacture tobacco products is equal to or less than the de      minimis level.       (c) De Minimis Level.--The de minimis level shall be 0.5      percent of the total number of children determined to have      used tobacco products in the first annual performance survey.     SEC. 4. NONCOMPLIANCE.       (a) First Violation.--If a manufacturer of a tobacco      product violates a performance standard, the manufacturer      shall pay a noncompliance fee of $1 for each unit of its      tobacco product which is distributed for consumer use in the      year following the year in which the performance standard is      violated.       (b) Fee Increase for Subsequent Violations.--If a      manufacturer violates the performance standards in 2 or more      consecutive years, the noncompliance fee for such      manufacturer shall be increased by $1 for each consecutive      violation for each unit of its tobacco product which is      distributed for consumer use.       (c) Reduction in Noncompliance Fee.--If a manufacturer      achieves more than 90 percent of the reduction in the number      of children who use its tobacco products that is required      under the applicable performance standard, the noncompliance      fee required to be paid by the manufacturer shall be reduced      on a pro rata basis such that there shall be a noncompliance      fee reduction of 10 percent for each percentage point over 90      percent achieved by the manufacturer.       (d) Payment.--The noncompliance fee to be paid by a      manufacturer shall be paid on a quarterly basis, with the      payments due within 30 days after the end of each calendar      quarter.     SEC. 5. USE OF NONCOMPLIANCE FEE.       (a) Funds for Enforcement and Education.--The first      $1,000,000,000 of noncompliance fees collected in any fiscal      year shall go into a Tobacco Enforcement and Education Fund      in the United States Treasury. Fees in such fund shall be      available to the Secretary, without fiscal year limitation,      to enforce this Act and other Federal laws relating to      tobacco use by children and for public education to      discourage children from using tobacco products.       (b) Funds for the Treasury.--Any amount of noncompliance      fees collected in any fiscal year which exceeds      $1,000,000,000 shall be paid into the United States Treasury.     SEC. 6. JUDICIAL REVIEW.       A manufacturer of tobacco products may seek judicial review      of any action under this Act only after a noncompliance fee      has been assessed and paid by the manufacturer and only in      the United States District Court for the District of      Columbia. In an action by a manufacturer seeking judicial      review of an annual performance survey, the manufacturer may      prevail--       (1) only if the manufacturer shows that the results of the      performance survey were arbitrary and capricious; and       (2) only to the extent that the manufacturer shows that it      would have been required to pay a lesser noncompliance fee if      the results of the performance survey were not arbitrary and      capricious.     SEC. 7. ENFORCEMENT.       Section 301 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (28      U.S.C. 331) is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``(x) The failure to pay any noncompliance fee required      under the NO Tobacco for Kids Act.''.     SEC. 8. PREEMPTION.       Nothing in this Act shall preempt or otherwise affect any      other Federal, State, or local law or regulation which      reduces the use of tobacco products by children.     SEC. 9.

(2) Cigarette.--The term ``cigarette'' has the same meaning      given such term by section 3(1) of the Federal Cigarette      Labeling and Advertising Act (15 U.S.C. 1332(1)).       (3) Cigarette tobacco.--The term ``cigarette tobacco''      means any product that consists of loose tobacco that      contains or delivers nicotine and is intended for use by      consumers in a cigarette.

(6) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary      of Health and Human Services.       (7) Smokeless tobacco.--The term ``smokeless tobacco'' has      the same meaning given such term by section 9(1) of the      Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Education Act of 1986 (15      U.S.C. 4408(1)).       (8) Tobacco product.--The term ``tobacco product'' means a      cigarette, cigarette tobacco, or smokeless tobacco.       (9) Unit.--The term ``unit'' when used in connection with a      tobacco product means 20 cigarettes in the case of cigarettes      and the smallest amount of tobacco distributed by a      manufacturer for consumer use in the case of any other      tobacco product.                                                                    ____               The NO Tobacco for Kids Act (NOT for Kids)       The NO Tobacco for Kids Act (NOT for Kids) will establish a      clear performance standard for the reduction of youth smoking      in America. For too many years, the tobacco companies have      claimed they oppose youth smoking and spit tobacco use while      continuing to hook new generations of kids on their deadly      products. This bill sets out a schedule to reduce actual      youth tobacco use and contains provisions that, for the first      time, will give individual tobacco companies an economic      incentive to stop marketing their products to children.      Specifically, the bill provides that:       Within 1 year after enactment, the Secretary of HHS will      conduct a survey to determine the number of children who used      each manufacturer's tobacco products within the previous 30      days.       Each manufacturer will then face penalties if it does not      reduce the number of children who use its tobacco products by      specified percentages from this baseline level over the      succeeding years. The performance standard for each      manufacturer is as follows: Year 1: no standard, baseline      survey is taken; year 2: 20-percent reduction from the      baseline; year 3: 40-percent reduction from the baseline;      year 4: 60-percent reduction from the baseline; year 5: 80-     percent reduction from the baseline; year 6: 90-percent      reduction from the baseline; and subsequent years: 90-percent      reduction from the baseline.       Manufacturers that reduce use to a de minimus level--one-     half percent of the current number of youth smokers--will be      deemed in compliance.       If a manufacturer violates the performance standard, that      manufacturer must pay a noncompliance fee of $1 per pack,      pouch, can, et cetera, on all of their tobacco sales in the      subsequent year--not just on sales to youth. If the      manufacturer violates the performance standard for 2 or more      consecutive years, the noncompliance fee is increased by $1      for each consecutive year of violation. A manufacturer who      comes within 10 percent of the required reduction for a      particular year will have its noncompliance fee reduced on a      pro rata basis.       The first $1 billion of noncompliance fees collected in any      fiscal year will go into a fund for enforcement and public      education to discourage children from using tobacco products.      Any additional fees will go to the Treasury for deficit      reduction.                                 ______                                       By
