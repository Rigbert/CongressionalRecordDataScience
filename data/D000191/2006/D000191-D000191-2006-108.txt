Salwasser, Dean Salwasser, Dr. Franklin, and Dr. Johnson.  That is the key here, is I believe that there is a reason, unlike some of the others, as the chairman pointed out, I did support the Healthy Forest Restoration Act. The Healthy Forest Restoration Act was used for much of the post-Katrina recovery with little or no controversy, and I believe that these tools can be valuable. But we also have to relate back to the forests themselves.  As the experts said in their testimony, and I asked them, how could you establish a list of peer-reviewed, preapproved practices? They said, you can't unless you were considering site-specific, class-specific application. You can't possibly do that. There is no generic way of doing that. So my amendment would, I believe, further the objectives of the authors of the bill and remove some uncertainty, because it is not clear from their testimony how you are ever going to get together this list.  And if the alternative to the list is to go to the CEQ, the Chief of the Forest Service said he didn't want to go there. He used HFRA instead, which is another proposal I put forward, which is why not just use, since we are all familiar with, there is still some controversy, but I think very little, attached to HFRA and its application, why not apply HFRA procedures to the problems in postcatastrophic events? But that was not deemed to be adequate for some reason, and now we have an entirely new construct which I believe has some need for perfecting amendments.  And that is why I am offering my amendment, and I would recommend it to my colleagues.  I yield back the balance of my time.
