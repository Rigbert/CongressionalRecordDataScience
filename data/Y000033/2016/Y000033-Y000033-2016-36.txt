Mr. Chairman, I am deeply disappointed in the comments that were just made because all he said was not true. The State does not den; the State does not snare; the State does not trap; the State does not kill wantonly. The State manages. To have the Federal Government manage the game when it is the law and when it is in the Constitution of the State of Alaska--an agreement made with this body--and to have an agency take that over and with the propaganda that has been espoused on this floor from the Humane Society is inappropriate of this body. It is a flat-out lie. That is what it is. It is not true.  The State manages, and they have not used these practices, but they have a right and should have a right to manage the fish and game on the property which was guaranteed to us.  I understand where this pressure is coming from. We in Alaska face this every day. No one understands that we have people in Alaska and that we have natives in Alaska who actually want the State to manage their fish and game or who would like to manage it by themselves, which I do support; but to have the Federal Government come in is wrong, and it is against our Constitution. I will stand by this amendment to stop moneys being spent by an agency that has overreached.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick).
