 President, I rise to introduce the Over-the-Counter Swaps Speculation Limit Act, a bill to establish workable speculative position limits that apply to both bilateral over-the-counter swaps transactions and on-exchange transactions.  The Over-the-Counter Swaps Speculation Limit Act would close the ``over-the-counter swaps loophole'' once and for all by requiring the Commodity Futures Trading Commission--or CFTC--to apply the position limit system to bilateral swaps, not just the on-exchange transactions that are limited today.  Let me explain what the bill would do:  CFTC would enforce ``aggregate'' position limits so that a trader's positions on and off exchange would be combined. Swaps would no longer be exempt from position limits.  CFTC would be allowed to grant hedge exemptions for bone fide hedging. This exemption would be limited to trading that hedges against price risk exposure related to physical transactions in that energy commodity.  Neither institutional investors hedging against inflation, nor swaps dealers hedging their secret dealings would qualify for a hedge exemption.  The bill would give CFTC the power to issue civil fines to enforce position limits when unwinding a speculative position would be disruptive to the marketplace.  This legislation is the missing piece to otherwise comprehensive anti-speculation legislation debated in the Senate in July and adopted by the House of Representatives in September.  Both of the House and Senate bills included vital provisions to protect our markets, including provisions to close the London Loophole by imposing speculation position limits on trading conducted on Foreign Boards of Trade.  It would grant CFTC the authority to collect data and monitor trading in Over-the-Counter Swaps markets, shining the bright light of oversight onto a previously un-watched market.  It would improve the data collection systems at CFTC to distinguish between swaps dealers, institutional investors, and genuine speculators;  It would assure no true speculator is exempted from speculative position limits; and increase CFTC's staffing levels.  Reacting to congressional pressure, the CFTC took many of the steps through administrative action that our bills in Congress would have required.  CFTC largely closed the London Loophole and began monitoring London trading of American crude oil.  CFTC began collecting detailed data on OTC swaps trading, especially by swaps dealers and institutional index traders, and it began monitoring these markets.  CFTC reclassified a major swaps dealer as a speculator and proposed a rulemaking to revise its system for granting speculative limit exemptions.  This is true progress, but the swaps loophole--exempting voice brokered bilateral swaps from the speculative position limit system--remains in place. Traders are able to hold positions far above speculative position limits simply by executing their trades through a voice broker.  Until this summer, the Federal Government knew very little about OTC swaps, which have been exempt from CFTC oversight since 1993. But thanks to CFTC's increased oversight this summer, published in its September 2008 ``Staff Report on Commodity Swap Dealers and Index Traders,'' we know that traders do in fact use these swaps markets to hold positions above the speculative position limits on regulated exchanges.  The CFTC report found that on a single day in June there were:  ``18 noncommercial traders (speculators) in 13 markets who appeared to have an aggregate position . . . that would have been above the speculative limit or an exchange accountability level if all the positions were on-exchange.''  CFTC discovered that a few traders held positions that would have ``significantly exceeded'' an aggregate position limit.  What is the purpose of speculative position limits if traders know they can buy the equivalent product in unlimited quantities from a voice broker?  The Over-the-Counter Swaps Speculation Limit Act puts an end to this flawed system by instructing CFTC to establish a system of aggregate position limits. As the staff report demonstrated, CFTC knows how to calculate such limits.  I believe this legislation avoids the pitfalls of previous efforts in the 110th Congress to limit speculative positions in swaps.  It is simple, granting CFTC the broad mandate to impose aggregate position limits across positions held on registered entities, foreign boards of trade, and OTC markets that impact the price discovery function of a regulated market. It grants the regulator proper discretion to determine which contracts are functionally equivalent and what the limits should be.  It applies speculative position limits only to swaps that impact the price discovery function on regulated markets. By focusing CFTC efforts only on the major, standardized swaps contracts, the bill maintains legal certainty for unique financing agreements and other private bilateral transactions.  The bill also prevents speculators from migrating to less regulated contracts. CFTC will only be allowed to exempt contracts from position limits after it determines that the contract is not functioning as a haven from regulation. CFTC must impose speculative position limits on any contract that: is highly standardized; settles on the price of a contracted traded in a regulated marketplace; has its prices widely published and referenced; or traded in significant volumes.  Finally, the legislation addresses CFTC staff concerns that enforcing position limits on bilateral swaps contracts would be too cumbersome. In recent briefings, CFTC staff argued that the primary reason CFTC was not calling for speculative position limits on swaps is that position limits on swaps would force parties to void existing contracts, which harms the counterparty as much as the trader who is over their limit.  Regulators should not force a trader to break a contract if such action would punish the counterparties as well as the speculator. To address this, this legislation gives CFTC the power to enforce position limits with fines instead of forcing a trader to unwind a position.  Over the past 6 months, OTC swaps markets have been exposed, and it has become increasingly apparent that speculative position limits are both appropriate and feasible in order to protect regulated markets from manipulation and excessive speculation.  The regulated and unregulated energy markets are fully integrated. With traders moving back and forth freely, it is no longer reasonable to believe that bad behavior in swaps can be isolated.  A manipulated swaps market would likely impact the price discovery function of a futures market, and in turn affect consumer prices.  If we want fair play in the energy markets, we cannot continue to instruct the CFTC to swallow its whistle when it sees violations at the Swaps' end of the court.  We need to allow CFTC to call foul when it sees excessive speculation, whether on an exchange or in a voice brokered swaps market.  The Over-the-Counter Swaps Speculation Limit Act would give the CFTC back its whistle. It would allow the Commission to use the speculative position limit system in existence since the 1930s--to reel in excessive speculation in American energy markets.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3671       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
