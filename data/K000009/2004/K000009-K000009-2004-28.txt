Chairman, I thank the gentleman so very much for that.  I would be concluding my remarks and saying with all of our veterans returning home, many of them disabled now, this is an absolutely perfect opportunity to transition them into jobs with adequate training and why should we not be using tax dollars to help our own people get jobs right here at home. I thank the chairman very much for his consideration and for the membership. This is a great victory for the American people.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
