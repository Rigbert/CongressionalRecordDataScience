Senator Dan Inouye of Hawaii has made such amazing contributions to this country. As a young man, his service in World War II led to his being honoredwith the Congressional Medal for his bravery in battle. He has carried the wounds of that battle now for many years. He used his time in the service to inspire him to higher levels of public service in our Government and beyond the military, serving in Congress and as a U.S. Senator from the State of Hawaii. He is, in fact, a legend in the history of the Senate. I am honored to call him a colleague. Parenthetically, 6 years ago, when I was sworn in to my second term, I chose Senator Inouye to escort me for that swearing-in ceremony because of my great respect for him and all he has meant to our country, his State of Hawaii, and to me personally.  What you just heard in his comments about Native Hawaiians you could have heard as well about his commitment to Native Americans. From the beginning, Danny Inouye has been there to fight for those who oftentimes were not given the same treatment, same respect, and same rights as other Americans. His voice has made a difference time and time again. When he comes to us and talks about this underlying Omnibus appropriations bill and some of the programs that will help Native Hawaiians and Native Americans, it is with a commitment from the heart. He really believes in helping these people, many of whom have been treated badly by the United States in our founding years.  I wanted to preface my remarks by saying, for those looking for a reason to support this bill, Senator Danny Inouye, our chairman, has given a good, solid reason, so that we can balance the books and right the wrongs that occurred in previous generations.  I want to come down to practical considerations.
