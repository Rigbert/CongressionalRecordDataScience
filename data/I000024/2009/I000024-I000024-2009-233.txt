I think, once again, we are faced with a backhanded attempt to regulate greenhouse gases without the transparency of public debate. Section 429 of the omnibus currently includes yet another congressional handout to some of the extremist groups and to the trial bar. This rider is clearly an attempt to legislate on a spending bill, the sort of bad habit that Democrats in Congress and the White House promised to give up during the last election.  As ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I strongly support the bipartisan amendment offered by Senators Murkowski and Begich to revise the omnibus section 429. This subject is particularly important to me since the EPW Committee holds jurisdiction over all issues impacted by the offending provision, including endangered species, the regulation of greenhouse gases, and the transportation infrastructure which we are going to be pursuing in the next few weeks.  Without the amendment, section 429 allows the agencies to make dramatic changes to the Endangered Species Act rules and regulations without having to comply with longstanding Federal laws that require public notice and public comment by the American people and knowledgeable scientists.
