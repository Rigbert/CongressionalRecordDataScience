I think the gentleman from California (Mr. Farr) is exactly right and he understands how one has to have integrated policies.  I wanted to say as I am looking at the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters) who has fought so hard for people to build a real middle class in this country and to help other nations help their people create a middle class, what is really sad about these trade agreements is it pits the poor against the more poor. It draws our living standards down. But one farmer that I met in Mexico said to me, what is really upsetting is that we feel like crabs in a bucket.                              {time}  2115  Every time we try to get up a little bit, somebody else pulls us down, and they were fighting this rush to the bottom, which is the expression that the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Brown) uses so well. One poor person pulling another person down, rather than having the standards that the gentleman from California (Mr. Farr) is talking about, where we all agree to a minimum standard. We bring people up, not pull them down.
