 President, James Bryant Conant once said that ``each honest calling, each walk of life, has its own elite, its own aristocracy, based on excellence of performance.'' I rise today to pay tribute to a man who is a member of the law enforcement elite, John B. Brown III, the Acting Director of the Drug Enforcement Administration.  John Brown has spent more than three decades as a special agent in the Drug Enforcement Administration. Last year he capped his law enforcement career when he was appointed deputy administrator of the agency. And when former Administrator Asa Hutchinson was appointed as under secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, John Brown was tapped to be Acting Director of the DEA.  John Brown is a dedicated, hard-working government leader. He is known at the DEA and in the larger law enforcement community as a thoughtful, personable administrator and a man of great humility.  His career at the DEA has been a distinguished one. As a young agent he worked in Mexico where he was deeply involved in the investigation into the murder of Kiki Camarena, the brave DEA agent who was tortured and killed by Mexican drug traffickers. During that time as in the rest of his career--whether it was in Miami, the Dallas field division, the El Paso intelligence center or at DEA Headquarters--John Brown rose to the challenge and excelled at each assignment.  But it was John Brown's first job as a teacher that really shaped him as an agent. John is known by the people who worked for him at DEA as a great teacher, someone who took the time to coach them, to motivate them, to counsel them. For that reason, he is one of the most popular administrators at DEA, and one of the most respected.  As a school teacher, John quickly found that many of the problems he saw among students in his classroom involved learning the skills and attitudes and character to cope with life. Drug use was becoming widespread in the early 1970s and prompted John to decide to join DEA as a special agent.  In truth, he never left the classroom. He has said many times that one of his proudest moments at DEA came when a former student--someone who as a young student had listened to one of his talks about the perils of drug use came up to him in an airport years later. He introduced himself, said that he had a great job and a wonderful family--both of which he said would have been impossible had he joined his many friends who used drugs in high school. He credited John Brown's talk on drugs with keeping away from a life of substance abuse.  I would be remiss if I did not mention John's wife, Christine Brown, who has been a source of tremendous supportand strength to John and their family. I know that she and their two children P.J. and Michael are incredibly proud of John and the superior and important work that he has done over the course of his career.  John Brown is a leader of integrity and total dedication. He has served his country well and I wish him all the best.                          ____________________
