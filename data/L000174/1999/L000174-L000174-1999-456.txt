President, in 1996, I authored the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act to provide assistance to victims of terrorism and mass violence, wherever it occurred. This assistance is limited to victims who are citizens or employees of the United States who are injured or killed as a result of a terrorist act.  Unfortunately, that legislation is not doing the job as we intended. There are still too many victims of terrorism who are not getting the help they need and deserve--the help that Congress meant to give them in 1996. Among those left out in the cold are the families of those killed in the downing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988, and the victims of last year's embassy bombings in West Africa.  Section 3024 of the emergency appropriations bill will provide a limited but immediate response by providing much-needed assistance to the families of the Americans who were killed in the bombing of Pan Am 103. I am proud to have worked to get this emergency provision included in the conference report.  Currently, in cases involving terrorist acts occurring outside the United States, the Office of Victims of Crime (OVC) may only give supplemental grants to the States, for compensation of state residents. This formulation has not provided the intended help to victims of terrorism who reside overseas and do not have a clear State residence, even though they are U.S. citizens. It is of little assistance to the non-citizen victims employed by our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, who also deserve our support and assistance. And due to an overly restrictive interpretation of the 1996 law by the Department of Justice, it has not provided help to the victims of the Lockerbie bombing and other victims of terrorist acts that occurred before the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act went into effect.  The current law has led to slower implementation than I intended when emergency aid is desperately needed, and has not enabled OVC to provide emergency relief, crisis response or training and technical assistance for victim service providers, as I intended.  Accordingly, this week I offered an amendment to the juvenile justice bill, S. 254--which was accepted in the mangers' amendment--which would improve the law even further. It would ensure that OVC can provide efficient and effective assistance--and really make a difference--for Americans whose lives are torn apart by acts of terrorism and mass violence occurring outside the United States.  In the meantime, the trial in the Pan Am 103 case is getting under way, and the families of those victims need our help now. This is an urgent matter, and I am glad that we are addressing it in this emergency bill.                           Outstanding Claims
