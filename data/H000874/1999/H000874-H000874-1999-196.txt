Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from Wisconsin, for yielding to me. I want to congratulate the gentleman for focusing on this issue.  Mr. Speaker, I think it is important that we do so because I think we need to reflect upon what the lessons of this operation are. Many had doubts. Many were concerned that we were going to lose large numbers of people. Many were concerned that those who had been expelled from Kosovo would not want to go home. Many frankly were opposed to the President's leadership on this issue because they thought it was wrong.  Mr. Speaker, the butcher of Belgrade, however, is in full retreat. NATO's 78-day air campaign operation allied force has harnessed Slobodan Milosevic's unbridled barbarism. It is producing the results we knew it would. It has made the world, in my opinion, a safer place today.  When we look at Southeastern Europe tonight and compare it to the situation there just 3 months ago, what do we see? First, of course, as I have said, we see a weakened Milosevic, both at home and abroad. The gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kind) mentioned and I will repeat that just this morning the Washington Post reported that demonstrations denouncing Milosevic's genocidal rampage in Kosovo have begun to occur in Belgrade. We expected them in Pristina, but they are occurring in Belgrade.  One Serb protester complained, and this bears repeating, as the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kind) just used this quote, ``Milosevic lied to us. He led us in the wrong direction. We should be entering the European Union and cooperating with the rest of the world. Instead, we are completely isolated.''  Second, we see 1.3 million Kosovars who were forced to flee their homeland or displaced within their province preparing to return home. We have some measure of confidence that the nightmarish scenes and gross violations of human rights in Kosovo are at an end and will not be replayed there soon.  Third, we see the unified, decisive action by NATO forces can repulse a ruthless dictator, protect and preserve the sanctity of human rights, and help stabilize the entire region.  Can anyone seriously question whether the threat to Macedonia or the Yugoslavia Republic of Montenegro is less tonight because of NATO's unwavering action against Milosevic and his henchmen? No one can doubt that the same could not be said had we fallen prey to the isolationist experts who coached appeasement.  In 1940, as the European continent was about to explode into a Second World War, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt said of appeasement, no man can tame a tiger into a kitten by stroking it. There can be no appeasement with ruthlessness. There can be no reasoning with the incendiary bomb.''  Milosevic's ruthless actions, his rejection of reasoning during the entire decade, left us little alternative but to confront him with force.  Mr. Speaker, let me again repeat, for the entire decade. This was not something that was sprung on the West. In fact, in my opinion, the West waited too long. But it is never too late to do the right thing.                              {time}  2100  With President Clinton, an extraordinarily courageous and forceful Prime Minister of Great Britain, and other leaders in NATO who obviously had in their own parliaments voices of doubt, voices of nonsupport, but notwithstanding that, they courageously stood as a NATO alliance to say that this kind of genocidal activity will not stand in the bosom of Europe.  Fourth, we see that the credibility of the United States has been enhanced throughout the world. As William Kristol and Robert Kagan wrote recently in the Weekly Standard, Mr. Speaker, as I am sure my colleagues well know, neither Mr. Kristol nor Mr. Kagan are known as spinmeisters for the Clinton administration, but they said this, the victory in Kosovo should``send a message to would-be aggressors that . . . the United States and its allies can summon the will and the force to do them harm.''  We have sent, I think, a very simple message to would-be aggressors in Europe and elsewhere. Do not do it. Do not do it. Do not do it. The West has the will, and the West clearly has the ability to confront you, stop you, defeat you, and drive you back. Do not do it.  If one takes aggressive hostile action against one's neighbors or one's own people, one will pay a very high price indeed.  Fifth, we see that a policy that recognizes and embraces basic human rights, decency, and democratic values is not just the right thing to do, but, Mr. Speaker, a strategic imperative. This policy, in this case, has been vindicated.  Syndicated columnist William Safire hit the nail on the head when he wrote recently, ``International moral standards of conduct, long derided by geopoliticians, now have muscle.''  How proud Americans ought to be of their President, this Congress, and their young men and women in the armed forces of the United States who align with those in NATO made that quote possible. That the cynics, the realpolitiks of the world who said that we did not have a strategic interest there, yes, of course, there was a moral imperative, but we did not have a strategic interest; therefore, perhaps as we did during the 1930s we ought to stand and simply watch, perhaps lament, perhaps wring our hand, but not take action.  The Clinton administration with the support of this Congress not only unified, not always out front, but nevertheless united in our conviction that we would let this policy go forward and congratulate themselves for standing for what is right. Why? Because of NATO's unified unwavering action in Kosovo, we have made it clear that international wrongdoers can and will be confronted.  This does not mean we can intervene, Mr. Speaker, in every instance. As Secretary of State Madeleine Albright stated recently, and again I quote, ``In copying with future crisis, the accumulated wisdom of the past will have to be weighed against the factors unique to that place and time.''  Unfortunately, for Milosevic, Kosovo was the place and the time.  Finally, in closing let me state our efforts to secure peace in the Balkans are not over. We must keep the faith. We must keep our will. We must keep our focus. We must keep our ties to our allies strong and unbroken.  Milosevic has properly been branded as a war criminal by the International War Crimes Tribunal at the Hague. He, Mr. Speaker, and those who committed crimes allied with him or, very frankly, those who committed crimes on the other side must be held accountable.  Our policy goal now should be, not only his removal from office, but his being held accountable for the atrocities for which he is clearly responsible. If we do not, Mr. Speaker, if we do not hold those who have committed war crimes accountable, then I fear we will see a continuation of the cycle of violence and revenge that has plagued the Balkans for so many years.  If, however, we hold accountable those responsible, then there will not be cause for the victims and their families and their successors to again strike out, to in vengeance, to restore the honor that has not been restored because we did not hold the criminals accountable.  We should encourage the Serbs to remove Milosevic and the brutal leaders who have caused this tragic suffering and misery. Serbia also must be clear about this. So long as Milosevic remains in power, it will not and should not receive financial assistance for its reconstruction. Humanitarian aid, yes. Reconstruction aid, economic aid, no.  Mr. Speaker, I am one of the Members of this House who has traveled to Macedonia and Albania, been to Pristina and Kosovo, and seen with my own eyes the devastation and the consequences of genocide. These images are seared into my memory forever.  We will not always be able to intervene to stop injustice wherever it occurs, but we have laid down a powerful precedent in Kosovo. Our credibility, as I said, earlier has been enhanced. NATO has been strengthened. A brutal dictator has been repulsed, and the cause for human rights has been advanced. If those are not good causes, Mr. Speaker, I do not know what are.  Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kind) who has himself been such a leader in this effort and who is ensured that the American public had the facts and were themselves focused on the objectives we sought, the means we used.  Parenthetically, let me say that we were extraordinarily lucky, the redress of the wrongs that were occurring, if they occur in the future, may not be as costless as this enterprise was. But having said that, the enterprise will be worth it.
