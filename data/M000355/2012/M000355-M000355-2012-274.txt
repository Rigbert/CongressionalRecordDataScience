 President, today I wish to pay tribute to a father and son who are bravely serving in our Armed Forces simultaneously: MSG Micah B. Mason and his son, PFC Micah J. Mason, both of London, KY. Master Sergeant Mason has served in the National Guard for 28 years. He now has had the opportunity to see his son, Private First Class Mason, learn, work, and grow in the same organization that the elder Mason began his career in almost three decades ago.  Not only are the Mason men both involved in the same service branch, they also served on the same mission, in the same truck. Master Sergeant Mason was excited to be given the opportunity to work alongside his son in ``real world'' missions. He feels that he is lucky to be able to experience a work environment firsthand with his son in a way very few parents get the chance to do.  Private First Class Mason is excited to be able to go on missions with his father. The 22-year-old didn't know that his father was going to be on the same truck as him until the day they deployed. He is overjoyed to show his father the proficiency at which he does his job on a day-to-day basis.  There is obviously a certain level of concern when deploying on a mission solo, and that level increases when there are not one but two members of the same family on a single mission. Nonetheless, the two have expressed that at the end of the day, they are glad they have each other for support.  The resiliency and strength shown by these two individuals in such a tolling work environment is truly remarkable. With men like the Masons serving in our Armed Forces, we have little reason to doubt our military's abilities. These men are true American heroes who have given much so that we may sleep soundly at night and know that our freedoms and liberties will always be protected.  Master Sergeant Mason and his son Private First Class Mason deserve a great deal of recognition, just as all those in military service do, for what they have done to protect the citizens of their community, the great State of Kentucky, and our great country of the United States of America.  Mr. President, I would like to ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in recognizing the hard work, dedication, and sacrifice of MSG Micah B. Mason and his son, PFC Micah J. Mason.  There was recently an article printed in Whitley County, Kentucky's local newspaper, The Times-Tribune, which highlighted the outstanding service of this father and son duo who have so graciously contributed to our Nation's defense throughout the years. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:                [From the Times-Tribune, Oct. 12, 2011]             Father and Son Team Up To Go Outside the Wire               (By Corbin, special to the Times-Tribune)       As soldiers complete their pre-mission checks and get      everything loaded for transport, it would seem the job of      escorting supply trucks from Joint Base Balad to Contingency      Operating Site Mosul is just another mission for the soldiers      of Delta Company, 1st Battalion, 149th Infantry Regiment,      77th Sustainment Brigade, 310th Expeditionary Sustainment      Command.       However, a rare occasion has been marked, not only in the      149th Infantry Regiment, but in the military as a whole. A      father and son are going out together on not only the same      mission, but in the same truck.       ``It's a unique experience for sure to actually be doing      real-world missions with your son as a gunner and seeing him      in that atmosphere,'' said Master Sgt. Micah B. Mason, an      assistant operations noncommissioned officer with      Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 149 Inf. Regt., a      native of London. ``It's something very few parents get to      do. I'm excited to actually go on a mission and experience it      first-hand with my son.       Master Sgt. Mason, 46, who served in the Guard for over 28      years, usually watches convoy escort missions unfold as a      shift battle NCO in charge of the 149th Inf. Regt.'s tactical      operations center. However, the unit sent him on this mission      as part of their ongoing efforts to ensure everyone in the      tactical operations center is able to see what goes on first-     hand during the missions they monitor on a daily basis.       ``I have a lot of concerns . . . if something does happen      (on the mission),'' said Master Sgt. Mason. ``I'm glad I'm      there with him, though.''       Master Sgt. Mason said he's only told two people back home      about him and his son doing this mission together and that      ``they're just in awe.''       ``I didn't know he was going, 'til I saw him sitting out by      the trucks,'' said 22-year-old Pfc. Micah J. Mason, a gunner      with Delta Company, 1/149th Inf. Regt., also a native of      London. ``It just makes me happy to actually do something      with him, to let him see what I do on a day-to day basis.''       Pfc. Mason said he had been waiting to be able to go on a      mission with his father, as not many people can say that they      have done that. After the mission, Master Sgt. Mason had only      good things to say.       ``Things went very smooth,'' he said. ``The convoy escort      team knew their jobs very well and were professional every      step of the way. Being out with my son was the chance of a      lifetime. It was very strange to see him doing his job, being      in control. But in the same sense, I was very proud.''                          ____________________
