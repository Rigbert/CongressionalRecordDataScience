 Speaker, I rise today to honor a resident of Vermont, Kathy Francis. I am not the first to recognize her merits. She has already been honored by the Vermont Foster and Adoptive Family Association as the Vermont Social Worker of the Year. In a week she will be recognized by the National Foster and Adoptive Families Association as National Social Worker of the Year.  We all know that our nation's future lies with its children. The young of today will be the adults of tomorrow. But being young is not always an easy or comfortable position: many children in America are at risk, and need adults--parents, relatives; teachers, social workers, families--to support and guide them.  Perhaps most at risk are those without birth parents. And it is toward these children that Kathy Francis has made a major, ongoing commitment. A child protective social worker for Vermont's Social and Rehabilitative Services Department for the past ten years, Kathy has worked overtime, and with great dedication, to make sure that the children she serves, and the families they are placed with, have support of every kind. That these children will move forward to live rich and productive lives, and that the families they live with will surround them with support and love (and will receive love in return), has much to dowith Kathy's ardor, perseverance and devotion to these Vermont children.  She is profoundly deserving of being honored Social Worker of the Year, and Vermont is greatly proud of her.                          ____________________
