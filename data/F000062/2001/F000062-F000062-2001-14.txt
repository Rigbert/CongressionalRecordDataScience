 President, I rise to talk about the farm bill as it is presented to this Senate, and specifically the dairy part of that bill. I rise with the knowledge that some negotiations are going on to see if that particular dairy program cannot be improved, at least improved from the position of California. The present bill, as drafted, before this body, is one, frankly, I cannot support. I cannot support it largely because of the dairy provisions.  I thought it might be helpful if I related my experiences. The problem is that some States have many small farms, 60 to 80 cows, and other States have larger farms. That is where the subsidies intermesh to really create a very difficult playing field for California. Essentially the provisions in the agriculture bill that is on the floor now would force consumers across the United States to pay $1.8 billion more for milk each year. It would drive down essential income to dairy farmers who produce the milk contained in most of our Nation's dairy products.  California is the largest dairy State in the Nation. Last year, dairy farmers produced 32.2 billion pounds of milk. Over 19 percent plus of the Nation's supply comes from California. The industry is a $4.3 billion industry in the State, and dairy is the largest part--most people do not know that--of what is a $30 billion agricultural industry. We have 2,000 dairy farms in the State--2,100 to be exact. We lead the Nation in the total number of milk cows at 1.5 million. I often joke I wish they could vote. The California industry produces 122,000 jobs and contributes $17.5 billion overall in the economy each year.  These are full-time, year-round jobs in agricultural counties that make up the heart of the great California central valley. Dairies provide jobs for farmers who grow and ship feed, for farmhands who milk the cows, for workers in the processing plants who make our famous California cheeses, and for packers, marketers, and many others. In fact, in the great San Joachin Valley, one in every five jobs is dependent on the dairy industry. If California were a separate nation--I think most people do not know this--it would rank eighth in the world in milk production, fifth in the world in cheese production, and ninth in the world in butter production.  I want to make it clear that we are talking about California more than any other State when you talk dairy. So it is simply not possible to leave California out of any dairy equation.  I am aware that the dairy industry, particularly in the Northeast, needs government help. I want to make it clear that I can't support that help if it greatly disadvantages the dairy farmers in California.  I think the California Secretary of Agriculture put it best. I would like to quote from a letter dated December 3:       Consumers will see higher prices for fluid milk. In the      Senate bill, it is 40 cents more a gallon for milk.       State law and economics dictate that California's dairy      prices must bear a reasonable relationship to milk prices in      neighboring regions.  California law, like it or not, ties us into any pooling agreement that might be made.       As fluid milk prices in surrounding states rise, California      fluid milk prices would be increased in a corresponding      manner. Unfortunately, the higher milk prices will force some      consumers to switch to less expensive--and less nutritious--     non-dairy alternatives. Dairy processors would be negatively      impacted by this loss of fluid milk sales.       At the same time, California's dairy farmers will also lose      under the Senate plan. Increases in fluid milk prices will      undoubtedly lead to increased milk production. Once an area      covers its needs for fluid milk, the additional milk goes for      manufactured product such as cheese, milk powder, and butter.      California is the leading producer of both milk powder and      butter. California is the second largest producer of cheese,      and in fact only 19 percent of California's milk production      goes for fluid milk. By simultaneously stimulating production      while dampening demand, the Senate plan strikes at the heart      of California's dairy economy by severely depressing prices      for manufactured dairy products.  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                     California Department of Food                                                & Agriculture,                                 Sacramento, CA, December 3, 2001.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I recently wrote to you expressing      concern about the proposed changes to the federal dairy      system and its impact on California. While this proposal has      changed since that letter, its impact remains negative for      California's consumers and dairy producers.       The new plan, contained in S. 1731 as of this writing,      would apply to only the federal order program. However, it      would have enormous consequences to this state.       Consumers will see higher prices for fluid (drinking) milk.      State law and economics dictate, that California's dairy      prices must bear a reasonable relationship to milk prices in      neighboring regions. As fluid milk prices in surrounding      states rise, California fluid milk prices would be increased      in a corresponding manner. Unfortunately, the higher milk      prices will force some consumers to switch to less      expensive--and less nutritious--non-dairy alternatives. Dairy      processors would be negatively impacted by this loss of fluid      milk sales.       At the same time, California's dairy farmers will also lose      under the Senate plan. Increases in fluid milk prices will      undoubtedly lead to increased milk production. Once an area      covers its needs for fluid milk, the additional milk goes for      manufactured product such as cheese, milk powder, and butter.      California is the leading producer of both milk powder and      butter. California is the     second largest producer of cheese, and in fact only 19      percent of California's milk production goes for fluid milk.      By simultaneously stimulating production while dampening      demand, the Senate plan strikes at the heart of California's      dairy economy by severely depressing prices for manufactured      dairy products.       This is the case even though the Senate plan will primarily      increase production in other parts of the country.      Manufactured dairy products may be easily stored and      transported. Accordingly, the markets for these products are      nationwide so that even if increased production were limited      to other regions, California's prices for its manufactured      products will drop significantly.       The Alliance of Western Milk Producers estimate that over 9      years the bill would have the impact of reducing California      dairy farmer's revenue by approximately $1.5 billion. At the      same time, California consumers would pay an additional $1.5      billion in higher retail milk prices. The Alliance estimate      seems reasonable using the analysis completed earlier by the      University of Missouri's Food and Policy Research Institute.      Our economists concur with these estimates.       Without question, dairy policy offers some of the most      contentious issues in agriculture. The sole positive      attribute of the Senate plan is that it has united      California's dairy consumers, producers, and processors in      opposition to the proposal. Whatever it does for the rest of      the country, it is bad for our state.       I thank you and your staff for all of your efforts on      behalf of Californians. If I may be of any assistance to you      on this or any other matter, please do not hesitate to      contact me.           Sincerely,                                     William (Bill) J. Lyons, Jr.,                                                        Secretary.
