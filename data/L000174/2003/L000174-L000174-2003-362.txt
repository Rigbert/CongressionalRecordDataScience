In fact, I say to my friend that the one time we did try to bring one of President Bush's circuit court nominees to the floor and ask to have him considered, for a month we were not allowed to because the Republicans objected. I have not done a whip check, but I am willing to bet that if we brought them to a vote, and they are on the calendar now, they would get confirmed. Even in the time we have had quorum calls and discussions on this today, we could have brought them up and had a series of 10-minute rollcall votes. And I am willing to bet we would have passed them all.
