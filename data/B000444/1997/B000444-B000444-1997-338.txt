 President, while on a field trip to a Civil War site in the 1950's, a young African-American boy from Delaware asked his teacher why there was no mention of black soldiers. He learned a cold, hard lesson that day--that even though black soldiers fought and died for their country, they were not honored because of the color of their skin.  That field trip ignited what would become a 40-year crusade by a Delawarean named Wilson K. Smith. Mr. Smith is a retired Army Sergeant, who was decorated with a Bronze Star and Silver Star during the Vietnam war as a member of the 101st Airborne Division, First Special Forces. In 1957, Sgt. Smith began collecting war stories from black veterans. By 1979, he had tracked down all the African-American Congressional Medal of Honor recipients. In 1989, he began seeking financial pledges and support to build an African-American Medal of Honor monument.  I am proud to have worked closely with Mr. Smith over the last 5 years to see the realization of his dream.  Last month, the names of the 85 African-American Medal of Honor recipients were officially recognized in a permanent exhibit at the Pentagon. This exhibit replicates a monument honoring black Medal of Honor recipients now on permanent display at Morgan State University in Baltimore, MD. Mr. Smith was the driving force behind the design and fundraising for this monument.  This monument will help keep the legacy of the African-American Congressional Medal of Honor recipients alive for generations to come. Never again will young African-American school boys and girls have to wonder why black veterans are not honored for their service and sacrifice to the United States of America.  The Medal of Honor is the highest award for bravery in military service to our country, but few are aware of the names, faces and stories of heroism of the Medal of Honor recipients. These are truly inspiring Americans, who continue to serve this country by their examples of courage, patriotism, and selfless dedication above and beyond the call of duty. From the Civil War to the World Wars to Vietnam to the Persian Gulf war, they have been the outstanding defenders of liberty, the highest hope of humanity in struggle, and the truest representatives of human strength. A memorial to bring that inspiration to African-Americans and to all of us, is a most worthy endeavor.  It truly has been my honor and pleasure to have strongly supported Wilson Smith's crusade, along with many other national and State leaders, including former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Colin Powell. Wilson Smith is an outstanding man, Delawarean, U.S. veteran and historian. We all will forever owe him a double debt of gratitude for his service to our country.                          ____________________
