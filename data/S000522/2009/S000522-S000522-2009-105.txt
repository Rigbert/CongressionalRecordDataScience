I thank my very distinguished colleague Dr. Broun. Thank you for your kind words, but more importantly, thank you for the contribution you make, especially given your background.  I think Americans need to know that physicians who believe in the sanctity of life, that patients before birth who might be in need of blood transfusions--I mean one of the things I will never forget, Bernard Nathanson, one of the founders of NARAL, an abortionist himself who did thousands of abortions, quit as the head of the center in New York, and he wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine ``I have come to the agonizing conclusion that I have presided over 60,000 deaths.'' So this innovator, this man who walked in the vanguard of the abortion rights movement, gave it all up. And he did so because, like you, he became a physician who said there are two patients, the unborn child and his or her mother, and both need to be treated with respect. The Hippocratic oath that you cited so eloquently is an admonishment that has fallen by the wayside with some, not all.  The newborn didn't get that way, a healthy newborn, traversing the birth canal. It had to do with good prenatal care. The mom taking care of herself and being treated obviously well by the family so that she could get her proper rest, all the things that lead to a good delivery, it all occurs prior to birth.
