Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to my good friend and colleague, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller), and thank him because he was very instrumental in helping us work on the language that provides $45 million for an outpatient clinic in Pensacola. I want to thank him for that outstanding work he did.
