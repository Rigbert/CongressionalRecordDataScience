 Chairman, I appreciate the words of my good friend. Is there anything in this amendment which would suggest that anybody here is not deeply concerned about what is happening around the world, that we do not want to see the economies of Mexico, Russia, Asia strong?  All that we are saying is, for example, maybe if the Congress had been involved in the discussion over the bailout of Russia, maybe the Russian economy would not be in the pits that it is in now.
