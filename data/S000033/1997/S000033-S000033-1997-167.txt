 Speaker, I briefly wanted to discuss an amendment which I will be introducing as soon as the rule on the supplementary appropriation is fixed, which deals with an emergency situation for gulf war veterans who are really not getting the attention and the understanding that they need inorder to deal with the very serious crisis of Persian Gulf war syndrome.  As we know, Persian Gulf war syndrome is right now affecting some 70,000 of the brave men and women who served this country in the gulf. Mr. Speaker, I am a member of the Subcommittee on Human Resources, which is chaired by the gentleman from Connecticut [Mr. Shays], who has done an outstanding job in bringing before the subcommittee some of the leading researchers in this country who are searching for an understanding of Persian Gulf war syndrome.  We have also heard testimony from the Pentagon and the Veterans' Administration. I must say, Mr. Speaker, that the conclusion that I have reached is that, for whatever reason, and I say this unhappily, it is my view that neither the Pentagon nor the Veterans' Administration is going to come up with a solution regarding the problems and the cause of the problems that our Persian Gulf war veterans are suffering from. Nor in my view are they going to come up with an effective treatment.  Mr. Speaker, there is some good news. The good news is that there have been some major scientific breakthroughs in allowing us a better understanding of Persian Gulf war syndrome. Mr. Speaker, the military theater in the Persian Gulf was a horrendous chemical cesspool. Nobody denies that. It is now acknowledged that our troops there were exposed to chemical warfare agents that had been denied for a while, but it is now acknowledged by all.  In addition, they were exposed to leaded petroleum, a widespread use of pesticides, depleted uranium and the dense smoke from burning oil wells. In other words, all around them were very dangerous and toxic chemicals. In addition they were given various vaccines. Perhaps, most importantly, as a result of a waiver from the FDA, they were given pyridostigmine bromide for antinerve gas protection.  Mr. Speaker, an increasing number of scientists now believe that the synergistic effects of these chemical exposures plus the pyridostigmine bromide may well be the major cause of the health problems affecting our soldiers.  The truth is that after 5 years, there has not yet been, to the best of my knowledge, one significant study coming out of the Pentagon or the VA which shows the relationship between chemical exposure in the Persian Gulf and the Persian Gulf syndrome.  On the other hand, and this is where the good news is, there have been a number of important studies done outside of the Pentagon and the VA which makes this important link. I will be introducing these studies into the record so that interested Members can study them. But let me just very briefly mention a few of them.  Dr. Robert Haley of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, based on studies that he has done, believes the syndromes are due to subtle brain, spinal cord and nerve damage caused by exposure to combinations of low level chemical nerve agents and other chemicals, including pyridostigmine bromide in antinerve gas tablets, DEET in a highly concentrated insect repellant, and pesticides in flea collars that some of the troops wore.  And Doctors Mohammed Abou-Donia and Tom Kurt, of Duke University Medical Center, found in studies that used chickens that two pesticides used in the gulf war, DEET and permethrin, and the antinerve gas agent pyridostigmine bromide, which was given to all troops, were harmless when used alone. However, when used in combination, these chemicals caused neurological deficits in the test animals similar to those reported by some gulf war veterans.                              {time}  1330  Dr. Satu Somani of the Southern Illinois University School of Medicine states that based on recent experimental proof and historical evidence of symptoms, such as impaired concentration and memory, headache, fatigue and depression of workers in the organophosphate industry, he considers that gulf war syndrome may be due to low dose sarin exposure and the intake of pyridostigmine and exposure to pesticides and other chemicals.  Drs. Garth and Nancy Nicolson of the University of Texas, Houston, found that gulf war veterans who are ill may eventually have their diagnoses linked to chemical exposures in the Persian Gulf, such as oil spills and fires, smoke in military operations, chemicals on clothing, pesticides, chemoprophylactic agents, chemical weapons, and others.  Dr. Claudia Miller and Dr. William Rea of Texas also see a connection between the chemicals that our soldiers were exposed to and gulf war syndrome.  Mr. Chairman, this is an important breakthrough. This research provides an important breakthrough which, in my view, may finally give us the information that we need to understand Persian Gulf war syndrome, which is affecting 70,000 veterans. This is why later this afternoon I will be bringing forward an amendment which asks for $10 million to go to the National Institute of Health and Environmental Science so that they can pursue this important area of research.                          ____________________
