 Both of us are committed to getting it fully funded and both of us agree the current supplemental appropriations is not the place to do it. But we are committed to trying to achieve that, and to achieve it soon, and at a more appropriate time.  I thank my colleague from Connecticut for not offering the amendment on this measure and pledge to work with him to achieve the goal we both desire.
