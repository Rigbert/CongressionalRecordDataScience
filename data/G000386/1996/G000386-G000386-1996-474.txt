 President, today I am pleased to introduce the Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996 with my colleague Senator Feinstein. This bipartisan bill takes aim at a rapidly growing problem in America--the abuse of methamphetamine, known on the street as meth or crank.  I am from Iowa--a rural State which most people do not associate with rampant crime or drug use. But in Iowa today, meth use has increased dramatically. According to a report preparedby the Governor's alliance on substance abuse, seizures of methamphetamine in Des Moines increased an astounding 4,000 percent from 1993 to 1994. I repeat: meth seizures in Des Moines increased by 4,000 percent. The increase statewide was 400 percent. These numbers are scary, Mr. President. According to the Iowa Department of Public Health, 7.3 percent of Iowans seeking help from substance abuse treatment centers in 1995 cited meth as their primary addiction. That's up over 5 percent from 1994, when only 2.2 percent cited meth as their primary addiction.  Why has meth become such a problem? I do not think anyone knows definitively, but experts have been able to identify some of the reasons. Meth is cheap; a meth high lasts for a very, very long time, so you get more for your money; and perhaps most disturbingly, meth does not have the stigma associated with cocaine and crack. Kids know that crack is dangerous. But they have not yet learned that meth is.  In Waterloo, IA, though, people are beginning to learn this sad and painful lesson. According to the New York Times, a 17-year-old Iowan who had been a good boy, descended into meth addiction. His behavior changed for the worse. Last October, this young man checked himself into the hospital because he believed that he had the flu. He died only days later because meth had so destroyed his immune system that he developed a form of meningitis. I will never forget the words of this boy's mother: ``He made some wrong decisions and this drug sucked him away.'' I ask unanimous consent that this New York Times article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Feb. 22, 1996]         Good People Go Bad in Iowa, And a Drug Is Being Blamed                           (By Dirk Johnson)       Newton, IA. Feb. 16.--In this small town surrounded by corn      fields, nothing but Sunday morning church bells ever made      much noise, and the jail sat three-quarters empty most of the      time.       And then about a year or so ago, things started to go      haywire.       Crime began to soar, coupled with an outbreak of irrational      behavior; a man with a spotless record pulled a string of      burglaries; some parents suddenly became so neglectful that      their children were taken away; a man fled his workplace to      get a gun, terrified that helicopters were coming after him;      motorists in routine traffic stops greeted the police with      psychotic tirades.       Prosecutors linked all of these cases and many more in this      town of 15,000 people to the influx of the drug      methamphetamine, and its frequent side-effects of paranoia      and violent behavior.       A problem for several years in California and other      Southwestern states, the drug is now making its way across      America, ruining lives and families along the way and raising      the concern of policy makers in Washington.       ``Meth seems to have taken control of these people,'' said      Steve Johnson, the prosecutor here in Jasper County, where      the 24-bed jail is now overflowing, and 90 percent of the      inmates have a problem with the drug. ``It's scary stuff.      We're pretty frustrated and don't know exactly what to do to      get it under control.''       The drug, also known as crank or ice, is a stimulant that      is swallowed, snorted or injected. It is much cheaper than      cocaine, and its high lasts longer, the authorities say.      Users may stay awake for several days at a stretch, feeling      euphoric and full of energy before finally plunging into      terrible depression and paranoia.       ``This is the most malignant, addictive drug known to      mankind,'' said Dr. Michael Abrams of Broadlawn Medical      Center in Des Moines, where more patients were admitted      during the past year for abuse of methamphetamine than for      alcoholism. ``It is often used by blue-collar workers, who      feel under pressure to perform at a fast pace for long      periods. And at first, it works. It turns you into wonder      person. You can do everything--for a while.''       Crack, wicked as it is, cannot compare to the destructive      power of methamphetamine, Dr. Abrams said, He said the drug,      because of its molecular structure, is more stimulating to      the brain than any other drug.       The effects of cocaine, whether snorted or smoked, might be      gone from the brain in 5 or 10 minutes, Dr. Abrams said,      while methamphetamine continues to work on receptors in the      brain for 8 to 24 hours.       The price of the drug here might be $100 a gram, about the      same as that for powdered cocaine, but would last a user for      a week while the cocaine would probably be used in a day.       Cocaine, which comes from the coca plant, is a natural      substance. Methamphetamine is purely synthetic. ``The body      has enzymes that break down cocaine,'' he said, ``but not      with methamphetamine.''       Methamphetamine causes psychotic and violent reactions, he      said, because the drug throws out of control the production      of the brain chemical dopamine, which plays an important part      in movement, thought and emotion, as is the case with      schizophrenia. Over time, the drug damages the brain.       ``A person addicted to this stuff looks and acts exactly      like a paranoid schizophrenic,'' he said. ``You cannot tell      any difference.''       He said that a crack addict could reach the same point of      psychotic behavior but that it would take ``much longer and      much more of the drug.''       The drug, combined with the effects of sleep deprivation,      can cause people to go mad, with ghastly consequences. In a      case last July, a man in New Mexico, who was high on      methamphetamine and alcohol, beheaded his 14-year-old son and      tossed the severed head from his van window onto a busy      highway.       The drug has already exacted a big death toll in Western      states. In California, it was blamed for more than 400 deaths      from overdose and suicide in 1994, the latest year with      complete records on the drug. In Phoenix, it killed 122      people in 1994, the authorities said.       Here in Iowa, the ravages of the drug have reached what      law-enforcement and health officials call an epidemic level.      The police in Des Moines seized $4.5 million worth of      methamphetamine in the last year alone.       And for the first time in Polk County, which includes Des      Moines, arrests for drugs now surpass the number of arrests      for drunken driving. Methamphetamine accounts for 65 percent      of the drug arrests.       The drug is often manufactured in makeshift laboratories in      rural areas, where the stench given off during its production      is more likely to go undetected, and where law-enforcement      agencies are more thinly spread.       Drug agents found seven such laboratories in Iowa last      year. In the first six weeks of this year, they found five      more. One of them, in a house trailer near the small town of      Centerville, exploded and burned a man over 40 percent of his      body.       The drug is also making its way into schools throughout      Iowa, with some ghastly consequences.       One night about a year ago, 17-year-old Travis Swope of      Waterloo sat down with his parents, Tim and Keely, and began      to tremble. ``I'm scared,'' the boy told them. He said he      could not eat or sleep, and that he had been taking a drug      called crank.       His parents, who had never heard of the drug, were shocked,      but supportive. Mr. Swope, a maintenance worker at the John      Deere Company, said his union insurance would cover drug      treatment. The next day, however, Travis said he would quit      on his own. And his parents believed him.       ``I was in denial,'' Mr. Swope said. ``I though it was      something he'd get through.''       Travis, who was a first-rate athlete, seemed better for a      while. But then he lost weight and looked pale, all the while      insisting that he was not using drugs. Then this manner      changed.       ``He had never been disrespectful to us,'' his mother said.      ``But all of a sudden, he'd be like, `I'll be home when I      decide to come home!' That wasn't Travis. It was like he was      a different kid.''       At the end of September, there was a blow-up with his      father, and Travis was told to leave the house.       On Oct. 6, Travis checked into a hospital, feeling as if he      had a terrible case of the flue. In fact, the drug had broken      down his immune system and he had developed a form of      meningitis. Ten days later, he was dead.       ``Learn about this drug, and sit down with your sons and      daughters,'' said Mrs. Swope, her voice breaking with emotion      as she talked with a reporter. ``I learned way too late, and      I feel like I failed him. Travis was a really good kid--not a      perfect kid. He made some wrong decisions, and this drug      sucked him away.''       Mr. Swope said there were times he avoided discussions      about drugs with his son, because he feared it would lead to      a confrontation. ``But I would give everything to have him      sitting here now,'' he said, ``being mad at me.''       While it seems puzzling why otherwise intelligent people      would risk ruining their lives with this poison, drug      counselors point out that stimulants have long held appeal in      American culture. Going back more than a generation,      students, athletes and workers have sought endurance by      taking ``uppers'' or ``speed'' in tablets called Black      Cadillacs or White Crosses.       The old country song by Dave Dudley, ``Six Days on the      Road,'' spoke in the voice of a long-haul trucker in a big      hurry: ``I'm taking little white pills, and my eyes are open      wide.''       Methamphetamine made inroads among many blue-collar people      because it did not carry the stigma of being a hard drug, the      authorities said.       ``Crack has the stigma of being an inner-city drug, and      powder cocaine is thought to be for affluent people,'' said      Mike Balmer, the chief deputy sheriff in Jasper County. ``But      speed was a working-class drug. It's what people used to get      them through a shift at the factory or keep up on a      construction site.''       Indeed, the use of methamphetamine goes back many years,      perhaps to the 20' or 30's. But today's form is farm more      powerful, and deadly.       Years ago, the authorities said, a typical street does of      methamphetamine consisted of perhaps 20 percent of ephedrine,      the ingredient that delivers the kick. New methods that     emerged in the late 1980's and early 90's often using a      synthetic psuedoephedrine, have yielded a much more potent      substance. Now the drug contains over 90 percent of the      active ingredient.       Even before the big influx of methamphetamine, the use of      stimulants was a problem in Iowa. A public health survey in      1993 found that the use of stimulants like amphetamines among      Iowans was twice the national average, a finding that caused      some scholars to wonder if an intense Midwestern work ethic      was mainly to blame.       The latest statistics show that more than 35 percent of the      people going to Iowa prisons last year reported using      methamphetamine. And 90 percent of the people being committed      to the mental health facilities in Polk County have used      methamphetamine.       In some cases, the psychotic behavior provoked by the drug      becomes permanent. The drug also causes body sores, which are      worsened by the incessant scratching by users who feel like      bugs are crawling over their bodies.       To fight the drug, Iowa has begun a radio and television      advertising campaign to warn people of the dangers. A new      prosecutor has been added to the United States Attorney's      office in Des Moines, just to concentrate on drugs. At least      five counties in Iowa have hired extra prosecutors to deal      with the rising tide of methamphetamine cases.       ``They haven't seen much of this in the East Coast,'' said      Tom Murtha, the director of the First Step-Mercy Franklin      Center, an alcohol and drug treatment center. ``But it's      coming.''
