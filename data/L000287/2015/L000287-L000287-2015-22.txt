Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 709. This legislation removes certain protections that are otherwise available to Federal employees if an employee conducts his or her official duties with the intent to extract personal gain or for a political purpose.  H.R. 709 responds to the investigation into the processing of tax-exempt applications. This investigation started nearly 2 years ago, in May of 2013. To date, the agency has spent more than $20 million to produce more than 1.3 million pages of documents, including 78,000 emails from Lois Lerner.  Mr. Speaker, to date, there has not been one shred of evidence produced to support the Republican claim that the processing of applications was politically motivated or intended to target the President's political enemies.  The inspector general even stated that no one outside the agency was involved in setting the criteria for processing tax-exempt applications. The delays experienced by groups were the result of incompetence at the agency in the Exempt Organizations Division.  I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``yes'' for H.R. 709.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
