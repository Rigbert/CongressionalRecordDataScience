 SESSIONS. I would be delighted to.  Mr. McCONNELL. It occurs to the Senator from Kentucky, in listening to observations of the Senator from Alabama, what has evolved in America is that we believe we are a society of victims, everybody is a victim? If somebody is wrong in my life, if I have a bad outcome in my life, it must be somebody else's fault. So beyond the obvious abuse of the legal system, it encourages the notion that personal responsibility is no longer a factor in American life.  I ask my friend from Alabama if he is also disturbed about this growing notion that I have no responsibility for the outcomes in my life, if anything goes wrong it must be somebody else's fault and obviously the solution to that is to sue.
