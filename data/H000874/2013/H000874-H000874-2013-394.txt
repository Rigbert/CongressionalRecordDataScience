Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Rev. Roderick McClanahan, and the dedication of the First Missionary Baptist Church's newest house of worship. For over 20 years the Reverend has served as Pastor of the First Missionary Baptist Church, and has lead this congregation in the Building project which resulted in this church.  Rev. McClanahan was born in Louisiana where he received a calling from God at a young age, preaching his first sermon on September 4, 1984, and eventually becoming ordained at the New Morning Star Missionary Baptist Church, under the leadership of Rev. Willie Minor, on September 21, 1985. He was brought to Maryland shortly thereafter, and has officially served as pastor of the First Missionary Baptist Church since March of 1990.  The First Missionary Baptist Church has a rich history in Maryland. The church was started as a Prayer Band in October of 1945 by Martha Hickenbotom, as a way of giving the African Americans of Lexington Park a place of worship. Service was initially held in the home of Mr. and Mrs. Lester Colson, but as the congregation grew, so did their need for space. For a brief time the Prayer Band made their home in the then USO Building, until on April 19, 1947, at the suggestion of Brother Ivory Moore, then the prayer leader for the Prayer Band, they purchased the first acre of land the church calls home today. Since then, through segregation and beyond, the church has continued to grow and faithfully serve the African American community of Southern Maryland.  It is truly my honor to pay tribute today to Rev. Roderick McClanahan, and the First Missionary Baptist Church, a shining beacon for all of Southern Maryland.                          ____________________
