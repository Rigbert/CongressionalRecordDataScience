 14, the Energy bill. Under the previous order, there will be 2\1/2\ hours of debate remaining on the Cantwell amendment. Following the disposition of that amendment, there will be 60 minutes prior to the cloture vote on the Estrada nomination. This will be the seventh cloture vote on the Estrada nomination. Following that vote, the Senate will resume consideration of the electricity amendment. It is expected that the Senate will be able to act on the two Bingaman second-degree amendments in a relatively short period of time. It is hoped that following those amendments, we will be able to reach an agreement as to when the Senate can dispose of the underlying electricity amendment, and the chairman will continue to work toward that agreement tomorrow. Senators should expect a very busy day tomorrow as the Senate continues to work through the energy-related amendments.                          ____________________
