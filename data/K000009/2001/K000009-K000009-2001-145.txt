Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I would just like to say to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Davis) and to the chairman of the subcommittee that I do believe the gentlewoman has really brought up an issue that we never have considered, never were asked to consider during our regular hearings and so forth.  I think this does involve also the authorizing of the Committee on Education and the Workforce since they have jurisdiction over the school lunch program, the free and reduced lunch program, although we have jurisdiction over the expenditures for that.  Knowing that some of our military personnel are extremely pressed, even some eligible for food stamps when serving the Government of the United States at points around the world, it would seem to me that we should find a way to encourage the Department of Education, the Department of Agriculture to treat our military personnel with the respect that they deserve.  I want to compliment the gentlewoman for bringing this issue to the attention of our subcommittee and pledge my own cooperation with her in resolving this in the weeks and months ahead, and certainly also encourage her to testify before the Committee on Education and the Workforce as well as the authorizing Committee on Agriculture.  We here on the Committee on Appropriations will continue to work with the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Davis) as we move to conference with the other body.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Does the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Davis) intend to withdraw her amendment?
