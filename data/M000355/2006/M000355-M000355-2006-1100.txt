 President, I ask my colleagues to pause for a moment today to commemorate the life and sacrifice of SGT Ryan Jay Montgomery.  Sergeant Montgomery of Greensburg, KY, served with the 623rd Field Artillery in the Kentucky Army National Guard. On July 3, 2005, he gave his life in defense of our country near Baghdad, Iraq. He had served his Nation as a citizen-soldier for almost 5 years. He was 22 years old.  On that day in July, Sergeant Montgomery and two of his fellow Kentucky National Guard soldiers were returning from escorting a supply convoy when, just outside of Baghdad, a roadside bomb struck his humvee. The other two soldiers were injured; sadly, Sergeant Montgomery was killed.  For his valiant service, Sergeant Montgomery was awarded the Bronze Star Medal, the Purple Heart, and the Combat Action Badge. He had previously received both the Army Commendation Medal and the Armed Forces Reserve Medal. And he was awarded the Kentucky Distinguished Service Medal, for demonstrating all the qualities of a great soldier, remaining combat-focused while decisively engaged with the enemy, performing his duties and accomplishing his mission.  While a student at Green County High School, Sergeant Montgomery started a Junior ROTC program there, for kids interested in a military career. The discipline and purpose of Army life appealed to him, so young Ryan decided he could better himself through joining the Guard. Enlisting before he finished high school, he hoped to use money from the Guard to help him pay for his education necessary to realize his goal of becoming an architect.  Ryan's mother, Patricia Montgomery, said that Ryan's service in the Kentucky National Guard could ``give him a better start in life.'' His twin brother, Bryan, who never strayed far from his brother's side, was so impressed by the opportunities the military gave his brother that he, too, decided to serve, and ended up a member of Bravo Battery, First Battalion, in the 623rd Field Artillery--the same unit as his brother Ryan.  Before he was deployed to Iraq, Ryan worked two jobs in addition to hiswork with the Guard. He was training with the Green County Fire and Rescue Team, to become a volunteer firefighter. He also helped out with the junior ROTC program at Green County High that he had formed, teaching classes and encouraging the students who were following his example to serve their country.  Sergeant Montgomery was deployed to Iraq in January 2005. Ryan and his unit were charged with escorting the many supply convoys which traveled in and out of Baghdad, often a hazardous assignment, and also searching for the enemy or their deadly roadside bombs. Sergeant Montgomery successfully took part in 130 missions. As his father, Raymond Montgomery said, ``He really felt like he was doing good over there. He absolutely loved it.'' Before deploying to Iraq, Ryan's unit also served in Kuwait.  During his downtime in Iraq, Ryan could most often be found working on his humvee with his twin brother Bryan, who served as a mechanic for the 623rd. He would also write or e-mail the folks back home, or he would talk or watch a movie with his brother Bryan. The two didn't get a lot of free time together in Iraq, but they usually saw each other every day.  Born in Greensburg, where he lived his whole life and which is the county seat of Green County, Ryan and Bryan were known as twin cut-ups, according to their mom, Patricia. She recalls that the two identical brothers would often switch clothes to confuse family friends and babysitters.  Patricia remembers that Ryan taught Bryan how to ride a bike when the two were little. As a child, Ryan loved family dinners. And he loved to make people laugh. ``If you see someone without a smile, give them yours''--that was Ryan's motto, according to his mother. Bryan recalled, ``My brother and I always lived like a laugh could solve anything.''  Both Ryan and Bryan played the great American pastime--Little League--as kids. What they may have lacked in athleticism, they made up for in enthusiasm. ``They were average athletes,'' says John Durham, the boys' Little League coach. ``But I don't think there was another member of the team that had as much fun out there playing than they did.''  In high school, Ryan played in the marching band in addition to his work with Junior ROTC. He played the trumpet and Bryan played the tuba and the trombone. And he liked to go hunting with his dad.  Ryan was also interested in truck-pulling. As a kid, Ryan's dad took him and his brother to truck pulls at local fairs. It was something that naturally appealed to both boys, and when he was old enough, Ryan bought a Chevy S-10 that all three men worked to modify together.  After Ryan's death, Bryan continued his brother's project, driving the truck they had collaborated on to victory in a truck pull that was dedicated to Ryan in Temple Hill, KY. It was the same competition that Ryan had won in 2004 with the same truck. After winning, Bryan said, ``It felt great to follow in Ryan's success like that.''  Ryan left behind a loving family who will forever treasure his memory. We thank his father, Raymond Montgomery, his mother, Patricia Montgomery, and his brother, Bryan Montgomery, for sharing their stories of Ryan with us. We are also thinking of Ryan's sister, Ashley Montgomery, and his stepmother, Sharon Montgomery, today.  I want to leave my colleagues with the words of SGT Ryan Montgomery himself. These words were found on his computer in Iraq. He wrote:       This place is a roller coaster ride; you never know what is      going [to] happen next. It's scary when you think about it.      But I pray every night for every soldier who has given their      freedom to free these people.  Ryan continued:       I pray for my family and every blessing God [has] put in my      life. [It's] hard to live day to day, not knowing what the      next day holds. I just pray and carry on with the mission. I      didn't think this place was going [to affect] me like it has.      I'm a different person, but for the good.  Words cannot describe the overflowing of gratitude, and pride, and honor one feels after reading this young man's words. Nor can they describe the depths of sorrow we feel at his loss. Sergeant Montgomery's courage was so strong that, even amidst the ``roller coaster'' of battle, he was able to hold on to his love of God, his family, and his mission to spread freedom.  I ask my colleagues to join me today in saying that America can never repay the debt we owe SGT Ryan Montgomery or the Montgomery family. We are truly blessed to live in a country where so many brave men and women, like Ryan, volunteer to face hardship out of the love of freedom, and love for the rest of us.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________[Pages S2678-S2679]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES                        sergeant ryan montgomery  Mr. McCONNELL.
