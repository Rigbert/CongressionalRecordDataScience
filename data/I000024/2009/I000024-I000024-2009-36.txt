President, first of all, let me say to my friend from Texas, the wake-up call is out there. People are fully aware of what is going on right now--the fact that you have a government option; you have a form of socialized medicine; you have something that has proven not to work in areas such as Canada and Great Britain and elsewhere. It is kind of interesting to me that we see those countries trying to emulate something we are doing at the same time we are edging over in their direction. I do not think that is going to work.                          ____________________
