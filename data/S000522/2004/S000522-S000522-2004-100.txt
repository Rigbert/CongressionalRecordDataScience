Creek Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center.''  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 4836       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Any      reference to that medical center in any law, regulation, map,      document, record, or other paper of the United States shall      be considered to be a reference to the Thomas E.
