 President, let me be the first to congratulate the junior Senator from Florida on his thoughtful and very persuasive initial speech here in the Senate.  I think I can safely say, after observing his work for the last 5 weeks, that the people of Florida are very fortunate to have such an intelligent and insightful Senator. He is doing an excellent job on their behalf. I again congratulate him on his initial speech here in the Senate.
