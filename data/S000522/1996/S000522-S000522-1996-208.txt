Mr. Speaker, Let me begin by thanking Chairman Tom Bliley for truly going the extra mile today; for his willingness to understand and address issues that are so vital to some of our States. I especially want to thank Mr. Bliley for the statesmanlike approach embodied in this compromise in meeting the legitimate needs of our colleagues intent on restricting the flow of waste into their States. And special thanks to Chairman Mike Oxley--in the House no one has worked as tenaciously as he on interstate waste legislation. And finally, special thanks to Chairman Jerry Solomon, who has worked hard to facilitate this bill.  After 20 months of toil and good faith compromises by all sides of the issue, we are here today with a modest, extremely narrow, rescue bill for locales throughout the country who have waste management systems predicated on flow control and tied to public debt.  Over $20 billion of public bonds and obligations of local communities and investors are today in grave jeopardy and desperately need this solution we are proposing. Our local governments--charged with managing their waste--are in desperate situations warranting immediate action.  The festering crisis dictates that we wait no more and fast-track this emergency debt protection remedy.  For communities across the country--who saw a legislative remedy vanish in the waning hours of the 103d Congress, a casualty of a failed UC request in the Senate--this is their only hope.  Make no mistake, this legislation does not establish a broad authority for flow control. Instead it prescribes a narrow grant of authority and phases out of such activity allowing communities to make a smooth transition and ensuring that investments in public projects do not go belly up.  Under the bill flow control is permitted for the limited purpose of paying off outstanding bonds and that is it. According to the EPA, less than 20 percent--one-fifth--of the solid waste market is expected to receive some type of protection under this flow control bill. And as each day passes, and municipalities pay off their bonds, this small share of the market will continue to diminish until it reaches zero.  No one likes it when rules of the game change in midstream.  The Carbone decision vitiated waste flow authority after States and local governments had devised comprehensive waste management plans--at the behest of the Federal Government--which relied on that authority to make the plan economically viable. In other words, decisions were made and funds expended or obligated based on assumptions that disappeared on May 16, 1994--the date the Carbone opinion was handed down.  In the post-Carbone world, communities still have the responsibility to manage garbage--that is: collect, treat, and dispose of it--but some may no longer have the tools to carry it out efficiently.  Flow control has been a difficult issue for the past 2 years because local governments and private industry have different opinions on how much of flow control is a good thing. State and local government organizations have historically supported the continuation of flow control authority as an important prerogative of State and local government and the best tool for safe and environmentally sound disposal of garbage. Members of the private waste industry believe there should be no constraints on the movement of waste.  The bill before us today has opted for the private enterprise position--prohibiting any future flow control. The bill is drafted as an extremely narrow grandfather--allowing flow control only in jurisdictions that exercised it, designated the waste facility to receive the waste, and sold bonds--or executed put-or-pay contracts--to finance the facility--all prior to the Carbone decision. And once the bonds are paid off, with the narrow exception of retrofits mandated under the Clean Air Act, flow control ends forever.  Importantly, because these flow control provisions are so narrow, they have achieved support from significant stakeholders on this issue: the national organizations representing State and local government interests, such as the National Association of Counties and the Solid Waste Association of North America; major companies from the waste industry, such as Waste Management Technologies, Inc. and Browning Ferris Industries; and the Public Securities Association, representing the concerns of bond holders and issuers. While all of them have a different bill of perfection in mind, they have reached a compromise that they can live with.  The situation in my home county of Mercer illustrates how urgent the situation is.  At present, Mercer has incurred debt obligations of over $189 million to finance the project, with approximately $100 million more needed for completion of the project.  Carbone has put the entire undertaking on the shelf and costs to build the waste-to-energy facility have increased by over $4 million. Accordingly to Mercer County executive, Bob Prunetti, each day of irresolution of this issue costs an additional $20,000 per day.  In the 20 months that we have been debating the perfect flow control and interstate provisions, Mercer County's bonds have been downgraded and, last week on January 25, permits for the construction of our facility expired. The authority has petitioned the New Jersey State Department of Environmental Protection for an extension of this permit. It is unclear, at this time, whether or not there is precedence for such an extension.  My State with our landfills nearing full capacity and with more than 2.1 million tons exported per year to other States has attempted to act responsibly and earnestly to resolve our waste disposal problems and become self-sufficient. My county of Mercer exports 300,000 tons to Bucks County, PA, just across the river.  If we are able to proceed with our waste-to-energy project at least 220,000 tons of municipal sold waste will stay in Mercer County to be incinerated. That, it seems to me, nips the problem at the source.  And let me remind Members that self-sufficiency has been our goal for 20 years and flow control was--is--the requisite to achieving that goal. Nearly two decades ago, the State of New Jersey took the initiative to limit its exports on its own. The State's comprehensive solid waste management plan is meant to achieve self-sufficiency by the year 2000. But the plan hinges on the use of limited flow control--without it, it just ain't gonna' happen. And worse, our 2.1 million tons of cross-State waste will only increase.  Mercer's bond downgrading has not been unique. Other communities around the Nation especially Pennsylvania, Florida, California, New York, New Hampshire, and Illinois have had their credit ratings downgraded or have been put on credit watch because they have lost the ability to flow control.  Mr. Speaker, Members of Congress anxious to pass tough interstate restrictions on the transport of garbage, take note: I respectfully submit this is your opportunity to advance that prospect since you will get your day in conference with this legislation. Yet, I am here to tell you that passage of flow control authority by this Congress--temporarily delinked from interstate--will only help alleviate the need to export garbage.  The Environmental Protection Agency's [EPA] study on flow control, released last year unequivocally states that: ``Flow control is one mechanism that State and local governments can use to foster development of in-State capacity to manage municipal solid waste.''  To my friends who are disappointed that the interstate provisions will be considered on a day other than today let me say that I have no qualms with limiting interstate waste. There is a symbolic relationship, however that should not be overlooked. If the goal of my friends in the Midwest and Pennsylvania is to ban the interstate transport of waste, then by all means you should support efforts to allow States to flow control waste within their own borders. This, of course, will diminish the urgency to transport garbage outside of the State.  In closing, Mr. Speaker, I remind our colleagues that the clock is ticking. I am hopeful that like the Senate, this body will now move on a proposal that offers real relief to communities in debt.                              {time}  1445
