  Our economy needs a shot in the arm. The GDP is declining, consumer confidence is at a 7-year low, and consumer spending has slowed to its lowest level in 8 years. But consumer spending is just what we need to get our economy going again. In fact, two-thirds of our economy depends on consumer spending.  Today, we are proposing an innovative way to get Americans back into stores and to get our economy back on its feet. What we are proposing is a national sales tax holiday, a 10-day period where every American can shop without having to pay a State sales tax.  The national sales tax holiday will save one money on everything from cars and computers to books and baby clothes. It will boost retail sales and consumer confidence, and it will help everyone in the retail chain, from assembly line workers and truck drivers to shelf stockers and sales people.  This national sales tax holiday we are proposing is immediate. Every American can take advantage of it. It will not break the bank, and it will directly stimulate our economy by boosting sales and supporting retail, transportation, and manufacturing jobs throughout our entire country.  Many businesses rely on the holiday season to make it through the year, and many workers count on those retail jobs before the holidays. Our bill will help both. Even before September 11, this was shaping up to be a very difficult time for retail businesses and the thousands of workers they employ. This sales tax holiday will give our economy a shot in the arm and will give families a break when they need it the most.  Our bill sets the date of the tax holiday from November 23 to December 2. That is the traditional start of the holiday shopping season. Many Americans are looking for ways to support our country. With the sales tax holiday, we can help jump-start our economy by buying things for school, for work, or for home.  It is all so easy. You do not have to wait for a check. You do not have to fit into a certain income tax bracket. You buy what you need, you put someone to work, you give our country a boost, and you save money.  Seven States, plus the District of Columbia, have used these sales tax holidays, and they have had great results. Under our approach, the Federal Government will reimburse States for the lost sales tax revenue. Right now we estimate the cost to be about $6.5 billion, depending on how many States participate and how strongly consumers respond.  Under our plan, every penny of the $6.5 billion will go directly into the economy.  In the coming weeks, the Senate will debate legislation to stimulate the American economy and to help workers who have lost their jobs as a result of the economic downturn. The final product needs to stimulate additional economic activity. It needs to boost consumer confidence and spending. It needs to encourage business investment and job creation. It needs to address the needs of workers and their families who have lost their jobs. It must maintain a commitment to fiscal discipline and the long-term economic health of this Nation. And it should help return the country to a sense of normalcy.  I believe the legislation I am introducing today with Senator Snowe can be an important part of a balanced economic stimulus package.  First, our proposal will stimulate economic activity and consumer confidence. States and businesses that have participated in sales tax holidays reported an increase in sales during their sales tax holiday. Most importantly, businesses have found that consumers do not just shift their spending to the holiday period, but these holidays create new spending that would not have otherwise occurred.  Second, our proposal will stimulate business investment and job creation. Retail businesses will need to boost inventories to prepare for larger crowds. That is good news for manufacturers, distributors, and other businesses that help meet consumer demand for all kinds of products.  Third, it benefits all Americans. Low, middle, and upper income people all pay sales taxes on the products they buy, and since the sales tax is the most regressive kind of tax, lower income consumers will benefit the most.  Our proposal is fiscally responsible. This tax holiday will last for no more than 10 days in any State and, therefore, there are no exploding costs in the long term.  Our proposal does not negatively affect State and local budgets. Here, in fact, is how the States will get reimbursed: Every State that participates in the holiday will receive a quick payment of their estimated lost revenue. Before the tax holiday, a State can decide if it wants to be reimbursed for the exact amount of its loss. Then after the tax holiday, those States would go through a reconciliation process with the Federal Government.  We need a sales tax holiday. The economic slowdown and other factors are having a tremendous impact on the ability of State and local governments to provide critical services and to help working families who have been hurt by higher unemployment. That is why I have worked very hard to make sure that the Federal Government will fully compensate the States that take advantage of this holiday. In addition, our plan is optional so States can choose to opt in if they want to stimulate their own economy.  Even without Federal incentives, seven States and the District of Columbia have already used sales tax holidays to help working families buy school clothes, computers, and to stimulate economic activity.  This will help return this country to a sense of normalcy. Our Nation, and each of our lives, have been changed forever by the events of September 11. We can never go back to September 10. Those events reminded us how fragile life is. They reminded us of everything for which we have to be thankful--our family, our friends, our faith, our communities, and our democracy. But as we celebrate these important things during the upcoming holiday season, I believe it is important that we not feel guilty about getting back to business and to our daily lives.  President Bush has urged all of us in the wake of the September 11 attacks to return to our daily lives and get back to business. I believe this legislation will help us get the Nation back to business. It is fair, it is responsible, it will help families, and it will stimulate our economy.  I urge my colleagues to support including it in the economic stimulus package.  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1643       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Sales Tax Holiday Act of      2001''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) Consumer confidence and spending is critical to a      healthy United States economy.       (2) In order to prevent a further decline in consumer      spending, which fell 1.8 percent in September 2001, and      consumer confidence, which is at its lowest level since      February 1994, the Federal Government needs to provide an      immediate and targeted tax incentive to encourage consumer      spending.       (3) The most immediate and targeted incentive for      consumption would be to reduce the price of goods to      consumers, which can be done most effectively by removing      sales taxes imposed on those goods.       (4) A 10-day sales tax holiday, prior to the 2001 Holiday      season, would encourage Americans to make immediate purchases      and help to counteract the decline in consumer confidence      Americans have experienced since September 11, 2001. The      direct boost to consumption resulting from a sales tax      holiday     would enhance the benefits of individual tax cuts provided by      any Federal tax stimulus legislation.       (5) A State and local sales tax holiday would allow all      taxpayers to benefit, especially lower-income Americans who      spend a larger portion of their income.       (6) To encourage a State and local sales tax holiday, the      Federal Government should ensure that each participating      State and local government receives fast and fair      reimbursement for lost sales tax revenue.       (7) Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Iowa,      Connecticut, Maryland, Ohio, North Carolina, and the District      of Columbia currently provide consumers with similar      temporary sales tax holidays. Consumer response to these      holidays has been extraordinary, with retailers reporting      greatly increased foot traffic in stores as well as an      increase in incremental retail sales.
