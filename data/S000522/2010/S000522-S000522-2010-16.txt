Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of the resolution honoring the 2500th anniversary of the Battle of Marathon in ancient Greece. This resolution celebrates the victory in the battle--against all odds--by Greek citizens opposing the overwhelming Persian force in the year 450 B.C.  The Battle of Marathon has been cited by historians as one of the pivotal events in ancient European history. The victory at Marathon marked the end of the Persian invasion of Greece. The following years of peace allowed the Greek city-states and the Greek nation to create the philosophy of democratic rule and establish the arts and sciences for which classical Greece is renowned to this day.  The commitment of the Greek warriors to protect their homeland from Persian invasion summoned within them the strength to withstand the attack through 5 long days of battle, and to finally overcome the invading force.  It was that same commitment to victory, Madam Speaker, that propelled a Greek messenger to run over 26 miles without a break in order to deliver the good news of the victory to the people of Athens. That incredible feat has inspired many in the modern age to emulate that runner's achievement--and I have run one marathon, Madam Speaker--with the first marathon races begun in 1896 and following that runner's course from Marathon to Athens.  I want to thank Mr. McGovern for sponsoring this very timely resolution.  I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1510
