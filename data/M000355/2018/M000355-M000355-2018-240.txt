 President, it is my pleasure today to recognize one of the greatest voices for Kentucky's agricultural communities, the Kentucky Farm Bureau, KFB, as it prepares to commemorate its centennial year. With a mission to identify the challenges facing farmers, to improve farm income, and to enhance the quality of life for growers, processors, and all of us who enjoy the fruits of their labors, the KFB has been a force for good throughout my home State. Since its establishment almost 100 years ago, the KFB has done all of this and more. I am so proud to have this opportunity to congratulate the men and women of the KFB on this impressive milestone.  In 1919, a small group of Kentucky farmers gathered in Louisville to form an organization to serve as the ``Voice of Kentucky Agriculture.'' Beginning as a member-based and member-driven organization, the KFB has proudly kept to its founding vision, striving each day to uphold that same goal.  In the last 100 years, the KFB has grown beyond anything its founders could have imagined. With nearly 500,000 members, the organization maintains a presence in all 120 counties in the Commonwealth. The KFB has developed many service programs to benefit its members and other parts of the agricultural community. These services include providing crop insurance products, Young Farmers development, public affairs representation, and estate planning assistance, just to name a few. As it celebrates its centennial year, the KFB can also be proud of being one of the largest State Farm Bureaus throughout the entire Nation.  Since my first day serving in the U.S. Senate, I have had the opportunity to be Kentucky's champion on the Senate Agriculture Committee. Every step of the way, the KFB has helped guide my work on that committee on behalf of my State's farm families. Through several agricultural bills--and countless fly-ins, the KFB has proved to be a partner I can rely upon to support Kentucky farmers. We have accomplished a great deal, and I look forward to many more projects we can work on together.  One particular event I look forward to each year is the KFB's annual country ham breakfast during the Kentucky State Fair. I make it a point to attend every year possible so I can not only have the opportunity to enjoy the delicious food, but also to spend quality time with the many friends of Kentucky agriculture I have gotten to know over the years. The tradition began in 1964 as a way to showcase our agricultural products during the Kentucky State Fair, and it has grown into one of the Nation's premier agricultural events. Each year, thousands of Kentuckians from across the Commonwealth gather to enjoy some of the best locally sourced food our State's farmers have to offer. The morning culminates in a charity auction of the blue-ribbon country ham. This year, the winning bid was a record-breaking $2.8 million to be donated to Kentucky charities. While the ham breakfast may be among its best-known public events, it is just one example of the KFB's many accomplishments.  Throughout 2019, I hear the KFB plans to celebrate its century of successes on behalf of Kentucky's farmers. I would like to recognize the contributions of the organization's leadership, in particular Mark Haney and his executive team. They are wonderful representatives of the KFB and proud advocates for farmers. With their guidance, the KFB has a bright future ahead.  I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in the recognition of the KFB, its members, and all who have benefited from its century of service to Kentucky. The organization's unmatched dedication to farmers and commitment to agricultural advancement continuesto serve the KFB's mission well. I look forward to its continued successes, and I am grateful for the chance to publicly join the KFB in celebrating this anniversary and to offer my thanks for everything it does to support farm families in the Commonwealth.                          ____________________
