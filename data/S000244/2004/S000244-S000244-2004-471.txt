Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 56) supporting the goals of the Japanese American, German American, and Italian American communities in recognizing a National Day of Remembrance to increase public awareness of the events surrounding the restriction, exclusion, and internment of individuals and families during World War II.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H. Res. 56       Whereas President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed      Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942, which authorized      the exclusion of 120,000 Japanese Americans and legal      resident aliens from the west coast of the United States and      the internment of United States citizens and legal permanent      residents of Japanese ancestry in internment camps during      World War II;       Whereas the freedom of Italian Americans and German      Americans was also restricted during World War II by measures      that branded them enemy aliens and included required      identification cards, travel restrictions, seizure of      personal property, and internment;       Whereas President Gerald Ford formally rescinded Executive      Order 9066 on February 19, 1976, in his speech, ``An American      Promise'';       Whereas Congress adopted legislation which was signed by      President Jimmy Carter on July 31, 1980, establishing the      Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians      to investigate the claim that the incarceration of Japanese      Americans and legal resident aliens during World War II was      justified by military necessity;       Whereas the Commission held 20 days of hearings and heard      from over 750 witnesses on this matter and published its      findings in a report entitled ``Personal Justice Denied'';       Whereas the conclusion of the Commission was that the      promulgation of Executive Order 9066 was not justified by      military necessity, and that the decision to issue the order      was shaped by ``race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure      of political leadership'';       Whereas Congress enacted the Civil Liberties Act of 1988,      in which it apologized on behalf of the Nation for      ``fundamental violations of the basic civil liberties and      constitutional rights of these individuals of Japanese      ancestry'';       Whereas President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties      Act of 1988 into law on August 10, 1988, proclaiming that day      to be a ``great day for America'';       Whereas the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 established the      Civil Liberties Public Education Fund, the purpose of which      is ``to sponsor research and public educational activities      and to publish and distribute the hearings, findings, and      recommendations of the Commission on Wartime Relocation and      Internment of Civilians so that the events surrounding the      exclusion, forced removal, and internment of civilians and      permanent resident aliens of Japanese ancestry will be      remembered, and so that the causes and circumstances of this      and similar events may be illuminated and understood'';       Whereas Congress adopted the Wartime Violation of Italian      Americans Civil Liberties Act, which was signed by President      Bill Clinton on November 7, 2000, which included provisions      which resulted in a report containing detailed information on      the types of violations that occurred, as well as lists of      individuals of Italian ancestry that were arrested, detained,      and interned;       Whereas the Japanese American community recognizes a      National Day of Remembrance on February 19th of each year to      educate the public about the lessons learned from the      internment to ensure that it never happens again; and       Whereas the Day of Remembrance provides an opportunity for      all people to reflect on the importance of justice and civil      liberties during times of uncertainty and emergency: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--       (1) recognizes the historical significance of February 19,      1942, the date Executive Order 9066 was signed by President      Roosevelt, restricting the freedom of Japanese Americans,      German Americans, and Italian Americans, and legal resident      aliens through required identification cards, travel      restrictions, seizure of personal property, and internment;      and       (2) supports the goals of the Japanese American, German      American, and Italian American communities in recognizing a      National Day of Remembrance to increase public awareness of      these events.
