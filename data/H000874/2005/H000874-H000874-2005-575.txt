Leader, I appreciate that observation. I agree with the gentleman from Texas. In light of the fact it is the first time that we will have considered an authorization bill from this committee and for this department since its formation as a separate piece of legislation, it would, hopefully, be one that would be open to perfection and amendment, if possible. So we will hear from the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions) shortly on that.  Prior to Memorial Day, can you tell us, Mr. Leader, what appropriation bills you anticipate coming to the floor prior to that Memorial Day break?  We are going to have, obviously, Homeland Security and Interior next week. Do you know which bills you might be considering?  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay).  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding.  As the gentleman knows, serving on committee, the committee has a very ambitious schedule, and it hopes to complete all 11 bills coming out of its committee by the Fourth of July recess, meaning all 11 bills out of the House by the Fourth of July recess. So, in addition to managing the two bills on the floor next week, the committee intends to mark up both the Military Quality of Life and the Energy and Water bills. So we would anticipate, if things go well, those two bills being on the floor the following week.
