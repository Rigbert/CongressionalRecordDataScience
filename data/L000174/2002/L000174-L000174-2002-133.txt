President, my colleague, Senator Jeffords, introduced legislation, the Lake Champlain Basin Program Act of 2002, in honor of former Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. With the forbearance of the distinguished Senator from Connecticut and the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, I will only speak for a couple minutes.  I, obviously, strongly support what Senator Jeffords has done and appreciate his work and the work of the members of his staff.  In Vermont, we are extremely pleased with the success of the Lake Champlain program to date. With the additional resources in this bill, we are confident that the problems that Lake Champlain encounters--the problems of pollution and of other matters--can be addressed.  Lake Champlain is a magnificent lake standing between Vermont and New York. It is a lake that is enjoyed by people who fish, sail, who are involved in economic activities, and, of course, it has tremendous economic and historical value to this Nation, from the time of the Revolutionary War on.  The basin program shows what happens when two States, Vermont and New York, and one province, the Province of Quebec, get together and work on a common watershed and link their people, their governments--local, State, and Federal--together in almost unprecedented cooperation to save this great big beautiful lake. It has been a model for watersheds throughout the Nation.  I am pleased to join in introducing this legislation. I believe it will ensure that our children and our grandchildren will enjoy this lake in the same way Senator Jeffords and I did when we were children.  I am very pleased to join with my colleagues from Vermont and New York as we introduce the Lake Champlain Basin Program Act of 2002 in honor of former Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.  I was with Senator Moynihan in 1990 that we were able to enact the first comprehensive piece of legislation to make Federal resources available to help our states address the challenges facing Lake Champlain.  I want to thank Senator Jeffords and his staff for all the work they have put into this effort. I know that many hours have gone into the research, discussion and editing to get where we are today.  I also want to thank Senators Clinton and Schumer who are our valuable New York partners in all things related to Lake Champlain.  Our initial 1990 Lake Champlain legislation was very successful. It brought together various agencies, interest groups and government entities to develop a comprehensive pollution prevention and restoration management plan for the Lake.  Through long hours and a cooperative effort, the Vermonters and New Yorkers involved came up with a good plan which was signed by Governors Dean and Pataki in 1996.  While we have several priority action items ranging across a wide spectrum of Lake related issues, the Big three remain phosphorus reduction, toxic contaminant prevention and clean-up and management of aquatic nuisance species.  Our legislative proposal today rightfully moves from an emphasis on research and planning to one of clean-up implementation and, quite importantly, monitoring the progress of that clean-up.  We are very pleased with the success of the Lake Champlain Basin Program to date, and with the additional resources envisioned in this bill, we are confident that the problems Lake Champlain is encountering can be addressed successfully.  The Basin Program stands as a fine example of how two States and one province can work together as a common watershed linking its citizens and their governments at all levels--local, State and Federal.  Indeed, the Lake Champlain model has been held up many times in recent years as an example for other watersheds around the world.  We are happy to share our successes, and even our failures, with conservation initiatives internationally.  I am excited about the prospects of this legislation and I hope the full Senate will give Vermont and New York its ringing endorsement once it has received committee review.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
