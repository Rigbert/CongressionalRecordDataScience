Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I want to say to my friend from Arizona, I agree with his first proposition and strongly disagree with his second proposition. The gentleman points out that this bill is almost exactly at the dollar level, $48 million is a lot of money, but we are talking about a bill that is close to $30 billion for both mandatory and discretionary spending. Essentially they are very close, the Senate and the House bills.  I think this is a bill worthy of support as it passed the House. It continues to be worthy as a conference report from the conference committee. I hope that Members would support the legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
