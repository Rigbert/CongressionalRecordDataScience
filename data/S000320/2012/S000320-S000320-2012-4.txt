 President, today I wish to pay tribute to Paul Davis, who passed away in his home on Sunday, September 23, 2012, at the age of 74. He was an award-winning journalist whose contributions to the journalism industry him the deepest respect from his peers and community. I am grateful that I was able to call Paul a longtime friend and mourn his passing.  Born on September 3, 1938 in Clanton, AL, Paul enjoyed a long career as not only a journalist and publisher, but as an advocate for those who did not have a voice. He served as the owner and publisher of the Auburn Bulletin and Tuskegee News for 25 years and for many years authored a Sunday column in the Opelika-Auburn News. Under his watch, the Auburn Bulletin and Tuskegee News won dozens of awards for their quality news coverage.  One of Paul's greatest achievements was his impeccable reporting on cases of negligence and abuse of mentally disabled patients at the Partlow School and Bryce Hospital for the mentally ill. His stories on these injustices led to a decision by the Federal court that required patients with disabilities receive an equal standard of care. For this work he was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize and appointed by Governor Bob Riley to the Alabama Department of Mental Health Board of Directors.  Throughout his life and established career, Paul was honored with numerous awards, among them the Alabama Press Association's Lifetime Achievement Award, the Community Service Journalism Award from Auburn University, a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Alabama Disabilities Advocacy Program, and the Meritorious Service Award from the Auburn University Chapter of the American Association of University Professors.  Outside of the newspaper business, Paul was one of the founding members of the Food Bank of Lee County and served as the president of the organization for 2 years. He continued to serve on its board as it expanded into five additional counties. He was also a member of the Auburn Church of Christ.  Paul was one of my most trusted friends. An outstanding writer, thorough reporter, and advocate for the less fortunate, he was a man of the highest integrity and was an inspiration to me and to many in the journalism and mental health communities. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends, especially his wife, Gayle, his children, Alan, Susan, and Chris, and his stepchildren, Roger, Keith, and Scott, as they mourn the loss of this irreplaceable man.  Paul's legacy will no doubt live on in the community and in the hearts of those who knew him. His contributions to journalism in Alabama and to the causes that he believed in will forever be remembered.                          ____________________
