President, today, I am introducing the Working Students' Income Protection Act, a bill to increase the number of working students who are eligible for Federal Pell grants. I am pleased to have Senator Snowe, Senator Hollings, and Senator Robb as cosponsors.  This bill will correct a problem created by the 1992 amendments to the Higher Education Act that unfairly denies aid to hundreds of thousands of deserving students. Let me explain the problem.  The formula used to determine the eligibility for Federal financial aid includes an income protection allowance, known as an IPA, which enables working students to retain a portion of their earnings to pay their basic living expenses. This allowance is not counted in determining eligibility for student aid. A portion of earnings above the IPA is used to calculate the contributions students can make to their education expenses. As students' incomes rise above the IPA, their eligibility for Federal student aid, especially for Pell grants, declines.  The 1992 amendments to the Higher Education Act dramatically and drastically lowered the income protection allowances. For single students, financially independent of their families, the IPA was reduced from $6,400 to $3,000. The IPA for working dependent students was lowered from $4,250 to $1,750. As a result, the amount a typical independent student can receive under the Pell Grant Program begins to decline when his or her income exceeds $3,000, and the student becomes completely ineligible at an income level of $10,000.  Because of this decrease in IPA's, the number of independent students receiving Pell grants declined from over a million in 1992 to about 750,000 in 1993--a loss of over a quarter of a million grants to independent working students.  This change has three unfortunate consequences:  First, many nontraditional students are not able to pursue post-secondary education. Typically these are older individuals with jobs who are attempting to improve their skills. Because the IPA is not enough to meet living expenses, independent students find themselves unable to pay tuition and meet their basic living expenses. They are forced to defer or even forgo higher education.  Second, the current law creates a disincentive to work. If a student knows that earning more than $3,000 will reduce the size of his or her Pell grant award, the student can easily conclude that there is no reason to try to earn more than $3,000 a year.  Third, it penalizes students who are trying to pay for their education through work rather than by borrowing. This is particularly unfair to the almost 75 percent of dependent undergraduates who are working while studying to pay college expenses. When earnings result in lower grants, these students must turn to larger loans to finance their education.  The Working Students' Income Protection Act will make great strides toward correcting these problems. It will allow single independent students to retain $6,000 of their earnings for basic living expenses, married working independent students to retain $9,000, and working dependent students to retain $4,200 before they begin to loose their Pell grants. This will not only make higher education more affordable for these students, it will also encourage and reward work, a worthwhile objective.  Moreover, these changes will correct an injustice by providing benefits to a segment of the student population that has been largely overlooked by the changes in student aid recently passed or currently under consideration. Increasing Pell grants by $300, for example, a move that I strongly support, which was included in the budget agreement, will not help the working students who are ineligible for these grants because of the inadequate level of the current IPA. Similarly, the tuition tax credit will not help them because they are not earning enough to pay taxes. By increasing the IPA, these students will be able to share in the government assistance available to those seeking to pursue a higher education.  I would like to give you some examples from the University of Southern Maine, a State-supported institution serving 10,000 students. These students have an average age of just under 30 years. They are largely independent students and they are balancing jobs, school, and often family responsibilities. When these students have incomes above the IPA, which they must have to survive, they are not eligible for Pell grants under the current law. Let me describe two of these students to you.  Both are single students. The first is a 25-year-old junior recreation therapymajor. She has worked as a nurses aide since graduating from high school, and she continues to work full time during the summers and part time during the school year. The second is a 31-year-old social work major. He works year round in a variety of part-time restaurant and clerical jobs. Both have total gross earnings of about $15,000 per year.  The current income protection allowance permits each of these students to retain only $3,000 for basic living expenses. It assumes that the remainder is available for calculating the family contribution toward educational expenses. The Working Students' Income Protection Act will allow each of these students to retain $6,000 for basic living expenses and will restore their eligibility for Pell grants. It will allow them to complete their education without incurring significant amounts of debt.  The president of the University of Southern Maine, Richard Pattenaude, has often noted that the mission of a public university is to help people of diverse backgrounds achieve their goals. These citizens, including recent high school graduates, adult learners with jobs and families, and single parents, all come to us, he says,       With dreams of becoming more than they are. I am always      moved and inspired by how hard our students work to realize      those dreams and how deeply they care about their educations.      These students underscore the significance of maintaining      support for higher education if we are to enter the 21st      century with an educational system ready to meet the needs      and challenges of the people we serve.  By increasing the income protection allowance, the Working Students' Income Protection Act will take a major step toward meeting this challenge by helping working students afford college and encouraging them to pursue higher education.  Later in this Congress, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, whose chairman is here today, will mark up the Higher Education Act reauthorization legislation. It is my hope that this legislation will be incorporated into the committee's bill.  Enacting this modest change will make a significant and positive change in the lives of thousands and thousands of students in the United States I urge my colleagues to show their support by cosponsoring this bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the American Council of Education on behalf of seven higher education associations which support this bill be included in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                American Council on Education,                                Washington, DC, September 4, 1997.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: The higher education associations      listed below, representing the nation's 3,700 colleges and      universities, strongly support the legislation you are      sponsoring to correct current inequities in the need analysis      formula for the Pell Grant program. Your legislation      parallels the reauthorization proposal we have advanced to      reinstate or expand eligibility for single independent      students and for dependent students who work.       A broad-based consensus exists among students, campus      officials, and higher education policy analysts, as well as      the Clinton administration and many members of Congress, that      the 1992 Higher Education Act (HEA) amendments made it overly      difficult for single, independent students and dependent      students with earnings to receive Pell Grants. These changes      were felt immediately and had a substantial, negative impact      on access to higher education. For example, at least 200,000      single independent students lost their Pell Grants as a      result of these changes in the first year they were      implemented.       For a number of years, the cost of providing greater grant      access for these extremely needy students has been cited as a      reason against acting to assist them. However, the President      has requested funds for this purpose this year, and the House      Appropriations committee has included funds that will make a      substantial contribution toward addressing this problem in      its version of the FY 1998 Labor, Health and Human Services      and Education appropriations bill. Securing these funds,      along with passage of authorizing legislation such as yours      to permit the funds to be spent, will provide tremendous      relief and benefit to students on campuses across the      country.       Again, we are grateful for your leadership on this      important issue. Prompt consideration and passage of your      bill immediately following the August recess will pave the      way for appropriations to follow, enabling students and their      families to make financial plans for the next academic year.      We are eager to assist you in any way to secure passage of      your legislation.           Sincerely,                                             Stanley O. Ikenberry,                                                        President.                                 ______                                       By
