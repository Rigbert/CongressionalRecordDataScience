 We could devote much more than an hour to Jerry Costello's career in Congress.  I sat next to Jerry on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for more than two decades, and there is no more knowledgeable, dedicated advocate in the United States Congress--most recently on aviation issues, but across the board on infrastructure issues which underlie our economy and our productivity and our growth--than Jerry Costello. His work has been phenomenal. He has done more than I could have imagined in his period of time. And we will miss him.  I congratulate him upon a well and hard-earned retirement.
