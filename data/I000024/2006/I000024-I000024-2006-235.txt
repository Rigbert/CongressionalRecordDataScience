I happen to be more sensitive to this than most people. Two of my kids are doctors, and they assure me that this nurse shortage is nationwide. It is all out there.  One of the concerns I had when this came up was I would not want this to detract from any of the other programs. Right now I have been one to say our military budget, our Defense authorization bill, is really not quite adequate as it is. It is my understanding the Senator has been very cooperative to make sure this doesn't happen.  I have added my name as a cosponsor, and it is my understanding Senator Warner is going to be here shortly and wants to add his name. So the amendment would give the discretion to the DOD, working with the Department of Education, to structure a program that would achieve the dual goals of creating more nurse educators and more Reserve officers. I think we have the support of the committee on both sides, and I commend the Senator for bringing up this solution.
