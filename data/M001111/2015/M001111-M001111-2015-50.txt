 President, in today's economy, too many of our workers across this country are underpaid, they are overworked, and they are treated unfairly on the job. In short, they lack fundamental economic security.  In Congress, we have got to act to give our workers much needed relief. We need to grow our economy from the middle out, not the top down. And we should make sure our country works for all Americans, not just the wealthiest few. There is no reason we can't get to work on legislation to do just that. That is why I am here this afternoon, joining my colleagues in calling for us in the Senate to move on some important policies that will help restore economic security and stability to more of our workers.  Mr. President, I understand that we are waiting for one of my Republican colleagues to come to the floor before I ask unanimous consent, so I will pause for just a minute.  But I will say while we are waiting that we are very concerned about many Americans today who make few dollars an hour, who don't have paid sick leave, who are told to go to work at hours that they cannot control or know about, and we are introducing legislation or asking to introduce legislation today to deal with all of those issues.                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1150  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by the majority leader, following consultation with the Democratic leader and no later than Friday, October 30, the HELP Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. 1150, the Raise the Wage Act; that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; that the bill be read a third time; that the Senate vote on passage of the bill, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.
