 President, I rise to thank the distinguished managers of this bill, Senators Leahy and Hatch, for including the Feinstein-Chafee amendment regarding separation of juveniles from adults in custody in the managers' ``technical amendment.'' I also wish to thank Senators Akaka, Feingold, Kohl, and Jeffords, who agreed to co-sponsor our amendment, for their support.  This amendment resolves a major concern that many, many people had with this bill, and will help speed the way to its final passage.  Our amendment is designed to strengthen the bill's requirements for separating juveniles in custody from adult criminals. We should not be counter-productive by allowing juvenile detention to be a school for crime, nor should we be cruel in permitting the victimization of youths by hardened adult criminals.  Under current law, juveniles cannot have any contact with adult inmates. None whatsoever. When a juvenile is in an adult facility, that juvenile cannot be within ``sight or sound'' of any adult--ever!  Why is that one of the four so-called ``core'' requirements?  Because I remind my colleagues that we are talking about children.  Children who may or may not have committed a violent offense.  Children who may have been arrested for the first time.  Children who perhaps are on the wrong path but most likely never commit another offense ever: statistically, over two-thirds of juveniles arrested never commit another crime.  In the early 1970s, before there were protections for children who came into contact with our court system, a number of studies found that children in adult jails were subject to rape, assault, sodomy, murder, and other acts which sometimes, frankly too often, led to suicide.  The Judiciary Committee at the time learned of numerous tragedies and outright atrocities, including a report on practices in Philadelphia which estimated that 2,000 sexual assaults occurred inside adult jails or ``sheriff's vans'' used to transport juvenile and adults to court over a 26-month period. One juvenile was raped five times while inside such a van.  The numbers tell the story. Children in adult jails are 8 times more likely to commit suicide; 5 times more likely to be sexually assaulted; twice as likely to be assaulted by staff; and 50 percent more likely to be attacked with a weapon than are children in juvenile facilities, according to studies by the Justice Department and others.  In my state of California, we passed our laws to keep juveniles out of adult jails in the mid-1980s in the wake of tragedies such as the case of Kathy Robbins, a 15-year-old girl who hung herself when she was placed in an adult jail in Glenn County for violating a juvenile curfew.  After those reports were released, Congress enacted the Juvenile Justice Delinquency Prevention Act and subsequent renewals of the law to ensure that children would be treated fairly by the juvenile justice system and be kept safely away from adults in jail.  Kentucky chose to forgo Federal money and continue placing juveniles in adult jails. This chart shows the result: four suicides, one attempted suicide, two physical assaults by other inmates, two sexual assaults by other inmates, and one rape by a deputy county jailer.  Let me give you some of the names behind the numbers:  In Oldham County, 15-year-old Robert Lee Horn, Jr. was put in jail for truancy and beyond parental control. He was paraded through the jail in front of adult inmates who called out to him for sex. He hung himself.  In McCracken County, a 16-year-old Todd Selke was put in adult jail for being a runaway and disorderly conduct. He committed suicide.  In Franklin County, a 16-year-old runaway was raped by a deputy county jailer.  The core protections help to prevent these tragedies elsewhere around the country.  Yet, this bill as introduced would have weakened the core protections for children. I was puzzled by why the authors felt the need to weaken the current standard. According to the latest figures from the Justice Department, 48 of the 50 states are in compliance with the current standard for separating children from adults, including such large, rural states as Alaska and Montana.  And yet this bill would have allowed for juveniles to be in close proximity to adult inmates. While it generally prohibits physical contact between juveniles and adults in custody, there is an exclusion. And the exclusion to the definition of prohibited physical contact said that the term ``does not include supervised proximity between a juvenile and an adult inmate that is brief and incidental or accidental.''  In other words, it permitted regular contact, planned contact, between delinquent juveniles and adult criminals, as long as it is deemed to be ``brief and incidental.''  Senator Chafee and I were concerned that this standard would have allowed juveniles to be paraded in front of adult inmates as they are being transported from one area of a facility to another. That means that every day the same youth could be required to walk by the adult cell block.  Adult inmates would have a chance to tease, taunt, harass, use suggestive body language, expose areas of their private parts, spit, and otherwise scare juveniles as they are being transported through the facility.  Now some might think that's OK. That to scare a child by exposing them to adults may reduce the likelihood of the child committing another crime.  But, actually, these young children who might be tough on the outside, but not so tough on the inside, could be scared to death--meaning scared enough to commit suicide--just as Robbie Horn was in Oldham County, Kentucky.  Older gang members, or veteranos, could pass messages on to younger gang members to coordinate criminal activities, or to intimidate them from turning state's evidence.  The amendment which we have agreed upon remedied this. In fact, it is even better than what Senator Chafee and I originally proposed. It makes two changes, which bring the bill into line with the current Justice Department regulations:  1. It eliminates any planned or regular contact between juvenile delinquents and adult criminals by changing the exception to ``brief and inadvertent, or accidental,'' contact. The minority report to last Congress' juvenile crime bill, S. 10, erroneously stated that the Justice Department's regulations, like the bill, excepted ``brief and incidental'' contact. However, there is a world of difference between ``incidental'' and ``inadvertent.'' Changing this exception to the Justice Department standard has the same effect as the amendment which Senator Chafee and I originally proposed, and will provide much greater protection for juveniles in custody.  2. The amendment passed in the manager's package then goes even further, limiting even this exception to nonresidential areas only. In other words, there is no exception at all in residential areas to the prohibition on physical contact between juveniles and adults. Specifically, the amendment provides that the inadvertent/accidental exception applies only ``in secure areas of a facility that are not dedicated to use by juvenile offenders and that are nonresidential, which may include dining, recreational, educational, vocational, health care, entry areas, and passageways.'' This language is taken almost verbatim from the Justice Department regulations.  This amendment ensures that a juvenile cannot be in close proximity such as supervised ``brief and incidental'' parades by adult cells or other planned or spontaneous actions by adults to transport children from one area of a jail to another.  Our amendment was endorsed by: The Department of Justice; the Children's Defense Fund; the National Network for Youth; and the National Collaboration for Youth, an alliance of 28 youth service groups, including Boy Scouts, 4-H, Girl Scouts, American Red Cross, National Urban League, United Way and YMCA.  A coalition of 22 other organizations wrote to the Majority Leader, asking that the standard for separating delinquent juveniles and adult criminals be strengthened, including: Minorities in Law Enforcement, National Association for School Psychologists, National Council of Churches of Christ-Washington Office, the Alliance for Children and Families, Campaign for an Effective Crime Policy, and Covenant House.  With the passage of this amendment, we have provided this protection, and substantially improved this bill. Coupled with the passage of other amendments that I offered, including banning imports of large-capacity ammunition magazines, the Federal Gang Violence Act, the James Guelff Body Armor Act, and anti-bombmaking legislation, this bill now represents a great step forward in the effort to reduce juvenile and violent crime. I ask that I be added as a co-sponsor of the bill, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting its passage.                      early childhood development
