 President, I rise today to pay tribute to SP Dustin S. Colby, a fellow Iowan from the Mason City/Clear Lake area. The Iowa National Guard regretfully announced the death of Specialist Colby when he was killed on August 27, 2004, along with fellow soldier SSG Bruce J. Pollema, when their military motor vehicle rolled over into a ditch near Camp Dodge. Specialist Dustin Colby was a member of the 2168th Transportation Company based in Sheldon, IA. SP Colby is survived by his mother, Misty L. Thoe, and his father, Jerry L. Colby, as well as numerous siblings. This brave young soldier was only 20 years old.  The family of Dustin Colby issued the following statement in response to the news of their son's death:       Dustin was a dedicated son, grandson, brother, cousin,      nephew, boyfriend, friend and Soldier. He loved life, his      family, and being a soldier.  My deepest sympathy goes out to his family and friends. Specialist Colby brought happiness to many people, and his memory will never die because of the impact he had on the people he knew. It is fitting that we pay tribute to his life and his service to his country.                       Sgt. James Daniel Faulkner
