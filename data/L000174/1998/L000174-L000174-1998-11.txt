President, last week's Washington Post proclaimed in one headline, ``High Tech is King of the Hill,'' citing the passage of several bills which I actively supported, including restricting Internet taxes, enhancing protection for copyrighted works online, and encouraging companies to share information to avoid Year 2000 computer failures. Yet, anyone familiar with the Internet proposals buried in the Omnibus Appropriations measure would be writing a different headline this week.  Certain provisions in this huge spending bill repeat the mistakes about regulating speech on the Internet that the last Congress made when it passed the Communications Decency Act, the ``CDA-I.'' I opposed the CDA from the start as fatally flawed and flagrantly unconstitutional. I predicted that the CDA would not pass constitutional muster and, along with Senator Feingold, sought to repeal the CDA so that we would not have to wait for the Supreme Court to fix our mistake.  We did not fix the mistake and so, as I predicted, the Supreme Court eventually did our work for us. All nine Justices agreed that the CDA was, at least in part, unconstitutional. Justice Stevens, writing for seven members of the Court, called the CDA ``patently invalid'' and warned that it cast a ``dark shadow over free speech'' and ``threaten[ed] to torch a large segment of the Internet community.'' Reno v. ACLU, 117 S.Ct. 2329, 2350 (1997). The Court's decision came as no surprise to me, and should have come as no surprise to the 84 members of the Senate who supported the legislation.  We had been warned by constitutional scholars and Internet experts that the approach we were taking in the CDA would not stand up in court and did not make sense for the Internet. In the end, three district court panels and the Supreme Court all ultimately agreed in striking down the CDA-I as an unconstitutional restriction on free expression.  Congress is about to make the same mistake again by including in the Omnibus Appropriations bill the ``Child Online Protection Act,'' or ``CDA-II.'' I have spoken before, on July 21, 1998, about my opposition to a version of this legislation that was included, without debate, on the annual funding bill for the Commerce, State and Justice Departments.  My opposition to these efforts to regulate Internet speech should not be misunderstood. I join with the sponsors of these measures in wanting to protect children from harm. I prosecuted child abusers as State's Attorney in Vermont, and have worked my entire professional life to protect children from those who would prey on them. In fact, earlier this month, the Congress passed the Hatch-Leahy-DeWine version of the ``Protection of Children from Sexual Predator Act,'' H.R. 3494, to enhance our Federal laws outlawing child pornography. We should act whenever possible to protect our children, but we have a duty to ensure that the means we use to protect our children do not do more harm than good. As the Supreme Court made clear when it struck down CDA-I, laws that prohibit protected speech do not become constitutional merely because they were enacted for the important purpose of protecting children.  CDA-II makes a valiant effort to address many of the Supreme Court's technical objections to the CDA. Nevertheless, while narrower than its CDA-I predecessor, this legislation continues to suffer from substantial constitutional and practical defects. The core holding of the CDA-I case was that ``the vast democratic fora of the Internet'' deserves the highest level of protection from government intrusion--the highest level of First Amendment scrutiny. Courts will assess the constitutionality of laws that regulate speech over the Internet by the same demanding standards that have traditionally applied to laws affecting the press.  The CDA-II provisions included in the Omnibus Appropriations bill do not meet those standards.  CDA-II would penalize the posting ``for commercial purposes'' on the World Wide Web of any material that is ``harmful to minors.'' Penalties include fines of up to $50,000 per day of violation, up to 6 months' imprisonment and, under a separate section of the bill, forfeiture of eligibility for the Internet tax moratorium. Like the old CDA-I, this new provision creates an affirmative defense for those who restrict access by requiring use of a credit card, debit account, adult access code, adult personal identification number, a digital certificate verifying age, or other reasonable measures. This new criminal prohibition raises a number of constitutional and practical issues that have been entirely ignored by this Congress.  First, the scope of CDA-II is unclear. The prohibition applies to anyone ``engaged in the business'' of making any communication for commercial purposes by means of the World Wide Web. Vendors selling pornographic material from Web sites are clearly covered, but also many other unsuspecting persons and businesses operating Web sites will likely fall under this prohibition. Under new section 231(e)(2)(B) of title 47, U.S.C., ``it is not necessary that the person make a profit'' or that the Web site ``be the person's sole or principal business or source of income.'' Does CDA-II cover companies that offer free Web sites, but charge for their off-line services? If CDA-II does not apply in that circumstance, would the measure have the unintended effect of encouraging the posting of ``harmful'' materials on the Web for free? Does CDA-II apply to a business that merely advertises on the Web? Does CDA-II apply to public service postings sponsored by businesses on the Web?  In the face of this uncertainty, entrepreneurs, small businesses and other companies who maintain a Web site as a way to enhance their business may face criminal liability if they post material--for free, for advertising, or for a fee--which some community in this country may perceive to be ``harmful to minors.''  Second, CDA-II adopts a ``harmful to minors'' standard that will likely be found unconstitutional. CDA-II defines ``material that is harmful to minors'' as what the ``average person, applying contemporary community standards,'' would find, taken as a whole and with respect to minors, is designed to appeal to the prurient interest, depicts in a manner patently offensive to minors actual or simulated sexual acts or contact, and lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value. The provision further defines a ``minor'' to be ``any person under 17 years of age.''  The ``17 year old'' age cutoff in CDA-II makes this measure significantly more restrictive than the ``harmful to minors'' statutes adopted in most states, including in my home state of Vermont. Most state ``harmful to minors'' statutes restrict materials that would be harmful to minors under the age of 18. These statutes are interpreted to prohibit only that material which would be harmful for the oldest minor. Thus, by setting the age at ``under 17,'' CDA-II would prohibit material on the Web that is inappropriate or harmful for 16 year olds. Consequently, CDA-II would impose more restrictions on the material that can be freely accessible on the World Wide Web than most states impose on materials available for sale in bookstores, news stands, and movie theaters within their borders.  Yet, unlike books, magazines, movies or even broadcasts, where the vendor can control the physical places to which the material is distributed, a person posting material on a Web site cannot restrict access to only Internet users from certain geographic regions. Indeed, Web site operators often cannot determine the region of the country, or the world, from which users are initiating their access.  As a consequence, Web site operators will have to tailor the material accessible on their sites to content that would pass muster in the most conservative community in the country for children 16 years old and younger. The standards of every other community would be discounted. Thus, the bill's core effect will be to set--for the first time--a single, national harmful to minors standard for material on the World Wide Web. Moreover, this standard will be more restrictive than those already in place in most states.  This result runs counter to existing ``harmful to minors'' law as articulated by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has never approved of a single, national obscenity standard, nor has it approved a ``harmful to minors'' statute based on a national, as opposed to local, standard. On the contrary, the Supreme Court in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 30-32 (1973), stated that:       our Nation is simply too big and too diverse . . . to      reasonably expect that such standards could be articulated      for all 50 States in a single formulation. . . . It is      neither realistic nor constitutionally sound to read the      First Amendment as requiring that the people of Maine or      Mississippi accept public depiction of conduct found      tolerable in Las Vegas, or New York City.  Reducing the material available on the Web to that which only the most conservative community in the country deems to be appropriate for 16-year-olds, could very well remove material that is both constitutionally protected and socially valuable. The online publication of the Starr report, in whole or in part, Robert Mappelthorpe's pictures, or PG, PG-13, and certainly R-rated movies or TV shows would be suspect.  CDA-II provides an affirmative defense for online publishers of such material that demand credit card numbers or other adult identification. A similar defense did not save CDA-I, however, and remains insufficient to reduce the significant burden on protected speech that the new prohibition imposes. The Supreme Court noted in analyzing this defense in CDA-I, that such a requirement would ```completely bar adults who do not have a credit card and lack the resources to obtain one from accessing any blocked material.''' 117 S.Ct at 2337.  In addition to burdening the speech rights of adults, the Supreme Court questioned the effectiveness of this defense in CDA-I to protect children, stating:     . . . it is not economically feasible for most noncommercial      speakers to employ such verification . . . Even with respect      to commercial pornographers that would be protected by the      defense, the Government failed to adduce any evidence that      these verification techniques actually preclude minors from      posing as adults. Given that the risk of criminal sanctions      `hovers over each content provider, like the proverbial sword      of Damocles,' the District Court correctly refused to rely on      unproven future technology to save the statute.'' 117 S.Ct.      at 2349-50.  The technology required to exercise the affirmative defense remains practically difficult and prohibitively expensive for many Web sites. As a result, just as the Supreme Court found with CDA-I, CDA-II would effectively chill the publication of a large amount of valuable, constitutionally-protected speech on popular commercial web sites such as CNN.com, amazon.com, or the New York Times online. As the Court restated in its decision on CDA-I, ```[t]he level of discourse reaching a mailbox simply cannot be limited to that which would be suitable for a sandbox.''' 117 S.Ct. at 2346.  Third, CDA-II will be ineffective at protecting children. In evaluating whether the burdens that CDA-II will place on Web publishers are justified, we must take a realistic look at how well these new restrictions will work to protect children from harmful online materials. As the Supreme Court noted, adult identification or verification techniques can be falsely used by children to gain access to forbidden material.  In addition, CDA-II is limited to activity on the Web, presumably to capture the material that the Supreme Court believed was susceptible to use of verified credit cards. Those of us who use the Internet recognize that the Web is merely one of several Internet protocols, although the one most amenable to pictorial or graphic displays. Limiting the reach of this measure to the Web excludes newsgroups, FTP sites, e-mail, chat rooms, private electronic bulletin board systems (BBS), and gopher sites, where children may continue to access harmful materials. Indeed, I am concerned that the unintended consequence of applying CDA-II's ill-considered speech restrictions on the Web will simply force Internet content providers and users to use or develop other protocols with which they would be able to exercise their First Amendment rights unfettered by the threat of criminal prosecution.  Those of us who use the Internet and the World Wide Web also recognize that this is a global medium, not just a network under United States control. Indeed, a large percentage of content on the Internet originates outside the United States, and is as accessible over the Web as material posted next door. Objectionable material is likely to come from outside the United States and be unreachable by American laws.  The Justice Department, in a letter dated October 5, 1998, on CDA-II that I would ask to be included in the record, stated, ``the practical or legal difficulty in addressing these considerable alternative sources from which children can obtain pornography raises questions about the efficacy of the [CDA-II] and the advisability of expending scarce resources on its enforcement.''  The warning by the Justice Department that this measure will detract from current efforts to stop the distribution of illegal child pornography has apparently gone unheeded by Congress. The Justice Department has made clear that CDA-II would ``divert the resources that are used for important initiatives such as Innocent Images,'' a successful online undercover program to stop child predators and pornographers. The work that the Justice Department has done in going after the worst offenders, highlighted by the recent international crack down on child-pornography, should not be diluted by broadening their enforcement load to embrace an unconstitutional standard.  Fourth, Congress simply has not done its homework to consider alternative effective means to protect children from harmful online materials. The Senate is considering CDA-II, including its creation of a new Federal crime, as part of an omnibus spending measure. Until recently the Senate had rules and precedent against this kind of legislating on an appropriations bill. Under Republican leadership, that discipline has been lost and we are left to consider significant legislative proposals as part of annual appropriations. These matters are far-reaching. They deserve full debate and Senate consideration before good intentions lead the Senate to take another misstep in haste.  The Congress has not held hearings on the CDA-II provisions before us. The Senate Commerce Committee hearing in February, 1998, elicited only the testimony of this measure's primary sponsor about a prior version of the bill, and no other testimony about its constitutionality. The Congress has made only the most minimal efforts to determine whether technical tools or this measure would be the least restrictive means of protecting children. There has been no study, no discussion, and no comparison of the effectiveness of various approaches, their likely impact on speech, and their appropriateness for the Internet.  Ironically, CDA-II puts the proverbial cart-before-the-horse by enacting new speech restrictions at the same time the bill establishes a ``Commission on Online Child Protection'' to study the technical means available to protect children from harmful material. While the selection of the members of this Commission is left solely to Republican congressional leadership, we should at least hear from the Commission before legislating. As the letter from the Department of Justice advises, ``Congress should wait until the Commission has completed its study and made its legislative recommendations before determining whether a criminal enactment would be necessary, and if so, how such a statute should be crafted.'' This approach would allow Congress to create a record on the most effective means to solve the problem instead of passing an ineffective law.  In striking the CDA-I as unconstitutional, the Supreme Court specifically cited ``the absence of any detailed findings by the Congress, or even hearings addressing the special problems of the CDA'' as grounds for its finding ``that the CDA is not narrowly tailored if that requirement has any meaning at all.'' 117 S.Ct. at 2348. The Congress is repeating this mistake here, since it has again not established a record showing that the extraordinary restrictions on Internet expression proposed in the CDA-II are the least restrictive way to achieve our goal of protecting children online. Congress is required to establish such a record if it seeks to impose these sorts of burdens of the speech of our citizens.  Experts have told us that there are better ways to protect children that have less of an impact on constitutionally protected speech, including the use of blocking and filtering tools that give parents the ability to control access to harmful content both within and outside of the United States. Harvard Law School Professor Larry Lessig, who is an expert on both constitutional law and Internet law, has described at least one less restrictive alternative--the use of voluntary ``kid certificates'' online--that would have the same effect Congress is trying to achieve while placing far less of a burden on free speech. I ask that his letter be made part of the Record.  It is precisely because these less restrictive means exist, and because Congress has not shown otherwise, that the CDA-II is most likely to fail in the courts.  Finally, there are constructive steps that Congress can and should take. Although CDA-II would not solve the problems facing parents and educators on how to protect their children fromharmful and inappropriate online material, there are several steps that Congress could take which would prove more effective.  We should hear from the Commission on Online Child Protection that is authorized in this bill to study the technical means available to protect children from harmful material.  We should do more to protect children's privacy. The Omnibus appropriations bill contains a provision authorizing the FTC to require parental consent from children to give out personal information to Web sites aimed at children or where the age of child has been collected. These privacy provisions have broad support and could be a way for Congress effectively and constitutionally to protect children online without detracting from the current mission of law enforcement.  We should not rush to legislate when non-legislative solutions may be more effective and consistent with our constitutional principles. Instead of trying to create a national harmful to minors standard, Congress should encourage companies and non-profit organizations who have responded to this problem with wide-ranging efforts to create child-friendly content collections, teach children about appropriate online behavior, and develop voluntary, user-controlled, technology tools that offer parents the ability to protect their own children from inappropriate material. Unlike legislative approaches, these bottom-up solutions are voluntary. They protect children and assist parents and care-takers regardless of whether the material to be avoided is on an American or foreign Web site. They respond to local and family concerns, and they avoid government decisions about content.  We can and must do better than CDA-II. This measure will do almost nothing to protect children from harmful material online, but will divert Federal enforcement resources, restrict constitutionally-protected free speech online and set a dangerous precedent for Federal regulation of the Internet. Perhaps worst of all, it will create the illusion of a solution. This Congress should not be in the business of lulling parents into a false sense of security while in fact doing nothing to protect children online.  Many members who have supported CDA-II are no doubt motivated by the same thing that motivates me in this area: a desire to protect children online. I am afraid, however, that we have not taken the time to craft a legislative solution that will actually help solve this problem. The Congress has been put on notice that our approach will not work, and will probably end up in court for yet another battle. We should not run another ambiguous speech regulation up the flagpole and expect the courts to salute. We owe it to the millions of Americans who use the Web not to make the same mistake a second time.  Now, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Acting Attorney General Anthony Sutin from the Department of Justice and a letter from Harvard University Professor Lawrence Lessig in opposition to the Child Online Protection Act be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       U.S. Department of Justice,                                Office of Legislative Affairs,                                  Washington, DC, October 5, 1998.     Hon. Thomas Bliley,     Chairman, Committee on Commerce,     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       This letter sets forth the views of the Department of      Justice on H.R. 3783, the ``Child Online Protection Act''      (``the COPA''), as ordered reported. We share the Committee's      goal of empowering parents and teachers to protect minors      from harmful material that is distributed commercially over      the World Wide Web. However, we would like to bring to your      attention certain serious concerns we have about the bill.       The principal provision of the COPA would establish a new      federal crime under section 231 of Title 47 of the United      States Code. Subsection 231(a)(1) would provide that:       ``Whoever, in interstate or foreign commerce, by means of      the World Wide Web, knowingly makes any communication for      commercial purposes that includes any material that is      harmful to minors without restricting access to such material      by minors pursuant to subsection (c) shall be fined not more      than $50,000, imprisoned not more than 6 months, or both.''       Subsection 231(a)(2), in turn, would provide for additional      criminal fines of $50,000 for ``each day'' that someone      ``intentionally violates'' Sec. 231(a)(1); and Sec. 231(a)(3)      would provide for additional civil fines of $50,000 for      ``each day'' that a person violated Sec. 231(a)(1).      Subsection 231(b) would exempt certain telecommunications      carriers and other service providers from the operation of      Sec. 231(a)(1). Subsection 231(c)(1) would establish what is      denominated an ``affirmative defense'':       ``(1) Defense.--It is an affirmative defense to prosecution      under this section that the defendant, in good faith, has      restricted access by minors to material that is harmful to      minors--       ``(A) by requiring use of a credit card, debit account,      adult access code, or adult personal identification number;      or       ``(B) by any other reasonable measures that are feasible      under available technology.''       Subsection 231(e) would define, inter alia, the following      terms in the criminal prohibition: (i) ``by means of the      World Wide Web''; (ii) ``commercial purposes''; (iii)      ``material that is harmful to minors,'' and ``minor.'' See      proposed Sec. 231(e) (1), (2), (6) & (7). In particular,      ``material that is harmful to minors'' would be defined as:       ``. . . any communication, picture, image, graphic image      file, article, recording, writing, or other matter of any      kind that--       ``(A) the average person, applying contemporary community      standards, would find, taking the material as a whole and      with respect to minors, that such material is designed to      appeal to or panders to the prurient interest;       ``(B) depicts, describes, or represents, in a patently      offensive way with respect to minors, an actual or simulated      sexual act or sexual contact, actual or simulated normal or      perverted sexual acts, or a lewd exhibition of the genitals      or female breast; and       ``(C) taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic,      political, or scientific value for minors.''       The Department's enforcement of a new criminal prohibition      such as that proposed in the COPA could require an      undesirable diversion of critical investigative and      prosecutorial resources that the Department currently invests      in combating traffickers in hard-core child pornography, in      thwarting child predators, and in prosecuting large-scale and      multidistrict commercial distributors of obscene materials.      For example, presently the Department devotes a significant      percentage of our resources in this area to the highly      successful Innocent Images online undercover operations,      begun in 1995 by the FBI. Through this initiative, FBI agents      and task force officers go on-line, in an undercover      capacity, to identify and investigate those individuals who      are victimizing children through the Internet and on-line      service providers. Fifty-five FBI field offices and a number      of legal attaches are assisting and conducting investigations      in direct support of the Innocent Images initiative. To      ensure that the initiative remains viable and productive, the      Bureau's efforts include the use of new technology and      sophisticated investigative techniques, and the coordination      of this national investigative effort with other federal      agencies that have statutory investigative authority. We also      have allocated significant resources for the training of      state and local law enforcement agents who must become      involved in our effort. To date, the Innocent Images national      initiative has resulted in 196 indictments, 75 informations,      207 convictions, and 202 arrests. In addition, 456      evidentiary searches have been conducted.       We do not believe that it would be wise to divert the      resources that are used for important initiatives such as      Innocent Images to prosecutions of the kind contemplated      under the COPA. Such a diversion would be particularly ill-     advised in light of the uncertainty concerning whether the      COPA would have a material effect in limiting minors' access      to harmful materials. There are thousands of newsgroups and      Internet relay chat channels on which anyone can access      pornography; and children would still be able to obtain ready      access to pornography from a myriad of overseas web sites.      The COPA apparently would not attempt to address those      sources of Internet pornography, and admittedly it would be      difficult to do so because restrictions on newsgroups and      chat channels could pose constitutional questions, and      because any attempt to regulate overseas web sites would      raise difficult questions regarding extraterritorial      enforcement. The practical or legal difficulty in addressing      these considerable alternative sources from which children      can obtain pornography raises questions about the efficacy of      the COPA and the advisability of expending scarce resources      on its enforcement.       Second, such a provision would likely be challenged on      constitutional grounds, since it would be a content-based      restriction applicable to ``the vast democratic fora of the      Internet,'' a ``new marketplace of ideas'' that has enjoyed a      ``dramatic expansion'' in the absence of significant content-     based regulation. Reno v. ACLU, 117 S. Ct. 2329, 2343, 2351      (1997). As the Court in ACLU suggested, id. at 2341      (discussing Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629 (1968)), it      may be that Congress could, consistent with the First      Amendment, enact an Internet version of a ``variable      obscenity,'' harmful-to-minors prohibition, analogous to      state-law statutes prohibiting bookstores from displaying to      minors certain materials that are obscene as to such minors.      See, e.g., American Booksellers v. Webb, 919 F.2d 1493 (11th      Cir. 1990), cert denied, 500 U.S. 942 (1991); American      Booksellers Ass'n v. Virginia, 882 F.2d 125 (4th Cir. 1989),      cert denied, 494 U.S. 1056 (1990), Davis-Kidd Booksellers,      Inc. v. McWherter, 866 S.W.2d 520     (Tenn. 1993). However, it is not certain how the      constitutional analysis might be affected by adaptation of      such a scheme from the bookstore context in which it      previously has been employed to the unique media of the      Internet. Because it may be more difficult for Internet      content providers to segregate minors from adults than it is      for bookstore operators to do the same, and because the      Internet is, in the Court's words, a ``dynamic, multifaceted      category of communication'' that permits ``any person with a      phone line'' to become ``a town crier with a voice that      resonates farther than it could from any soapbox,'' ACLU, 117      S. Ct. at 2344, the Court is likely to examine very carefully      any content-based restrictions on the Internet.       The decision in ACLU suggests that the constitutionality of      an Internet-based ``harmful-to-minors'' statute likely would      depend, principally, on how difficult and expensive it would      be for persons to comply with the statute without sacrificing      their ability to convey protected expression to adults and to      minors. And the answer to that question might depend largely      on the ever-changing state of technology, the continuing      progress that the private sector makes in empowering parents      and teachers to protect minors from harmful material, and the      scope and detail of the record before Congress. In this      regard, it is notable that the COPA also would establish a      Commission (see Sec. 6) to study the ways in which the      problem could most effectively be addressed in a time of      rapidly evolving technologies. In light of the difficult      constitutional issues, we believe that Congress should wait      until the Commission has completed its study and made its      legislative recommendations before determining whether a      criminal enactment would be necessary, and if so, how such a      statute should be crafted.       Finally, the COPA as drafted contains numerous ambiguities      concerning the scope of its coverage. Such ambiguities not      only might complicate and hinder effective prosecution; they      also might ``render [the legislation] problematic for      purposes of the First Amendment,'' by ``undermin[ing] the      likelihood that the [bill] has been carefully tailored to the      congressional goal of protecting minors from potentially      harmful materials.'' ACLU, 117 S. Ct. 2344. Among the more      confusing or troubling ambiguities are the following:       ``(a) While the COPA mentions that minors' access to      materials on the Internet `can frustrate parental supervision      or control' over their children, Sec. 2(1), the only      `compelling interest' that the COPA would invoke as a      justification for its prohibition is `the protection of the      physical and psychological well-being of minors by shielding      them from materials that are harmful to them,' id. Sec. 2(2).      The constitutionality of the bill would be enhanced if      Congress were to identify as the principal compelling      interest the facilitation of parents' control over their      children's upbringing, in addition to the government's      independent interest in keeping certain materials from minors      regardless of their parents' views. See, e.g., ACLU, 117 S.      Ct. at 2341 (noting that the statute in Ginsberg presented      fewer constitutional problems than the Communications Decency      Act because in the former, but not the latter, parents'      consent to, or participation in, the communication would      avoid application of the statute).       ``(b) While the bill would not appear to apply to material      posted to the Web from outside the United States, that      question is not clear; and the extraterritoriality of the      prohibition might affect the efficacy and constitutionality      of the statute. See ACLU, 117 S. Ct. at 2347 n. 45.       ``(c) It is unclear what difference is intended in      separately prohibiting `knowing' violations (proposed      Sec. 231(a)(1)) and `intentional' violations      (proposed ``Sec. 231(a)(2)); and there is no indication      why the two distinct penalty provisions are necessary or      desirable. Moreover, it is not clear, in subsection      (a)(1), which elements are modified by the ``knowingly''      requirement. For example, must the government prove that      the defendant knew that the communication contained the      harmful-to-minors material? That the defendant knew the      materials were, in fact, harmful to minors? Nor is it      clear what it would mean, in the context of distribution      of the targeted materials over the World Wide Web, to      violate subsection (a)(1) ``intentionally.''       ``(d) Proposed Sec. 231(a)(3) would provide for civil      penalties; but that section does not indicate how such      penalties are to be imposed and enforced--e.g., who would be      responsible for bringing civil actions. In this regard, we      should note that if Congress were to eliminate criminal      penalties altogether, in favor of civil penalties, that would      improve the likelihood that the statute eventually would be      found constitutional. See, e.g., ACLU, 117 S. Ct. at 2342      (distinguishing the civil penalties upheld in the      ``indecency'' statute at issue in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation,      438 U.S. 726 (1978), from the criminal penalties in the CDA).       ``(e) The titles of Sec. 3 of the bill, and of proposed      Sec. 231 of Title 47, refer to materials ``sold by means of      the World Wide Web''; and yet the prohibition itself does not      appear to prohibit merely the ``sale'' of harmful material,      although it is limited to communications ``for commercial      purposes.''       ``(f) One of the elements of the basic prohibition in      proposed Sec. 231(a)(1) would be that the defendant made the      communication ``without restricting access to such material      by minors pursuant to subsection (c).'' Yet subsection (c)      itself would provide that such a restriction of access is an      affirmative defense. This dual status of the ``restricting      access' factor appears to create a redundancy; at the very      least, it leaves unclear important questions regarding      burdens of proof with respect to whether a defendant      adequately restricted access.       ``(g) The COPA definition of ``materials that is harmful to      minors'' would be similar to the ``variable obscenity''      state-law definitions that courts have upheld in cases (cited      above) involving restrictions on the display of certain      material to minors in bookstores. Those state statutes have,      in effect, adopted the ``obscenity as to minors'' criteria      approved in Ginsberg as modified in accordance with the      Supreme court's more recent obscenity standards announced in      Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 14 (19873). But the COPA's      definition would, in several respects, be different from the      definitions typically used in those state statutes, and the      reasons for such divergence are not clear. Is the definition      intended to be coterminous with, broader, or narrower than,      the standards approved in the cases involving state-law      display statutes? The breadth and clarity of the coverage of      the COPA's ``harmful to minors'' standards could have a      significant impact on the statute's constitutionality.       ``(h) Particular ambiguity infects the first of the three      criteria for ``material that is harmful to minors,'' proposed      Sec. 231(e)(6)(A). (i) The words ``that such material''      appear extraneous. (ii) It is unclear whether ``is designed      to'' is supposed to modify ``panders to,'' and, if not,      whether the ``panders to'' standard is supposed to reflect      the intended or the actual effect of the expression ``with      respect to minors.'' (iii) Which ``contemporary community      standards'' would be dispositive? Those of the judicial      district (or some other geographical ``community'') in which      the expression is ``posted''? Of the district or local      community in which the jury sits? Of some ``community'' in      cyberspace? Some other ``community''? Resolution of this      question might well affect the statute's constitutionality.      See ACLU, 117 S. Ct. at 2345 n.39.       ``(i) Must the material, taken as a whole, ``lack serious      literary, artistic, political, or scientific value'' for all      minors, for some minors, or for the ``average'' or      ``reasonable'' 16-year-old minor? See, e.g., American      booksellers, 919 F2d at 1504-05 (under a variable obscenity      statute, ``if any reasonable minor, including a seventeen-     year-old, would find serious value, the material is not      `harmful to minors' ''); Davis-Kidd Booksellers, 866 S.W. 2d      at 528 (same); American Booksellers Ass'n, 882 F.2d at 127      (sustaining constitutionality of a state variable obscenity      statute after state court had concluded that a book does not      satisfy the third prong of the statute if it is ``found to      have a serious literary, artistic, political or scientific      value for a legitimate minority of normal, older      adolescents'').       ``(j) In the definition of ``engaged in the business''      (proposed Sec. 231(e)(2)(B)), it is not clear what is      intended by the reference to ``offering to make such      communications.'' Also unclear is the effect of the modifier      ``knowingly'' in that same definition's clarification that a      person may be considered to be ``engaged in the business of      making, by means of the World Wide Web, communications for      commercial purposes that include material that is harmful to      minors only if the person knowingly causes the material that      is harmful to minors to be posted on the World Wide Web or      knowingly solicits such material to be posted on the World      Wide Web.'' Must the person know that the material is posted      on the Web? That the material is harmful to minors? That he      or she ``cause[d]'' the material to be posted?''       In addition, we have concerns with certain facets of the      proposed Commission on Online Child Protection, which would      be established under Sec. 6 of the bill. The Commission would      be composed of fourteen private persons engaged in      business, appointed in equal measures by the Speaker of      the House and the Majority Leader of the Senate, as well      as three ``ex officio'' federal officials (or their      designees): the Assistant Secretary of Commerce, the      Attorney General and the Chairman of the Federal Trade      Commission. The principal duty of the Commission, see      Sec. 6(c)(1), would be:     ``. . . to conduct a study . . . to identify the      technological or other methods to help reduce success by      minors to material that is harmful to minors on the Internet,      [and] which methods, if any--       ``(A) that the Commission determines meet the requirements      for use as affirmative defenses for purposes of section      231(a) . . . ; or       ``(B) may be used in any other manner to help reduce such      access.''       If subsection (A) of this provision were construed to      permit or to require the Commission to ``determine,'' as a      matter of law, which methods would satisfy the affirmative      defense established in Sec. 23(c), it would violate the      constitutional separation of powers because most of the      Commission members would be appointed by congressional      officials and would not be appointed in conformity with the      Appointments Clause of the Constitution, article II, section      2, clause 2. Accordingly, we would urge deletion of the      portion of Sec. 6(c)(1) that follows the word ``Internet.''      For similar reasons, we urge deletion of Sec. 6(d)(4), which      would require the Commission, as part of the report it      submits to Congress, to describe ``the technologies or      methods identified by the study that may be used as      affirmative defenses for purposes of section 231(c) . . .''      (Even if such a delegation of responsibility to the proposed      Commission     were otherwise permissible, it would be unwise, in our view,      as a matter of policy to permit the Commission--in essence--     to make such determination about a criminal offense.)       Thank you for the opportunity to present our views on this      matter. The Office of Management and Budget has advised that      there is no objection from the standpoint of the      Administration's program to the presentation of this report.

Anthony Sutin,     Acting Assistant Attorney General.                                  ____                                           Harvard Law School,                                  Cambridge, MA, October 10, 1998.     Re H.R. 3783.     Hon. John McCain,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I note that the Senate passed a version      of Congressman Oxley's H.R. 3783 earlier this year. On      September 11, I testified before the Subcommittee on      Telecommunications, Trade, and Consumer Protection, of the      House Committee on Commerce, at a hearing devoted to various      proposals for regulating access to material deemed ``harmful      to minors.'' Subsequent developments have convinced me that      the approach presently being considered is unconstitutional.       My view at that time, with respect to H.R. 3783, was that      while the idea of require adult IDs could in principle be      constitutional, the existing ID technologies would be      constitutionally too burdensome. Given other adult ID      technologies, the requirement (predominate in the statute)      that adult turn credit numbers over to pornographers in order      to get access to constitutionally protected speech struck me      as too great a burden.       Since my testimony, an argument by Professor Mark Lemley of      The University of Texas Law School, has strengthened my view      that there are serious constitutional problems with this      approach. Lemley proposes that rather than requiring adult      IDs, a less restrictive alternative would be a statute that      facilitated the development of kid IDs--digital certificates      that would be bound to a user's browser, but that would      simply identify the user as a minor. A law could then require      that servers with material deemed ``harmful to minors'' block      access by users with such certificates. Such certificates,      again, would reveal no information except that a user was a      minor.       Such a proposal, in my view, would be seen by a court to be      a clearly less restrictive alternative under First Amendment      jurisprudence. If so, the proposal would then render the      means proposed in H.R. 3783 unconstitutional.       While there are important details to be worked out in the      ``kid IDs'' alternative, I will note one other feature that      might be of interest. If kid IDs were generally available,      then Congress could more easily require commercial sites not      to gather data from kids. As it is, any rule that commercial      sites not gather data from kids would be hard to enforce. But      if such IDs became common, these other regulatory purposes      would be more easily achieved.       If there is more information that I can provide, please let      me know.           With kind regards,                                                  Lawrence Lessig.
