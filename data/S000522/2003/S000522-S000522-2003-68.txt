Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds.  I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica) for his contribution, and just remind him that his brother, Dan Mica, used to be on the House Committee on Veterans Affairs and never lost an opportunity to remind us how everyone, everybody ultimately moved to Florida from the northeast and everywhere else. So his point about need was very well-taken.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Harris) who, again, worked very hard to ensure that the Sarasota provision was included in our bill.
