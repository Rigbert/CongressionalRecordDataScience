 President. Today I rise to introduce an important resolution designating the week of February 10-16, 2008 as National Drug Prevention and Education Week. While we have made progress in curbing the rate of illegal drug use among teens in this country, there remains a great deal of work to be done. Key components of staying on top of emerging drug threats and lowering the overall rate of drug use in this country are prevention and education. These efforts start at the local level and this resolution encourages communities, schools, parents, and youth to engage in and carry out community-based prevention and education activities and programs to reduce and stop drug use before it starts.  We have come a long way in combating drug use in this country, in large part because of the good work of so many talented professionals in the prevention and treatment fields. However, the rates of illegal drug use among teens and adults remains too high. The overall rate of current illegal drug use among persons aged 12 or older is 8.3 percent, which has remained stable since 2002. Moreover, the well-known Monitoring the Future survey found ``a clear pattern of gradually rising use [of ecstasy] in the upper grades'' over the past couple of years. Thus, as the data shows, clearly we have got a lot of work left to do.  The threat of illegal drugs is not our only concern. Newly released data shows that abuse of prescription and over-the-counter medicines is a huge problem that has not declined in recent years. One in ten 12th graders has reported non-medical use of the powerful painkiller Vicodin within the past year and abuse rates of other powerful narcotics are similarly troubling.  Abuse of over-the-counter drugs has also become concerning, with nearly 6 percent of 12th graders having used over-the-counter cough and cold medications in the past year for the purpose of getting high. These problems don't simply pose serious health risks, but they are also closely linked to low educational achievement and increased risk of illegal activity and crime.  One critical component of stemming drug use is prevention. Over 20 years of research has demonstrated that prevention intervention, designed and tested to reduce risk and enhance protective factors, can help children at every step along their developmental path, from early childhood into young adulthood. The more successful we are at general prevention of drug use in younger adolescents, the less we will have to deal with the concomitant economic and societal consequences of their use-including the more than $500 billion in societal costs associated with drug and alcohol use. Community anti-drug coalitions provide the flexibility needed to effectively address the local needs of their communities.  Coalitions of local leaders, including parents, teachers, religious leaders, local law enforcement officials, youth, and business leaders have the power to reduce the demand for drugs, and we must support their efforts and applaud them for their outstanding work on these issues.  During the week of February 10-16, thousands of community anti-drug coalition leaders and community based substance abuse prevention, treatment, and education specialists will come to Washington, DC to receive state-of-the-art technical assistance, training, and education on drug prevention at the Community Anti-Drug Coalition of America's Annual National Leadership Forum. I applaud these community leaders--and prevention and treatment professionals around the Nation--for their tireless efforts to curb drug use in our country and, in recognition of these efforts I have introduced this resolution to designate the week of February 10-16, 2008 as National Drug Prevention and Education Week.                          ____________________
