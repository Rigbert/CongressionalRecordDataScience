 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the bill. I had hoped to offer amendments, as did others, that are not being allowed to improve this legislation and deal realistically with this problem.  Even if we believe the preemption of the laws of the 50 States with tort reform, something the Republicans, of course, the States rights party, does not normally believe in, would resolve this problem, we have to question, why is the pharmaceutical industry in this bill? Are they buying malpractice insurance? No. This is an incredible gift to the pharmaceutical industry.  Why is the HMO industry in this bill? Why are the nursing homes in this bill? Guess what? It is all about campaign fundraising on that side of the aisle. They know this bill is so radical, and is not a solution. It is not going anywhere in the Senate, but they want to bring it up today with no amendments and no attempt to really resolve this.  No savings are required to be passed on to the doctors in their premiums. In fact, the insurers never promised that tort reform would achieve specific premium savings. That is the American Insurance Association. That is a quote from them.  The premiums are excessive. Are they excessive because of a cyclical change in settlements? No. We have had four crises in 20 years. Guess what, there have not been four up-and-down cycles in settlements in lawsuits and malpractice; there have been four cycles in the investment losses of the insurance industry, bad underwriting, and bad accounting on their practice.  This is another corporate bailout by the Republicans, plain and simple. This is not going to help my docs. My docs really want a solution. They are desperate. Some of them are even biting on this stuff they are shoveling out. They are going to do nothing to resolve this problem long-term in this country.
