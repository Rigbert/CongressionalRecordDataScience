President, in spite of the intransigence of the White House and the overreaching of the Republican majority here in the Senate, I believe the Senate will, by the end of this week, have moved forward to confirm 111 of President Bush's judicial nominations since July 2001. That total would include 11 judges confirmed so far this year and of those 7 would be confirmed this week. Consideration of this controversial nomination of Jay S. Bybee to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is the 18th circuit nomination considered for this President since July 2001. The 17 others were each confirmed, some like Judge Shedd and Judge D. Brooks Smith with significant opposition. Nonetheless, Democrats have moved forward almost twice as promptly on this President's circuit nominees as the Republican majority did on President Clinton's circuit nominees. The Republican majority averaged 7 circuit judge confirmations a year over the 6\1/2\ years it previously controlled this process. By contrast, the Democratic majority confirmed 17 circuit judges in 17 months for President Bush, in addition to 83 district court judges.  In terms of percentages, which is what Republicans love to cite, the percentage of circuit nominees of President Clinton confirmed under the Republican majority in the 107th Congress was 0; the percentage confirmed in the 106th Congress was 44 percent; the percentage confirmed in the 105th Congress was 66 percent; and the percentage confirmed in the 104th Congress was 55 percent. In fact, despite the percentage for a full Congress, in four of their six full years, they confirmed 33 percent or less of President Clinton's circuit court nominees. In less than a full Congress, after assuming the majority in the summer of 2001 and in spite of the 9/11 attacks and the anthrax attacks and all the disruptions and priorities in those 17 months, the Democratically-led Senate not only held hearings on 20 circuit nominees, the Judiciary Committee voted on 19 and the Senate confirmed 17 for a 53 percent confirmation rate of the President's controversial slate of circuit nominees.  Those considering these matters might contrast the progress in which Democrats are assisting with the start of the last Congress in which the Republican majority in the Senate was delaying consideration of President Clinton's judicial nominees. In 1999, the first hearing on a judicial nominee was not until mid-June. The Senate did not reach 11 confirmations until the end of July of that year whereas we will reach that benchmark this year before St. Patrick's Day. Accordingly, the facts show that Democratic Senators are being extraordinarily cooperative with a Senate majority and a White House that refuses to cooperate with us. We have made progress in spite of them.  Indeed, by close of business today, we will have reduced vacancies on the Federal courts to under 55, which includes the 20 judgeships Democrats newly authorized in the 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act last year. That is an extremely low vacancy number based on recent history and well below the 67 vacancies that Senator Hatch termed ``full employment'' on the federal bench during the Clinton Administration.  Turning to the nomination now before the Senate, the nomination of Jay S. Bybee for a lifetime appointment to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is a difficult one for me. It is made all the more difficult by the respect I have for the senior Senator from Nevada, who has supported this nomination.  I think that Senator Biden made a compelling case against this nomination in his statement to the Judiciary Committee. I know that we intended to and did establish a separate Violence Against Women Office at the Department of Justice and a Director subjectto Senate confirmation when we wrote the Department of Justice authorization legislation and enacted it last year. How Mr. Bybee could misinterpret that measure is beyond me.  Mr. Bybee appeared before the Judiciary Committee in 2001 when he was nominated to serve at the Department of Justice. During that confirmation hearing, Mr. Bybee promised the Judiciary Committee that as Assistant Attorney General, he would ``not trample civil rights in the pursuit of terrorism'' and that he would ``bring additional sensitivity to the rights of all Americans'' to his work at the Justice Department. Given the veil of secrecy imposed by the Administration, I have serious concerns about how the Department of Justice has been operating.  Unfortunately, Mr. Bybee's hearing for judicial office took place on a particularly busy morning when many Senators had other committee obligations and during the Secretary of State's address to the United Nations regarding Iraq. Many of us were unable to attend Mr. Bybee's hearing in person that day. At least five of us submitted detailed sets of written questions to ask about the Justice Department and some controversial views he has taken in his academic writings and speeches before the Federalist Society.  I have given a lot of thought to this nomination. I have concerns that Mr. Bybee was chosen to be another in a long line of circuit court nominees from this President who will prove to be an ideologically driven conservative activist if accorded lifetime tenure on the Court of Appeals.  However, Senator Reid knows Mr. Bybee and supports his confirmation. Mr. Bybee is obviously conservative, but we've had a chance to review his articles and speeches and no one has called into question his ability and commitment to setting aside his views as a judge.  On the very day that Democrats cooperated in debating and voting on the Bybee nomination in Committee, our cooperation was rewarded by the Republican majority violating our rights. Republicans violated our longstanding Judiciary Committee rules and unilaterally declared the termination of debate on two other controversial circuit court nominations, John Roberts and Justice Deborah Cook that very morning.  Senator Daschle termed this unilateral action deeply troubling and a ``reckless exercise of raw power by a Chairman,'' and he is right. He observed that the work of this Senate has for over 200 years operated on the principle of civil debate, which includes protection of the minority. When a chairman can on his own whim choose to ignore our rules that protect the minority, not only is that protection lost, but so is an irreplaceable piece of our integrity and credibility.  The Democratic leader noted that faithful adherence to longstanding rules is especially important for the Senate and for its Judiciary Committee. He noted ``how ironic that in the Judiciary Committee, a Committee which passes judgment on those who will interpret the rule of law,'' that it acted in conscious disregard of the rules that were established to govern its proceedings. If this is what those who pontificate about ``strict construction'' mean by that term, it translates to winning by any means necessary. If this is how the judges of the judicial nominees act, how can we expect the nominees they support as ``strict constructionists'' to behave any better? Given this action in disrespect of the rights of the minority, how can we expect the Judiciary Committee to place individuals on the bench that respect the rule of law?  In my 29 years in the Senate and in my reading of Senate history, I cannot think of so clear a violation of Senators' rights.  As Chairman of the Agriculture Committee, as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations of the Appropriations Committee and as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I strove always to protect the rights of the minority. I did not always agree with what they were saying or doing, I did not always find it convenient, but I protected their rights. It was not always as efficient as I might have liked, but I protected their rights. That is basic to this democracy and fundamental to the Senate of the United States. Senators respect other Senators' rights and hear them out.  There is no question that the Senate majority is in charge and responsible for how we proceed. I understand that and always have--I wish Republicans had shared that view when I chaired the Judiciary Committee last year. But in the Senate, the majority's power is circumscribed by our rules and traditional practices. We protect and respect the rights of the minority in this democratic institution for the same reason we steadfastly adhere to the Bill of Rights.  I, too, am gravely concerned about this abuse of power and breach of our committee rules. When the Judiciary Committee cannot be counted upon to follow its own rules for handling important lifetime appointments to the Federal judiciary, everyone should be concerned. In violation of the rules that have governed that committee's proceedings since 1979, the chairman chose to ignore our longstanding committee rules and short-circuit committee consideration of the nominations of John Roberts and Justice Deborah Cook. Senator Daschle spoke to that matter that day. Judiciary Committee members, Senator Feinstein, Senator Schumer, Senator Durbin and Senator Feingold have also spoken to the Senate about this breach of our rules, as well as a number of other liberties that Republicans have been taking with the rules.  Since 1979, the Judiciary Committee has had this particular committee rule to bring debate on a matter to a close while protecting the rights of the minority. It may have been my first meeting as a Senator on the Judiciary Committee in 1979 that Chairman Kennedy, Senator Thurmond, Senator Dole, Senator Cochran and others discussed adding this rule to those of the Judiciary Committee. Senator Thurmond, Senator Hatch and the Republican minority at that time took a position against adding the rule and argued in favor of any individual Senator having a right to unlimited debate--so that even one Senator could filibuster a matter. Senator Hatch said that he would be ``personally upset'' if unlimited debate were not allowed.  Senator Hatch explained:       There are not a lot of rights that each individual Senator      has, but at least two of them are that he can present any      amendments which he wants and receive a vote on it and number      two, he can talk as long as he wants to as long as he can      stand, as long as he feels strongly about an issue. I think      those rights are far superior to the right of this Committee      to rubber stamp legislation out on the floor.  It was Senator Dole who drew upon his Finance Committee experience to suggest in 1979 that the Committee rule be that ``at least you could require the vote of one minority member to terminate debate.'' Senator Cochran likewise supported having a ``requirement that there be an extraordinary majority to shut off debate in our Committee.''  The Judiciary Committee proceeded to refine its consideration of what became Rule IV, which was adopted in 1979 and has been maintained ever since. It struck the balance that Republicans had suggested of at least having the agreement of one member of the minority before allowing the Chairman to cut off debate.  That protection for the minority has been maintained by the Judiciary Committee for the last 24 years under five different chairmen--Chairman Kennedy, Chairman Thurmond, Chairman Biden, under Chairman Hatch previously and during my tenure as chairman.  Rule IV of the Judiciary Committee provides the minority with a right not to have debate terminated and not to be forced to a vote without at least one member of the minority agreeing. That rule and practice had until last month always been observed by the committee, even as we have dealt with the most contentious social issues and nominations that come before the Senate.  Until last month, Democratic and Republican chairmen had always acted to protect the rights of the Senate minority. The rule has been the committee's equivalent to the Senate's cloture rule in Rule 22. It had been honored by all five Democratic and Republican chairman, including Senator Hatch--until last month.  It was rarely utilized but Rule IV set the ground rules and the backdrop against which rank partisanship wasrequired to give way, in the best tradition of the Senate, to a measure of bipartisanship in order to make progress. That is the other important function of the rule.  Besides protecting minority rights, it enforced a certain level of cooperation between the majority and minority in order to get anything accomplished. That, too, has been lost as the level of partisanship on the Judiciary Committee and within the Senate reached a new level when Republicans chose to override our governing rules of conduct and proceed as if the Senate Judiciary Committee were a minor committee of the House of Representatives.  The premature and unilateral termination of debate in committee last month was apparently a premeditated act. Senator Hatch indicated that he had checked with the parliamentarians in advance, and he apparently concluded that he had the raw power to ignore our committee rule and so long as all Republicans on the committee stuck with him, he would do so. I understand that the parliamentarians advised Senator Hatch that there is no enforcement mechanism for a violation of committee rules and that the parliamentarians view Senate Committees as ``autonomous''. I do not believe that they advised Senator Hatch that he should violate our Committee rules or that they interpreted our Committee rules.  I cannot remember a time when then-Chairman Kennedy or Chairman Thurmond or Chairman Biden would have even considered violating their responsibility to the Senate and to the committee and to our rules. Accordingly, we have never been faced with a need for an ``enforcement mechanism'' or penalty for violation of a fundamental committee rule.  In fact, on the only occasion I can recall when Senator Hatch was faced with implementing Committee Rule IV, he did so. In 1997, Democrats on the committee were seeking a Senate floor vote on President Clinton's nomination of Bill Lann Lee to be the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights at the Department of Justice.  Republicans were intent on killing the nomination in committee. The committee rule came into play when in response to an alternative proposal by Chairman Hatch, I outlined the tradition of our Committee. I said:       This committee has rules, which we have followed      assiduously in the past and I do not think we should change      them now. The rules also say that 10 Senators, provided one      of those 10 is from the minority, can vote to cut off debate.      We are also required to have a quorum for a vote.  I intend to insist that the rules be followed. A vote that is done contrary to the rules is not a valid one.  Immediately after my comment, Chairman Hatch abandoned his earlier plan and said:       I think that is a fair statement. Rule IV of the Judiciary      Committee rules effectively establishes a committee      filibuster right, as the distinguished Senator said.  With respect to the nomination in 1997, Chairman Hatch acknowledged:       Absent the consent of a minority member of the Committee, a      matter may not be brought to a vote. However, Rule IV also      permits the chairman of the Committee to entertain a non-     debatable motion to bring any matter to a vote.       The rule also provides as follows: ``The Chairman shall      entertain a non-debatable motion to bring a matter before the      Committee to a vote. If there is objection to bring the      matter to a vote without further debate, a rollcall vote of      the Committee shall be taken, and debate shall be terminated      if the motion to bring the matter to a vote without further      debate passes with ten votes in the affirmative, one of which      must be cast by the Minority.''  Thereafter, given the objection, the committee proceeded to a roll call vote whether to end the debate. That was consistent with our longstanding rule. In that case, Chairman Hatch followed the rules of the committee.  At the beginning of our executive business meeting on February 27, I referenced the Committee's rules and during the course of the debate on nominations both Senator Kennedy and I sought to have the committee follow them. We were overridden.  Last month, the bipartisan tradition and respect for the rights of the minority ended when Chairman Hatch decided to override Rule IV rather than follow it. He did so expressly and intentionally, declaring: ``[Y]ou have no right to continue a filibuster in this committee.''  Chairman Hatch decided, unilaterally, to declare the debate over even though all members of the minority were prepared to continue the debate and it was, in fact, terminated prematurely. I had yet to speak to any of the circuit nominees on the agenda and other Democratic Senators had more to say.  Senator Hatch completely reversed his own position from the Bill Lann Lee nomination and took a step unprecedented in the history of the committee. Contrast the statements of Senator Hatch in 1979 when he supported unlimited debate for a single Senator--with Republicans in the minority--with his action overriding the rights of the Democratic minority and his recent letter to Senator Daschle in which, now that Republicans hold the Senate majority, he says that he ``does not believe the Committee filibuster should be allowed and [he] thinks it is a good and healthy thing for the Committee to have a rule that forces a vote.''  But our committee rule, while providing a mechanism for terminating debate and reaching a vote on a matter, does so while providing a minimum of protection for the minority. Even this minimum protection will no longer be respected by Chairman Hatch.  Contrast Senator Hatch's recognition in 1997 that Rule IV establishes a Judiciary Committee ``filibuster right'' and that a ``[a]bsent the consent of a minority member of the Committee, a matter may not be brought to a vote,'' with his declaration last month that there is no right to filibuster in committee.  In his recent letter to Senator Daschle, Senator Hatch declares that he ``does not believe that Committee filibusters should be allowed.'' It is Senator Hatch who has ``turned Rule 4 on its head'' last month, after 24 years of consistent interpretation and implementation by five chairmen. Never before his letter to Senator Daschle has anyone since the adoption of the rule in 1979 ever suggested that its purpose was to be narrowed and redirected to thwart ``an obstreperous Chairman who refuses to allow a vote on an item on the Agenda.'' After all, as Senator Hatch recognizes in his letter, it is the chairman's prerogative to set the agenda for the mark-up.  This revisionist reading of the rule is not justified by its adoption or its prior use and appears to be nothing other than an after-the-fact attempt to justify the obvious breaches of the longstanding Committee rule and practice that occurred last month. It was not even articulated contemporaneously at the business meeting.  I appreciate the frustrations that accompany chairing the Judiciary Committee. I know the record we achieved during my 17 months of chairing that committee, when we proceeded with hearings on more than 100 of President Bush's judicial nominees and scores of his executive nominees, including extremely controversial nominations, when we proceeded fairly and in accordance with our rules and committee traditions and practices to achieve almost twice as many confirmation for President Bush as the Republicans had allowed for President Clinton, and know how that record was mischaracterized by partisans. Those 100 favorably reported nominations included Michael McConnell, Dennis Shedd, D. Brooks Smith, John Rogers, Michael Melloy and many others.  I know that sometimes a chairman must make difficult decisions about what to include on an agenda and what not to include, what hearings to hold and when. In my time as chairman I tried to maintain the integrity of the committee process and to be bipartisan. I noticed hearings at the request of Republican Senators and allowed Republican Senators to chair hearings. I made sure the committee moved forward fairly on the President's nominees in spite of the Administration's unwillingness to work with us to fill judicial vacancies with consensus nominees and thereby fill those vacancies more quickly.  But I cannot remember a time when Chairman Kennedy, Chairman Thurmond, Chairman Biden, Chairman Hatch previously, or I, ever overrode by fiat the right of the minority to debate a matter in accordance with our longstanding committee rules and practices.  The committee and the Senate have crossed a threshold of partisan overreaching that should never have been crossed. I urge the Republican leadership to recommit the nominations of Justice Deborah Cook and John Roberts to the Judiciary Committee so that they can be considered in accordance with the committee's rules. The action taken last month should be vitiated and order restored to the Senate and to the Judiciary Committee.  I urge the Republican leadership to rethink its missteps and urge the chairman and the committee to disavow the misinterpretation and violations of Rule IV that occurred last month.  We have also worked hard to report a number of important executive and judicial nominees in spite of the continued partisanship by the White House and Senate Republicans. As Senator Feinstein recently noted, we have cooperated by not insisting on our rights to seven days notice or seven days holdover on various matters and we have not insisted on three days' notice of items on the agenda. We have proceeded to debate with less than a quorum present and Democrats have been responsible for making quorum after quorum so that this committee could conduct business. Ironically, we did so even last month while our rights were being violated. Order and comity need to be restored to the Judiciary Committee and to the Senate. An essential step in that process is the restoration of our rights under Rule IV and recognition of our rights thereunder.  There are continuing problems caused by the administration's refusal to work with Democratic Senators to select consensus judicial nominees who could be confirmed relatively quickly by the Senate. Despite the President's lack of cooperation, the Senate in the 17 months I chaired the Judiciary Committee was able to confirm 100 judges and vastly reduce the judicial vacancies that had built up and were prevented by the Republican Senate majority from being filled by President Clinton.  Last year alone the Democratic-led Senate confirmed 72 judicial nominees, more than in any of the prior six years of Republican control. Not once did the Republican-controlled committee consider that many of President Clinton's district and circuit court nominees, even though there were often more judicial nominees than that waiting for a hearing. In our efforts to turn the other cheek and treat this President's nominees better than his predecessor's had fared, we confirmed 100 judges in 17 months. Yet, not a single elected Republican has acknowledged this tremendous bipartisanship and fairness. When Chief Justice Rehnquist thanked the committee for confirming 100 judicial nominees, this was the first time our remarkable record had been acknowledged by anyone from a Republican background.  Almost all of the 100 judges we confirmed last Congress are conservative, quite conservative. And with some, the Senate has taken a significant risk that they will be activist judges with lifetime tenure. We nonetheless moved fairly and expeditiously on as many as we could. We cut the number of vacancies on the courts from 110 to 59, despite an additional 50 new vacancies that arose during my tenure. I recall that Senator Hatch took the position in September of 1997 that 103 vacancies, during the Clinton Administration, did not constitute a ``vacancy crisis.'' He also stated repeatedly that 67 vacancies meant ``full employment'' on the federal courts.  Even with the vacancies that have arisen since we adjourned last year, we remain below the ``full employment'' level that Senator Hatch used to draw for the federal courts with only 60 current vacancies on the District Courts and Courts of Appeals. Unfortunately, the President has not made nominations to almost two dozen of those seats, and on more than one-half of the current vacancies he has missed his self-imposed deadline of a nomination within 180 days. Of course, several of the nominations he has made are controversial.  Last Congress, we worked hard to keep a steady pace of hearings, even though so many of this President's judicial picks proved to be quite divisive and raised serious questions about their willingness to be fair to all parties. We held hearings for 90 percent of his nominees eligible for hearings, a total of 103 nominees, including 20 circuit court nominees. We voted on 102 of them, two of whom were defeated after fair hearings and lengthy debate. The President has taken this unprecedented action of re-nominating candidates voted down in committee in spite of the serious concerns expressed by fair-minded members of this committee.  This year the committee has had a rocky beginning with a hearing that has caused a great many problems that could have been avoided. The committee proceeded to a vote on the Estrada nomination and to a vote on the Sutton nomination and to votes on the Bybee and Tymkovich nominations--all controversial nominations to circuit courts.  The rushed processing of nominees in these past few weeks has led to editorial cartoons showing conveyor belts and assembly lines with Senators just rubber-stamping these important, lifetime appointments without sufficient inquiry or understanding. What we are ending up with is a pile-up of nominees at the end of this rapidly-moving conveyer belt. There is no way that we can meaningfully keep up with our constitutional duty to determine the fitness of these nominees at this pace. The quality of our work must suffer, and slippage in the quality of justice will necessarily follow. I hope we will do all we can to prevent more of these ``I Love Lucy'' moments.  All of the Democratic Senators who serve on the Judiciary Committee have asked the Chairman to reconvene the hearing with Justice Cook and Mr. Roberts because of the circumstances under which it was held and not satisfactorily completed. We have also taken the White House up on its offer to make the nominees available with a joint letter seeking an opportunity to make further inquiries of them. Regrettably, last Wednesday the White House withdrew its offer and now refuses to proceed. That change of position by the White House, on top of the inadequate hearing on these important nominations, has created another impasse and unnecessary complication.  That is why the minority, while prepared to debate and vote on the Bybee nomination to the 9th Circuit and nine other presidential nominations on February 27, wished to continue the debate on the Cook and Roberts nominations.  Let me be specific: On January 29, the Judiciary Committee met in an extraordinary session to consider six important nominees for lifetime appointments to the federal bench, including three controversial nominees to circuit courts: Jeffrey Sutton, Justice Deborah Cook and John Roberts. Several Senators only officially learned the names of the nominees on the agenda for that hearing at 4:45 p.m. on January 28, the day before.  On learning that the chairman intended to include three controversial circuit court nominees on one hearing, something virtually unprecedented in the history of the committee, and absolutely unprecedented in this chairman's tenure, Democrats on the committee wrote to the Chairman to protest. We explained that since 1985, when Chairman Thurmond and Ranking Member Biden signed an agreement about the pace of hearings and the number of controversial nominees per hearing, there has been a consensus on the committee that members ought to be given ample time to question nominees, and that controversial nominees in particular deserve more time.  We explained that we were surprised by the chairman's rush to consider these three nominees at the same time, considering the pace at which President Clinton's nominees were scheduled for hearings. During the time Republicans controlled the Senate and Bill Clinton was president, there was never a hearing held to consider three circuit court nominees at once. Never.  Finally, we explained the importance of giving Senators sufficient time to consider each nominee and properly exercise their constitutional duty to give advice and consent to the President's lifetime appointments to the federal bench.  But our request went unanswered, and we were expected to question three nominees in the space of a single day. That proved impossible, as was evident throughout that long day. My colleagues and I asked several rounds of questions of Mr. Sutton, and were onlyable to ask very few questions of the other two nominees. We asked, during the hearing itself, that the chairman reconsider and ask the other two nominees to return the next day or the next week, and to give them the time they deserved in front of the committee, but he refused.  We asked the same thing after the hearing, and were told that indeed the nominees would make themselves available to meet with each of us, so we wrote to accept those offers, although as we explained, we would have preferred to meet with them altogether, and in a public session. But again, we were rebuffed. I wonder, though, if they were available for one sort of meeting, why were they not available for another. I regret that the White House refused our request to bring closure to those matters.  During the last 4 years of the Clinton administration, his entire second term in office after being reelected by the American people, the Judiciary Committee refused to hold hearings and committee votes on his qualified nominees to the D.C. Circuit and the Sixth Circuit. Last month, in sharp contrast, this committee was required to proceed on two controversial nominations to those circuit courts in contravention of the rules and practices of the committee. This can only be seen as part of a concerted and partisan effort to pack the courts and tilt them sharply out of balance.  I ask unanimous consent to print a letter in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                             United States Senate,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                Washington, DC, February 24, 2002.     Hon. Alberto R. Gonzales,     Counsel to the President, The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear Judge Gonzales: As you may know, Democratic Senators      on the Judiciary Committee have been offered the opportunity      to meet with Justice Deborah Cook and Mr. John Roberts in      order to ask questions and discuss issues relevant to their      nominations to lifetime appointments to United States Courts      of Appeals. We are writing to let you know that some of us      would like to accept those offers and meet with both of the      nominees together before voting on their nominations.       We are available to meet as early as Wednesday, February      26, 2003, but are amenable to another mutually convenient      time. For the purposes of review after the meeting, we will      arrange for a stenographer to attend the meeting and record      the exchanges with the nominees. We also anticipate that the      meeting will be open to the public.       We hope that you and the Department of Justice will work      with us to schedule this important meeting. Some of us      believe the January 29, 2003, Committee hearing did not      provide an adequate opportunity to ask the questions      necessary for Senators to effectively carry out their      Constitutional duty to advise and consent to judicial      nominees. Written questions are not a satisfactory substitute      for direct exchanges between Senators and the nominees.       Thank you for your assistance, and we look forward to the      meeting we have requested.           Sincerely,         Patrick J. Leahy; Edward M. Kennedy; Joseph R. Biden,            Jr.; Dianne Feinstein; Charles E. Schumer; John            Edwards; Herbert Kohl; Russell D. Feingold; Richard J.            Durbin.
