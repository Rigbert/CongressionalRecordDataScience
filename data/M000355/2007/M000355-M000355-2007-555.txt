 President, I join the majority leader in commending Mr. Morton for his extraordinary service in the Senate. Not only does he love the Redskins, he loves to fish, too--two passions I share with him. I expect he will have more time for both in the coming years. I join with my good friend, the majority leader, in thanking him for his remarkable career in the Senate and for helping us in so many ways over the years.
