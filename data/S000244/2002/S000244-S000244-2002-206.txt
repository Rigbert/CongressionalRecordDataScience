Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3838 would amend the Federal charter of the Veterans of Foreign Wars to allow any member of the Armed Forces who received hostile fire or imminent danger pay to be a member of the VFW. The language would allow veterans from conflict areas such as Somalia or Kosovo to be eligible for membership in the VFW.  Currently, VFW membership is limited to those who have honorably served in the Armed Forces and who have received a campaign medal for service or those who served honorably for a specific period on the Korean peninsula.                              {time}  1445  Without this amendment, members of the Armed Forces who served under equally dangerous conditions, such as those experienced in the campaign medal service in Korea, are not eligible for VFW membership.  The bill also adds the word ``charitable'' to the purpose of the VFW. VFW members volunteer millions of hours to local communities. Although volunteerism has always been a large part of the mission of the VFW, in some States the VFW is being denied qualification as a charitable organization because ``charitable'' is not included in their charter language.  These amendments reflect the language of two resolutions approved by the voting delegates of the VFW at their national convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I urge the House to pass this bill to ratify the changes to the VFW Federal charter, which have been approved by the membership.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
