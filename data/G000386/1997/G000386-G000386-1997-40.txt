 President, I voted for Mr. Rossotti to be reported out of the Senate Finance Committee. So, obviously, I support his nomination on the floor of the Senate today.  His resume differs from many of his predecessors. That is, he did not come to this position through appointment of the President as a tax practitioner. He comes to us from having succeeded in the business world, but not as a tax lawyer.  In business, he provided a superior product and a superior service. The country desperately needs a superior product and superior service at the IRS and a manager who can deliver both. That is why the country needs someone like Charles Rossotti to be Commissioner of the IRS.  Senator Kerrey and I found, through our work on the Commission to Restructure the IRS, that what the IRS really needed was not a tax lawyer to head it up. That had been tradition. What they need is an organizational leader. I think Charles Rossotti fills that responsibility. The duties of the IRS are very much like a big business organization.  Last year, the IRS had revenue of $1.4 trillion and a congressional appropriation of over $7 billion to collect that money. On the other hand, the IRS cannot satisfy the General Accounting Office that its books are in order. The IRS has a work force of 106,000 people. This compares to the 50 largest business organizations in America. The IRS serves 115 million individual taxpayers. Last year, it received 76 million inquiries. It handles 200 million different tax returns and over 1 billion information returns annually.  It has offices in every State in the Nation. The National Treasury Employees Union is one of the largest labor unions in the country. The IRS deals with over 12,000 financial institutions and 12 Federal Reserve banks in some 600 locations.  All of these things taken together require a manager with very special skills. Those skills do not necessarily involve expertise in the Tax Code. Consequently, that is my argument. The tradition of having a tax lawyer as IRS Commissioner is overblown. Somebody with organizational skills coming from a business organization with a proven track record in that environment is the best person to run this massive organization we call the IRS.  The IRS Commissioner's job has been thought of as the chief tax collector of our country. In a way, I hope that Mr. Rossotti does not become the Nation's chief tax collector. We all expect him to collect every dollar that is legally due.  But I would rather think of the Commissioner's job as that of the ``chief customer service representative'' at the IRS. We need to instill, in other words, through Mr. Rossotti and his background, the attitude of customer service at the IRS. In other words, another way to say that would be to put the word ``service'' back into the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Rossotti seems to recognize improved customer service as his personal task. In the private sector he knew his organization would not be successful without putting customer service No. 1 on his priority.  In January this year I wrote to the President. I discussed the kind of person that we would need to be the nextIRS Commissioner. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the materials was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                 Washington, DC, January 13, 1997.     Re selecting a non-lawyer as the next IRS Commissioner.     The President,     The White House     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: Presently you are confronted with the      resignation of Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Margaret      Milner Richardson. Though the Commissioner and I have      disagreed on certain practices and policies of the IRS, we      have had a good working relationship that has resulted in      some successes.       As you begin to consider persons whom you will nominate as      the next IRS Commissioner, I urge you to consider nominating      a new kind of administrative leader for the IRS. Rather than      focusing on lawyers with a workable knowledge of the tax law,      it may be time to nominate someone who is both a non-     Washington, D.C.-insider and a non-lawyer to be the next IRS      Commissioner. A person educated in business and experienced      in running a large private sector company would be better      suited to administer the IRS than most lawyers.       The duties of IRS are very much like a business. The IRS      would benefit from the leadership of a trained and      experienced business person. Last year, the IRS had a revenue      of 1.4 trillion dollars, and a Congressional appropriation of      over 7 billion dollars, but it cannot balance its own books      to satisfy our own Congressional accountants, the General      Accounting Office.       The IRS has an employee workforce of 110,000 individuals.      This makes it comparable to the group of the fifty largest      companies in the country. The IRS has 115 million individual      taxpayers that it must serve. As taxpayers, all of these      customers, are also owners of the IRS. IRS received 76      million taxpayer inquiries last year. It handles 200 million      different tax returns, and over 1 billion information returns      annually. It has offices in every state in the nation. The      employee union with which the Commissioner must deal, the      National Treasury Employee's Union, is one of the largest      labor unions in the country. The IRS deals with over 12,000      financial institutions and 12 Federal Reserve Banks in some      600 locations.       I think that these things suggest the need for an expertise      that is not taught in law school and is not tested on any bar      exam. The best of our prospective administrative leaders are      found in this country's private sector companies. One would      think that, if the President of the United States would ask,      he would have his choice of the best of the best.       There will be people in both the public and private sector      who will criticize the idea of a non-lawyer running the IRS.      Many of these people will be professionals of what I call the      federal tax industrial complex. About these criticisms, I      will say two things. First, most of the critics will      themselves be lawyers. Second, I will remind them that many      non-lawyer CEOs of this country all have many lawyers who      work for them, and they seem to get along just fine. I would      even suggest that the stock-holders of big companies run by      non-lawyers are much happier with the production and service      of those companies, than the people who own the IRS, the      federal taxpayers.       For these reasons, I sincerely hope that you can select a      non-lawyer as your next nominee for the post of IRS      Commissioner. If you are interested, I would like to help you      with the selection process.           Sincerely,                                              Charles E. Grassley,                                                     U.S. Senator.
