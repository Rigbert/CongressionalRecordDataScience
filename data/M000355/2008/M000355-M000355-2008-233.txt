 President, I thank my good friend from South Carolina for allowing us to go forward today. As he knows full well, we have been complaining on this side that we have not been allowed to legislate on frequent occasions lately. The majority leader has outlined a way to go forward today that allows us to do what we used to do in the Senate, which is to actually offer amendments related to the subject and vote on them. I believe this is a good way to proceed. I thank the majority leader for his accommodation, and I thank my good friend from South Carolina as well.
