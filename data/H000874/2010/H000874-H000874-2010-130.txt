We passed last year the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act which you voted against and which your party voted, to a person, against. I don't know whether you happened to see that, as a result of that act, people last year paid the lowest tax rates that they have paid since 1950. We reduced over $300 billion in taxes for individuals and small business.  Now, you can make fun of the resolutions that your party introduces and my party congratulating people for things or noting that post offices are being renamed or things of that nature, but that's a ruse. That's not the substance of what we do here. Members want to acknowledge their hometown folks. I've been in the legislature for a long period of time. They did that in the State senate. They do it here. And sometimes it's easy to make fun of.  But we've done some very substantive things. The gentleman knows that. This is one of the most productive Congresses that I've served in over the last 30 years in terms of very important pieces of legislation. Your party has voted, in many instances, against that legislation.  The proof of the pudding, of course, is in its eating. You didn't ask me where the jobs are this time as you usually do. There were 290,000 new jobs created, 230,000 jobs the month before that, and an average of 100,000 jobs have been created per month over the last 4 months.  The gentleman, over the last 4 months, hasn't mentioned jobs, apparently because he thinks perhaps we found them where, frankly, the previous administration lost them wherever they were lost. We need to bring them back.  We are investing in bills to get jobs back. We're investing in making sure that people who have lost their jobs have some sustenance to support themselves and their families. We don't think that's de minimis legislation. We think it's critically important.                              {time}  1330  We are passing legislation to make sure that people have health care; that when they lose their job, they lose their insurance, they get sick, that they have a COBRA coverage that they can count on. We don't think that is de minimis. We are working on legislation to make sure that doctors get reimbursed at appropriate levels so they will continue to serve the seniors of America under Medicare. We don't think that is de minimis action.  Now, I could go on and on, as I am sure you know and probably my colleagues know; but we believe we are passing a lot of legislation to respond to a deep crisis of economic depths, unknown since 75 years ago in the Great Depression, that we inherited and we are trying to respond to. And we are now creating jobs. We are now expanding the economy.  Somebody that you may agree with most of the time, Larry Kudlow, said, you ought to stop talking down the economy. The facts speak for themselves. GDP growth for three quarters in a row, jobs being created, stock market up. It has been down and up in little glitches, but it is up some 70 percent on the Dow, 80 percent on the S&P, and almost 100 percent on the NASDAQ. None of that we think is de minimis, I tell my friend.  Both sides, by the way, do what you just did. We did it to you and we made fun of these little resolutions that don't take much time but are meaningful to the constituencies that hear about them and appreciate the fact that their efforts throughout the country were acknowledged in one way or another, or that somebody that has great respect in their community was honored. Many soldiers and sailors and airmen and marines are being honored by having post offices named for them in their communities. Others are being honored.  So I tell my friend, we need to be serious. We have a critical deficit confronting us. We have a critical long-term deficit confronting us. We have a critical problem of an unsustainable entitlement regime confronting us. The Peterson Institute is running hearingsall over this country to say, Americans, tell us what you think. I don't think your idea is a bad idea of asking Americans. We all want to ask Americans: What do you think? So we can come together to solve what we both agree is a very serious economic ditch into which we have fallen. We need to get out of it. We need to work together to do that. The American public expects us to do that.
