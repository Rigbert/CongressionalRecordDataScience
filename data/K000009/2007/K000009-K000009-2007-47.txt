Chairman, I thank the gentleman very much for yielding.  As I said with Issa's choice, it is either being shot with a pistol or a rifle. It does not guarantee that once the patent is granted that that person can keep their intellectual property, can opt out and not have it published for that 18-month period. So we are taking away that intellectual property protection.
