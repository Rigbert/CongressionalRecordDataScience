 President, I wish to thank the Senator from California for her willingness not to offer those amendments. I thank her very much, because it will help us hurry the legislation through this body and to the President of the United States.  I also want to assure her for our leader--because he has said so many times himself that there will be an ample opportunity to discuss the issues that she wants to bring up, as well as the campaign finance reform issue will be discussed--that there will be plenty of opportunity to do that.  I say that not only to assure the Senator from California of that opportunity, but also to suggest to other people on her side of the aisle, on the Democratic side of the aisle, who have amendments that deal with campaign finance reform--and there still are a few of the 20 yet to deal with tomorrow--that maybe they will follow the example of the Senator from California and not offer their amendments so that we can get done with this bill earlier tomorrow.
