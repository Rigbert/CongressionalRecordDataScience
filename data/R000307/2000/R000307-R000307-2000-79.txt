First, I thank the Senator from Maine for all her leadership and her hard work in this effort, for tapping not so gently on the shoulders of the leadership and, in a bipartisan way, attracting all sorts of support for this bill. I believe it is possible for Congress to bring this much needed relief to the home health care industry, as well as to the small rural hospitals and the teaching hospitals that are feeling the pinch of all these regulatory and legislative changes made in the last few years--with every good intent.  But this is the law of unintended consequences personified. We must work quickly. Time is of the essence for many of our home health agencies and hospitals, especially the small rural providers. I don't want to have to go out again on a 105-county listening tour in Kansas and have people come and say; Senator Roberts, thank you so much for your past help on a whole litany of things we have gone through regarding the home health care delivery system, only to find out that their doors may close.  I will continue to work with my colleague from Maine to pass legislation before Congress adjourns this year. We have a good team and we have good support. We cannot go home without providing help. I thank the distinguished Senator for her leadership in heading up a home health care posse for fairness and justice.
