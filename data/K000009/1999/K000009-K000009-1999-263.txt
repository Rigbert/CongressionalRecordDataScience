Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a long time friend, John Michael Hurley of my district. John passed from this life on June 10, 1999.  John made his career in public service, first in the Armed Forces where he served in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps Reserves, and Air Force. Upon his retirement from the Air Force he began a career with the City of Toledo's Streets, Bridges & Harbors Division until his 1992 retirement. While employed with the city, he rose to the top leadership post of AFSCME Local 7. He worked for the union as steward, divisional steward, chief steward, and president. He also served AFSCME Ohio Council 8 as regional vice president, and was a board member of Ohio's Public Employees Retirement System. Throughout that service, the quality guarded the hard fought rights of working people throughout our community and state.  In addition to his civil service, John was also an active member of local veterans organizations, belonging to the Veterans of Foreign Wars Northwood Post #2984 and American Legion Conn Weisenberger Post #587. Rounding out his service to community and country, John coached Toledo's North End Lagrange Lions Baseball Team.  A family man, John was the proud father of Angela, Laura, Lillian, Nicole, Patrick, Andrew, David, and Kelly, and doting grandfather to 21 grandchildren. Our condolences to them, his wife Joanne, and his sisters and brothers. May they gain some small comfort in knowing the spirit and fire of John Hurley is carried through in each of them. The people of our community have been touched with his strength and kindness and our nation expresses its gratitude for his service to our country.                          ____________________
