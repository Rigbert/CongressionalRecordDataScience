President, I am proud to recognize Aaron Goldberg, Jeffrey Potash and the greater Ohavi Zedek community for their tireless efforts in relocating a treasured artifact in our State's Jewish community. For nearly two decades, the historically significant Shul Mural--a 105-year-old rare mural--has sat hidden behind the walls of Chai Adam Synagogue in Burlington's north end district. In May, after years of careful restoration and planning, the mural was safely moved to its new home, where it will finally be displayed to honor a prominent period in our State's Jewish history.  Burlington's Jewish history dates back to the mid-1880s, when a large influx of Lithuanian Jews traveled from Eastern Europe to settle in Vermont. Ohavi Zedek Synagogue was established in 1885 by the Lithuanians, and has since remained a thriving community stronghold for Burlington's Jewish population. In 1889, the Chai Adam Synagogue was created by a group of Orthodox Jews previously aligned with Ohavi Zedek. It is here the Shul Mural was created.  Stretching floor-to-ceiling, the Shul Mural depicts two lions and the Ten Commandments, two iconic symbols in the Jewish faith. The Shul Mural, painted by Ben Zion Black, uses a rare artistic style, one that dates back to before World War II and was prevalent in wooden synagogues across Eastern Europe. At that time, vast murals of iconic, hand-painted images sprawled entire walls and ceilings to capture the imagery held in Jewish Torah readings. The Shul Mural presents a rare folk design mixed with modern painting techniques, yet little is actually known about its genre, as most of these works were sadly destroyed during the Holocaust.  In 1939, Ohavi Zedek and Chai Adam rejoined, and the old Chai Adam was sold and used as retail space and later a rug store. It was here that Adam Goldberg, a volunteer and historian of Ohavi Zedek Synagogue, discovered the mural. Through the years, the Shul Mural sat uncovered and ill-preserved, until 1986 when the space was renovated to an apartment complex, and Mr. Goldberg along with Ohavi Zedek archivist, Jeffrey Potash, pleaded with the new owner to cover the mural with a false wall so that it would not bear further decay.  Over two decades later, when the apartment building was again sold in 2012, its new owner, Steven Offenhartz, agreed to donate the mural to Ohavi Zedek. The false wall that had covered the Shul Mural for more than 20 years was lifted, and the construction team worked with Constance Silver, a conservator from Brattleboro, to stabilize and recover what was lost. At that point, decades of deterioration had taken their toll, and the once vibrant paint began to dull and flake away. Piece by piece, Constance reinforced and restored the painting.  On May 6, 2015, after decades in hiding, the mural was successfully transported to Ohavi Zedek where it will be cleaned and further restored. The hard work and dedication of the entire team with the support of Burlington's community--which raised over $400,000 to support the restoration and transportation of this historic piece of art--made this incredible feat possible.  Adam Goldberg, Jeffrey Potash, Steven Offenhartz, Constance Silver, and the many other members of the Ohavi Zedek and greater Burlington community should be congratulated for their support and dedication to protecting and restoring one of our State's most significant treasures. This important piece of Burlington's Jewish history will finally be on proper display for all to enjoy.  I ask unanimous consent that that an article on the Shul Mural from the Burlington Free Press be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Burlington Free Press, May 14, 2015]                  ``Lost'' Jewish Mural Finds New Home               (By Zach Despart, Free Press Staff Writer)       When the project was done, it might have appeared to      onlookers that a construction crew had no difficulty moving      the Lost Shul Mural to a new home in the Old North End.       After all, the construction crew only had to remove the      roof of a Hyde Street building, lift via crane a brittle,      multi-panel, 105-year-old rare piece of art, place the mural      on a flatbed truck, drive it nearly half a mile uphill and,      with the strength of many workers, push the artwork, on      rollers, into Ohavi Zedek Synagogue.       All in a day's work for a volunteer group of local      residents, who for almost three decades have been trying to      find a way to move the historic artifact from a hidden alcove      on Hyde Street to more suitable location.       ``I had hoped to someday move the mural, but it's been over      29 years we've been waiting for this time,'' Ohavi Zedek      archivist Aaron Goldberg said Wednesday. ``It's a remarkable      achievement for the community to have this here.''       The story of the lost work begins in 1910, when      Burlington's Jewish community commissioned Lithuanian artist      Ben Zion to paint a mural within the Chai Adam synagogue,      which was built on Hyde Street in 1889. The floor-to-ceiling      mural contains three panels that depict Jewish iconography,      including two lions and the Ten Commandments.       In 1939, Chai Adam merged with Ohavi Zedek and vacated the      Hyde Street building.       Congregants, in an effort to preserve the mural, hid the      piece behind a false wall. The ownership of the building      changed hands several times in the following decades, and a      private owner in 1986 converted the building into apartments.       That year, Goldberg and other archivists persuaded the      owner to wall off the mural permanently with Sheetrock, so      the art would be safe for a later move. Many tenants over the      next two decades never knew the mural was there.       But Burlington's Jewish community never forgot about the      lost mural. In 2012, some 26 years since the mural      disappeared from public view, the archivists of Ohavi Zedek      worked with the owner of the building to uncover the artwork.       They decided to move the artifact to Ohavi Zedek and      proudly display the mural in the lobby. For the next three      years, a dedicated group of congregants developed a plan for      the big move, and raised more than $400,000.       ``This is a very innovative job,'' Goldberg said. ``This      took two and a half years of planning.''                              The big move       The moment Goldberg for decades had waited for arrived      Wednesday. Shortly after 8 a.m. on the warm, calm morning,      crews used a crane to lift off a pre-cut section of the roof      of the synagogue-turned-apartment-building on Hyde Street,      exposing the old cupola that held the mural.       The mural itself was not visible to onlookers. For      protection, it was encased in cushioning made of Chinese silk      and other materials. Bob Neeld, the structural engineer, said      this project required special attention to minimize any      vibrations that could damage the mural.       ``Even a three-story building can be built to handle      several inches of movement,'' Neeld said. For this move,      Neeld added, the crew was hoping to limit movement ``to a      couple thousandths of an inch.''       The mural itself is made of less than half an inch of      plaster on a wood lathe. To stabilize the century-old      material before the move, crews reinforced the artwork with      mortar.       After the roof was off, the crane lifted the fragile mural,      encased in a specially built steel frame, from the second      floor of the structure and placed the artifact onto a flatbed      truck. The mural and frame stood about feet tall and 15 feet      wide, and weighed about 6,500 pounds.       Next came a slow parade through the Old North End, as the      truck crept north on Hyde Street, east on Archibald Street      and south on North Prospect Street, onto the lawn of Ohavi      Zedek. A crowd of congregants, many of them with cameras,      followed the informal procession. Burlington police blocked      the intersections along the way. Perplexed motorists      scratched their heads.       In front of the synagogue, another crane lifted the mural      onto a makeshift bed of rollers on a wooden ``landing pad.''      Once there, about of dozen laborers pushed the 3-ton mural      through an opening into the lobby. Next week, crews will      hoist the mural above the lobby, where the art will hang for      visitors to see, much as it did on Hyde Street 105 years ago.       Organizers planned the move to take 12 hours, but it took      just three--a result engineers chalked up to good weather and      meticulous planning.                         Community significance       Thousands of European synagogues--and the ornate murals      within the places of worship--were destroyed by the Nazis      during the Holocaust. The Lost Shul Mural is one of the few      remaining murals from that time period in existence, said      Goldberg, the Ohavi Zedek archivist.       Rabbi Joshua Chasan said the restoration of the lost mural      was important not only to Burlington's Jewish community, but      to Jews around the world.       ``It's a benefit to the Jewish people internationally to      have a piece of folk art from the world the Nazis      destroyed,'' Chasan said. ``In that sense, it's a memorial to      those who died in the Holocaust and . . . to that Jewish      world that perished.''       Goldberg said that in addition to being a Jewish relic, the      lost mural is an important connection to Burlington's rich      history of hosting immigrants. Among the European immigrants      who settled in Burlington during the 19th century were a      group of Lithuanian Jews who moved into the city's North End,      a neighborhood that for decades came to be known as Little      Jerusalem.       ``This is immensely important to the preservation      immigration history in Vermont,'' Goldberg said. ``It is the      only example of its kind we know of in the U.S., and one of      the few remaining remnants in the world.''       Janie Cohen, director of the University of Vermont's      Fleming Museum, said having such a rare piece of art in      Burlington is remarkable.       ``The fact there are so few of these left in the world, and      we have one in Burlington--it's phenomenal,'' said Cohen, who      watched the move Wednesday.       Former Vermont Gov. Madeleine Kunin, who helped raise money      for the move and the restoration, walked with the crowd that      followed the mural as the truck traveled through the Old      North End.       ``Today is so exciting, because many people thought it      would never happen: How can you move something that's part of      a wall?'' she said.       One man on the synagogue lawn had a special connection to      the lost art. He remembers seeing the mural 76 years ago.      Mark Rosenthal, 84, grew up in Burlington and remembers      seeing the mural as a child at Chai Adam in the 1930s.       ``My father and I would go on holidays,'' Rosenthal said.      ``I remember the whole scene where the mural was, and I'm      moved and touched by what is taking place today. I can't      believe it's happening.''                          ____________________
