Speaker, the 276 million of us who do not work in the farming and ranching sectors need to take time today on National Agriculture Day to give thanks to the 700,000 men and women of American agriculture for all they do to feed our Nation and, indeed, much of the rest of the world.  Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to pay highest tribute to some of the hardest working people in America. I know of no other people who take such great financial risks, give more of themselves each and every day, and who do so with great discipline and dignity.  With the depression that is afflicting rural regions of our country, America needs a new declaration of economic independence, and that declaration should insist that America's farmers and ranchers are not expendable. Their husbandry and stewardship are central pillars of our national security and freedom.  Today, we are witnessing an alarming hollowing out of America's countryside and a wanton destruction of precious arable lands that have sustained us and on which future generations will depend.  Rural America is on life support. The current farm depression, now in its fourth year, is the deepest since 1915. This year's prices were at a 27-year low.  The average age of our farmers is 57 years, and now they are getting over three-fourths of their earnings in public support because the market does not work for them.  And up until today, National Agriculture Day, what have we heard from the new administration? Silence. Not the peacefulness of the countryside, but the eerie solemnness of the graveyard.  President Bush, when he delivered his State of the Union address just a few weeks ago in this Chamber, had nothing to offer America's farmers. No plans. No solutions. No ideas. The budget that he has submitted so far suggests that agriculture's crisis will be taken care of out of something called a contingency fund. That sounds like it is tangential. Now, how exactly is that supposed to happen?  The President has talked largely about estate taxes, implying that farmers can leave their properties to sons and daughters. But what does that do to earn a living today and hold on for the rest of their productive years?  Anyone who saw the New York Times story this past weekend saw the heart-wrenching story about potato growers in Idaho facing their lowest prices in decades. They are worried about having an income. What will a tax cut do for them?  Then yesterday the President spoke on our Nation's energy policy. But, for agriculture, it was again the sound of silence. America has the ability to convert many of our crops into ethanol and biodiesel, throwing off the yoke of international fuel dependency. In fact, if we just converted our strategic petroleum reserve to a strategic fuels reserve and only fill 2 percent of it with biofuels, we would double the production of both ethanol and biodiesel in this country, helping to build that new industry from inside this Nation.  But the President did not mention it, not a word. But he did express his appreciation just yesterday to the OPEC ministers who agreed to hold price increases to only 7 percent for imported fuel. He thought that gesture by them was comforting. It is not comforting to me.  Mr. President, why do you not offer some comfort to America's farmers and ranchers and help them get their prices up the same 7 percent that you are willing to accept for oil? Why do you not help them develop new products like ethanol and biodiesel? Why do you not tell them what you propose to break them out of the cycle of dependency on government farm payments? Why do you not offer an agriculture policy that our farmers and ranchers can look toward the future?  Let me start in this way. America's farmers and ranchers need a new farm bill that gives equal footing to them in our global marketplace, starting out with contracting rights. We need a budget from the executive branch that addresses the farm crisis and positions American agriculture for the future.  We need to meet America's energy crisis with a major national commitment to biofuels. We must invest in new ways for farmers and ranchers to move their products to the market domestically and internationally. We need to restore a free market in agriculture and enforce antitrust laws.  We must give farmers and ranchers a place at the bargaining table in global trade negotiations, starting with the reform of NAFTA and the proposal for the free trade agreement of the Americas. We must launch a new homesteading program that ties the chance to retain your farm or to own a farm mortgage and title to conservation and holding and preserving our arable land for future generations who will depend on it.  Mr. President, it is National Agriculture Day. Help us celebrate it by giving America's farmers and ranchers the respect and the attention they deserve at the highest levels.                          ____________________
