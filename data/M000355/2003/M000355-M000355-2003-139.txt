 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m. tomorrow, November 4. I further ask that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then begin a period of morning business for 60 minutes, with the first 30 minutes under the control of the minority leader or his designee and the second 30 minutes under the control of Senator Hutchison or her designee, provided that following morning business, the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. 1753, the fair credit reporting bill.  I further ask consent that the Senate recess tomorrow from 12:30 to 2:15 p.m. for the weekly party luncheons.
