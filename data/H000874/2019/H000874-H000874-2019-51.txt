 Madam Speaker, I would advise all Members on both sides of the aisle not to schedule any business outside of Washington, D.C., between the 16th and the 20th of next month. And I will advise them further if, in fact, we do not fund the government by the 20th, they may well be here longer than that. We will not leave here without funding the Government of the United States of America.
