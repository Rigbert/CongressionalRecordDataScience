 President, I rise today with my colleagues Senator Gordon Smith and Ron Wyden of Oregon, as well Senator Max Baucus and Senator Slade Gorton to introduce legislation to strengthen tax incentives and encourage more charitable giving in America. The legislation, based on S. 1121 which I introduced last year, represents an important step to encourage greater private sector support for important educational, medical, and other goals in local communities across the country.  Americans are among the most caring in the world, contributing generously to charities in their communities: American families contribute, on average, nearly $650 for each household, or about $130 billion annually, to charities. Approximately, three out of every four households give to nonprofit charitable organizations.  However, charities are very concerned for the future, as Federal efforts to balance the budget will limit funds for social spending for urgent needs like children's services, homelessness, job training, and health care. While support for charities grew by 3.7 percent in 1994, contributions for human services, the area most closely associated with poverty programs, dropped by 6 percent. Nonprofit charities are very concerned about their ability to maintain their current level of services or grow to address unmet needs.  Nonprofit charities can never replace government programs, but they can play a critical role and provide vital social services. The Federal Government must ensure we are doing everything we can to encourage support for charities, which supplement Federal programs.             expanding tax incentives for charitable giving  The Federal Government must provide the leadership and the tools to encourage more charitable giving through the Tax Code. One source of untapped resources for charitable purposes is closely held corporate stock. A closely held business is a corporation, in which stock is issued to a small number shareholders, such as family members, but is not publicly traded on an exchange. This type of business is very popular for family businesses involving different generations.  However, the tax cost of contributing closely held stock to a charity or foundation can be prohibitively high. The tax burden discourages families and owners from winding down a business and contributing the proceeds to charity. This legislation would permit certain tax-free liquidations of closely held corporations into one or more tax exempt 501(c)(3) organizations.  Under current law, a corporation may have to be liquidated to effectively complete the transfer of assets to a charity, incurring a corporate tax at the 35 percent tax rate. In 1986, Congress repealed the ``General Utilities'' doctrine, imposing a corporate level tax on all corporate transfers, including those to tax exempt charitable organizations. A charity may also be subject to taxation on its unrelated business income from certain types of donated property.  These tax costs make contributions of closely held stock a costly and ineffective means of giving funds to a charity. If we are going to find new ways to strengthen charities, we need to review the tax costs which undercut the incentive to give and the value of a charitable gift.  Volunteers are already hard at work in their communities and charitable funding is already stretched dangerously thin. Charities need added tools to unlock the public's desire to give generously. We need to create appropriate incentives for the private sector to do more.  In California, volunteer and charitable organizations, together, perform vital roles in the community and deserve our support. I would like to offer some examples, which can be also found throughout the country:  Summer Search: In San Francisco, the Summer Search Foundation is hard at work preventing students from dropping out of high school. Summer Search helps students successfully complete school and, for 93 percent of the participants, go on to college. With increased charitable contributions, Summer Search could help keep kids in school and on track toward graduation and a more productive contribution to the Nation.  Drew Center for Child Development: I am deeply concerned with increases in the number of child abuse and neglect cases, which now total nearly 3 million children in the United States. Social services block grants cuts will impose new burdens on local communities. The Drew Child Development Center, located in the Watts area of Los Angeles, works directly with children and families involved in child abuse environments. There are thousands of other families that could benefit from the Drew Center program if only more resources were available. Stronger taxincentives to boost charitable giving could provide the Drew Center with some of the resources needed to combat this enormous problem.  The Chrysalis Center: In 1993 I visited the Chrysalis Center, a Los Angeles organization dedicated to helping homeless individuals find and keep jobs. Chrysalis provides employment assistance, from training in jobseeking skills to supervised searches for permanent employment. The Center has helped place thousands of people in permanent, full-time jobs in the last decade.  Jobs for the Homeless: Jobs for the Homeless assists with job placement services for the homeless in Berkeley and Oakland, supporting over 1,400 men and women. However, thousands more need their help. The former homeless individuals have landed successful positions in manufacturer, retailers, and small and large businesses. Without more contributions, Jobs for the Homeless will be unable to provide the necessary support and increase their literacy or drug rehabilitation programs, critical ingredients in moving people back to work.  Today, Senators Smith, Wyden, Baucus, Gorton, and I introduce tax incentive legislation to encourage stronger support for the Nation's vital charities. The proposal: Eliminates the corporate tax upon liquidation of a qualifying closely held corporation under certain circumstances. The legislation would require 80 percent or more of the stock to be dedicated to a charity; and clarifies that a charity can receive mortgaged property in a qualified liquidation, without triggering unrelated business income tax for 10 years.  By eliminating the corporate tax upon liquidation, Congress would encourage additional, and much needed, charitable gifts. Across America, countless thousands have built successful careers and have generated substantial wealth in closely held corporations. As the individuals age and plan their estates, we should help them channel their wealth to philanthropic goals. Individuals who are willing to make generous bequests of companies and assets, often companies they have spent years building, should not be discouraged by substantially reducing the value of their gifts through Federal taxes.  While the Joint Tax Committee has not yet prepared an official revenue cost, previous estimates suggest a cost of about $400 million over 5 years. However, as a result of capital gains tax reform adopted earlier this year, the cost if likely to be significantly lower. Of equal significance, the same revenue estimating assumptions project big increases in charitable giving as a result of the legislation, stimulating between $3 and 5 billion in charitable contributions. This tax proposal may generate as much as seven or eight times its projected revenue loss in expanded charitable giving.  I encourage others to review this legislation and listen to the charities in your community. The legislation has been endorsed by the Council on Foundations, which represents foundations throughout the country, and the Council of Jewish Federations. Since the introduction of the legislation last year, the proposal has been revised to sharpen the bill's focus and target the legislation in the most effective manner. I want to encourage the review process to continue, so we may continue to build support and target the bill's impact for the benefit of the Nation's nonprofit community.  With virtually limitless need, we must look at new ways to encourage and nurture a strong charitable sector. Private charities cannot replace the government, but if the desire to support charitable activity exists, we should not impose taxes to decrease the value of that support. Tax laws should encourage, rather than impede, charitable giving. By inhibiting charitable gifts, Federal tax laws hurt those individuals that most need the help of their government and theie community.                                 ______                                       By
