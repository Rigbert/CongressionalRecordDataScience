 President, I am pleased to join my good friend Senator Hagel in introducing the Famine Prevention and Freedom from Hunger Improvement Act of 2000.  The challenge facing developing nations whose people live in hunger today is no longer just how to increase food production. As we enter the new millennium, those countries must also confront the problems of inadequate income, lack of access to markets for both producers and consumers, and unsustainable natural resource management practices.  One of the keys to all these issues must be a new, more productive relationship between educational institutions--here in the U.S. and in the affected countries--and their private partners involved in agricultural development. In short, they must become part of the new, higher-tech, international agricultural economy. This bill, an amendment to the Foreign Assistance Authorization Act, is designed to move us in that direction.  Mr. President, when delegates from around the world gathered in Rome in 1996 for the World Food Summit, they pledged to reduce by half the number of people suffering from hunger by the year 2015. At that time the number of hungry people was estimated to be between 830 and 840 million. Now, four years later, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that there are 790 million people in the developing world who do not get enough the eat each day. This is positive news, but it is painfully evident that more needs to be done.  Title XII of the FAA, Famine Prevention and Freedom from Hunger, was written in 1975, at a time when there was a significant level of famine and hunger in the world. Its aim was to involve U.S. universities in the fight to increase food production. Mr. President, that mission has achieved a large degree of success. It is time to go beyond the basic issue of production, to take on the further challenges of increasing access to markets, improving shipping and storage, promoting environmentally sustainable agriculture, and turning farming in developing nations from a subsistence activity into a source of income.  The U.S. Action Plan on Food Security was developed to fulfill America's part of the 1996 commitment to cut in half the number of hungry persons by 2015. This plan includes several key priority areas, including strengthened research and educational capacity, increased liberalization of trade and investment, and greater attention to natural resource management and environmental degradation. This legislation furthers U.S. efforts by amending title XII of the Foreign Assistance Act to reflect these priorities.  As a donor country, our task is to channel assistance into the areas in which it is most needed, and to use the most effective means to do so. American land and sea grant colleges have been engaged in agricultural research for years and, increasingly in the past decade, have partnered with private research institutions. In my own state of Delaware, Mr. President, both the University of Delaware and Delaware State University are engaged in just the kind of research that could benefit from the support this legislation will provide.  I would wager, Mr. President, that most Americans are not aware of the many direct benefits that our country's foreign assistance programs can provide for us right here at home. Our commitment to reduce hunger in developing countries not only benefits those in need: with the changes this bill proposes, we will increase the existing benefits to U.S. universities and research institutions, and our private organizations involved in agricultural development. Our assistance programs, while primarily aimed at helping those abroad, can and should reflect our commitment to involve U.S. universities and businesses, with all of their expertise and experience, in making the world a healthier, more productive, and a safer place.  Mr. President, here in the United States, we are experiencing a period of unprecedented growth. At a time in which we have so much, I believe that we have a moral obligation to share our blessings. This bill helps us to shift our priorities to reflect changing realities so that the generosity of the American people is as effective and targeted as possible.                                 ______
