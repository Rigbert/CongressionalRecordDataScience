Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to continue to thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney), the chairman of the Committee on House Administration, who has been so incredibly important in getting us to this point. We passed a very good bill through the House. The Senate has now passed a bill which also, in my opinion, has some very good aspects. It will now be necessary to put those two bills together so that we might in a timely fashion enact election reform.  The effort to correct the problems that surfaced in the 2000 election has been in some respects a long, lean one and often a difficult one; but then, of course, Mr. Speaker, most worthwhile efforts are.  Today, as this House prepares to go to the conference with the other body, I am pleased to say that we are closer than ever to enacting the most comprehensive voting reform legislation since the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  The motion that I am offering today is intended to ensure that as Congress enters this final critical stage of election reform we do not forget to correct the very problem that sparked us to recognize the need for reform in the first place. I am referring, of course, to the infamous punch card machines and their accompanying chads, which were used by approximately one-third of all voters in this country in 2000, more than any other voting system.  My motion would instruct House conferees to insist on title I of the House-passed version of H.R. 3295, which authorizes $400 million for the buyout of punch card voting machines. Numerous authoritative studies issued in the past year, including one by MIT and CalTech have only confirmed what we all knew was the truth in November 2000, that punch card machines must be retired and replaced by a new generation of more accurate, more accessible and more user-friendly voting technology.  H.R. 3295, the Help America Vote Act, which this House passed last December by an overwhelming vote, recognizes that obsolete, poorly maintained punch card machines are a prime threat to our democratic process. Recognizing this threat, title I authorizes a $400 million punch card buyout program that will be available to those States and political subdivisions that used punch card machines in 2000. For States like Florida and Georgia, they have already begun replacing their punch card machines. Title I authorizes assistance in that effort.                              {time}  1630  Under title I, States or their political subdivisions will receive conditional grants of up to $6,000 for each voting precinct in which punch card machines were used in 2000. The motion also instructs the House conferees to insist on section 232 of the Help America Vote Act, which creates a simple, common sense formula for distribution of funds.  Mr. Speaker, I believe that this is a motion which has been agreed on by the chairman and myself. It does not obviously deal with all aspects on which there is some controversy. I expect us to discuss that in the conference, but I am expecting, as our relationship has been, where not only has the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney) and I worked closely together, but our staffs have worked closely together, that we will reach an historic reform piece of legislation to ensure that every American not only has the right to vote, not only is facilitated in that vote, not only is encouraged and educated as to how to vote, but is assured that their vote will count.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
