 President, I am going to propound my consent agreement with a modification one more time and then I am going to engage in a colloquy with Senator Coleman. It is his amendment that he had hoped to offer, which I initially offered consent that we take up. Then these additional amendments were a different trigger, these additional consents were with a different trigger. I say to my friend from Minnesota, I will give our friends on the other side one more opportunity to maybe get their attention. Then we will discuss the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota.  Mr. President, I renew my request with the modification that the trigger be $10 a gallon at the pump.
