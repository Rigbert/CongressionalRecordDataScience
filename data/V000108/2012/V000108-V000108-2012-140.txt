Speaker, it is with great respect and admiration that I recognize the Gary, Indiana Alumnae Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority for recently celebrating its 75th anniversary. The theme for the event was ``Through the Looking Glass: A Supreme Record of Sisterhood, Scholarship and Service.'' In honor of this momentous occasion, a reception was held on Friday, October 19, 2012, at the Genesis Convention Center in Gary, Indiana.  Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Incorporated, is a private, non-profit organization that was founded on January 13, 1913, by 22 students at Howard University in Washington, DC. The organization was founded in order to promote academic excellence and to assist the underserved population by providing scholarships, supporting community organizations, and by empowering people to fight for positive public policy. In one of their first public acts, the Delta founders participated in the Women's Suffrage March in Washington DC. on March 3, 1913. The Deltas were incorporated in 1930 and today, the sisterhood has over 200,000 female members and 900 chapters across the world.  Throughout the years, the sorority has continued to establish programs that strengthen the African American family and improve education, healthcare, and international development. The programs supported and developed by Delta Sigma Theta are based on the organizations five-point thrust that includes: economic development, educational development, international awareness and involvement, physical and mental health, and political awareness and involvement. Each program is coordinated by committees that work together to develop and implement this five-point thrust.  The Gary, Indiana, Alumnae Chapter has worked diligently to serve the city of Gary and all of Northwest Indiana. The Gary Alumnae chapter has created many innovative programs that have helped numerous peoplethroughout the community. Delta Days at Gary City Hall is a program that was created in order for chapter members to voice their concerns about issues affecting the community to the mayor, city council, and other elected officials. Every year, the Gary Chapter gives out five $1,000 scholarships to girls that attend Northwest Indiana schools. The mentoring program has been implemented to help students learn the importance of staying in school, setting goals, and making positive decisions. The Gary Alumnae Chapter contributes to the Maama Project, which supports efforts to help with the healthy and safe delivery of babies of women in Africa. For several years, the chapter has hosted a free Thanksgiving dinner feeding hundreds of people. There is so much that the chapter has accomplished over the years, and Northwest Indiana is not only proud but inspired by the good works of this outstanding organization.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the members of the Gary, Indiana, Alumnae Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority for the exceptional contributions they have made to the city of Gary, Northwest Indiana, and throughout the world. I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating the Gary, Indiana, Alumnae Chapter on the organization's 75th anniversary.                          ____________________
