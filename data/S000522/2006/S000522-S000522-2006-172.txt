Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 190) expressing the sense of the Congress that the Russian Federation should fully protect the freedoms of all religious communities without distinction, whether registered and unregistered, as stipulated by the Russian Constitution and international standards.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 190       Whereas the Russian Federation is a participating State of      the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe      (OSCE) and has freely committed to fully respect the rights      of individuals, whether alone or in community with others, to      profess and practice religion or belief;       Whereas the Russian Federation specifically committed in      the 1989 Vienna Concluding Document to ``take effective      measures to prevent and eliminate discrimination against      individuals or communities on the grounds of religion or      belief'' and to ``grant upon their request to communities of      believers, practicing or prepared to practice their faith      within the constitutional framework of their States,      recognition of the status provided for them in the respective      countries'';       Whereas Article 28 of the Constitution of the Russian      Federation declares ``everyone shall be guaranteed the right      to freedom of conscience, to freedom of religious worship,      including the right to profess, individually or jointly with      others, any religion'' and Article 8 of the 1997 Law on      Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations provides for      registration for religious communities as ``religious      organizations,'' if they have at least 10 members and have      operated within the Russian Federation with legal status for      at least 15 years;       Whereas registration is critical for religious groups to      fully enjoy their religious freedoms, as many rights and      privileges afforded to religious communities in the Russian      Federation are contingent on obtaining registration;       Whereas many religious groups refuse to seek registration      on theological or other grounds, while other communities have      been unjustly denied registration or had their registration      improperly terminated by local authorities;       Whereas many of the unregistered communities in the Russian      Federation today were never registered under the Soviet      system because they refused to collaborate with that      government's anti-religious policies and they are now      experiencing renewed discrimination and repression from the      authorities;       Whereas over the past 2 years there have been an estimated      ten arson attacks on unregistered Protestant churches, with      little or no effective response by law enforcement officials      to bring the perpetrators to justice;       Whereas in some areas of the Russian Federation law      enforcement personnel have carried out violent actions      against believers from unregistered communities peacefully      practicing their faith; and       Whereas the United States has sought to protect the      fundamental and inalienable human right to seek, know, and      serve God according to the dictates of one's own conscience,      in accordance with the international agreements committing      nations to respect individual freedom of thought, conscience,      and belief: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that the      United States should--       (1) urge the Russian Federation to ensure full protection      of freedoms for all religious communities without      distinction, whether registered and unregistered, and end the      harassment of unregistered religious groups by the security      apparatus and other government agencies;       (2) urge the Russian Federation to ensure that law      enforcement officials vigorously investigate acts of violence      against unregistered religious communities, as well as make      certain that authorities are not complicit in such attacks;       (3) continue to raise concerns with the Government of the      Russian Federation over violations of religious freedom,      including those against unregistered religious communities,      especially indigenous denominations not well known in the      United States;       (4) ensure that United States Embassy officials engage      local officials throughout the Russian Federation, especially      when violations of freedom of religion occur, and undertake      outreach activities to educate local officials about the      rights of unregistered religious communities;       (5) urge both the Personal Representative of the OSCE      Chair-in-Office on Combating Racism, Xenophobia and      Discrimination, also focusing on Intolerance and      Discrimination against Christians and Members of Other      Religions, and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on      Freedom of Religion or Belief to visit the Russian Federation      and raise with federal and local officials concerns about the      free practice of unregistered religious communities; and       (6) urge the Council of Europe and its member countries to      raise with Russian Federation officials issues relating to      freedom of religion, especially in light of the Russian      Federation's responsibilities as President of the Council in      2006.
