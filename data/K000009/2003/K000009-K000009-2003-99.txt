Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to thank the Committee on Rules. I want to thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Boehner) of the Committee on Education and the Workforce and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee), ranking member, for allowing us to move this amendment today, and I want to acknowledge the hard work of Keysha Brooks-Coley on my own staff who has worked so very hard on this amendment and others.  This past Friday the Department of Labor reported that unemployment again went up in our country to a level of 8.8 million citizens, of which at least 250,000 are unemployed in the State of Ohio, and the unemployment level is now somewhere around 6 percent of those that we are still counting.  Without question people need access to training and to transitional assistance, which this bill offers so much hope to those who are struggling out there, trying to find a good-paying job with good benefits. The amendment I have proposed would strengthen the technical assistance provisions of the underlying bill to allow the Department of Labor where a State does not do it to give help to localities to apply for the program and to administer the program.                              {time}  1415  It would also require that a best practices system be established at the Department of Labor, so if a county in New York wants to learn what a county in Illinois might have done, or vice versa, that that would be available.  The amendment would require the Department of Labor to establish a coordinated system so there is no duplication at all. For example, in the technical assistance, it would only be allowed to be provided when the State itself is not doing it.  So this amendment was two parts: to better help the localities to apply, and then best practices.  I would like to just say for the record, if I could, Mr. Chairman, that we did try to offer another amendment and it was not allowed in order in the Committee on Rules. But I do think it is important with the gentleman from Ohio (Chairman Boehner) and the ranking member, the gentleman from California (Mr. George Miller), here on the floor, to just state for the record that in a State like Ohio, which ranks at the bottom in terms of drawdowns of these funds, I really hope that as this bill is perfected, as it moves over to the other body and through conference, that some thought might be given to the accounting aspect of our funds, the Federal funds that are sent to the States, and to require quarterly reports, and also to differentiate between allocations to the State and actual expenditures by the State and the local counties.  Believe me, its impossible to get this information. We cannot even obtain it for a State like our own from the Department of Labor. We asked the General Accounting Office to become involved in this. Even they have not been able to obtain these numbers.  Frankly, I would like to strongly recommend to the committee that if dollars have not been spent by the States that there be a pass-through to the localities, so that our counties that are dealing with unemployed people and people needing training every day would have the flexibility to expend funds that, for whatever reason, seem to be getting lost or stored at the State capital level and never really getting down to those who need to establish contracts for trading with those who are unemployed.  Mr. Chairman, although this amendment does not deal with that, I would ask Members for strong consideration of the amendment that does require technical assistance to be given by the Department of Labor if the States are not doing it and also to establish this best-practices opportunity at the Department of Labor, so people can learn across our country, from one State to another, from one county to another, and strongly urge the committee to think about requiring strict accounting of these dollars, with quarterly reports and differentiating between expenditures and allocations, and then, if the State is not spending the money, allowing the locality to receive the pass-through of those funds.  I would ask for support of this amendment.
