Secondly, I thank the gentleman for his question. I happen to believe, I want the gentleman to know, that the rule you were involved with that the minority leader and I have discussed is a good rule. It's a good rule because if something is dropped in conference that nobody knows about it, whatever it may be, I'm not going to mention any specific projects, but we've talked about some during the course of the last 2 days, we will in the rule provide for 10 minutes on each side. So, essentially, what we're doing is expanding under those circumstances by a third the time available for debate on a conference report.  So it is a pretty substantial extension of time. I think to the extent, again, the gentleman was involved, it's an appropriate extension of time so that we do ensure what all want to ensure and that projects that do not justify inclusion in bills and this House or the Senate rejects them or wants to reconsider them, that we have that opportunity. So the debate will be included in the rules recommendation.
