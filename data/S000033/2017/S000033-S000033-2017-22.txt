  Madam President, tonight is chapter 1 of the Republican Party Koch brothers plan.  Tonight, the Republicans provide $1 trillion in tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country and to the largest corporations, while raising the deficit by over $1.4 trillion.  Part 2 of their plan--probably coming in a few months--will be to call for massive cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid in order to pay for their tax breaks to the rich. For those of us who don't want to cut these vitally important programs that the American people have paid for, this amendment establishes a 67-vote threshold to make those cuts.  If you don't want to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to give tax breaks to millionaires, support this amendment.
