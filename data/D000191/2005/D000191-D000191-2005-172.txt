Speaker, I was just actually watching a speech by the President. It was sort of the Grimm's Fairy Tales version of why Members of this House should vote for CAFTA, why Members of this House should vote to extend a failing trade policy to another five nations in Central America as a template for an even larger expansion of failed U.S. NAFTA free trade policies throughout the western hemisphere.  He talked about their subsistence farmers and how, if only the tariffs on very expensive U.S. agricultural machinery were removed, that additional 10 or 15 percent on the cost, how the subsistence farmers who average less than $1,000 a year will be buying $100,000, $500,000 pieces of farm equipment. They will just trot right down to the local bank, and I guess the bank will extend them a loan for a $500,000 piece of equipment they will never be able to pay for, and they will not be able to afford fuel to put this.  Now, that is the same kind of falsehood we heard about NAFTA, that this was going to be a boon for U.S. workers and manufactured goods because all the people of Mexico would take all their pesos, put them together, and they could afford to buy almost as much stuff as the people of New Jersey. In the case of CAFTA it is an even smaller economy, less capability.  He talked about how the factory workers there are just waiting in line to buy American goods. Of course $0.40 an hour, you are not going to be buying a lot of American goods or probably not any. But they are working for a lot less than American production workers.  So what is going to happen with CAFTA? The same thing that happened with NAFTA. You are going to see U.S. capital flood south into Central America so that they can produce things that were once made here, textiles and other things in the case of Central America and in all probability. In the case of NAFTA, it was automobiles, auto parts, it was a whole flood of things, washing machines, driers, other appliances. It all went to Mexico. They predicted that NAFTA, just like with CAFTA, they said, oh, CAFTA is going to be great for the American economy. It will put people to work, create jobs. They said the same thing about NAFTA. It was going to create a million jobs. Instead it lost a million jobs.  Now, what they do is really tricky when they talk about CAFTA. They talk about how they have studied it and studied it, and they see an increase in exports to Central America.  What they do not say is the President's own trade commission sees a much bigger increase in imports from Central America. That means a net deficit. That means we are selling less there than we are buying back. It means we are going to lose more jobs. It is the same condition we are in with the rest of the world.  The United States of America is borrowing $2 billion a day to finance the purchase of overseas goods, goods that were once made here by people who earned a decent living.  This is not a sustainable model. And to extend it to Central America is not going to begin to put America on a better path to bringing jobs home to the United States, bringing wages back up for our production workers, seeing that they continue to have benefits.  American workers should not be asked to compete with workers who earn less than a $1 an hour in Central America. But that is what will happen if this is passed.  Time and time again, the experts, the administrations, including the Democratic administration, the Clinton administration, which was a total disaster on trade, as bad as Bush and maybe worse, they come to this Congress and they say if only, if only you will open up our borders, it will bring great wealth to the American people, prosperity and jobs. And what it has brought is the loss of 3 million manufacturing jobs, a deficit of $2 billion a day in trade, and driven down wages in countless industries across this country where all the boss has to say is, you will not take a pay cut? Not far to the Mexican border. That is where your plant is going. And they have done that again and again and again. So we should not extend this disaster one more time. And when all the apologists stand up and talk about all the wealth it is going to create, all the jobs and all the exports, remember, they said exactly the same thing about the NAFTA. They said exactly the same thing about China MFN and the WTO, and they were wrong, and there is no reason why they are not going to be wrong again, because they know that what they are saying is not true. It is just the way they have got to sell the package here to benefit a few industries to the disadvantage of the rest of the people in this country.  It is time for a trade policy that makes sense for all the people of America, not just a treasured few who own the stock and the factories of the multinational corporations that have been profiting from our failures.                          ____________________
