President, let me say to my friend Senator Sarbanes, there is no stronger supporter of our State revolving funds than I am, as chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. But I wish to say this is a $2.9 billion tax increase. There are ways of doing it by eliminating some unnecessary programs.  Regarding the portion also affecting the Corps of Engineers, I understand they are underfunded at this time and we are working right now in our committee to see what we can do to come up with some money by striking some of the less important, less necessary programs.  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Sarbanes amendment.
