He said: Why don't we stay on the small business bill? It is very important.  Today, we couldn't work out an agreement when we accepted the three amendments which the Republicans said they wanted to offer. We said: Fine, you may offer those three, we will offer three, and let the Senate decide.  Now the Senate minority leader, the Republican leader, comes to the floor and objects again. He can't have it both ways. He can't complain that we are killing time here on the floor instead of taking up small business and then, when we return to it, object to finishing the bill.  Right now, if I am not mistaken, we are facing a cloture vote. That will happen automatically in the morning, if I am not mistaken, on this bill, and I am hoping we can either get a unanimous consent agreement by then or some agreement by some Republicans to stand up for small business.
