Mr. Speaker, last week the Washington Times reported that, and I quote, ``Vice President Al Gore, warning that overpopulation fosters global warming, yesterday suggested expanding abortion programs in developing countries to help reduce the environmental threat.''  Mr. Speaker, it is absolutely scandalous and inhumane that the Vice President of the United States is aggressively touting violence against babies to mitigate global warming. The Vice President is blaming the babies of the poor for the consumption excesses of the rich and powerful. How dare he blame the kids.  In a meeting with the weather forecasters, Al Gore gleefully pointed to the administration's repeal of the Mexico City policy, the Hyde amendment for the developing world, as a step towards population control.  Make no mistake about it, President Clinton's action has permitted hundreds of millions of dollars, U.S. tax dollars, to flow to the abortion industry overseas. The Vice President is blaming the problem of global warming on children and suggesting that somehow the world will be a much cleaner place if these innocent children are killed by abortion.  Mr. Speaker, I insert the following article into the Record.               [From the Washington Times, Oct. 3, 1997]        Gore's Cure for Global Warming Jolts Pro-Life Activists                            (By Paul Bedard)       Pro-life activists yesterday expressed alarm that Vice      President Al Gore's suggestion to curb global warming by      slashing population growth could lead to more abortions in      Third World countries.       ``What he would do is push violence against babies to      advance a theory to cure greenhouse gas problems,'' said Rep.      Christopher H. Smith, New Jersey Republican. ``You don't use      violence to get a cleaner atmosphere.''       ``Al Gore should not try to impose the immortality of      abortion on developing nations,'' said Carol Long, director      of the National Right to Life Political Action Committee.       Mr. Smith charged that the White House was being      ``elitist'' in its effort to curb birth rates by targeting      mostly poor, nonwhite populations in Africa, Asia and South      America.       ``It's elitist because it blames the poor and vulnerable      for the problems of the rich and powerful,'' said Mr. Smith,      chairman of the House International Relations human rights      subcommittee. ``It's very arrogant to persecute anyone to      push a theory.''       Mr. Gore this week told a White House global warming      conference that overpopulation was the top proponent of      climate change and, thus, should be a major focus for      Government policy. He heralded President Clinton's early 1993      decision to reverse GOP policies blocking U.S. funding of      family-planning groups that perform abortions abroad.       Mr. Gore suggested that the industrialized nations have      ``stabilized'' their populations through a three-point      program of birth control, abortion and a reduction in child      mortality rates, but world populations would grow if      developing nations aren't targeted now.       He suggested that pushing his three initiatives could cut 2      billion to 5 billion people from the projected 2050 world      population of 14 billion.       ``We're actually beginning to experience some good news      around the world with the beginnings of a stabilization in      world population. But the momentum in the demographic system      is such that we're inevitably going to go to 8 or 9 billion.      The question is whether these changes will keep us from going      to 10, 12, 14 billion,'' Mr. Gore said.       Mr. Gore has long promoted a ``Global Marshall Plan'' that      promotes birth control and family planning, but his comments      at a White House summit of some 100 TV weathermen this week      rattled some pro-life advocates.       ``This will be the wake-up call,'' Mr. Smith said.       The National Right to Life Committee also took notice of      Mr. Gore's comments and began alerting members, as did the      House Pro-Life Caucus.       And Gary Bauer, head of the Family Research Council, said,      ``The problem with global warming isn't that there are too      many people or too many children. That's our greatest      asset.''       Under the Gore plan, developing nations need three programs      to slow population: one to cut child mortality rates so that      families don't need to produce numerous children with the      expectation that some will die young, birth control and moves      to boost women politically and socially.       ``When those three conditions are established, those      countries make that change,     and their population begins to stabilize,'' he said.       Since 1992, the year he was chosen to be President      Clinton's running mate on the Democratic ticket challenging      President Bush, he has promoted population control as a means      to combat global warming--even though the scientific      community remains divided about the seriousness of the global      warming threat.       That year, for example, he authored the popular book      ``Earth in the Balance.''       Chapter 15 of the book details elements of a ``Global      Marshall Plan'' that promotes education, birth control and      reductions in child mortality rates.       ``No goal is more crucial to healing the global environment      than stabilizing human population,'' he wrote.                                  ____              [From the Washington Times, October 2, 1997]    Third World Birth Control Tops Gore's List of `Greenhouse' Cures                            (By Paul Bedard)       Vice President Al Gore, warning that overpopulation fosters      global warming, yesterday suggested expanding abortion      programs in developing countries to help reduce the      environmental threat.       Noting that Third World nations are producing too many      children too fast--in addition to too much pollution--Mr.      Gore said it is time to ignore the controversy over family      planning and cut out-of-control population growth.                    warming blamed on overpopulation       While hosting about 100 TV weathermen at a White House      global-warming conference, Mr. Gore was asked how to reduce      population surges in developing countries that experts say      will lead to a doubling of Earth's current 5.5 billion      population within 40 years.       After highlighting President Clinton's early decision to      kill the Bush administration's so-called ``Mexico City      policy'' that prohibited U.S. funding of overseas birth-     control programs that include abortion, Mr. Gore focused on      family planning and child mortality rates.       ``This doesn't have to be as controversial as some people      make it out to be,'' Mr. Gore said, offering three solutions      to overpopulation.       First, he said that cutting child mortality rates will      encourage families in developing countries not to have so      many children.       ``They count on the fact that at least some of their      children will survive into adulthood and take care of them      when they're old. If you have a very high child mortality      rate, and a high percentage of the children die in infancy or      in childbirth, then you've got to have a lot of children in      order to guarantee stability and--I mean, you know, in your      old age,'' he explained.       The second factor is ``availability of birth control      information and culturally appropriate and acceptable      techniques. And that's the controversial part,'' he said.       ``The third factor is the empowerment of women, socially,      politically, and in the context of the family, to participate      in the decisions about childbearing,'' said Mr. Gore, who is      pro-choice.       The issue was the first of several Mr. Gore and Mr. Clinton      touched on as they tried to persuade the weathermen to warn      viewers of the threat of global warming.       White House spokesman Michael McCurry explained the      conference goal: ``Maybe they can make the subject of global      warming a little more lively for their audiences.''       He added that the weathermen ``appreciated being treated as      something other than airheads.''       Mr. Gore, using an easel and four different colored      markers, tutored the forecasters on the issue, and suggested      that changing weather patterns are due to global warming.       At one point he seemed to suggest that global warming was      linked to weather-related deaths, plane crashes and unusual      out-breaks of malaria, but he later said the cause wasn't      clear.       Several of the forecasters said they believe that weather      patterns have changed, possibly because of the warming of the      earth due to overpopulation and pollution.       But most weren't ready to make the link as quickly as the      vice president was.       Doug Hill, weatherman for WUSA-TV (Channel 9) in      Washington, said, ``I recognize that we are probably in the      threshold of having a problem'' with global warming.       But he said that he was not ready to make ``the giant      leap'' that changing weather conditions are due to human-     generated global warming rather than the product of weather      cycles.       ``I didn't see [the conference] as sounding alarm. I see it      as raising awareness'' to the issue, he said.       While Mr. Clinton said he believed the vice president's      claim that global warming from pollution and ``greenhouse''      gases exists, he was more anecdotal in explaining the      effects.       ``You'd be amazed how many people just sort of from their      anecdotal, personal experiences have this sense that there is      more instability in the climate than there used to be,''      leaving the scientific language for Mr. Gore, author of a      best-selling book on the environment.       The administration is preparing to attend a worldwide      global-warming conference in Japan to set a goal for the      reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, but Mr. Gore refused      to reveal the U.S. bargaining position.       And while the goal of the conference was to alert the      nation that environmental changes could lead to hotter      temperatures and flooding due to snow and ice melts in the      North and South poles, he offered few initiatives Americans      could undertake to reduce the threat.       Mr. Gore also said it would be ``crazy'' to ignore global      warming just because there isn't universal agreement in the      scientific community about its existence.       He compared naysayers to tobacco industry executives who      claimed for years that cigarettes weren't harmful--even after      the 1964 surgeon general's report linking tobacco to lung      cancer.       ``I can't imagine that we would allow this to happen,'' he      said.                          ____________________
