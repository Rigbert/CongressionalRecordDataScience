It is something we both support, but it clearly was an effort to engage Republican Senators in changing the bill in a positive way. The second amendment adopted yesterday was by Senator Isakson of Georgia relative to a tax credit for home purchases, and I believe the cost of that is $19 billion. Those two amendments account for $89 billion out of the $900 billion in the bill. So about 10 percent of the bill comes from Republican amendments.  To suggest that we are not open to amendments from the Republican side, I would say to my colleague, I think we are trying. We could do more and we want to do more, but we don't want to lose what we hope President Obama is asking for here--something that will have a substantial and dramatic impact on the economy.
