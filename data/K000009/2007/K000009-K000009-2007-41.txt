You voted against NAFTA on this floor. You were a leader on your side of the aisle. That vote was proven to be right.  What this is going to do, this is going to ``NAFTAtize'' the patent system and allow China to infringe on more of our inventions. We should not permit this to happen. We should be allowed to fully debate this for the people of this country.  Two-thirds of the value of companies, up to 80 percent of our industrial companies value, relate to their patents, and we should be given more respect. We should give our constituents more respect than compressing this debate into such a narrow time slot.
