Speaker, I would like to note the passing of one of my predecessors in representing the Fifth Congressional District of Maryland--Richard E. Lankford--who passed away at the age of 89 at his Easton home on September 22.  Born in Wilmington, Delaware, on July 22, 1914, Dick Lankford was raised on St. Paul Street in Baltimore's Guilford neighborhood. He earned a political science degree from the University of Virginia in 1937 and then received his law degree from the University of Maryland in 1940.  After being admitted to the Maryland Bar that same year, Dick practiced law in Annapolis, where later in life he worked as a tobacco and cattle farmer. However, his legal career was interrupted by World War Two, during which he served in the Navy as an intelligence officer in Europe.  After the war, Dick worked on the campaign of Governor William Preston Lane, Jr., and then in 1948 he entered public life himself when he was appointed to fill a vacancy in the Maryland House of Delegates. He won the election to retain that seat in 1950, and four years later he won election to this House of Representatives, defeating the incumbent, Republican Frank Small, Jr. Congressman Lankford was re-elected four times to the House of Representatives, serving 10 years in Congress, before deciding to retire in 1964.  Mr. Speaker, I vividly recall Congressman Lankford as my own Congressman when I was still completing my undergraduate studies at the University of Maryland in the early 60s. The old Fifth Congressional District, which I have been privileged to serve since 1981, then stretched all the way from South Baltimore to suburban Washington, and included industrial workers in the Curtis Bay area, tobacco farmers in Calvert County, Federal government employees in Prince George's County, and watermen in Charles County. It's a testament to Dick Lankford's ability that he successfully served constituents from such varied backgrounds and livelihoods.  In Congress, Dick Lankford worked hard to secure pay raises and to improve working conditions for Federal employees. He also was an early advocate for cleaning up Maryland's rivers and the Chesapeake Bay, as well as mass transit in the Baltimore-Washington areas. He also served with distinction on the Armed Services Committee.  I want to extend my sincere condolences to Dick's wife, Edna, as well as his daughter, Sallie, of Massachusetts, and son, Richard Jr., of Millington.  Dick Lankford was proud of his service in this House. He brought to his constituency and to our State energy and a commitment to his country that served all of them well. Today, we honor his service to the State of Maryland and these United States, and we affirm that it indeed will be remembered for many years to come.                          ____________________
