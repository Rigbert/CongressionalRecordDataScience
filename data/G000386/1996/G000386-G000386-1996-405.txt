 Section 322 of the bill amends section 1222 of the 1985 farm bill to say that ``No person shall be adversely affected because of having taken an action based on a previous certified wetland delineation by the Secretary. The delineation shall not be subject to a subsequent wetland certification or delineation by the Secretary, unless requested by the person * * *. ''  My concern is that this could read to allow the Department to change delineations that have not yet been certified. I don't argue with this, per se. I am sure there is a need for granting NRCS this authority in some specific situations.  But again, I do not want a repeat of this situation in Iowa in 1994 and 1995. Specifically, I do not want the NRCS to use this language to conduct a massive review of wetland delineations. This will just cause further uncertainty and confusion in the farm community. It can only lead to ill will between our farmers and the NRCS and should be avoided at all cost.  Under the able leadership of Chairman Lugar, we have made some very positive changes in the 1996 farm bill that will lead to a more cooperative relationship between farmers and the NRCS. I hope this progress will not be undermined by the provision I mentioned.
