Mr. Speaker, I am surprised to see my Republican colleagues on the floor today congratulating Speaker Newt Gingrich for doing something he should have done months ago, paying $300,000 for lying to Congress.  Speaker Gingrich admitted to bringing discredit on the House of Representatives. He has admitted to lying to this House.
