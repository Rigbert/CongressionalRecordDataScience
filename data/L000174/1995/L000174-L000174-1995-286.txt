President, although the committee did not designate specific earmarks for microenterprise poverty programs, I would point out that the report accompanying the bill includes language reaffirming the committee's strong support for the program's efforts to encourage micro and small business as a means to help the truly poor transition out of poverty.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the ranking member is correct. The committee--on a bipartisan basis--agrees that these programs promote sustainable, market-base development at relatively little cost and deserve our support.
