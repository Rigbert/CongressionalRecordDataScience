4. We are the only global superpower, and in order to avoid stimulating the creation of a hostile coalition of other nations, the United States should, and can afford to, forego unilateralist actions, except where our vital national interests are involved.  The U.S. should pay international debt.  The U.S. must continue to respect and honor international commitments and not abdicate our global role leadership.  Finally, the U.S. must avoid unilateral economic and trade sanctions. Unilateral sanctions simply don't work as a foreign policy tool. They put American businesses, workers, and farmers at a huge competitive disadvantage. The U.S. needs to take a harder look at alternatives, such as multilateral pressure and more effective U.S. diplomacy.  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Georgia.
