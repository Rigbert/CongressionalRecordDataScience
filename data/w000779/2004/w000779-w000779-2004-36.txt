 If ever there were a cause that ought to bring the Senate together, fighting childhood obesity is exactly the kind of thing where we ought to be teaming up. I thank my colleague for his excellent statement and for the chance to work with him.  The majority leader and I believe our legislation will help launch a national mobilization to reduce and prevent the epidemic of childhood obesity and help our kids grow up healthy in America. Today, kids are eating greater quantities of less healthy foods. They are exercising less and less.  Childhood obesity has doubled during the past 30 years. In my home State, it is far and away one of our most serious emerging health problems. Ten percent of the 8th graders and 7 percent of the 11th graders in my State are overweight. So, in my view, what we have is nothing short of an epidemic of kids who are not as healthy as they could be and they need to be and not as healthy as children were in previous generations. These kids today have a host of health problems that promise to worsen if nothing is done to change them.  I was particularly pleased that the majority leader highlighted some of the concerns we want to tackle. The situation with respect to type II diabetes is completely unacceptable. This is an illness that used to be virtually unheard of in children. Yet the increase in this disease is literally on a parallel with the documented track of an increase in childhood obesity. One-quarter of children 5 to 10 years of age show early warning signs for health problems such as elevated cholesterol and high blood pressure. Doctors at the Oregon Health Sciences University Obesity Clinic say that referrals of youngsters as young as 6 are becoming virtually routine.  We are not going to see this change happen by osmosis. It is going to come about because adults working with parents, schools, and communities provide some real leadership, and that is what this bipartisan legislation seeks to do. We recognize in this bill that there is a fair amount of good work going on in our communities already, and we recognize this is an issue that needs to be addressed not from Washington, DC, with a one-size-fits-all approach, but it needs to be addressed in our schools and in our communities.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  What we seek to do is to encourage this kind of bottom-up approach, where schools and communities across the country, relying on leaders in their own hometowns, consulting with experts here from the Congress, will get out state-of-the-art information with respect to making sure we are using all the tools that are out there to fight obesity. We are going to be consulting and coordinating this effort with the President's Council on Physical Fitness so that both sides of the equation, nutrition and exercise, are addressed in the fight against childhood obesity.  We have also concluded it is absolutely critical to use state-of-the-art technology to get out this information. We have proposed a Web site be created to link schools to community groups and leaders who are already working to help kids stay healthy. With a few clicks of the ``enter'' button, it will be possible for kids in Des Moines to find out what the best approaches are for kids, say, in the rural West.  We believe using this kind of technology is going to allow us to use scarce resources, at a time when we are all concerned about the deficit, to better meet the health needs of children in our communities. Whether it is enlisting local organic farmers to make their produce available to schools or helping our kids become more physically active, what we propose in this bipartisan legislation is a wide variety of options for schools and communities to work together.  I am very pleased that an important feature of the legislation, as noted by the majority leader, is the foundation that would allow us to continue the work of our Congressional Council, which would end once the foundation is established.  Finally, it seems to me the point of this legislation is to target the area where we can make the most difference and that is our schools. Schools, of course, are where the children are. It is where they spend a lot of time. It is a place where they eat, and very often several meals a day. If children can learn in school how to balance their choices, wherever they go and whenever they are confronted with a variety of food options, they can make better choices for themselves.  I see the distinguished chair of the Armed Services Committee is back on the floor. He has an extensive schedule, I know. I don't want to hold this up. I want to wrap this up by saying to the majority leader how much I have enjoyed working with him. We have long felt that health care is one of the issues that can bring the Senate together. If ever there was a health cause that requires what I think is appropriately called a national mobilization in our schools and our communities, fighting childhood obesity is it.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2551       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Childhood Obesity Reduction      Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) According to the Centers for Disease Control and      Prevention, obesity may soon overtake tobacco as the leading      preventable cause of death.       (2) In 1999, 13 percent of children aged 6 to 11 years and      14 percent of adolescents aged 12 to 19 years in the United      States were overweight. This prevalence has nearly tripled      for adolescents in the past 2 decades.       (3) Risk factors for heart disease, such as high      cholesterol and high blood pressure, occur with increased      frequency in overweight children and adolescents compared to      children with a healthy weight.       (4) Type 2 diabetes, previously considered an adult      disease, has increased dramatically in children and      adolescents. Overweight and obesity are closely linked to      type 2 diabetes.       (5) Obesity in children and adolescents is generally caused      by a lack of physical activity, unhealthy eating patterns, or      a combination of the 2, with genetics and lifestyle both      playing important roles in determining a child's weight.       (6) Overweight adolescents have a 70 percent chance of      becoming overweight or obese adults.       (7) The 2001 report ``The Surgeon General's Call to Action      to Prevent and Decrease Overweight and Obesity'' suggested      that obesity and its complications were already costing the      United States $117,000,000,000 annually.       (8) Substantial evidence shows that public health risks can      be reduced through increased public awareness and community      involvement.       (9) Congress needs to challenge students, teachers, school      administrators, and local communities to voluntarily      participate in the development and implementation of      activities to successfully reduce and prevent childhood      obesity.
