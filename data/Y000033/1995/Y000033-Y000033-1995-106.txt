Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, the difference is the councils in many cases have already acted. With the language that is in the bill now, it is really an awakening call for the councils. We will be revisiting this if they do not.  Mr. Chairman, I believe that they do see the importance of this and we do have the backing of the councils. But we have to allow the councils the discretion or we end up being the total managers of the fisheries and that would be a disaster for the fisheries.  The fisheries are very competitive and very monetarily important for certain interest groups and we do not want this Congress to be involved, but should allow the councils to be the ones with the discretion.  Mr. Chairman, I do urge the defeat of the amendment.
