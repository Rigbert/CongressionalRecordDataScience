Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the motion to be offered by my good friend and colleague on the Committee on Ways and Means, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett), the motion to recommit. It simply says that section 527 political organizations will not get the benefit of the telephone excise tax repeal unless they disclose their donors. It is that simple.  The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett) had tried to offer this amendment in the Committee on Ways and Means twice, once today and once during the debate on the Taxpayers' Bill of Rights. Both times, the Republicans have voted it down and blocked it from coming to the floor.  Every person in America realized the importance and necessity of fixing our system of financing elections. The Doggett amendment is an attempt, but an important attempt, a necessary attempt, to bring about campaign finance reform. It will close another loophole in campaign finance disclosure laws. It will clean up the mess created by section 527 political organizations. These organizations can take unlimited money from almost any source, even foreign money, and make expenditures without any disclosure to anyone. It is a sham, it is a shame, and it is a disgrace. The American people deserve better.  The Doggett amendment only requires simple open disclosure by these organizations, these 527 organizations. The American people have a right to know. They have a right to know who is funding political campaigns in our country. They have a right to know who is behind the attack ads. The American people have a right to a free and fair election process.  There is already too much money in the political process. There is no room for secrecy too. We need to fix the mess. I urge my colleagues to support the motion to recommit.
