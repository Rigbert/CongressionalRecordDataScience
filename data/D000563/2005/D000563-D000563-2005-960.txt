Is it my understanding the Senator from Nevada came to the floor and gave the Republican leader his assurance that these amendments would be considered in a timely fashion and that we would agree that this bill, the Department of Defense authorization bill, would be passed from the Senate this week, no later than Thursday evening, in plenty of time so that it will be there for the administration and for the conference committee to consider, so there would be no delay, so we could take up in a timely fashion amendments to help the totally disabled veterans, amendments to help the widows and orphans of those who have fallen in combat, amendments to help the Guard and Reserve when they are activated so their families can stay together? Did the Senator from Nevada give that assurance to the Republican leader, Senator Frist, that we are not trying to delay this unreasonably but want to move it through quickly, consider these amendments in a timely fashion, vote up or down and move to final passage this week?
