 President, I come to the floor of the Senate because I was very concerned in reading this morning's newspaper about criticism of the administration in the Middle East peace process. As a strong supporter of Israel and its security, I want to take this opportunity to commend President Clinton and Secretary Albright for their current effort to preserve the peace process.  About a month ago, 81 Senators sent a letter to the President of the United States in which they expressed concern about the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. They, in effect, were concerned about a proposal for land redeployment going public, about security cooperation, and final status talks.  I was not one of those 81 Senators. In fact, a few days later, I sent a letter of my own expressing my support for the current course. In that letter, I mentioned that I have great faith in what the administration is doing, and I still believe that.  I ask unanimous consent that my letter be printed in the Record at this time.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                    Washington, DC, April 9, 1998.     The President,     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: At a time of considerable urgency in      the Middle East peace process, I write to express my support      for your ongoing efforts to help achieve a diplomatic      resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict. The success of these      efforts is crucial to the fulfillment of the United States'      commitments to ensure Israel's security, to enhance regional      stability, and to protect U.S. strategic interests in the      Middle East.       Progress on the Israeli-Palestinian track is clearly the      most urgent need. The stalemate that has defined these talks      for the past year poses great dangers for all sides. Your      approach to moving this process forward has included a      healthy combination of urging the parties to uphold their      commitments, discouraging unilateral acts that undermine      confidence, facilitating ongoing contacts and negotiations,      helping each side understand the other's needs, and      presenting ideas intended to help bridge gaps between the      parties.       As you and Secretary of State Albright have repeatedly      stressed, an all-out Palestinian effort to combat terrorism,      and the full commitment of both sides to Israeli-Palestinian      security cooperation, are absolutely essential for further      progress to occur. Without these, the region could easily      descend into violence, ending the chances for a peace      settlement in the foreseeable future.       In addition, you have consistently urged the parties to      approach their negotiations with a sense of realism and      restraint, while understanding the needs of the other side,      and avoiding unilateral steps that call into question the      parties' commitment to achieving a settlement.       While you understand that U.S. diplomacy may be essential      to bridge some of the gaps between the two sides, you have      remained keenly aware that only the parties themselves can      make the difficult, but necessary, decisions required to move      toward a final agreement. We cannot do this for them.       America's longstanding and unshakeable commitment to      Israel's security, which you have faithfully upheld, is fully      consistent with your efforts to move the peace process toward      a successful outcome. Without a peaceful permanent resolution      to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Israel's security--which      is undoubtedly a vital U.S. interest--can never be      guaranteed.       I have great faith in your Administration's efforts to move      the peace process forward without undue micromanagement from      Congress. I believe that you, Secretary Albright, Special      Middle East Coordinator Dennis Ross, and Assistant Secretary      of State for Near Eastern Affairs Martin Indyk have great      ability and credibility in this effort. As you continue to      pursue this vital mission, you will continue to have my      support.           Sincerely,                                                 Dianne Feinstein,                                                     U.S. Senator.
