 I have never said we have changed our opinion. That has been our opinion expressed by our President, expressed by me and expressed by others, that we desire to work in a bipartisan mode. But the gentleman surely understands that there were, I can tell you, people on your side of the aisle who indicated to me that they wanted to vote for a number of the pieces of legislation that dealt with the stimulus; but the party pressure was so great to vote ``no'' that they didn't feel comfortable doing it. I may in private give you those names so you can check on the veracity of my representation.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. Well, I appreciate the gentleman because when I was sitting here on the floor, and I saw 17 of your Members join with everyone voting ``no,'' the bipartisan support, that there was a better way, that there was an opportunity. That kind of goes back to the whole debate about amendments. I always thought, coming to this floor, that maybe the power of the idea should win, and no one should be afraid of an idea or an amendment, that we would actually be better. But I think the opportunity to spend time with the gentleman--and I appreciate it if some Members on your side thought differently in the past, that we can get the message out. I appreciate the work that you have done.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________
