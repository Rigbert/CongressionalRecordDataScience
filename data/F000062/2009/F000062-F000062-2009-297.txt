 President, I rise on behalf of myself and Senator Boxer to introduce legislation to improve the administration of Chappie-Shasta Off-Highway Vehicle area by reducing unnecessary bureaucracy and aiding in proper enjoyment of these Federal lands.  This bill is simple. It interchanges the administrative jurisdiction of certain Federal lands between the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management in Shasta-Trinity National Forest in California.  This legislation consolidates BLM's jurisdiction and management of the Off-Highway-Vehicle area while, in exchange, the Forest Service benefits by receiving small tracts of wilderness areas that are currently managed by the BLM but are contiguous to Forest Service land.  This exchange only affects land already controlled by the Federal government and will not change the designation of these lands. Furthermore, it will be beneficial to the local community which has supported this jurisdictional change.  These Federal lands, near Redding, California, have long been used by off-highway-vehicle enthusiasts. However, overlapped management of these areas by both the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management has caused unnecessary burden to these recreational opportunities.  It means users need two permits, often at substantial and unnecessary cost. Likewise, the overlapping management has resulted in different opening dates for the same area of land, frustrating the local off-highway-vehicle community and the thousands of tourists who travel there every year.  This jurisdictional exchange will reduce bureaucracy to ease recreational access as well as provide for better Federal management of these areas.  The bill was developed in a collaborative manner, with input and agreement at the local level by the Forest Service and BLM, in conjunction with the local off-highway-vehicle community. The bill is also supported by the local community and the County Board of Supervisors.  This effort represents a sensible, common sense approach to problem solving and better government.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1328       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
