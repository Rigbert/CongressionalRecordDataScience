Chairman, again I want to thank the gentlewoman for her national leadership on this issue, and to say as we move towards conference, believe me, I will take these amendments into consideration and see if there is not some way that we can get additional momentum within the Department. There is absolutely no reason that a farmer against whom injury has been found should have to go bankrupt simply because the agency has not delivered the assistance in a timely manner and the award in a timely manner.  So I think the gentlewoman has some excellent suggestions here. I am sure the farmers who are listening and those who are facing this litigation are very grateful for her leadership.  I was listening to our former colleague, Congressman Kweisi Mufume, yesterday at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Persons discuss the agricultural issue, and I do not know that I have ever heard that from the President of the NAACP before, but it is great to hear. It is a priority for them as well.  We look forward to working for the gentlewoman. I thank her for her leadership on behalf of civil rights for farmers, regardless of color or region. I would say to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters), we appreciate her great, great heart and her sense of justice.
