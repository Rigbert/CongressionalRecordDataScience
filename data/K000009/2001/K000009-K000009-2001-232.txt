Speaker, I rise today to recognize the career of service of Nancy Atkins from Toledo, Ohio. Nancy is retiring on May 1, 2001 after twenty years at the helm of Toledo Metropolitan Mission (TMM), a faith-based agency dedicated to uplifting the underserved. Concurrently, she led the metro Toledo Churches United (MeTCU) for the past fifteen of those years. The last ten years also found her leading these organizations' umbrella agency, Toledo Ecumenical Area Ministries.  Thomas Paine said, ``I believe that religious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our fellow creatures happy.'' This sentiment has been the guiding principle behind these organizations' development under Nancy's ever-present leadership. Nancy's leadership positioned TMM as the strongest advocate for the weakest among us, influencing or developing programs for poor people, children, struggling women, homeless people, and older people. TMM has weighed in heavily on issues affecting these disaffected groups of people, from housing to health care to the impact of welfare reform. TMM and MeTCU are respected as voices of true compassion, never forgetting Christ's admonition, ``Whatever you do to the least of my brethren, that you do unto me.'' Nancy has empowered TMM to lead the charge for the rights of those most vulnerable and yet ignored. Her guidance saw TMM develop more than a dozen programs to address those rights, forged coalitions of agencies committed to those rights, and nurtured in many the growth of self-advocacy for those rights.  A member of more than fifteen community, social justice, and inter-religious organizations, Nancy Atkins has galvanized the role of TMM in bringing the rights of all to the table and ensuring that no one is left out of the discussion. She has fostered a spirit of cooperation while working together toward common goals and practical solutions. Truly, her contribution to the success of TMM and its mission cannot be underestimated.  Mindful of Dr. Martin Luther King's creed that ``Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere'' Nancy Atkins' leadership these past two decades has been the embodiment of social justice. If the measure of a person is her legacy, then Nancy Atkins' legacy thus far is beyond measure. Her daily presence at TMM will be sorely missed, but her imprimatur is there, it will not fade. She will remain a vibrant contributor to its mission for she will always be a part of our community. We wish her well in retirement, and hope she is able to spend time doing all those things she most enjoys.                          ____________________
