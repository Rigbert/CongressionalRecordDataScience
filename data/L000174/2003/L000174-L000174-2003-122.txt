President, I will yield 3 minutes to the distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts in just a moment.  I would hope, after this debate, we might start debating judicial nominees based on the facts and not on some of the innuendoes we have heard.  Mr. President, before I yield, I understand that again we are reserving the last 5 minutes for the distinguished senior Senator from Mississippi; is that correct?
