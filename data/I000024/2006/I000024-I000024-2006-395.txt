President, it is my understanding--we talked about this before the Senator came in--that we will have two amendments that we will be talking about: the Salazar amendment and the Inhofe amendment. They will be side by side. There will be a vote at 4:15. That vote will take place on my amendment first and then on the Salazar amendment, is my understanding.
