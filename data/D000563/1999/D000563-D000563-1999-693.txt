President, I can recall this concept when it was first suggested by President Reagan. It was a concept that was alluring. The notion that we could somehow put a protective umbrella of defense over the United States against nuclear missiles would certainly be an effort that would allay the fears of many that a missile might be launched from some nation like Russia. This idea of a strategic defense initiative, Star Wars, or whatever you might characterize it as, has always had a certain appeal to me and I am sure to anyone who hears it. I have been skeptical from the start as to whether or not this was feasible. Now I think there are more fundamental policies that should be addressed.  First, let us take a look at the history of the early part of the century.  After World War I, the French--determined never to let the Germans invade their country again--set up a series of ``impregnable'' fortifications along their border from Switzerland to Belgium called the Maginot Line. When Hitler decided to invade France he passed north of the Maginot Line via Belgium, swept behind the line, and captured it from behind. France was totally defeated in 6 weeks.  The national missile defense plan is our Maginot Line. It would give us a false sense of security and be completely ineffective in countering threats that simply go around it--like the terrorist with chemical, biological or nuclear weapons in his suitcase. It could be totally overwhelmed by intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) held by Russia, and its existence would encourage nuclear countries to defeat it with devastating force. The star wars Strategic Defense Initiative in the 1980's faced these same problems. The current plan is ``star wars lite,'' a shrunken relic of the cold war.                            the rogue states  No one is underestimating the capacity for so-called rogue nations to act in ways that seem irrational to us. However, in deciding that we must spend billions of dollars to build a missile defense system to protect ourselves against these third-rate powers, we are making one of two assumptions. Either we are tacitly admitting that we would not respond to an attack by one of them against us with overwhelming force--whether nuclear or conventional--or else we are assuming that these leaders are so crazy that they would risk the destruction of their nations and the loss of their own power or lives for one shot at the United States.  The leaders of the rogue nations, like Iraq and North Korea, may be isolated and seem irrational to us, but survival, not suicide, has been their overarching goal. It is much more likely that terrorists would do these nations' dirty work for them in a way that is difficult to link to a particular nation, to avoid a retaliatory strike. National missile defense would not help against terrorist attacks, which are far more likely to be delivered by truck than by missile.  The danger of missile attacks from rogue nations is much more acute against our military forces in the Persian Gulf and Asia than against U.S. cities.  During the gulf war we made it quite clear that if Saddam Hussein used his weapons of mass destruction against our forces, he would suffer an overwhelming response. He did not use those weapons. We have made it clear to the whole world that we will respond to any use of weapons of mass destruction against us, while leaving the type of weapon, nuclear or convention, ambiguous.  Our massive arsenal should be as capable of deterring a rogue nation as it was to deter the Soviet Union for 50 years. Are thousands of weapons now ineffective against one or two or three or four or five missiles in North Korea or some other country?  Nonetheless, the enormous cost in lives of even one missile strike against one U.S. city, no matter how unlikely, could lead us to decide to deploy a national missile defense system at some point in the future--if that would mean that our country would be more secure. That is why Congress has consistently supported research into missile defense technology for theater and national applications. We should continue to research with deliberate speed and reasonable funding, but we must not make the decision to deploy prematurely. We must not make the leap which this resolution would lead us to.                       arms control implications  Deciding to deploy a missile defense system without getting Russian agreement to changes in the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty not only would in effect abrogate that treaty, it would also be the end of the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START) process that is the basis for the strategic stability between the United States and Russia. Strategic stability means that neither side is willing to engage in a first strike against the other.  If a missile defense system is deployed without regard to its effect on strategic stability with Russia, our own security will be imperiled. The United States and Russia still have thousands of nuclear warheads poised to launch at each other with just a few minutes between targeting and launch. If arms control breaks down because of our deployment of a missile defense system, we would be encouraging nuclear countries to use multi-warhead ICBMs to defeat it. It would seem a fairly irrational decision on our part to trade away a strategic balance that has kept the peace for 50 years in order to protect us against a hypothetical threat. The threat of 6,000 Russian and some 400 Chinese missiles is not hypothetical.  We are at peace with Russia and the cold war is over. A first strike seems quite unlikely at this time. The danger today is from an unauthorized launch from Russia, or, because parts of Russia's early warning system do not work, that Russian leaders could falsely think the United States had started a first strike and would launch a retaliatory strike. A national missile defense system could not stop those missiles.  Since Russia is having difficulty maintaining its nuclear arsenal now, it is in our vital national interest to see reductions in the number of missiles on both sides--rather than pursuing a policy that would put the START process on ice and could lead to redeploying multiple warheads instead.  Our broader nuclear nonproliferation goals could also be undermined by the demise of arms control. The grand bargain forged when the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) was negotiated was that the nuclear countries would work toward nuclear disarmament, in return for the non-nuclear countries foregoing them.  If we take a unilateral action that undermines the START process, there will be no grand bargain, and we will have no argument against any country, including the rogue states, acquiring nuclear weapons.  The Maginot Line of national missile defense will not only encourage countries to go around it, or to overwhelm it, it could also become the Trojan Horse that lets our enemies into the nuclear club.                                 costs  While we must make this decision on its merits, we cannot ignore the costs of making it. We have spent over $40 billion on national missile defense since 1983 with virtually nothing to show for it. That figure does not include the $52 billion spent before 1983on various missile defense systems, like the Nike and Safeguard systems of the 1960's and 1970's. Estimates vary greatly on how much a limited missile defense system would cost, and these estimates depend greatly on what system would be chosen. I think it is safe to say that no one really knows yet how much a system would cost.  I listened to the debate earlier today from some of my colleagues. One of them raised the specter of vulnerability of nations on the west coast as well as Hawaii in terms of attack from new members of the missile nuclear club. One of the people speaking said if we know that threat is out there, and we know the damage that could take place, isn't it a given that we would spend any amount of money to protect our coast? Isn't that a responsibility? That is an interesting argument, and it certainly is one that would suggest that we would spend any amount of money on this national missile defense system, that there are no limits to spending.  In fact, as I read it, the only limitation in this bill is that it has to be somehow technologically possible to have a national missile defense system. I would like to suggest that it is interesting that this would be the standard which we would use to determine defense spending.  I wonder if I introduced a resolution into the Senate which asks if it would be the policy of the United States to spend as much money as necessary if we found that it was technologically possible to cure cancer, how many votes we would get on the floor of the U.S. Senate. We have made more progress in the war against cancer than we have on any national missile defense system. Yet, when it comes to that kind of courage with respect to virtually every American family, that is not considered really food for thought or even an issue for debate. The same question could be asked when it comes to education. If it is technologically possible to educate children in America better, should we make it our policy to spend whatever is necessary to achieve that? I doubt that I could muster a majority vote in the Senate for that suggestion. Or the elimination of drugs in America, if it is technologically possible to end the scourge of drugs in our country, should we spend whatever is necessary?  I have given you three examples which come to mind, and many more could be produced. But it is interesting to me that when it comes to defense spending we apply standards which are totally different than the priorities which many Americans would identify as important to us and important to all families.  In May 1996 the Congressional Budget Office estimated that it would cost $31-60 billion through 2010 to acquire a system outlined in the Defend America Act of 1996, plus an additional $2-4 billion per year to operate and maintain it. The National Security Council estimated that a two-site, ground-based system would cost $23 billion to deploy. The General Accounting Office reported that the Ballistic Missile Defense Office estimated that limited deployments in North Dakota and Alaska would cost between $18-28 billion. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that it would cost $60 billion to build a ``high end system,'' including space-based lasers. Given the history of defense cost over-runs, it is quite likely that these figures are the floor, not the ceiling of what these costs may be.  No matter how many amendments are adopted--and some I have supported, and some are very good--the bottom line is the U.S. Senate with this vote is virtually giving a blank check to this project. There are no limitations on cost. As long as it meets the threshold requirement of being technologically possible, it can go forward.  We must not forget that, if we push ahead with deploying a national missile defense system without seeking Russian agreement with changes to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the nuclear arms reduction process will be moribund.  Let me salute my colleagues in the House.  Senator Landrieu offered an important amendment that at least reiterates America's commitment to negotiating some type of disarmament. I support it. Virtually every Member did. I think that is a positive step. But to simply adopt that amendment and ignore the bill that is before us, I think, is folly. We have to be consistent. We have built into this bill an inconsistency. On the one hand, we are going to move forward with the national missile defense system, even if it violates existing treaties, and then an amendment which says we are going to continue to negotiate these START treaties. I don't know what the negotiating partner would believe, if they read this bill after this debate.  That means we would also be bearing the costs of maintaining our current level of 6,000 nuclear weapons, instead of being able to reduce to START II levels of 3,500 warheads, or START III levels of 2,500 warheads, or even 1,000 warheads. We now spend about $22 billion on maintaining and supporting our current nuclear force levels, including $8 billion per year maintaining nuclear warheads.  Would it not be in the best interests of the United States of America and its future to continue the arms control negotiations to reduce the nuclear warheads not only in the United States but around the world? I think that is the best course of action. I am afraid this bill is inconsistent with that strategy.  In March 1998, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that reducing warheads to START II levels by the end of 2007 would save $700 million per year through 2008 and about $800 million a year in the long run (in constant dollars). Making these reductions by 2003 would yield an additional $700 million through 2008.  Reducing warheads to START III levels would save $1.5 billion per year in the long run, provided weapons platforms are also retired. If warheads were reduced to 1,000, savings would increase to $2 billion per year in the long run. Talk about a peace dividend. This $2 billion per year savings--25 percent of the current costs of maintaining nuclear warheads--does not include huge savings that would result if nuclear platforms, such as submarines, were retired to reflect the reduced number of warheads.  Thus, in considering the costs of deciding to deploy a national missile defense system, we must add not only the $35-60 billion or more that it would cost to deploy it, but also the opportunity cost of billions of dollars every year of foregone savings from not being able to reduce our nuclear arsenal.  If Russia reverts to deploying multiple warhead missiles in response to our decision to deploy a national missile defense system, we may then feel that we must do the same--potentially creating a new arms race. The cost fighting the proliferation of nuclear weapons that could occur if the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty is undermined is incalculable.  Deciding today that it is our policy to deploy a national missile defense system is an expensive and bad idea that will lower, not improve our national security.  I yield the remainder of my time.
