President, much has happened since the Irish Republican Army broke its cease-fire with two bloody bombings in London. Those cowardly acts cast doubt on the viability of the entire peace process. But the people rose up en mass, as I had a feeling they would. Tens of thousands demonstrated in the streets of Dublin and elsewhere, demanding that the perpetrators of the violence give them back their peace.  Responding to the will of the people, the Irish and British Governments reached agreement on a way forward, including a date of June 10 for full-party talks. The peace process is back on track and moving ahead, and Sinn Fein and the IRA should waste no time in seizing this opportunity. Their participation is needed if lasting peace is to be achieved. As Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring said in an eloquent speech to the Dail Eireann on February 29, the ``fixed date surely now offers the basic assurances that the republican movement has sought. Given the intolerable human cost, and the grave political damage caused by the violence to date, how can the IRA explain the continuation, for one more day, of its renewed campaign?''  Mr. President, Foreign Minister Spring has been on a relentless quest for peace in Northern Ireland for much of his distinguished career. I know his hopes were dashed when the IRA ended its cease-fire, as were all of ours. But he did not lose hope. He persevered, and we all owe him and Prime Minister John Bruton our support and admiration for their determination, their fairness, and their commitment to a better life for all the people on that island.  I ask that Foreign Minister Spring's February 29 speech be printed in the Record.  The speech follows:  Statement by Tanaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Dick Spring,                      Dail Eireann, 29 February 1996       The British and Irish Governments have long shared a common      analysis and a common objective: a comprehensive political      settlement based on consent. We have also been united in      agreement that this objective can only be attained through      all party negotiations addressing comprehensively all the      relevant relationships and issues in an inter-locking three-     stranded process. The necessity for all-party negotiations is      also appreciated by all parties in Northern Ireland.       Where they, and we, have differed, has been on how to      proceed into such negotiations. Was it possible to ensure      that, on the one     hand, all parties could enter into such negotiations freely,      on a basis of equality, and without prejudice to their      fundamental aspirations, and, on the other hand, that all      could negotiate in full confidence that there was a basic      commitment all round to exclusively peaceful methods and to      the democratic process?       This conundrum has dominated discussions between the two      Governments, and wider debate, for the last year. It has been      a difficult and frustrating period. Disputes over a wide      range of complex and interconnected, but ultimately      secondary, issues have been permitted to obscure the      fundamental point, that there is an overwhelming consensus      for peace, and for agreement between the people who share      this island. Debate about questions of substance has been      crowded out by debate about questions of procedure.       The appalling prospect that the peace process might run      into the sands has loomed before us. In their mass      demonstrations last Sunday, the people underlined their      determination that this could not be allowed to happen. Even      before yesterday's Communique was written, the wider Irish      public had demonstrated that the peace does indeed belong to      all the people.       The two Governments agreed at the end of November that is      was their firm aim to launch all-party negotiations by the      end of February--that is, today. A clear and unalterable      timetable leading to negotiations on 10 June has now been put      in place. The timescale now envisaged is consistent with the      implications of an elective process, the possibility of which      was signalled in the November communique.       The essential point agreed at the summit is that there is a      fixed date on which all-party negotiations will begin. This      is a firm and unambiguous commitment. Neither Government has      sought to enter any qualifications, to hedge or to      equivocate.       We now see a definite commitment that the two Governments      and the Northern parties will sit down together to begin to      fashion that lasting settlement which is required to underpin      peace and to allow for a new beginning in all three core      relationships.       The need for negotiations has been acknowledged on all      sides. We want them because, objectively, they are necessary.      They would be necessary even if the paramilitary      organizations had never existed, because there is a political      conflict that must be resolved.       Nor can the will of the people for negotiations leading to      an agreement founded on consent be thwarted by violence. The      Taoiseach and the Prime Minister resolved that neither      violence, nor the threat of violence, would be allowed to      influence the course of negotiations, or preparations for      negotiations. They also agreed that the IRA's abandonment of      its cessation of violence was a fundamental breach of the      declared basis on which both Governments had engaged Sinn      Fein in political dialogue. They reiterated what has already      been stated more than once in this House, that the resumption      of full political dialogue with Sinn Fein requires the      restoration of the ceasefire.       The vast majority of the people of Ireland, North and      South, who utterly repudiate the use of violence for any      purpose whatever, can be assured that there will be no      bending of the principle that violence has no place in any      political process.       Equally, the Governments have emphasized that they are      determined to press on in the search for political agreement,      irrespective of whether the republican movement makes it      possible for Sinn Fein to rejoin that quest or not.       Nevertheless, a fundamental objective of the peace process      has always been to offer a meaningful political alternative      to violence. Negotiations conducted on a fully inclusive      basis, and in the absence both of violence and of security      counter-measures, have always seemed more likely in the long      run to produce a stable agreement in which all could      acquiesce. It is the hope of the two Governments,      accordingly, that the negotiations will be fully inclusive,      with all parties being able to participate in them. We call      on Sinn Fein, and the IRA, to make Sinn Fein's participation      in the process of such negotiations possible.       On 15 February, the President of Sinn Fein said that ``the      absence of negotiations led to the breakdown. The      commencement of negotiations therefore provides the way      forward. Any new process must contain copperfastened and      unambiguous public assurances that all party talks will be      initiated by both Governments at the earliest possible      date.''       All-party negotiations will begin on 10 June. While many      would have wished for an earlier date, we wanted to be sure      that the appointed date was realistic and could be fixed      without doubt. This fixed date surely now offers the basic      assurances that the republican movement has sought. Given the      intolerable human cost, and the grave political damage caused      by the violence to date, how can the IRA explain the      continuation, for one more day, of its renewed campaign? It      is up to it to decide its own course. I cannot pretend to      know how the minds of its leaders work. But I expect that all      those with influence upon it will do what they can to point      out to it the straightforward and positive implications of      agreement on a fixed date and timetable for negotiations.       The Taoiseach and the Prime Minister both recognized that      confidence building measures will be necessary in the course      of all-party negotiations. Negotiations are a dynamic      process, depending on the interplay of personalities and      arguments, and not a matter of static calculation. As one      such measure, all participants would need to make clear at      the beginning of negotiations their total and absolute      commitment to the principles of democracy and non-violence      set out in the Mitchell Report. These principles offer      essential guarantees that negotiations will not be affected      by violence or by the threat of violence, and that they will      address and, as part of their outcome, achieve, the total and      verifiable decommissioning of all paramilitary weapons.       All parties will also have to address, as a high priority,      the Report's proposals on decommissioning. Negotiations must,      in a nutshell, deal fully and satisfactorily with this issue.       But decommissioning is by no means the only item on the      agenda, nor should the commitments we seek be exploited to      avoid serious negotiation on the many other questions to be      addressed. The two Governments have been at pains to stress      that confidence is required all round if the negotiations are      to gain the momentum necessary for their success. The parties      must have reassurance that a meaningful and inclusive process      of negotiations is genuinely being offered to address the      legitimate concerns of their traditions, and the need for new      political arrangements with which all can identify.      Negotiations must be for real, and must be undertaken in good      faith. Every participant has the right to expect that every      other participant will make a genuine effort to understand      opposing perspectives and to seek accommodation.       A heavy onus will rest on all of us. For all to gain, each      must be prepared to change. A flexible and accommodating      approach will be essential. For example, I was heartened by      the fact that the Ulster Unionist Party's recent paper, The      Democratic Imperative, displayed some understanding of the      basis of the nationalist requirement for meaningful North/     South links. I hope that all parties, including the      Unionists, will feel able, both before and throughout the      negotiations, to prove to others their determination to forge      a new and all-embracing accord.       The Unionist parties have stressed that for them an      elective process is of crucial importance in enabling them to      go to the table. Both Governments are of the view that such a      process would have to be broadly acceptable and would have to      lead immediately and without further pre-conditions to the      convening of all-party regotiations with a comprehensive      agenda.       As is reflected in the Communigue, the details of an      elective process are primarily a matter for the Northern      Ireland parties, which will be the participants in any such      process, and for the British Government, which will have to      introduce the necessary legislation, and to ensure that it is      speedily processed. The question of how elections are to be      integrated into the launch of negotiations, on the other      land, is one in which we have entirely legitimate interest,      as one of the participants in those negotiations. The Irish      Government is prepared to support any process which satisfies      the criteria set out by the International Body; it must be      broadly acceptable to the Northern parties, have an      appropriate mandate, and be within the three stranded      structure. It is on this basis that the Government has agreed      with the British Government on the approach outlined in the      Communique.       It is no secret that the Northern parties continue to      disagree on the form of any elective process, and on the      precise function of that process. There are significant      disagreements even between those who have advocated such a      process from the beginning. There is a range of possible      options consistent with the requirement that elections lead      directly and without pre-conditions into three-stranded all      party negotiations.       There are also numerous other significant details which      need to be resolved in advance of the launch of negotiations.      These are broadly grouped together under the rubric of ``the      basis, participation, structure, format and agenda'' of such      negotiations. Both Governments have had useful discussions      with the parties during the series of preparatory talks which      were initiated after last November's Summit. Nevertheless,      there is still much work to be done. For example, we need to      ensure that, irrespective of the form and outcome of any      elective process, there will be a way for all the relevant      players in the situation, including the loyalist parties,      which have played so crucial and constructive a role, to be      involved in resolving the conflict. There are several other      key points, and myriad lesser details on which it will be      necessary to be clear in advance.       It seemed to me for some time that the only practical way      to hammer out agreement on these issues, given both their      complexity and the number of participants involved, would      be through some form of concentrated and accelerated      dialogue, which would allow us all to bounce ideas off one      another and to explore common ground.       The Prime Minister and the Taoiseach have now agreed that      the two Governments will conduct intensive multi-lateral      consultations on these lines with the relevant Northern      Ireland parties, in whatever configuration, or indeed      configurations, are acceptable to those concerned. These      consultations will begin on Monday next, 4 March.      Preparations at official level are already underway. The      Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and I will meet in      Belfast on that day to launch the consultations and to agree     on how we will make the best use of the time available, to      ensure that every effort is made to secure widespread      agreement among the parties on elections and the organisation      of negotiations, and to allow us to come to a view on the      question of a referendum. I would appeal to all parties to      cooperate fully in that process.       These consultations are to be strictly time-limited. They      will end on Wednesday 13 March. They will not be allowed to      drag on inconclusively, and in so doing to threaten the      timetable set out for the launch of negotiations. The      existence of a deadline will focus the minds of participants.       After 13 March, the two Governments will immediately review      their outcome. The British Government will bring forward      legislation for an elective process, based on a judgement of      what seems most broadly acceptable. Decisions will also be      announced as appropriate on the other matters relating to the      negotiating process which are to be addressed by the      consultations. The two Governments are of the shared view      that the parties must be given every opportunity to shape      these matters in an agreed fashion, but ultimately we are      prepared to make judgements and where appropriate to take the      necessary decisions on the basis of what we have learned in      the consultations.       In essence, we have mapped out a clear path to the      negotiating table. This combination of steps offers to all      parties a balanced and honourable way forward. It guarantees      negotiations, and it also guarantees that those negotiations      will be conducted on the basis of the principles of democracy      and non-violence. There is no reason for any party to refuse      to participate in negotiations. Equally, there is no reason      for the IRA, through a refusal to restore its ceasefire, to      deny Sinn Fein the possibility of full participation in      political dialogue and entry into the negotiations on a basis      of equality.       Negotiations are a necessary means to an essential end. We      must never forget what it is that we seek to attain through      them. It is important to remind ourselves of the ultimate      prize we seek to gain.       Political violence could be eradicated for-ever through a      draining of the swamp of inherited distrust and      incomprehension. Through partnership in agreed institutions,      unionism and nationalism could learn to respect one another      and to work together for the common good. Nationalists could      feel secure and valued within Northern Ireland: Unionists      could feel secure and valued on the island of Ireland. We      could achieve permanent agreement on the rules which would      order our relationships, through matching and reciprocal      guarantees which would transcend disputes about sovereignty.      The last ghosts which haunt the relationship between Britain      and Ireland would be laid to rest.       It is long past time that we began to work out together how      to reach this destination. Now we know when negotiations will      begin, and we must prepare ourselves for the task ahead. The      Irish Government, working on the foundations and with the      commitments of yesterday's communique, will approach that      task with the utmost urgency and resolve.                          ____________________
