President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record editorials from the New York Times and the Washington Post, and an op-ed from the Los Angeles Times in support of this amendment.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Apr. 3, 2006]                         Terrorists or Victims?       In Sierra Leone there is a woman who was kept captive in      her house for four days by guerrillas. The rebels raped her      and her daughter and cut them with machetes. Under America's      program to resettle refugees, she would be eligible to come      to safety in the United States. But her application for      refuge has been put on indefinite hold--because American law      says that she provided ``material support'' to terrorists by      giving them shelter.       This law is keeping out of the United States several      thousand recognized refugees America had agreed in principle      to shelter. By any reasonable definition, they are victims,      not terrorists.       A Liberian woman was kidnapped by a guerrilla group and      forced to be a sexual slave for several weeks. She also had      to cook and do laundry. These services are now considered      material support to terrorists. In Colombia, the United      Nations will no longer ask the United States to admit dozens      of refugees who are clearly victims, since all their      predecessors have been rejected on material support grounds.      One is a woman who gave a glass of water to an armed      guerrilla who approached her house. Another is a young man      who was kidnapped by paramilitary members on a killing spree      and forced to dig graves alongside others. The men, many of      whom were shot when their work was finished, never knew if      one of the graves would become their own.       The law makes no exception for duress. It also treats any      group of two or more people fighting a government as      terrorists no matter how justified the cause, or how long ago      the struggle. So the United States has turned away Chin      refugees, for supporting an armed group fighting against the      Myanmar dictatorship, which has barred them from practicing      their religion. The United States has acknowledged that the      law would also bar Iraqis who helped American marines find      Jessica Lynch.       The law does not formally reject these applicants but      places them on indefinite hold. No one accused of material      support has ever had that hold lifted. The Department of      Homeland Security can supposedly waive the material support      provision but has never done so.       Clearly, Congress needs to add an exception for duress,      allow the secretary of state to designate armed movements as      nonterrorist, and allow supporters of legitimate groups to      gain refuge. These changes would pose no risk of admitting      terrorists to the United States and would keep America from      further victimizing those who have already suffered at the      hands of terrorist groups.                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 28, 2006]                        How Not To Treat Friends       Congress tightened a law last year on refugee admissions in      order (it thought) to keep terrorists and their supporters      out of the country. The effect has been to bar friends and      allies.       One example: Many Vietnamese Montagnards fought alongside      U.S. forces during the Vietnam War and were then murderously      oppressed by the Vietnamese government. During the war, the      United States helped arm a Montagnard group called the United      Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races, which continued      to struggle for autonomy after the war ended. This group      ceased to exist in 1992, when a band of nearly 400 fighters      disarmed and were resettled in North Carolina. Under      Congress's irrational new rules, however, the group has      become, legally speaking, a terrorist organization, and 11      Montagnards still stuck in Cambodia would be denied refugee      status because in the past they had offered the group      ``material support.''       The Montagnards are not the law's only, or even principal,      victims. Thousands of ethnic victims of the Burmese military      regime, living in camps in Thailand, expected after long      waits to receive refugee status; now they're stuck in limbo.      So are large numbers of Colombians who were forced to support      the leftist rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of      Colombia. Liberians, Somalis and anti-Castro Cuban dissidents      are also being branded terrorists and kept out.       Misguided law now prevents the admission of a member or      backer of any group of ``two or more individuals'' that      ``engages in, or has a subgroup which engages in,''      activities as commonplace as using an ``explosive, firearm or      other weapon or dangerous device.'' The law treats a      Montagnard who once aided a U.S.-backed group no differently      from an al-Qaeda operative. The administration has the      authority to override this absurdity in certain instances,      though not all. But it has not used this limited power, and      even the need for a waiver is galling. America should not be      ``forgiving'' people who did not, in fact, support terrorism.      These are victims--exactly the sort of people refugee and      asylum programs are meant to protect.       An amendment being offered to the supplemental      appropriations bill by Sens. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), Norm      Coleman (R-Minn.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) would solve      the problem cleanly. It would clarify that only associates      and supporters of groups certified by the government as      terrorist organizations should be denied refugee status and      that those forced to aid terrorists are not themselves      terrorists. Congress did not mean to create this problem.      Fixing it should not be controversial.                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 17, 2006]                              Fix This Law       If Congress doesn't quickly fix a major problem it created      in the law governing the admission of refugees, tens of      thousands of human rights victims will soon begin paying the      price. Congress, we assume, never meant to rewrite federal      law so that victims of totalitarian regimes and those forced      to serve human rights abusers are kept out of the United      States. Yet an accumulation of legal changes in recent years,      culminating in the Real ID Act last year, has done just      that--paralyzing America's traditionally generous refugee      admission program. The United States is supposed to admit up      to 70,000 refugees this year, though it probably will take      around 55,000 under the best of circumstances. Yet human      rights advocates estimate that between 10,000 and 20,000      people may be barred because of irrationally broad legal      definitions of terrorism, support for terrorism and terrorist      groups--definitions that make no distinction between this      country's enemies and those it ought to protect.       The law makes ineligible for admission members or      supporters of any group that contains ``two or more      individuals, whether organized or not, [which] engages in, or      has a subgroup which engages in'' activities as broad as      using an ``explosive, firearm or other weapon or dangerous      device.'' It makes no exception for people compelled to      support a group--for example, Colombian peasants forced to      aid the leftist rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of      Colombia. Nor does     it exempt someone who took up arms--or sheltered or fed      someone who did--against the murderous Burmese government.       The result is that people around the world whose struggles      America backs find themselves ineligible for refugee status      here. The problem is most acute for Colombians and large      numbers of people of the Karen and Chin ethnic groups whom      the Burmese military junta has brutally repressed. But      Liberians, Somalis and Vietnamese Montagnards have also      gotten caught up in the problem. Even some Cuban dissidents      who once helped anti-Castro forces may be found ineligible.      The Bush administration has acknowledged that members of      Afghanistan's Northern Alliance would be barred under the law      as well; they, after all, fought alongside our troops.       The government has the power to waive the exclusion in some      cases, but it hasn't managed to use it yet. Its power is      limited, in any event; it can forgive people for their      support for terrorism but not for their membership in      terrorist groups. Even if it were broader, its categories are      all wrong. These people aren't terrorists and shouldn't be      labeled as such.       Fixing the law would not be hard. At a minimum, Congress      needs to make it clear that not every armed, non-state group      is a terrorist organization. Not all such groups attack      civilians; some are U.S. allies fighting legitimate military      struggles against evil governments. What's more, the law      needs to recognize that people forced to aid terrorists are      victims of terror, not terrorists themselves. Time is running      out. Congress must act.                                  ____              [From the Los Angeles Times, Mar. 29, 2006]                        Terrorist or Terrorized?                            (By George Rupp)       In his second inaugural address, President Bush made a      stirring commitment to oppressed people yearning to be free:      ``When you stand for your liberty, we will stand with you.''       For half a century, one of the best expressions of that      bond has been the federal Refugee Resettlement Program. This      State Department-administered program seeks to offer a safe      harbor to those fearing persecution by tyrannical      governments. But thousands of people whose lives are at risk      for standing up for freedom will this year be denied help      because of a Kafkaesque interpretation of who is deemed a      terrorist.       The laws governing eligibility for refugee status have long      denied it to anyone who commits a terrorist act or who      provides ``material support'' to terrorists. These laws were      strengthened after 9/11. The problem was created by recent      legislation that expanded the definition of terrorists. There      are real-life consequences from such myopic ``reform.''       In Colombia, for example, the leftist guerrilla group FARC      often kidnaps civilians and demands ransom from their      relatives. FARC also requires the payment of a ``war tax''      from Colombians in the regions it controls, upon threat of      serious harm. Nearly 2,000 Colombians who faced such      circumstances as paying a ransom or ``tax''--and who later      fled the country and were determined by the United Nations to      be refugees--have been denied U.S. resettlement on the basis      of the ``material support'' provision.       In Liberia, a female head of a household was referred to      the U.S. resettlement program by the Office of the United      Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as a person      particularly vulnerable to attack. Rebels had come to her      home, killed her father and beat and gang-raped her. The      rebels held her hostage in her own home and forced her to      wash their clothes. The woman escaped after several weeks and      made her way to a refugee camp. The Department of Homeland      Security has decided that because the rebels lived in her      house and she washed their clothes, she had provided      ``material support'' to the rebels; the case has been placed      on hold.       A Sierra Leonean woman's house was attacked by rebels in      1992. A young family member was killed with machetes, another      minor was subjected to burns and the woman and her daughter      were raped. The rebels kept the family captive for days in      their own home. Homeland Security has placed the case on hold      for ``material support'' concerns because the family is      deemed to have provided housing to the rebels. Under this      interpretation, it does not matter whether the support      provided was given willingly or under duress.       Unfortunately, the actions of Homeland Security go far      beyond barring the affected refugees from entering the U.S.      They become permanently tainted by suspicions of terrorism      and find themselves shut out by other nations that resettle      refugees. And the governments now providing these people with      temporary asylum might even force them back to the nations      they fled.       U.S. policy toward authoritarian governments has been      turned on its head: The victims of terrorism are being denied      protection and sanctuary. The secretary of Homeland Security      has the authority to determine that the ``material support''      provision shall not apply to certain individuals or groups.      Yet the department has failed to issue guidance, causing mass      confusion and holding up decisions on refugee cases. Neither      the administration nor Congress seems able to fix the problem      for fear of being labeled weak on terrorism.       Yes, we must remain vigilant against terrorists. But in      order to implement Bush's commitment to stand with those      seeking liberty at great personal risk. Homeland Security      Secretary Michael Chertoff or Congress must rectify the      injustice that treats victims of coercion as supporters of      terrorism.
