Forgione, Sr., for his outstanding dedication to music, service, and country.  From his earliest days, Frank--the son of two musicians--demonstrated an appreciation and recognition of the power of music. At age 11 he began studying music with Frank Holt, a percussionist for noted bandmaster and composer John Philip Sousa. At the encouragement of his instructors, he auditioned and was accepted into the Navy School of Music here in Washington in 1938.  In December 1941, Frank was stationed at Pearl Harbor aboard the USS Oglala. During the attack of December 7, the Oglala fell victim to the Japanese attack and sank. Fortunately, Frank was able to make it to a dock. He often said that every day he lived after that was a gift.  In 1951, he became head of the percussion department at his alma mater, the Navy School of Music. Just 10 years later, he founded and led the U.S. Navy Special Show Band--the first Navy Show Band--on a tour in South America. Called the Navy's Goodwill Ambassadors, the band toured through South America during a period of unrest.  When the band encountered anti-American sentiment or threats at their shows, Frank directed the band to perform, believing that the universality of music would be enough to win over the crowd. More often than not, his instincts proved correct. The band went on to make several more tours throughout South America and the rest of the world.  Frank Forgione's service did not go unnoticed. He became the first musician since John Philip Sousa to receive the Secretary of the Navy's Commendation Medal.  In 1972, Frank retired with the rank of Chief Warrant Officer. Retirement did not ebb his desire to serve. Inspired by his tours in South America, Frank dedicated himself to relieving the poverty he witnessed while on the continent. For the next 16 years, he enlisted many national corporations to donate food, educational materials, medicine, and other essential supplies to help improve the living conditions for those less fortunate.  In addition, Frank continued fulfilling his love of music. He created the Fort Washington Continentals, an award-winning youth drum corps located in Prince Georges County. The corps was selected to lead Washington's Bicentennial Parade.  At age 70, Frank became bandmaster for the New York Military Academy in Cornwall-on-Hudson, touring extensively throughout the United States, Europe, and Australia. While there he was given the honorary rank of Army Colonel. He retired again in 2005 at the age of 87. Though Frank passed away on July 27, 2009, it is undeniable that his spirit and appreciation for music have remained with those he touched throughout his life.  Madam Speaker, Frank G. Forgione, Sr. was blessed with the gift of music and committed to serving others. He helped to make the U.S. Navy, the State of Maryland, and communities throughout the world a better place. I urge my colleagues to join with me in paying tribute to this extraordinary individual for a life well lived and in offering sincerest condolences to his friends and family on their loss.                          ____________________
