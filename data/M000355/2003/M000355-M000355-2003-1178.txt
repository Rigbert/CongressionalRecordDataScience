 President, I, too, look forward to working with Senator Reid. I have known him for many years and have admired his great work. I am confident that we will get along well and advance the business of the people to the maximum extent possible, and whatever partisan differences develop along the way, I know neither of us will take that personally. As we know, the most important vote is always the next one. So I look forward to continuing our good relationship. We will be spending a lot of time together in this Chamber.                          ____________________
