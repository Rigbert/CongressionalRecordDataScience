President, by sad coincidence, America lost two women this past weekend women we had watched grow from little girls into accomplished women. Kara Kennedy and Eleanor Mondale Poling were both members of this Senate family.  Kara was the daughter of Senator Edward Kennedy and his wife Joan. Eleanor was the daughter of former Senator and former Vice President Walter Mondale and his wife Joan. Both women fought brave, against-the-odds battles against cancer in recent years.  Ted and Joan Kennedy named their first-born Kara, a name that means ``dear little one'' in the old Irish language--and that is what she always was to her parents. Like the rest of her famous family, Kara was committed to helping those less fortunate than herself. After graduating from Tufts University, she worked as a filmmaker and was active in a number of causes.  In 2002, she was diagnosed with lung cancer. Her doctors gave her 1 year to live. But Kara and her family refused to give up. She underwent surgery, chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Her father accompanied her to her chemotherapy treatments.  It seemed that Kara had beaten cancer. But Friday night, she collapsed after her usual workout at the gym. Her brother, former Congressman Patrick Kennedy, said that cancer surgery and years of grueling chemotherapy and radiation treatment had taken a devastating toll on his sister's strength and her heart simply gave out.  In addition to her mother Joan and stepmother Vickie, Kara leaves behind three brothers and a sister, a multitude of cousins and nieces and nephews, and her two beloved children, Max, 14, and Grace, who turned 17 yesterday.  Eleanor Mondale Poling was just 4 years old when her father was appointed to fill the Senate seat vacated by Hubert Humphrey, who had just become Vice President of the United States. Like Kara Kennedy, she grew up in this Senate and in the public eye. She was 17 when her father became Vice President of the United States.  As a young woman, Eleanor Mondale made her own career in broadcasting, beginning with a job as a radio D.J. in Chicago. She would go on to work for a number of TV organizations. In 2005, Eleanor Mondale married Chan Poling. The couple lived on a farm in Prior Lake, MN, surrounded by animals, which Eleanor loved.  That same year, 2005, Eleanor was diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer. The next 6 years would bring multiple surgeries, chemotherapy and radiation, and at least twice apparent remissions. But the cancer came back in 2009. Eleanor Mondale Poling died at home on her farm early Saturday.  In addition to her parents, Eleanor leaves her two brothers, Ted Mondale, a former Minnesota State senator, and William Mondale, the former assistant attorney general of Minnesota.                          ____________________
