President, I rise to engage in a brief colloquy with the distinguished ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Agriculture, Senator Kohl, regarding language in the Committee's report to accompany S. 1427, the fiscal year 2004 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for including language in the committee's report recognizing the importance of eelgrass habitats to marine ecosystems along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean, and urging the Department of Agriculture to make funds available for projects in Rhode Island to enhance these habitats. I understand that it was the Committee's intention to encourage USDA to make such funding available through the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP), rather than through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) as stated on page 101 of Senate Report 108-107. The purpose of our colloquy today is to clarify that the report language should have read as follows: ``The Committee urges the Department to give consideration to the use of WHIP funding for projects in Rhode Island, and similar areas, that will enhance these habitats.''
