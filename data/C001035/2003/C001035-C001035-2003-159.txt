President, I am pleased to join with Senators Miller, Dole, McCain, Kerry, Chambliss and Specter in introducing the David Jayne Medicare Homebound Modernization Act of 2003 to modernize Medicare's outdated ``homebound'' requirement that has impeded access to needed home health services for many of our Nation's elderly and disabled Medicare beneficiaries.  Health care in America has gone full circle. People are spending less time in institutions, and recovery and care for patients with chronic diseases and conditions have increasingly been taking place in the home. The highly skilled and often technically complex care that our home health agencies provide has enabled millions of our most vulnerable older and disabled individuals to avoid hospitals and nursing homes and stay just where they belong--in the comfort and security of their own homes.  Under current law, a Medicare patient must be considered ``homebound'' if he or she is to be eligible for home health services. While an individual is not actually required to be bedridden to qualify for benefits, his or her condition must be such that ``there exists a normal inability to leave home.'' The statute does allow for absences from the home that are ``infrequent'' or of ``relatively short duration.'' It also gives specific permission for the individual to leave home to attend medical appointments, adult day care or religious services.  Unfortunately, however, the statute does not define precisely what ``infrequent'' or ``relatively short duration'' means. It leaves it to the fiscal intermediaries to interpret just how many absences qualify as ``frequent'' and just how short those absences must be. Interpretations of this definition have therefore varied widely.  As a consequence, there have been far too many instances where an overzealous or arbitrary interpretation of the definition has turned elderly or disabled Medicare beneficiaries--who are dependent upon Medicare home health services and medical equipment for survival--into virtual prisoners in their own home.  The current homebound requirement is particularly hard on younger, disabled Medicare patients. For example, last year I met with David Jayne, a 41-year-old man with Lou Gehrig's disease, who is confined to a wheelchair and cannot swallow, speak or even breathe on his own. Mr. Jayne needs skilled nursing visits each week to enable him to remain independent and out of an inpatient facility. Despite his disability, Mr. Jayne meets frequently with youth and church groups. Speaking through a computerized voice synthesizer, he gives inspirational talks about how the human spirit can endure and even overcome great hardship.  The Atlanta Journal Constitution ran a feature article on Mr. Jayne and his activities, including a report about how he had, with the help of family and friends, attended a football game to root for the University of Georgia Bulldogs. A few days later, at the direction of the fiscal intermediary, his home health agency--which had been sending a health care worker to his home for two hours, four mornings a week--notified him that he could no longer be considered homebound, and that his benefits were being cut off. While his benefits were subsequently reinstated due to the media attention given the case, this experience motivated him to launch a crusade to modernize the homebound definition and led him to found the National Coalition to Amend the Medicare Homebound Restriction.  The fact is that the current requirement reflects an outmoded view of life for persons who live with serious disabilities. The homebound criteria may have made sense thirty years ago, when an elderly or disabled person might have expected to live in the confines of their home--perhaps cared for by an extended family. The current definition, however, fails to reflect the technological and medical advances that have been made in supporting individuals with significant disabilities and mobility challenges. It also fails to reflect advances in treatment for seriously ill individuals that allow them brief periods of relative wellness.  It also fails to recognize that an individual's mental acuity and physical stamina can only be maintained by use, and that the use of the body and mind is encouraged by social interactions outside the four walls of a home.  The David Jayne Medicare Homebound Modernization Act of 2003 will create an exception to the homebound restriction based on the severity of the patient's functional limitations and clinical condition. The specific, limited exception to the homebound rule would apply to individuals who: one, have been certified by a physician as having a permanent and severe condition that will not improve; two, who will need assistance with three or more of the five activities of daily living, such as eating, dressing and bathing, for the rest of their lives; three, who require technological and/or personal assistance with the act of leaving home; and four, who are only able to leave home because the services provided through the home health benefit makes it possible for them to do so.  We believe that our legislation is budget neutral because it is specifically limited to individuals who are already eligible for Medicare and whose conditions require the assistance of a skilled nurse, therapist or home healthaide to make it functionally possible for them to leave the home. Our legislation does not expand Medicare eligibility--it simply gives people who are already eligible for the benefit their freedom.  This issue was first brought to my attention by former Senator Bob Dole, who has long been a vigorous advocate for people with disabilities, and I ask unanimous consent that the editorial Senator Dole wrote for the Washington Post last summer entitled ``Imprisoned by Medicare'' be printed in the Congressional Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  Our proposal is also supported by the Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities, the Visiting Nurse Associations of America, the National Association for Home Care, Advancing Independence: Modernizing Medicare and Medicaid, AIMM, the National Coalition to Amend the Medicare Homebound Restriction, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the Half the Planet Foundation.  Moreover, the David Jayne Medicare Homebound Modernization Act of 2003 is consistent with President Bush's ``New Freedom Initiative'' which has, as its goal, the removal of barriers that impede opportunities for those with disabilities to integrate more fully into the community. By allowing reasonable absences from the home, our legislation will bring the Medicare home health benefit into the 21st Century, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to get it done.  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, June 27, 2002]                         Imprisoned by Medicare                               (Bob Dole)       Heroes inspire us to achieve the unachievable, to leave      America a better place for future generations. They remind us      that contributing to family and community is our highest      priority. I am fortunate to know such a hero, and his story      has inspired me to help achieve his one simple wish before he      dies--to change a Medicare restriction so that he and      thousands of others who live with permanent and severe      disabilities can leave their homes to see their children grow      up and contribute to their community without losing life-     sustaining home health services.       David Jayne was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease at age      27. Otherwise known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),      this degenerative neuromuscular condition causes his muscles      to atrophy, leaving him unable to eat, breathe or move on his      own. Though his mobility is limited to moving three fingers,      Jayne, now 41, has demonstrated to everyone who knows him or      has read about him that the human spirit is indomitable.       I met David Jayne by chance at Reagan National Airport      about a year ago. Attached to life support equipment and a      computerized voice simulator because of his body's      deterioration at the hand of ALS, Jayne had traveled with the      help of friends from his home in Rex, Ga., to meet with his      elected members of Congress. He came to urge them to amend      the Medicare homebound restriction.       The homebound rule was intended to deter abuse of the home      health benefit by limiting services to only those individuals      whose illnesses and disabilities are so severe that leaving      the home would require ``a considerable and taxing effort.''      In the 1960s, when this rule was created, it reflected the      limits of health care and technology at the time. It was      incomprehensible then to think that someone with ALS or any      severe and permanent disability could leave the home.       While the homebound restriction has not changed, the role      of physicians and home health providers has. Nurses, doctors      and home health administrators have been turned into      watchdogs and given the responsibility to report any      knowledge of their patients leaving their homes. And the      awful reality of those receiving these services is that they      must either lie or cheat just to enjoy fundamental liberties.       This nearly 40-year-old policy reflects an outmoded view of      life for persons with disabilities. Thanks to advances in      technology and greater community accessibility through the      passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), people      with the most severe disabilities are able to leave their      homes to go to work, volunteer in their communities and enjoy      their family and friends. Unfortunately, Medicare policy has      not kept pace with our times and is now punishing the very      people it was intended to benefit. While Medicare has      developed other and better policies to deter abuse, it has      kept this outdated policy.       The Medicare statute does allow for absences from the home      of ``infrequent'' or ``relatively short duration.'' But the      vagueness of this allowance leaves it to Medicare contractors      to interpret just how many absences qualify as ``frequent''      and just how short those absences might be. To err on the      conservative side, contractors have stripped home health      coverage from those most needing it, including David Jayne,      whose life depends on a ventilator, intravenous feeding and      daily care from a home health aide. Because Jayne's story      went public, his home health agency discontinued these life-     sustaining services. They were only reinstated after members      of Congress became involved and Jayne agreed to pay his home      health provider for any claim denied by Medicare. But      thousands of others live in fear of leaving their homes      because of the stories that have been reported. In two      heartbreaking cases, one mother's services were cut off after      she attended the funeral for her child, while another mother      did not attend the funeral of her child because of fear of      losing her home health care.       For millions of Americans, Medicare-covered home health      services provide a less costly alternative to nursing home or      hospital care. There are abuses that should be corrected, but      not by extracting a price that no law-abiding American should      ever have to pay.       David Jayne has inspired many people with his love and      determination and his simple words, ``Always wait another day      because the next day will be better.'' He inspired me to      volunteer to try to help.       I urge the House of Representatives to amend this harsh      restriction on individual freedom by including in the      Medicare reform bill the David Jayne Amendment, carefully      drafted by Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Sen. Susan Collins      (R-Maine), to do what we all know in our hearts is right,      including all the appropriate safeguards to prevent abuse.      And if this is not possible because of cost concerns, to      adopt an amendment to provide for those who are severely and      permanently disabled and who require the assistance of an      attendant or a skilled nursing facility.       The amendment should give the Health and Human Services      Department six months to address the homebound rule and make      recommendations on how to bring it up to date with today's      technology. Make no mistake, David Jayne is a prisoner--a      prisoner in his specially designed wheelchair. His illness      has robbed him of the ability to do anything without the aid      of technology. Medicare shouldn't act as jailer too.      Thousands of David Jaynes across America are looking to the      president, Congress and the Department of Health and Human      Services for help.                                 ______                                       By
