Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, again to the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Skeen), for whom I have the highest respect, the chairman of our committee, I know that no member of our committee could be proud of the bill that is on the floor today. Many have referenced that in their remarks.  I would urge the membership to recommit this bill back to our subcommittee where it belongs to fix its flaws.  In the years that I have been here in the Congress, I have never seen a conference report that comes to the floor where over one-third of our members do not even sign it. There was pressure put on a number of these people whodid sign. This is not the way that one of the bills out of appropriations ought to come to the floor.  I want to say a word about how this overall legislation is structured. Our concern does not necessarily go to the fundamental appropriations for the Department of Agriculture that are in the bill for the Year 2000. Our problem goes to the heart of the emergency package, the disaster assistance package, which is so fundamentally unfair.  I would beg my colleagues to listen. I am going to spend a few minutes here and lay out some numbers.  There are two parts to that portion of the legislation. There is $7.5 billion that goes out in economic assistance. That basically means low prices--trying to help people, as one of the gentlemen here said, the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Barrett), meet cash flow problems in rural America. Of that $7.5 billion, $5.5 billion of it goes out under the AMTA formula. But, remember, AMTA is based on the planting of program crops in the years 1991 to 1995. It is not tied at all to what was planted this year, to what is planted now, prices received, or economic loss. In fact, there is no requirement to have planted a crop at all in order to get these dollars!  In fact, there is nothing in that section of the bill for fruits and vegetables. Many of our Members are coming up here and saying we want a fair bill. There are provisions that are in there for sugar, for cotton, for peanuts, for tobacco, for oil seeds, for honey, for mohair. But there are no provisions for vegetables, for fruits, for revegetation.  In fact, in that section of the bill, if we look at livestock, hog farmers, an industry that is on its knees, it only gets a chance to compete for up to $200 million nationally. Other claimants in that fund are livestock producers, including those suffering from natural disasters. So their ability to be made ``whole,'' or to even be helped to be made ``half'' or even ``40 percent,'' is almost nothing when you look at the losses that are out there.  I will submit for the Record from the Governors of over a dozen States what they believe the losses to be in their areas. Or look at a State like Ohio, my own State, where over $600 million of losses is documented, with a letter from our Governor. Dollars in the bill for livestock amount to almost nothing as we try to keep some family farmers whole as they try to transition in this difficult rural economy.                                               September 10, 1999.     Hon. Trent Lott,     Majority Leader,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,     Minority Leader,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. J. Dennis Hastert,     Speaker of the House,     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.     Hon. Richard A. Gephardt,     Minority Leader,     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Lott and Daschle and Representatives Hastert      and Gephardt: On behalf of farmers and agricultural      communities in more than 12 states, we request your help in      obtaining immediate federal emergency grant assistance to      address the economic losses caused by this year's severe      drought. Farmers and rural communities along the eastern      seaboard--from Rhode Island to South Carolina and west to      Ohio--are experiencing the worst drought in decades. The      drought of 1999 is compounded by the farm crisis caused by      low agriculture commodity prices. This combination is placing      tremendous financial stress on farmers throughout the region.       Initial estimates indicate that these states will      experience agricultural losses in excess of $1.64 billion      because of the severe and extended drought conditions. This      will have a ripple effect on the economy. The USDA Disaster      Declarations which have been issued for our states enable      farmers to apply for emergency low interest loans; however,      loan assistance programs do not adequately respond to this      year's unexpected economic impact on the farm communities.      Many farmers are simply not in the financial position to      assume more debt when they have lost their income. We urge      you to act quickly to include direct payment assistance to      those producers impacted by the drought.       The recently passed Senate Agriculture Appropriations bill      provides assistance for the commodity price disaster, but      does not address the natural disaster impacting our farmers.      We request that the final aid package be augmented to provide      adequate funding for USDA disaster assistance programs such      as the Crop Loss Disaster Assistance Program, the Non-insured      Crop Disaster Assistance Program, the Livestock Assistance      and the Emergency Conservation Programs. These programs can      provide the rapid response we are looking for and the      agricultural community deserves. We further request that this      disaster funding be earmarked for drought-impacted states.       We appreciate your assistance in helping our farmers in      this time of crisis.           Sincerely,         Bob Taft, Parris N. Glendening, Jim Hodges, Cecil H.            Underwood, James S. Gilmore III, Lincoln C. Almond,            George E. Pataki, Jim Hunt, John G. Rowland, Tom            Carper, Tom Ridge, Christine T. Whitman.                                  ____                               memorandum     Re: Latest Estimates of Agriculture losses in 13 State          Drought Region (revised 9/21/99 4:30 pm).     Date: September 21, 1999.     To: Agriculture Appropriations Conferees.     From: DC Offices of Drought-Affected States.       Following, you will find our most recent estimates of      agriculture losses in our states due to the recent drought.      You will note these estimates reflect increases from our      August numbers due to the inclusion of specialty crops,      livestock, aquaculture and dairy that had not been accounted      for in our previous estimates. Some states were unable to      provide specific estimates per commodity at this time. The      recent Hurricane has caused constraints on staff resources.      Our states believe these numbers are conservative estimates      of what is expected to be the eventual effect of this      devastating drought, but represent the best information we      can provide at this date.       We also request the following programs be activated to      deliver immediate and direct emergency assistance to our      agriculture communities:       (1) Crop Loss Disaster Assistance       (2) Emergency Livestock Feed Program       (3) Emergency Conservation Program       (4) Dairy Loss Assistance Program       (5) Non-Insured Crop Disaster Assistance Program       (6) Tree Assistance Program       The Secretary should be directed to release funds to our      farmers and producers in need within a reasonable, but      expedited timeframe, based on estimated crop losses. We      suggest 30-90 days.

Hon. Marcy Kaptur,     House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Representative Kaptur: On behalf of Ohio's farm      families, I am writing to request your help in contacting      House leadership to secure federal emergency assistance to      overcome drought losses. This summer's drought not only has      devastated crops, but has caused corresponding economic loss      of livestock and dairy producers.       In the past month I have notified you of the State of      Ohio's response to the drought emergency and expressed my      hope that additional appropriations might be made available      to provide the help that Ohio farmers badly need. Ohio's      drought losses already are approaching a projected $600      million and will continue to grow (see attached Ohio Drought      Impact Fact Sheet and memo to the Agriculture Appropriations      conferees for estimated crop loss breakout).       I understand that Agriculture Appropriations conferees will      soon meet to discuss a final bill and will consider providing      meaningful drought assistance to states such as Ohio where it      is sorely needed. I hope that you can support this effort and      work with your House colleagues and the leadership to ensure      that this happens.       As you know, the USDA has made available low interest loans      to disaster designated areas. However, loan assistance      programs do not adequately respond to this year's unexpected      economic impact on the farm communities of the Drought      affected states. Rather, producers impacted by drought      require dedicated direct payment assistance. A farm aid      package should provide adequate funding for USDA disaster      assistance programs, such as the Crop Loss Disaster      Assistance Program, the Non-Insured Crop Disaster Assistance      Program, the Livestock Assistance Program and the Emergency      Conservation Program. Further, this disaster funding should      be earmarked for drought-impacted states.       In addition, I hope you will agree that in order for our      farmers to receive the help they need, Congress should      include emergency grant assistance for drought disaster in      the FY 2000 Agriculture Appropriations Bill.       I appreciate your efforts with this important issue.           Sincerely,     Bob Taft.                                  ____ Fact Sheet: Impact of 1999 Drought on Ohio Crop and Livestock farms,                            September 21, 1999       Drought Loss--Governors' recent estimate for 12      northeastern states: $2.5 billion.       Natural Disaster Loss--National Assn. Of State Departments      of Agriculture (U.S.) estimate for all affected states: $3.56      billion.       Drought loss--Projected estimate for Ohio: $600 million      (While harvest has just begun, there are projections that      Ohio's losses could be in the range of $600 million of      agricultural products. This represents about 10 to 15 percent      of the nearly $4.7 billion of Ohio agricultural products sold      in 1997. The FSA's July estimate was $422 million.)     Estimated direct USDA assistance payments       Drought Assistance--Estimated direct USDA assistance      payments for which Ohio producers would be eligible: $164.8      million.       Breakdown of potential USDA funding to program assistance      grants:     Crop Loss Disaster Assistance Program (CLDAP) and Noninsured          Assistance Program (NAP), $80.6 million;     Livestock Assistance Program (LAP), $82.3 million;     Emergency Conservation Program (ECP), $1.9 million.       According to the Palmer Drought Severity Index, the long-     term forecasting tool used by the NOAA's Climate Prediction      Center, all of Ohio is now in either severe or extreme      drought. Rainfall needed to end the drought, according to the      Index, ranges regionally from about 6 to 10 inches. Topsoil      moisture in Ohio is now 78 percent short to very short,      compared to the five-year average of 41 percent short to very      short. (See Palmer Index map.)       Eighty-seven Ohio counties have been designated natural      disaster areas by U.S. Agriculture Secretary Glickman,      enabling qualified farmers in those counties to apply for      federal disaster assistance loans. Of those, 66 counties were      designated primary natural disaster areas.       Hay Shortage: There is a significant shortage of hay in      southern Ohio (estimated need is 325,000 tons).                                  ____                               memorandum     Re: Latest Estimates of Agriculture losses in 12 State          Drought Region.

Then if you look at the natural or weather-related disaster portion of the emergency bill, there is only $1.2 billion in that, $1.2 billion. And these estimates are pre-hurricane Floyd. As Members have verified these numbers were put in the draft bill before North Carolina happened. So the natural disaster section is woefully inadequate. These are weather-related losses, and the funds are seriously short of what would be needed to assist those faced with disasters this year.  Why should producers in the Northeast and the middle Atlantic States that have had droughts this year not get some attention in this bill, as have producers in Texas who had droughts last year? If you look at the way the formulas work, there is not fair treatment for these States. Had our conference not been suspended, we would have offered amendments that would have attempted to fix these formulas and constructs that give such unequal treatment.  We know what this will mean are more bankruptcies and more loss of equity, which is so unfair. This bill should be targeted at people who are suffering hardship, not just some formula that was cooked up 3 or 4 years ago that does not meet current needs.  I wanted to put this on the Record and beg my colleagues, it would not take us long to go back to subcommittee to try to fix this, to make sure that we meet fairly the current needs of our country, and also help to position ourselves for the long term because of the fundamental inadequacy of Freedom to Farm alone to deal with the volatility that we have experienced with the downturn in the markets and what has happened with our lack of access to overseas markets.  There are longer-term solutions here that we are not being given the opportunity to address in this bill. Please do not do this. Please do not do this. Next year we are going to be back here again with more requests for supplemental credit, as we were this year.  This is not the way to deal with this problem. This is important enough and the gun is at our head, that if the Members of this Congress recommit this bill, we can do it right. Just do not bar us from the opportunity to do that.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
