 President, I rise today to introduce a bill which will clarify certain National Park Service authorities for the Golden GateNational Recreation Area and San Francisco Maritime National Historic Park.  I also want to thank Congresswoman Pelosi for introducing a similar bill in the house. As a San Francisco native and a former mayor, I know these parks are extremely popular tourist sites and I believe this bill will allow the National Park Service to restore and renovate these parks in order to maintain their status as top tourist destinations.  The Golden Gate National Recreation Area is one of the largest urban national parks in the world--home to such renowned sites as the Presidio of San Francisco and Alcatraz Island. Additionally, the San Francisco Maritime National Historic Park, located at the west end of San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf, includes a fleet of landmark vessels and a maritime museum.  Presently, the revenue collected by these parks must be spent in the same fiscal year in which it is collected. Otherwise, any revenue that is not spent is deposited in the National Treasury. This current policy makes it difficult for these two parks to pursue long term, major restoration projects. This bill makes the necessary changes to allow these parks to undertake needed substantive restoration as opposed to smaller, less significant projects allowed under the current revenue system.  The bill also calls for a modest boundary adjustment between the two adjacent parks in order to be consistent with the current administration of San Francisco's Municipal Pier.  I am introducing this bill with the hope that it will allow these two parks to retain the revenue necessary for maintenance in order to continue to attract visitors from around the world to these historic sites of California.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1870       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
