 No longer content to lay all the Nation's problems at the feet of his predecessor, he has taken to creating controversies out of whole cloth. Whether it is a manufactured fight over student loan rates or the so-called war on women, the goal is as clear as you can imagine: get reporters to focus on these things, and maybe the rest of the country will as well; get them to focus on anything other than the President's own failure to turn the economy around, and maybe he can squeak by without folks noticing it. That is the plan at least and, frankly, it could not reflect a more misguided view of the American people.
