Perhaps we will discuss that. Ibelieve that starting at 10 makes sense. I understand we want to use all of the time that is available that day, so I am not suggesting that we change that. It is the time when we start votes, and then I am sure there will be a series of votes at some point in time that evening, as we have every Tuesday when we return at night.  But perhaps we can discuss it a little further after the colloquy, and then perhaps, if there is any change, inform Members of that change.  Regarding the energy bill, under what type of rule would the gentleman expect that to be considered; and how late would the gentleman expect votes to go on Friday? First of all, the energy bill and the kind of rule the gentleman expects on the energy bill.  And I say that to my friend in the context, as the gentleman knows, that the bill was introduced Monday of this week. It is my understanding there were 16 hours of markup yesterday, going until 1 a.m. this morning. So there has been little time, really, to review this bill.  Obviously, there will be over the week, and we will not get back until Thursday, so there will be that time. But can the gentleman tell us what kind of rule he might expect on that bill? I yield to my friend.
