President, Beth from Tribune, KS, is a single mother of a 3-year-old son with significant physical disabilities. Her son's insurance is being canceled. To replace this policy with a similar plan, it is going to cost far more than the $750 monthly premium Beth pays now.  She writes:       How can this be? My little boy needs health insurance. . .      . Now our insurance company is telling us this policy no      longer exists because it doesn't meet the government's      requirements and if we'd like to get another plan it's going      to cost even more for the same child . . .       We didn't change children . . . it's the same child!! This      doesn't make sense. We frequently visit multiple specialists.      We need this insurance. It baffles me as to why this is      happening. It's not rocket science . . . it's healthcare.      ObamaCare is affecting those that need it the most and NOT in      a good way . . . It's very stressful raising a child with      significant needs . . . I'd like to be concentrating on the      health and well-being of my son and not on stressing out over      health insurance.  For Beth and her son, we must repeal this law.  I yield the floor.
