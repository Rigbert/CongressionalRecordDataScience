 President, I would object. What the Senator is asking for is a precondition on a conference committee without the consideration of this whole Senate.  What I have offered to him and to this body in my unanimous consent request is a vote on the motion to instruct conferees, which is what occurs in the Senate if we want to put any precondition onto a budget.  I reject his unanimous consent, and I ask again my unanimous consent request.
