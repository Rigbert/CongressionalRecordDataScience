 President, I thank Chairman Alexander and join him in commending Ms. Bolden for her many years of dedicated and outstanding service to the Government Publishing Office, the Congress, and the American people. I greatly appreciate the sacrifice that Ms. Bolden has made over the past 13 years in assisting the HELP Committee by applying her expertise in editing, printing, and memorializing our important work. We wish her and her family all the best in her well-deserved retirement.  We hope our colleagues will join us in thanking Ms. Bolden for her service.                          ____________________
