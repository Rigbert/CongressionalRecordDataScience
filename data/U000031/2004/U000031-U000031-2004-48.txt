Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to John La Montagne, Ph.D., Deputy Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who died suddenly on November 2, 2004. He was a true public servant who worked tirelessly to improve public health in the United States and across the world. He is sorely missed in the public health community, by Elaine, his beloved wife of 37 years, his family, and the many persons in his community who were blessed to be able to call him friend and know his warmth, compassion for others, humor, and quiet modesty and dignity.  Dr. La Montagne's contributions to the national and international effort against infectiousdiseases are remarkable. Trained as a microbiologist, Dr. La Montagne was a leader in the effort to develop a safer pertussis vaccine and new vaccines against childhood diarrhea and pneumonia. He guided the National Institute on Allergy and Infectious Disease's response to the emerging AIDS crisis and led the effort to respond to severe respiratory syndrome within months of the first outbreak.  Globally, he played a central role in the organization of the Multilateral Initiative on Malaria. He served as a member of the Scientific Advisory Groups of Experts on Vaccines and Biologicals as well as for Vaccines and Immunization for the World Health Organization. He chaired the WHO Task Force on Strategic Planning for the Children's Vaccine Initiative, advised the Pan American Health Organization on its programs in vaccine research implementation, and served as a member of the board of the Global Alliance for Tuberculosis Drug Development.  As an influential contributor to the field of infectious diseases, Dr. La Montagne delivered many major lectures all over the world. He received many prestigious awards for his scientific accomplishments, including the Public Health Service Special Recognition Award for leadership in childhood vaccine research programs, the Surgeon General's Certificate of Appreciation, the Presidential Meritorious Executive Rank Award, the Distinguished Executive Award for his work in the areas of infectious diseases research of global health relevance, the Secretary's Award for Distinguished Service for leadership of acellular pertussis vaccine trials, and most recently the Secretary's Award for Distinguished Service for design and implementation of critically important biodefense strategies.  As Dr. Zerhouni, the Director the National Institutes of Health said, ``Personally, he was a dear friend and one of the finest people I have ever known. Professionally, in an NIH career spanning nearly thirty years, his leadership and commitment to improving global health were remarkable. His generosity, wit, even-handedness and kindness made him a friend to all who knew him. He will be sorely missed.''  On November 2nd, our country and the world lost a great and good man.                          ____________________
