 President, I want to take a few minutes to discuss a provision in the Beneficiary Access to Care and Medicare Equity Act I introduced yesterday with Senator Baucus.  The core of our bill, as the short title indicates, ensures beneficiary access to care and improves equity in Medicare payments. But the bill also makes important other improvements to the Medicare program that go beyond payment policy and beneficiary improvements.  Chief among those is regulatory relief for providers.  Every day, in cities and towns across Iowa, health care providers treat the sick, restore them to health, and work to prevent further illness. Iowa's proportion of older adults in the population exceeds that of the United States as a whole. In fact, we rank second in the Nation in our percentage of persons aged 85 and older.  Simply put, the Medicare program means a great deal to Iowans, not only from a beneficiary perspective but also from a provider perspective. Health care providers in Iowa rely on the Medicare program for much of their business.  I have had extensive conversations with many Iowa health care providers and workers, and a complaint I have heard over and over is that the Medicare program is too bureaucratic. Too much time is spent on paperwork instead of treating patients. Rules coming out of Washington are confusing and contradictory. Doctors and nurses receive one answer to a question from their Medicare contractor and a different answer from Medicare headquarters in Baltimore.  Now, don't get me wrong. My position on the sin of Medicare waste, fraud, and abuse has not changed. As a watchdog of the taxpayer dollar, I firmly believe in asking health care providers to account for the money they receive from the government. Taxpayer dollars must be spent responsibly. However, when honest providersare unable to get straight answers from the government, frustration and inefficiency can result. The outcome is a health care program that is not serving beneficiaries or taxpayers as well as it could. So I am proud that this legislation takes steps to treat some of these bureaucratic ills afflicting Medicare.  Based on provisions in a bill introduced last year by myself and Senator Baucus, along with Senators Murkowski and Kerry, the Beneficiary Access to Care and Medicare Equity Act offers additional appeal rights for providers, mandates enhanced provider education, and ensures that providers receive straight answers from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS.  Importantly, our legislation reforms the way Medicare contracts with the private companies that process and pay claims. Today, CMS is stymied by outdated guidelines that fail to recognize efficiency and quality in contractor performance. Today's system is also not competitive. Our legislation brings competition into the program so that the best available contractors, in terms of quality and efficiency, will serve it. The bill provides incentives for contractors to give timely and accurate information to beneficiaries and providers.  For Medicare contractor reform to succeed, however, contractors need protection from unlimited civil liability in carrying out the payments, provider services, and beneficiary services functions expected of them.  The bill I have just introduced would therefore continue the past policy of limiting the liability of certifying and disbursing officers, and the Medicare administrative contractors for whom those officers serve, with respect to certain payments. In addition, the language contained in Section 621 clarifies that Medicare administrative contractors are not liable for inadvertent billing errors but, as in the past, are liable for all damages resulting from reckless disregard or intent to defraud the United States.  Importantly, the reckless disregard standard is the same as the standard under the False Claims Act, a 150-year-old Federal law that I updated in 1986 and that has had unmatched success in fighting fraud and abuse in Federal programs like Medicare. The False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. Sections 3729-3733, applies to Medicare fiscal intermediaries and carriers under current law and has been used effectively by whistleblowers and the Department of Justice to uncover and penalize fraud against the program by some intermediaries and carriers.  This specially calibrated version of reckless disregard balances the practical need to shelter Medicare administrative contractors from frivolous civil litigation, with the Medicare program's interest in protecting itself from contractor fraud. This legislation makes it clear that the False Claims Act continues, as in the past, to remain available as a remedy for fraud against Medicare by certifying officers, disbursing officers, and Medicare administrative contractors alike and that, among other things, the remedy subjects Medicare contractors to administrative as well as trust fund damages. I am pleased that the Department of Justice and the HHS Office of Inspector General believe this special liability standard serves taxpayers and the Medicare program extremely well.  In closing, let me again say how proud I am that on this issue and on the many other provider and beneficiary policies in this bill, Chairman Baucus and I were able to work together in a balanced, bipartisan fashion. Together, we carefully considered and came to agreement on payment, administration and benefit policies that make sense for Medicare. I urge the Senate Democrat leadership to call up our bill for full consideration in short order before we adjourn next week.                          ____________________
