Speaker, the holiday season 2003 marks the passing of a loved and beloved member of our community of Toledo, Ohio. Rose Kennedy, a mother for our community and a pioneering activist of her North Toledo neighborhood, passed from this life on December 26, 2003 at age 76.  I came to know Rose and her husband Bob nearly three decades ago as she vigorously pursued improvements in her neighborhood, Toledo's oldest. Small in stature, unassuming by nature, she worked on larger-than-life projects side-by-side with community leaders on the revitalization of the heart of our city, starting in North Toledo with beautification initiatives. Most notably, North Toledo's signature effort, the Buckeye Basin Greenbelt Parkway, has Rose's imprimatur. Without Rose Kennedy's personal tireless efforts, this major parkway construction which diverted traffic from North Toledo streets and upgraded the entire region with a linear greenbelt in the heart of our city would not have been realized. She pursued this goal for nearly a quarter century, and proudly stood by as the dream was finally brought to fruition and ribbons cut.  In addition to her community activism, Rose Kennedy, together with her husband Robert, brought a sense of family to eighteen children: four adopted and fourteen fostered. She explained, ``These kids needed love and that was about all we had to give them.''  The oldest of six children, Rosalie Kennedy spent her entire life in her North Toledo neighborhood. After marriage, she and her husband were involved in veterans' organizations-heading up the Toledo chapter of the DAV in the 1950's--in addition to neighborhood groups. She worked with the Northriver Development Corporation and the Economic Opportunity and Planning Association. Civic-minded as well, Rose served for many years as her precinct's Democratic committeewoman. Rounding out her community and civic responsibilities, she also served her faith as Secretary to her church, Salem Lutheran Church.  In spite of her family and community demands, Rose found time to enjoy her hobbies of crochet and crossword puzzles and reading. She was an ordinary woman who accomplished extraordinary feats. To her husband, children, grandchildren and greatgrandchildren, we extend our heartfelt sympathy. Rose Kennedy lived life large, and her actions left a lasting legacy. We will miss her earnest resolve, her unrelenting dedication, and the loving gift she gave of herself.                          ____________________
