HATCH. What I do want to make clear is I believe the distinguished Senator from Illinois and others have been saying that Mr. Estrada did not answer the questions. Let me recall, in case it might have slipped the mind of the distinguished Senator, ``Follow-up Questions for Miguel Estrada, Senator Richard J. Durbin, Senate Judiciary Committee.'' Let me read a few of these.  One:       During your nominations hearing, Senator Edwards asked      whether you consider yourself a ``strict constructionist''      when it comes to interpreting the Constitution. You described      yourself instead as a ``fair constructionist.'' How do you      distinguish these two concepts? In what ways are they      similar? In what ways are they different?  That is an intelligent question. I commend my colleague.
