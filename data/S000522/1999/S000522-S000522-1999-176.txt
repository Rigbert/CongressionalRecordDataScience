Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs for yielding me the time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2280, the Veterans Benefit Improvement Act.  Veterans have sacrificed to defend our Nation and have earned health care and other benefits through their service. They came forward when America needed them. Now Congress must continue to keep its promises to those who served.  H.R. 2280 keeps our promises to veterans by increasing the Cost of Living Adjustment to millions of disabled veterans. It also restores medical, educational, and housing loans to surviving spouses who have remarried.  Consideration of this legislation is timely since it helps to remind us to commemorate the anniversary of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. For 100 years, the VFW has been active not only with veterans programs but also with a host of civic and volunteer activities. During 1997 and 1998, the VFW and the Ladies Auxiliary contributed over 12 million hours of volunteer services and donated nearly $55 million to various community service projects.  I would also like to single out the Heart O' The Hills VFW Post in my district in the Hill Country of Texas. It is one of the oldest and most active in the State. Two weeks ago, it celebrated its 84th anniversary. It is because of the selfless dedication of the veterans in the Hill Country and veterans around the Nation that we enjoy prosperity and freedom today.  Mr. Speaker, our veterans willingly served to defend our Nation. They were there when we needed them, and now we must be there when they need us.
