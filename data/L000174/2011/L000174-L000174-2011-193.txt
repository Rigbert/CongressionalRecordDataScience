President, today I would like to pay tribute to two dedicated public servants in Vermont who passed away tragically in the floods of Hurricane Irene.  Both Michael Garofano Sr. and Michael Garofano Jr. were employees at the Rutland City Water Facility in Rutland, VT, where they served at the interest of their communities until the very end. During the worst hours of Hurricane Irene in Vermont, Michael Sr. and Michael Jr. sought to protect the people of Rutland by inspecting the town's water system infrastructure. In this brave moment, both men unfortunately lost their lives as the waters of Mendon Brook rose to threatening levels. We will always remember them for their everlasting courage, evident by their extreme dedication to protecting their family and beloved community during a crisis.  Michael Sr. joined the Rutland City Water Facility as its manager in 1981. He served zealously, ensuring that the water of Rutland City was safe at all times for those living in the region. He was also a member of the American Water Works Association where he was committed to benefitting not only Vermont, but also the country, in its pursuit of clean water. Michael was highly respected and honored by those who worked under his supervision. He was known as one of the best employees the industry had to offer.  Michael Sr.'s son, Michael Garofano Jr., also had the interest of water quality at heart. As a water operator at the Rutland City Water Facility, he too braved the elements of Hurricane Irene to serve his family and community. As an independently contracted landscaper, Michael's loyalty to his community was widely recognized. At a mere 24 years of age, both his accomplishments and bravery are of honorable praise.  Michael Garofano Sr. and Jr. are survived by wife and mother, Celestine ``Sally''--Sitek--Garofano and son and brother, Thomas Garofano of Rutland, Vermont. My wife Marcelle and I wish to express our deepest condolences to Sally, Thomas, and Michael Sr. and Jr.'s extended family. In the days following the hurricane, many acts of bravery have been displayed throughout our state. All of Vermont can be proud of Michael Sr. and Michael Jr.'s incredible courage and the legacy they both have left behind.  I ask unanimous consent that the obituary for Michael Garofano Sr. and Michael Garofano Jr. from the Rutland Herald be printed in the Record so all may recognize two men whose acts of bravery will not soon be forgotten.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:                          Michael J. Garofano   Published in Rutland Herald from September 2 to September 3, 2011       Michael J. Garofano, 55, of Rutland died Sunday afternoon,      Aug. 28, 2011, with his son Michael, as a tragic result of      Hurricane Irene in Rutland.       He was born in Rutland, Vt., on March 27, 1956, the son of      Patrick and Jacqueline (Roussil) Garofano.       Michael was a graduate of Rutland High School, Class of      1974. He graduated from Vermont Technical College in 1976,      with an Associate Degree in Water Quality.       He was employed as the Water Treatment and Resource Manager      in the Rutland City Department of Public Works since 1981.       He enjoyed his family, especially his three boys. He      enjoyed puttering around the house and fixing things. Mike      had a dry sense of humor and gave everyone a nickname.
