Thank you, my friend, for raising the question.  I must tell you that we cannot make any type of commitment on that. We're working on it, and we will continue to work on it, and we hope to work with you and others in a bipartisan fashion before we act.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. I appreciate you bringing up bipartisanship.  Yesterday was the hundredth day of our new President, and one of our big goals together was to work in a bipartisan way and forge that effort, and as everybody knows in this House, unfortunately that did not take place. And it is regrettable. But Republicans on this side want to make sure that we do forge in a bipartisan matter, and I would like to bring up a few items that we could work together on.  I will tell you--and I was very proud at the very beginning of this session when we, the minority, the Republicans, invited the President to our conference, and we actually had a very good discussion about the stimulus bill. It was unfortunate that a bill was introduced while he was talking to us and was not able to be bipartisan in that nature. But I was wondering about a couple of items that we could work closely together.  Recently, the President came forward and asked his Cabinet to find $100 million in waste and abuse and duplication, and this is a place that I know we can all work together. I know our leadership, Mr. Boehner and Mr. Cantor, personally talked to the President. The President asked us to produce a list.                              {time}  1545  I would ask our good friend from Georgia if the House Democrats would be willing to work with the Republicans to bring something to the floor before this May recess where we could eliminate waste, fraud and duplication and actually save the taxpayers and America. And I yield back.
