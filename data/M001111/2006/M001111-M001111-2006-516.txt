 President, it is unfortunate the Senate just defeated the amendment that would actually add real money to CDBG and allow our communities across the Nation to invest in the critical infrastructure to bring hope and opportunity back.  The amendment we are now going to vote on is a sham, and I refuse to be part of a continuing sham that says to all of us that we are going to have CDBG money. Our recipients deserve a lot more. This amendment is for show, as I quote from the Wall Street Journal of today: `` . . . for show since no money has been added above the cap''--leaving us, next October, November, in the appropriations bill to either fund CDBG or cut transit and Amtrak, which I know is important to many Senators, and many other critical housing programs.  I urge my colleagues to say no and to put a stop to this continuing sham of amendments that do nothing for our communities that deserve a lot better.
