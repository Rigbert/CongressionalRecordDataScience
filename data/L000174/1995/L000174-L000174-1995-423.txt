President, I am pleased to introduce with Senators Kyl and Grassley the ``National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1995'' [NIIPA]. This bill will increase protection for both government and private computers, and the information on those computers, from the growing threat of computer crime.  We increasingly depend on the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of computer systems and information to conduct our business, communicate with our friends and families, and even to be entertained. With a modem and a computer, a business person can communicate with his or her office, a student can access an on-line encyclopedia at home, or researcher can get weather information from Australia over the Internet. Unfortunately, computer criminals can also use this technology to pry into our secrets, steal confidential Government information, and damage important telecommunications systems. With the advances in global communication, these criminals can do this virtually anywhere in the world.  The facts speak for themselves--computer crime is on the rise. The computer emergency and response team at Carnegie-Mellon University reports that, since 1991, there has been a 498 percent increase in the number of computer intrusions, and a 702 percent rise in the number of sites affected. About 40,000 Internet computers were attacked in 2,460 incidents in 1994 alone. We need to increase protection for this vital information infrastructure to stem the online crime epidemic.  The NII Protection Act seeks to improve the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act by providing more protection to computerized information and systems, by designating new computer crimes, and by extending protection to computer systems used in foreign or interstate commerce or communications. The bill closes a number of gaps in our current laws to strengthen law enforcement's hands in fighting crimes targeted at computers, computer systems, and computer information.  First, the bill would bring the protection for classified national defense or foreign relations information maintained on computers in line with our other espionage laws. While existing espionage laws prohibit the theft and peddling of Government secrets to foreign agents, the bill would specifically target those persons who deliberately break into a computer to obtain the Government secrets that they then try to peddle.  Second, the bill would increase protection for the privacy and confidentiality of computer information. Recently, computer hackers have accessed sensitive data regarding Operation Desert Storm, penetrated NASA computers, and broken into Federal courthouse computer systems containing confidential records. Others have abused their privileges on Government computers by snooping through confidential tax returns, or selling confidential criminal history information from the National Crime Information Center.  The bill would criminalize these activities by making all those who misuse computers to obtain Government information and, where appropriate, information held by the private sector, subject to prosecution. The harshest penalties would be reserved for those who obtain classified information that could be used to injur the United States or assist a foreign state. Those who break into a computer system, or insiders who intentionally abuse their computer access privileges, to secret information off a computer system for commercial advantage, private financial gain or to commit any criminal or tortious act would also be subject to felony prosecution. Individuals who intentionally break into, or abuse their authority to use, a computer and thereby obtain information of minimal value, would be subject to a misdemeanor penalty.  Third, the bill would protect against damage to computers caused by either outside hackers or malicious insiders. Computer crime does not just put information is at risk, but also the computer networks themselves. Hackers, or malicious insiders, can destroy crucial information with a carefully placed code or command. Hackers, like Robert Morris, can bring the Internet to its knees with computer ``viruses'' or ``worms.'' This bill would protect our Nation's computer systems from such intentional damage, regardless of whether the perpetrator was an insider or outside hacker.  Under the bill, insiders, who are authorized to access a computer, face criminal liability only if they intend to cause damage to the computer, not for recklessly or negligently causing damage. By contrast, hackers who break into a computer could be punished for any intentional, reckless, or negligent damages they cause by their trespass.  Fourth, the bill would expand the protection of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to cover those computers used in interstate or foreign commerce or communications. The law already gives special protection to the computer systems of financial institutions and consumer reporting agencies, because of their significance to the economy of our Nation and the privacy of our citizens. Yet, increasingly computer systems provide the vital backbone to many other industries, such as the telecommunications network.  Current law falls short of protecting this infrastructure. Generally, hacker intrusions that do not cross State lines are not Federal offenses. The NII Protection Act would change that limitation and extend Federal protection to computers or computer systems used in interstate or foreign commerce or communications.  Fifth, this bill addresses a new and emerging problem of computer-age blackmail. In a recent case, an individual threatened to crash a computer system unless he was granted access to the system and given an account. The bill adds a new provision to the law that would ensure law enforcement's ability to prosecute these modern day blackmailers, who threaten to harm or shut down computer networks unless their extortionate demands are met.  Finally, the statutory scheme provided in this bill will provide a better understanding of the computer crime problem. By consolidating computer crimes in one section of title 18, reliable crime statistics can be generated. Moreover, by centralizing computer crimes under one statute, we may better measure existing harms, anticipate trends, and determine the need for legislative reform. Additionally, as new computer technologies are introduced, and new computer crimes follow, reformers need only look to section 1030 to update our criminal laws, without parsing through the entire United States Code.  The Kyl-Leahy NII Protection Act would provide much needed protection for our Nation's important information infrastructure. It will help ensure the confidentiality of sensitive information and protect computer networks from those who would seek to damage these networks.  I commend the Department of Justice for their diligent work on this bill, and their continued assistance in addressing this critical area of our criminal law. I look forward to working with my colleagues on refining and improving this bill, as necessary.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1995--Section-by-                            Section Analysis       The National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of      1995 amends the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C.      Sec. 1030, to increase protection for the confidentiality,      integrity and security of computer systems and the      information on such systems.       Sec. 1. Short Title. The Act may be cited as the ``National      Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1995.''       Sec. 2. Computer Crime. (1) The bill amends five of the      prohibited acts in, and adds a new prohibited act to, 18      U.S.C. Sec. 1030(a).       (A) Subsection 1030(a)(1)--Protection of Classified      Government Information.       The bill amends 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1030(a)(1) to increase      protection for computerized classified data. The statute      currently provides that anyone who knowingly accesses a      computer without, or in excess of, authorization and obtains      classified information ``with the intent or reason to believe      that such information so obtained is to be used to the injury      of the United States, or to the advantage of any foreign      nation'' is subject to a fine or a maximum of ten years'      imprisonment. The amendment would modify the scienter      requirement to conform to the knowledge requirement in 18      U.S.C. Sec. 793(e), which provides a maximum penalty of ten      years' imprisonment for obtaining from any source information      connected with the national defense. Unlike Sec. 793(e),      however, Sec. 1030(a)(1) would require proof that the      individual knowingly used a computer without, or in excess      of, authority in obtaining the classified information.       As amended, Sec. 1030(a)(1) would prohibit anyone from      knowingly accessing a computer, without, or in excess of,      authorization, and obtaining classified national defense,      foreign relations information, or restricted data under the      Atomic Energy Act, with reason to believe the information      could be used to the injury of the United States or the      advantage of a foreign country, and willfully communicating,      delivering or transmitting, or causing the same, or willfully      retaining the information and failing to deliver it      to the appropriate government agent. The amendment specifically covers      the conduct of a person who deliberately breaks into a      computer without authority, or an insider who exceeds      authorized access, and thereby obtains classified information      and then communicates the information to another person, or      retains it without delivering it to the proper authorities.       (B) Subsection 1030(a)(2)--Protection of Financial,      Government and Other Computer Information.       The bill amends 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1030(a)(2) to further      protect the confidentiality of computer data by extending the      protection for computerized financial records in current law      to protecting information from any department and agency of      the United States and on computers subject to unauthorized      access involving interstate or foreign communications.       This amendment is designed to protect against the      interstate or foreign theft of information by computer. This      provision is necessary in light of United States v. Brown,      925 F.2d 1301, 1308 (10th Cir. 1991), where the court held      that purely intangible intellectual property, such as      computer programs, cannot constitute goods, wares,      merchandise, securities, or monies which have been stolen,      converted, or taken within the meaning of 18 U.S.C.      Sec. 2314.       The seriousness of a breach in confidentiality depends on      the value of the information taken or on what is planned for      the information after it is obtained. The statutory penalties      are structured to reflect these considerations. Specifically,      first-time offenses for obtaining, without or in excess of      authorization, information of minimal value from government      or protected computers is a misdemeanor. The crime becomes a      felony, subject to a fine and up to five years' imprisonment,      if the offense was committed for purposes of commercial      advantage or private financial gain, for the purpose of      committing any criminal or tortious act in violation of the      Constitution or laws of the United States or of any State, or      if the value of the information obtained exceeds $5,000.       (C) Subsection 1030(a)(3)--Protection for Government      Computer Systems.       The bill would make two changes to Sec. 1030(a)(3), which      currently prohibits intentionally accessing, without      authorization, computers used by or for any department or      agency of the United States and thereby ``adversely''      affecting ``the use of the Government's operation of such      computer.'' First, the amendment would delete the word      ``adversely'' since this term suggests, inappropriately, that      trespassing in a government computer may be benign. Second,      the amendment would replace the phrase ``the use of the      Government's operation of such computer'' with the term      ``that use by or for the Government.'' When a computer is      used for the government, the government is not necessarily      the operator, and the old phrase may lead to confusion. The      amendment would make a similar change to the definition of      ``protected computer'' in Sec. 1030(e)(2)(A).       (D) Subsection 1030(a)(4)--Increased Penalties for      Significant Unauthorized Use of Computers.       The bill amends 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1030(a)(4) to insure that      felony level sanctions apply when the fraudulent use of a      computer without, or in excess of, authority is significant.      The current statute penalizes, with fines and up to five      years' imprisonment, knowingly and with intent to defraud,      accessing a computer without, or in excess of, authorization      to further the fraud or obtain anything of value, unless the      object of the fraud and the thing obtained is only the use of      the computer. The blanket exception for computer use is too      broad since trespassing in a computer and using computer time      may cause large expense to the victim. Hackers, for example,      have broken into Cray supercomputers for the purpose of      running password cracking programs, sometimes amassing      computer      time worth far more than $5,000. The amendment would      restrict the exception for trespassing, in which only      computer use is obtained, to cases involving less than      $5,000 during any one-year period.       (E) Subsection 1030(a)(5)--Protection from Damage to      Computers.       The bill amends 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1030(a)(5) to further      protect computers and computer systems covered by the statute      from damage both by outsiders, who gain access to a computer      without authorization, and by insiders, who intentionally      damage a computer. Subsection 1030(a)(5)(A) of the bill would      penalize with a fine and up to five years' imprisonment      anyone who knowingly causes the transmission of a program,      information, code or command and intentionally causes damage      without authorization to a protected computer. This would      cover anyone who intentionally damages a computer, regardless      of whether they were authorized to access the computer.       Subsection 1030(a)(5)(B) of the bill would penalize with a      fine and up to five years' imprisonment anyone who      intentionally accesses a protected computer without      authorization and, as a result of that trespass, recklessly      causes damage.       Finally, subsection 1030(a)(5)(C) of the bill would impose      a misdemeanor penalty of a fine and no more than one year      imprisonment for intentionally accessing a protected computer      without authorization and, as a result of that trespass,      causing damage.       The bill would punish anyone who knowingly invades a      computer system without authority and causes significant      losses to the victim, even when the damage caused is not      intentional. In such cases, it is the intentional act of      computer trespass that makes the conduct criminal. Otherwise,      hackers could break into computers or computer systems, safe      in the knowledge that no matter how much damage they cause,      it is no crime unless the damage was intentional or reckless.      By contrast, persons who are authorized to access the      computer are criminally liable only if they intend to cause      damage to the computer without authority, not for recklessly      or negligently causing damage.       As discussed more fully below, the bill adds a definition      of ``damage'' to encompass significant financial loss of more      than $5,000 during any one year period, potential impact on      medical treatment, physical injury to any person, and threats      to public health and safety.       (F) Subsection 1030(a)(7)--Protection from Threats Directed      Against Computers.       The bill adds a new section to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1030(a) to      provide penalties for the interstate transmission of threats      directed against computers and computer systems. It is not      clear that such threats would be covered under existing laws,      such as the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1951 (interference with      commerce by extortion), or      18 U.S.C. Sec. 875(d) (interstate communication of threat to      injure the property of another). The ``property''      protected under these statutes does not clearly include      the operation of a computer, the data or programs stored      in a computer or its peripheral equipment, or the decoding      keys to encrypted data.       The new subsection (a)(7) covers any interstate or      international transmission of threats against computers,      computer systems, and their data and programs, whether the      threat is received by mail, telephone, electronic mail, or      through a computerized messaging service. Unlawful threats      could include interference in any way with the normal      operation of the computer or system in question, such as      denying access to authorized users, erasing or corrupting      data or programs, slowing down the operation of the computer      or system, or encrypting data and then demanding money for      the key.       (2) Subsection 1030(c)--Increased Penalties for Recidivists      and Other Sentencing Changes. The bill amends 18 U.S.C.      1030(c) to increase penalties for those who have previously      violated any subsection of Sec. 1030. The current statute      subjects recidivists to enhanced penalties only if they      violated the same subsection twice. For example, a person who      violates the current statute by committing fraud by computer      under Sec. 1030(a)(4) and later commits another computer      crime offense by intentionally destroying medical records      under Sec. 1030(a)(5), is not treated as a recidivist because      his conduct violated two separate subsections of Sec. 1030.      The amendment would provide that anyone who is convicted      twice of committing a computer offense under Sec. 1030 would      be subjected to enhanced penalties.       The penalty provisions in Sec. 1030(c) are also changed to      reflect modifications to the prohibited acts, as discussed      above.       (3) Subsection 1030(d)--Jurisdiction of Secret Service. The      bill amends 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1030(d) to grant the United States      Secret Service authority to investigate offenses only under      subsections (a)(2) (A) and (B), (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(5) and      (a)(6). The current statute grants the Secret Service      authority to investigate any offense under Sec. 1030, subject      to agreement between the Attorney General and the Secretary      of the Treasury. The new crimes proposed in the bill,      however, do not fall under the Secret Service's traditional      jurisdiction. Specifically, proposed Sec. 1030(a)(2)(C)      addresses gaps in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2314 (interstate      transportation of stolen property), and proposed      Sec. 1030(a)(7) addresses gaps in 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1951      (the Hobbs Act) and 875 (interstate threats). These statutes      are within the jurisdiction of the FBI, which should retain      exclusive jurisdiction over these types of offenses, even      when they are committed by computer.       (4) Subsection 1030(e)--Definitions. The bill contains      three new definitions for ``protected computer,'' ``damage,''      and ``government entity.''       The term ``protected computer'' would replace the term      ``federal interest computer'' used currently in Sec. 1030.      The new definition of ``protected computer'' would slightly      modify the current description in Sec. 1030(e)(2)(A) of      computers used by financial institutions or the United States      Government, to make it clear that if the computers are not      exclusively used by those entities, the computers are      protected if the offending conduct affects the use by or for      a financial institution or the Government.       The new definition of ``protected computer'' would also      replace the current description in Sec. 1030(e)(2)(B) of a      covered computer being ``one of two or more computers used in      committing the offense, not all of which are located in the      same State.'' Instead, ``protected computer'' would include      computers ``in interstate or foreign commerce or      communication.'' Thus, hackers who attack computers in their      own State would be subject to this law, if the requisite      damage threshold is met and the computer is used in      interstate commerce or foreign commerce or communications.       The tern ``damage,'' as used in new Sec. 1030(a)(5), would      mean any impairment to the integrity or availability of data,      information, program or system which (A) causes loss of more      than $5,000 during any one-year period; (B) modifies or      impairs the medical examination, diagnosis or treatment of a      person; (C) causes physical injury to any person; or (D) threatens the      public health or safety. Computers are increasingly being      used for access to critical services, such as emergency      response systems and air traffic control. ``Damage'' is      therefore broadly defined to encompass the types of harms      against which people should be protected from any computer      hacker or those insiders who intentionally cause harm.       The term ``government entity,'' as used in new      Sec. 1030(a)(7), would be defined to include the United      States government, any State or political subdivision      thereof, any foreign country, and any state, provincial,      municipal or other political subdivision of a foreign      country.       (5) Subsection 1030(g)--Civil Actions. The bill amends the      civil penalty provision in Sec. 1030(g) to reflect the      proposed changes in Sec. 1030(a)(5). The 1994 amendments to      the Act authorized victims of certain computer abuse to      maintain civil actions against violators to obtain      compensatory damages, injunctive relief, or other equitable      relief, with damages limited to economic damages, unless the      violator modified or impaired the medical examination,      diagnosis or treatment of a person.       Under the bill, damages recoverable in civil actions would      be limited to economic losses for violations causing losses      of $5,000 or more during any one-year period. No limit on      damages would be imposed for violations that modified or      impaired the medical examination, diagnosis or treatment of a      person; caused physical injury to any person; or threatened      the public health or safety.                                 ______      By
