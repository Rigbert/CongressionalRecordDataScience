Since 1982, Charlie has served as a member of the Indiana General Assembly. For his dedication and countless efforts toward improving the lives of Indiana residents, Charlie will be honored at a reception hosted by the Lake County Medical Society on Wednesday, October 24, 2007, at the Avalon Manor in Merrillville, IN.  Charlie Brown grew up in Philadelphia, PA. Following the completion of his undergraduate studies at Cheyney State Teachers' College in Cheyney, PA, Charlie relocated to Gary, IN, where he began his lifelong career in public service. After serving as an educator in the Gary Community School Corporation from 1961 to 1968, Charlie took on several new roles within his community. From 1968 to 1988, Charlie served in many capacities in the City of Gary, including: Youth Coordinator, Mayor's Assistant on Youth Activities, Director of the Youth Services Bureau, Affirmative Action Officer and Risk Manager.  In 1988, following many years of service as a public official, Charlie went on to utilize his vast experience and knowledge of health care-related issues by accepting the position of Chief Executive Officer of the Gary Community Mental Health Center. Charlie served in this capacity until 1993. Currently, Charlie serves as a consultant, where he provides guidance to organizations seeking to foster positive interaction between the government and the community.  Though Charlie has always put people first in every position he has held, it is through his efforts as an elected official that he has made an indelible mark on the progress and future in Indiana. First elected to the Indiana General Assembly as a member of the Indiana House of Representatives in 1982, Charlie has always been a true champion of improving health care in Indiana for all residents. As a member of the Indiana State House, Charlie has served on several committees, most notably, the Standing Committee on Public Health. As both a member and Chairman of this crucial committee, Charlie has fought tirelessly to improve health care in Indiana. When it comes to health care, Charlie has always had one goal in mind: To provide affordable, accessible, and high-quality health care for all Indiana citizens.  Throughout his illustrious career, Charlie has been recognized with many distinguished awards by numerous organizations. To name a few, Charlie has received accolades from: the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education, Indiana University Northwest, the Alzheimer's Association of Indiana, the Indiana Council of Community Mental Heath Centers, the Mental Health Association of Indiana, the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), the Indiana Optometric Association, the Indiana Black Expo, the Calumet Council of the Boy Scouts of America, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).  Though Charlie has received many esteemed honors for his commitment to the residents of Indiana, Charlie's greatest source of pride is his family. Charlie and his wife, Angela Baker Brown, are the proud parents of one daughter, Charlisa L. Scott, and two adoring grandsons, Landon Charles Douglas Scott and Cole Nathaniel Scott.  Madam Speaker, I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring State Representative Charlie Brown for his outstanding devotion to his community and to the people of Indiana. His unselfish and lifelong dedication to improving health care for Indiana residents is worthy of the highest commendation. Charlie's selflessness and his commitment to improving lives throughout Indiana serves as an inspiration to us all, and I am proud to call him my friend.                          ____________________
