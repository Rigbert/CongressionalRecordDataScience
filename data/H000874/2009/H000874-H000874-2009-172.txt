 Mr. McCARTHY of California. Well, I thank the gentleman.  Knowing that we heard the President last night, and we're all coming off from an August recess where we watched America wake up and really pay attention to what is going on here in Congress and voice their opinion when it comes to health care, and having watched that and having my own townhall meetings, watching other Members' townhall meetings throughout the country and some of the questions raised, I listened to the President last night talk about ideas and a public plan, and others--the gentleman yourself had talked during your townhalls--and some leadership said the public plan has to be in the plan or a bill will not go through. I know the gentleman from Maryland said it doesn't have to be exactly a public plan in there. =========================== NOTE ===========================     September 10, 2009 on Page H9411 the following appeared: Another gentleman from Maryland said it doesn't have to be exactly a public plan in there.    The online version should be corrected to read: I know the gentleman from Maryland said it doesn't have to be exactly a public plan in there. ========================= END NOTE =========================                               {time}  1230  Does the Democratic leadership position include a government option or exactly a public plan or a trigger?  I yield to the gentleman.
