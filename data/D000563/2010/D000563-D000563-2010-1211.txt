President, the amendment being offered by the Senator from Oklahoma affects the legislative branch. It is true it affects Members of Congress in their offices, but it affects much more. We just had an overwhelming vote to give new responsibilities to the Government Accountability Office. The next amendment up calls for cutting their budget. I would say to the Senator from Oklahoma, you can't have it both ways. You give new responsibilities to these agencies and then say: We will give you less money to do it.  Let me suggest something else. When you start to leave this evening to go home and you drive by the gate out here and you see, in the dark, men and women in uniform risking their lives for us and for the visitors to the Capitol, remember this vote. This vote cuts funds for the Capitol Police and security in the Capitol. When the Senator from Oklahoma was asked earlier, are you asking for too much in cuts, he said: I want to keep cutting until they squeal. What will be the squeal we hear when it comes to security from the Capitol? I am sorry to say it might be an incident that none of us wants to see.  We want this to be a safe place. The Capitol Visitor Center has more and more people coming in. Cutting security for the Capitol at this point in time with the threats facing our Nation and the fact that we work in one of the biggest targets in America is very shortsighted. That is what happens when you cut across the board and you don't take a look at the individual agencies involved. Please, for the security of the Capitol and for the security of the people who visit it, vote no on this amendment.
