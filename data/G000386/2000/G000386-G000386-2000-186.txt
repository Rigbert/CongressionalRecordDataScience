 President, I am pleased to be joining my colleague, Senator Graham, to cosponsor the Ecstasy Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000. This legislation is vital for the safety of our children and our nation. Around the country, Ecstasy use is exploding at an alarming rate from our big cities to our rural neighborhoods. According to Customs officials, Ecstasy is spreading faster than any drug since crack cocaine. This explosion of Ecstasy smuggling has prompted Customs to create a special task force, that focuses exclusively on the designer drug.  Along with my colleague Senator Graham, I believe it is important that we act to stop the spread of this drug. I join with Senator Graham in urging our colleagues to support the Ecstasy Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000, and pass this measure quickly. By enacting this important bill, we will get drug dealers out of the lives of our young people and alert the public to the dangers of Ecstasy.
