 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:45 a.m. on tomorrow, Tuesday, February 1. I further ask that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved, and that there then be a period for the transaction of morning business until 10:45 a.m., with the time equally divided, with the first half of the time under the control of the Democratic leader or his designee and the final half under the control of the majority leader or his designee; provided that following morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the nomination of Alberto Gonzales to be Attorney General.  I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. for the weekly party luncheons.
