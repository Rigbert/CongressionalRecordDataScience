Speaker, at a time when crime concerns are on every citizen's mind, those who have dedicated their lives to law enforcement are to be commended. I would like to make a special commendation to Chief Len Smith, a devoted law enforcement officer from Indiana's First Congressional District. Chief Smith will be retiring on June 1, 2003, after having served the people of Porter for 34 years. Chief Smith will be honored by his family, friends, and members of the Porter Police Department at an open house on Sunday, May 25, 2003 at the Porter Community Building.  Len Smith, a native of Porter County and a resident of the Town of Porter for 42 years, has always been a man of compassion. He began his adult life by serving in the United States Army from 1966-1968. Upon his return to Northwest Indiana, Chief Smith thought that he would be a school teacher, having degrees in both biology and anthropology. He began police work because it afforded him the opportunity to work afternoons and midnights, allowing him to spend quality time with his family.  Smith's distinguished career in law enforcement has made his community and nation a better place in which to live and work. His outstanding motivational skills and unmatched charisma helped mold him into a natural leader. For more than 34 years, Len Smith has worked for the Porter Police Department and he has served as the town's police chief from 1974 to 1993 and from 1996 to the present. In 1993, when a former Town Council appointed a new chief from outside the town, over 200 people packed the Porter municipal building tosupport Smith. The next Town Council immediately reinstated the popular Smith.  During his tenure with the Department, Chief Smith has demonstrated a sincere love for the community in which he lives. While on the force, Smith was presented with the American Legion Life Saving Award for saving two men from drowning. While Chief Smith has dedicated considerable time and energy to his work with the Porter Police Department and protecting the lives of others, he has never limited the time he gives to his most important interest, his family. He and his wife Diana have two children, Todd and Molly.  On this special day, I offer my heartfelt congratulations to Chief Smith. His large circle of family and friends can be proud of the contributions this prominent individual has made to the law enforcement community and the First Congressional District. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending Chief Smith for his lifetime of service and dedication to the people of Northwest Indiana and the citizens of the United States. He worked hard to make the Town of Porter a safer place in which to live and work. I sincerely wish him a long, happy, healthy, and productive retirement.                          ____________________
