 President, later this afternoon I will be meeting with Malcolm Turnbull, the Prime Minister of one of our closest allies, Australia. Our alliance with Canberra is an important one, and our countries share many fundamental values. I am looking forward to meeting the Prime Minister.                          ____________________
