 Maybe there is a possibility of getting some kind of time agreement on an amendment for tomorrow so we can get into the debate.  I agree with the Senator from Arizona; I don't think there is any need for opening statements tonight. I am not planning on making one, but we desire to get started because we have a lot of Senators on both sides of the aisle desiring to offer amendments.
