Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to recognize and pay tribute to two distinguished individuals who have dedicated their lives to protecting Rhode Islanders against crime and violence.  Today, Detectives Frank DellaVentura and Freddy Rocha of the Police Department in Providence, RI, will receive Top Cops Awards for their outstanding service in protecting our Nation's communities. The Top Cops Award is the only national award for officers nominated by their peers in law enforcement.  Across our country, drug abuse is a root cause of the crime and violence that plague our neighborhoods. In recent years, we have made important strides to stop drug-related crime. Law enforcement has been a vital part of this effort, and Detectives Rocha and DellaVentura have been instrumental in this fight.  For example, in 1994, Detective Rocha went undercover to investigate a group of criminals who were identifying themselves as law enforcement agents and stealing drugs and money from drug dealers. Risking his life by posing as a major cocaine dealer, Detective Rocha gathered evidence against this group, which was also linked to organized crime. Winning the group's confidence, he arranged a meeting at which its members expected to receive drugs and money, but instead were apprehended by the Providence SWAT team. The criminals are now serving prison sentences.  Detective DellaVentura has also played a critical role in Rhode Island's fight against drugs. He organized several of the undercover operations in which Detective Rocha has served. In addition, Detective DellaVentura's detailed research, careful surveillance, and thorough knowledge of the requirements of federal law have been essential to these operations' success.  The work of Detectives DellaVentura and Rocha has been nothing short of exceptional. I respectfully ask my colleagues to join me in saluting these Top Cops for their efforts to make the streets of Rhode Island safer for law-abiding citizens.                          ____________________
