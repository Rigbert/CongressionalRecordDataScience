President, in 2001, at the President's urging, Congress passed the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act, which provided $1.35 trillion in tax cuts over 10 years. While I have consistently voted to reduce the tax burden of working families, I voted against the President's tax cut because it left too few resources for debt reduction and came at the expense of reforming Medicare and Social Security, providing a prescription drug benefit, and supporting critical investments like education, the environment, and national defense. A year later, the economic evidence indicates that the President's 2001 tax breaks have had little positive effect on the economy.
