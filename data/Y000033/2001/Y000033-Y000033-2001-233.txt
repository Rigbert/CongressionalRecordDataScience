Good. Now what I want to make sure is that because we do not have any information, as the gentleman from New York (Mr. LaFalce) pointed out, as we had in the Chrysler loan guarantees or the New York loan guarantees, we do not have any information like that. So we do not know where we are. We quickly believe that this is going to cost about $15 billion. We used to have a little bit of information before we commit ourselves to $15 billion.  So what I am asking for, and I believe the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) asked a similar question, I want a commitment from my friend, the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young) and my friend, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) that the language, if you ever come back from conference, that that language will be protected to guarantee that none of this money will come out of the supplemental that we passed today for the recovery from the terrible terrorist activities.  Mr. Speaker, I want a commitment on the gentleman's part, and we will not object if we can get that commitment, that the gentleman will not present a conference report here that will allow that money to come from the supplemental; that it would not, in fact, be subject to a subsequent appropriations action.
