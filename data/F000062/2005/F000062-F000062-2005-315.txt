 President, I have been listening to the debate upstairs on television. I thought I might come down and indicate the reasons I am going to vote for this Central American Free Trade Agreement.  This agreement has sparked a great deal of debate about our trade agenda,the effects of trade agreements on labor rights and the environment, and the impact of increased imports on sensitive domestic industries. I understand the concerns of my colleagues, including members of my own party, who do not support this agreement.  For me, I have always approached these agreements on a case-by-case basis. I have supported some, and I have opposed others. For example, I opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Singapore-Chile Free Trade Agreement. I opposed NAFTA because of the concerns about the impact of jobs and the environment, and I opposed the Chile-Singapore Free Trade Agreement because of the inclusion of immigration provisions.  But in my view, this is an important opportunity for this Congress to go on record in support of economic growth and political stability in these countries and new markets and opportunities for our manufacturers and farmers.  Bottom line, this agreement provides immediate benefits for American exports. It balances an uneven trading relationship. Some have said this, but I do not think it has sunk in: approximately 80 percent of goods manufactured in these countries and 99 percent of their agricultural products already enter the United States duty free. But America's exports into these countries face stiff tariffs on a number of key products. Let me give some examples.  Wood products have an average tariff of 10 percent; motor vehicles and parts, an average of 11.1 percent; vegetables, fruits, and nuts, an average of 16.7 percent--that is today--dairy products, an average of 19.5 percent and up to 60 percent in some cases. In some cases, to send dairy products into these countries, they face a tariff of 60 percent; grains, an average tariff of 10.6 percent; beef, up to 30 percent; rice, up to 60 percent; and wine is as high as 35 percent.  Upon enactment of this agreement, 80 percent of U.S. industrial exports will enter the CAFTA countries duty free, with the remaining tariffs eliminated over 10 years. That is good for us. That is good for our workers because in these industries it will produce more jobs. Fifty percent of agricultural exports become duty free immediately, with remaining tariffs eliminated over 15 and 20 years.  A World Bank and University of Michigan study estimates that with the agreement, U.S. income will rise by $17 billion and the income of CAFTA countries by $5 billion. I think that is substantial. According to the American Farm Bureau, CAFTA would increase U.S. agricultural exports by $1.5 billion annually.  Now let me just talk about my own State of California. It has often been said we are the fifth largest economic engine on Earth. We have a $1.4 trillion economy. We are a leader in U.S. and global markets, with products ranging from high tech to agriculture. Our workers, our farmers, and our businesses need access to new and expanding markets to sustain that leadership position.  In 2004, my State exports to the CAFTA countries totaled $660 million. That was the sixth largest of the 50 States. Manufactured goods accounted for 89 percent of the total, including computers and electronic equipment, fabric mill products, and coal products.  CAFTA will provide significant opportunities for several California export industries. Let me go over them. Let us take dairy, for example. California's producers represent a $4 billion dairy industry. We know it is the largest in the Nation. Their exports face duties as high as 60 percent today. Each country in this agreement establishes tariff rate quotas for certain dairy products totaling 10,000 metric tons across the six CAFTA countries. Access will increase by 5 percent a year for the Central American countries and 10 percent a year for the Dominican Republic, and all duties will be eliminated over 20 years.  Beef: Current duties on beef are as high as 30 percent. Duties on prime and choice cuts will be eliminated immediately in the Central American countries. Duties on other beef products will be phased out over 5 to 10 years.  Wine: Current duties on American wine are as high as 35 percent. Duties on standard size U.S. bottled wine will be eliminated immediately. All others will be phased out over 15 years.  Rice: Currently, U.S. rice exports face tariffs of up to 60 percent. Under the agreement, each country will establish a tariff rate quota for milled rice and rough rice, except for the Dominican Republic, which will have a tariff rate quota for brown rice. In the first year, 400,000 metric tons will be imported duty free, growing as the tariff is eventually eliminated.  Fruits: Duties of up to 20 percent on U.S. grapes, raisins, fresh and canned peaches, and fresh and canned pears will be eliminated immediately upon enactment of the agreement.  Tree nuts: Duties of up to 20 percent on U.S. walnuts, almonds, and pistachios will be eliminated immediately upon enactment of the agreement.  Services: The agreement provides broad market access and regulatory transparency for telecommunications, insurance, financial services, distribution services, computer and business technology services, and tourism, among others. U.S. financial service suppliers will have full rights to establish subsidiaries, joint ventures or branches for banks and insurance companies.  High tech: The agreement eliminates distribution barriers for information technology products. It requires countries to eliminate information technology tariffs by signing the World Trade Organization Information Technology Agreement, and it opens up information technology services. All exports of products covered by the Information Technology Agreement, including computer equipment and communications equipment, will receive immediate duty-free treatment.  Entertainment: California is a big entertainment State, and this is very important. The agreement provides for increased market access for U.S. films and television programs through cable, satellite, and the Internet. Currently, movies face tariffs ranging from 5 to 20 percent. Compact discs and DVDs face tariffs of up to 10 percent. The agreement provides for zero tariffs on movies, music, consumer products, software, books and magazines, and nondiscriminatory treatment for digital products such as U.S. software, music, text, and videos. It also includes protections for U.S. trademarks, copyrighted works, patents, trade secrets, and penalties for piracy and counterfeiting. As a matter of fact, Peter Chernin, the CEO and president of the Fox Group, said this: This agreement sets a template for what agreements should look like.  Textiles: Apparel from garment factories in Central America supporting 400,000 jobs will be duty free and quota free in the United States if they contain U.S. fabric and yarn, thus benefiting U.S. fabric and yarn exports. The CAFTA countries are the largest market for U.S. apparel and yarn exports. That is $2.2 billion in 2003. Tariffs on U.S. textile exports are currently 18 percent, and they will be eliminated immediately upon enactment of the agreement.  Now, these are all win-win-win for my State and I believe for the United States. Perhaps because of the NAFTA agreement, which was a very different agreement, people look at this agreement as they looked at NAFTA. In fact, CAFTA countries now export most of their products into the United States at no tariff, and most of our products face tariffs which would either be eliminated immediately or eliminated over a period of time under CAFTA.  So I do not think it should come as any surprise that there is very wide support among California businesses, farmers, and agricultural organizations: the Farm Bureau, the Wine Institute, the United Dairymen, the Rice Commission, the Cattlemen's Association, the Pork Producers, the Table Grape Commission. In high tech, virtually every company: Cisco, Intel, National Semiconductor, Apple, Oracle, Hewlett-Packard, Qualcomm, IBM, Kodak, and the Telecommunications Industry of America. This is opening markets for our products. Entertainment: the Motion Picture Association of America, the Recording Industry of America, the Independent Film and Television Alliance, and the Entertainment Software Association.  As the New York Times stated in an editorial:       Denying poor people in Central America the benefits of      better access to the American market is certainly not the way      to lift them out of poverty.  That is the flip side of this, that by creating an agreement that reduces these tariffs on American products, a more competitive and higher quality marketplace is produced for citizens of these countries, and that is not bad.  Denying these countries access to the U.S. market is certainly not the way to reward them for advances made in the area of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. Twenty years ago, these countries were marred by constant warfare, human rights abuses, poverty, and political instability. Since then, they have all made enormous strides, and passage of CAFTA will not only promote economic development and rising standards of living by allowing their products to compete in the U.S. market, it will also lock in economic reforms, respect for the rule of law, and solidify democratic institutions. Each country now has a democratically elected leader, and I think we should reward those allies and not turn our backs on them.  I ask unanimous consent to have a letter from former President Jimmy Carter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                     June 8, 2005.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       To Senator Charles Grassley: As you prepare for your      initial consideration of the Central American Free Trade      Agreement (CAFTA) with the nations of Central America and the      Dominican Republic, I want to express my strong support for      this progressive move. From a trade perspective, this will      he1p both the United States and Central America.       Some 80 percent of Central America's exports to the U.S.      are already duty free, so they will be opening their markets      to U.S. exports more than we will for their remaining      products. Independent studies indicate that U.S. incomes will      rise by over $15 billion and those in Central America by some      $5 billion. New jobs will be created in Central America, and      labor standards are likely to improve as a result of CAFTA.       Some improvements could be made in the trade bill,      particularly on the labor protection side, but, more      importantly, our own national security and hemispheric      influence will be enhanced with improved stability,      democracy, and development in our poor, fragile neighbors in      Central America and the Caribbean. During my presidency and      now at The Carter Center, I have been dedicated to the      promotion of democracy and stability in the region. From the      negotiation of the Panama Canal Treaties and the championing      of human rights at a time when the region suffered under      military dictatorships to the monitoring of a number of free      elections in the region, Central America has been a major      focus of my attention.       There now are democratically elected governments in each of      the countries covered by CAFTA. In negotiating this      agreement, the presidents of each of the six nations had to      contend with their own companies that fear competition with      U.S. firms. They have put their credibility on the line, not      only with this trade agreement but more broadly by promoting      market reforms that have been urged for decades by U.S.      presidents of both parties. If the U.S. Congress were to turn      its back on CAFTA, it would undercut these fragile      democracies, compel them to retreat to protectionism, and      make it harder for them to cooperate with the U.S.       For the first time ever, we have a chance to reinforce      democracies in the region. This is the moment to move forward      and to help those leaders that want to modernize and humanize      their countries. Moreover, strong economies in the region are      the best antidote to illegal immigration from the region.       I appreciate your consideration of my views and hope they      will be helpful in your important deliberations.           Sincerely,                                                     Jimmy Carter.
