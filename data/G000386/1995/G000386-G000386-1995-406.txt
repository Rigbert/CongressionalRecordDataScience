 President, today I am introducing a bill that I have entitled ``The Welfare To Work and Strong Families Act of 1995.'' This is a bill that we can classify as dramatic welfare reform.  I look forward to working with the leaders of the House and the Senate, as we have already been working with the State Governors to arrive at a consensus in developing a new and hopefully very effective welfare system. I am pleased to be joining my colleagues in this effort to dramatically change the welfare system as we know it through the introduction of this bill.  This reform proposal would fundamentally alter the way that we administer welfare. At least fundamentally from the way we have administered over the last half century. It would move the decision makingprocess closer to those who can best address the needs and concerns of our citizens, the States, their Governors, and State legislatures. There are not many issues that all my colleagues agree upon, particularly on both sides of the aisle. But there appears to be agreement on the fact that the current welfare system is a dismal failure. That goes back to statements that the President made in his State of the Union message 12 months ago, including what both Republicans and Democrats, in both Houses of Congress, have said.  The current system has contributed toward the breakdown of the family, destroyed independence and self-reliance, and it has discouraged work and productivity by the people of this country who are on welfare. The system simply does not serve the needs of welfare recipients. It does not serve the needs of those who are supposed to be helped. It surely does not serve the needs of the tax-paying citizens who are funding the program and want to get the most bang for their buck.  Of course, the failure of our welfare system shows up in the weaknesses of society in many, many, different ways. In addition, the current system requires States that want to be very innovative in welfare reform to jump through tremendous number of hoops to receive Federal waivers.  My own State of Iowa sought and received, but it did take months, Mr. President, a whole series of such waivers from the Department of Health and Human Services [HHS]. The waiver process theoretically allows States to develop programs that best meet the needs of each State. But the lengthy and the very burdensome process often inhibits States' initiatives and innovations.  From visiting with the Governors and State legislatures we know that there are more States that want to try to solve this problem because they do not see it solved in Washington, DC. However, those few States that have waded through the time-consuming process have been partially successful in developing a welfare system more tailored to their needs.  Although many of the State initiatives are still in their infancy, State governments have been very supportive of proposals at the Federal level to design a program tailored to the States' unique environment. As well as to allow them more leeway to use their own ingenuity to solve the welfare problems in their own States.  Mr. President, I recognize that in order for welfare reform to work we must establish three goals: First we must reduce the rising cost of welfare programs; second, welfare reform must address the social crisis of out-of-wedlock births; finally, it must require real work from its recipients.  Mr. President, under my proposal, the entire Federal Aid to Families With Dependent Children, the AFDC program, the AFDC Job Opportunity and Basic Skills [JOBS] Program, as well as the Food Stamp Program as it applies to AFDC recipients, would simply be repealed.  They would be ended. The role of the Federal Government would be unalterably changed as we transfer these moneys to the States in block grants to accomplish our goal and let them use their ingenuity to do what we have not been able to accomplish through several reforms that have passed the Congress in recent decades.  This is important because this is a reform effort first. This is not just simply a budget effort and would fail if it were just a budget effort. The goal is to make the program work more effectively by giving control of it to those people who are ingenious and have shown that ingenuity in past activities to accomplish a better approach to welfare than what we have been able to accomplish in Washington.  The resulting budget and deficit reductions are important, but they are secondary. The focus must be on reform of welfare. This legislation requires only two reform goals be achieved by the States: First, an increase in the number of welfare recipients working each year as compared to the previous year and, second, a reduction in the number of out-of-wedlock births in the State.  Apart from those requirements, the States would be completely free--let me emphasize, completely free--to create their own welfare reform plan that would work best for them and meet the needs of their citizens.  While reform is clearly the primary goal, there are also clear budget implications in this bill. It would establish a cap on Federal spending on assistance programs for low-income Americans at the 1995 levels, and it would then block grant the money that the States now receive in 1995 at those levels to the States for their use, using their own ingenuity to operate their own welfare programs.  States would be free to experiment with new ideas for dramatic change. That is the essence of our approach. They would also be responsible for making the changes work because they have funding caps and those caps would be at the present level. The incentive is for States to get people off welfare and to get them into work. My bill sets forth measurable performance standards that reward work and change the culture of welfare. It would allow States that have met or exceeded the two goals of this legislation to be awarded additional bonus payments in their block grant.  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to reform welfare and devise a more effective program. This bill would allow States to have a greater decisionmaking role and to have the freedom to create welfare programs that fit the individual needs of their respective States. I urge Senators to join me in cosponsoring the Welfare-to-Work and Strong Families Act of 1995.  Mr. President, this country of the United States of America--with all 50 States, is too diverse of a country to administer the distribution of the Food Stamp Program to meet the needs of States or how they are spent in Puerto Rico because of the heterogeneity of our population. It is too geographically [[Page S903]] vast to pour from one mold in Washington, DC, to solve the welfare problems of New York City just like Des Moines, IA.  It is better under those conditions where our country is so different from one end to the other to leave it to the individual States to devise a plan. We have tried to reform welfare in Washington. We have not been successful. Several States have been successful. We want to build upon that success, and that is why this bill is being introduced.  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 209       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Welfare-     to-Work and Strong Families Act of 1995''.

FINDINGS.       The Congress finds the following:       (1) The current welfare system is broken and requires      replacement.       (2) ``Work'' is what works best for American families.       (3) Since State and local governments know the best methods      of connecting welfare recipients to work and since each      community faces different circumstances, Federal assistance      to the States should be flexible.       (4) Government has the responsibility to provide a helping      hand to assist individuals but individuals have the      responsibility to use the assistance to help themselves.       (5) Between 1970 and 1991, the total number of all out-of-     wedlock births in the United States has increased from 10 to      30 percent and, if that rate of increase continues, by 2015,      50 percent of all births in the United States will be out-of-     wedlock.       (6) The negative consequences of out-of-wedlock births on      the child, mother, and society are well-documented as      follows:       (A) Children born into families receiving welfare      assistance are 3 times more likely to receive welfare      assistance when they reach adulthood than children born into      families that do not receive welfare.       (B) Young women who have children before finishing high      school are more likely to receive welfare assistance for a      substantial period of time.       (C) A single parent family is 6 times more likely to live      in poverty than a two-parent family.       (7) Due to the crisis caused by the growing rate of out-of-     wedlock births in the United States, the Congress deems the      reduction of out-of-wedlock births to be an important      governmental interest.     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.       The purpose of this Act is to create a block grant program      to replace the aid to families with dependent children      program under title IV of the Social Security Act and a      portion of the food stamp program under the Food Stamp Act of      1977 and give the States the flexibility to create innovative      welfare-to-work programs and programs designed to reduce the      increasing rate of children born out-of-wedlock.     SEC. 4. DEFINITION OF STATE.       For purposes of this Act, the term ``State'' means each of      the several States of the United States, the District of      Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin      Islands, Guam, and American Samoa.
