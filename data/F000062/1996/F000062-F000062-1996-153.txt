 President, I would like to respond, if I might, to the argument raised by the Senator from Massachusetts. Using an Immigration and Naturalization Service document entitled ``Immigration and Backlog Reductions Under Current Law,'' and adding the three categories--spouses and children's space, spouses and children's change, an increase due to legalization through IRCA, here are the totals that we come up with: In fiscal year 1995, 206,000; in fiscal year 1996, 270,000; in fiscal year 1997, 370,000; in fiscal year 1998, 349,000. The highest year would be 1997, which leaves 110,000 even in 1997 to filter down through the categories.  I ask that the chart entitled ``Immigration and Backlog Reductions Under Current Law''--these are assumptions, so I recognize that depending on the assumptions that one uses, you can get different figures. These are the ones that, again, are a little different from what Senator Kennedy is working on because they project this very large total at the bottom of 1 million in 1995, of 984,000 in 1996, of 600,000 in 1997. Those are the total numbers.  So I think if these come in to be the case, even in the most difficult year, there is 110,000 that would filter down through the remaining categories.
