 President, I am glad that Senator Frist and other Senators were able to work out the parliamentary maneuvering that it takes to get us to finality on this JOBS bill.  We obviously want to encourage the creation of jobs and manufacturing in America. We want to reduce reasons for outsourcing. This bill deals with all of those and some others as well.  Throughout this debate, I feel as though I was whipsawed in arguments trotted out by opponents of this bill. They complain about accommodations we have made to Members. Some of these accomplishments and accommodations have even helped folks in States of the critics. Then they complain about what is not in this bill that should have been included in this bill.  First of all, I don't know how many times I have to say this, but I think itneeds to be continually said. This bill is revenue neutral. Yes, we decrease taxes for partnerships, family-owned businesses, and corporations that are involved in manufacturing, reducing that from 35 to 32 percent. Obviously, that brings in less revenue, but that does not mean the deficit of the United States is going to be increased. We pay for it by raising revenue from businesses, by closing corporate tax loopholes, and we collect that new revenue coming in to small businesses, especially to any size business that manufactures--large or small.  This bill is basically about manufacturing jobs. That is where the revenue in this bill goes.  There are those who talk about this bill as somewhat of a giveaway to business. You have some businesses not paying taxes because they are abusing the Tax Code through corporate loophole abuse, and they pay more money. Then you have the socially good provisions such as encouraging manufacturing in the United States to create jobs in the United States. I don't think people are correct in saying this is a giveaway to business because it balances out within the business sector of our country--some paying more and some not paying more. Because we are taxing them more, they are paying more because they can't cheat anymore. We are giving some benefits from that same revenue to create jobs in the United States.  Those who call this a giveaway for business need to put on their reading glasses and take a look at revenue tables produced by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. These people aren't Republican or Democrat. They are professionals who decide how many changes are in the Tax Code, where revenue comes from. These tables show that this bill is revenue neutral; that financial reductions are paid for in new revenue coming in from the closing of corporate loophole abuse.  For those who are talking about this bill being a giveaway for business, I want them to stop using that argument. One statement was made last night that was egregiously in error. One of the hard-line opponents of this bill claimed that the tobacco buyout was paid for by the taxpayers.  I don't support the tobacco buyout but realize it was necessary to get this bill through the other body. I insisted on one of the Senate's positions in the tobacco buyout, and that position is that tobacco companies pay for this buyout. Opponents need to read this bill and the revenue tables. If they bother to do so they will see the buyout is paid for not by the taxpayers of America but by the companies that produce tobacco.  Now, let's put in context the mischaracterization of this bill as somewhat of a special interest bill. In part, the bill receives such widespread support because many Member items were accommodated. Literally dozens of tax benefits were adopted in committee and on the floor.  Let me define ``Member items.'' Constituents of one State came to their Senator and said: This part of the Tax Code is wrong, it is hurtful; or they said: We think the Tax Code ought to be changed this way. Maybe they do not come to me. Maybe they do not go to the other 99 Senators; they go to 1 Senator. That Senator is a representative of his people. It is his responsibility to bring that issue to the Senate. He does not have to. He can say: I don't agree with you, I will not do that. If he feels his constituents are justified in what they are requesting, then the matter is brought to the committee that has jurisdiction. That is the Senate Finance Committee, which I chair. Somehow there is something negative or derogatory about a Member bringing forth an item for all to consider. If we think that Member is crazy, we do not have to do it. If we think there is some justification to what that Member brings before the Senate, we ought to consider that. That is how our representative system of government works.  Literally dozens of tax changes were adopted in committee or in the Chamber. Before the conference, Senator Baucus and I received letters from virtually every Member of the Senate. In some cases those letters asked for items from the Senate to be retained. In other cases those letters asked for the Senate to accept items from the House bill, and in still other cases Members wrote asking for items that were not in either bill. Finally, some Members asked us to not accept certain provisions not in either bill.  I have a stack of letters with me. These letters are not all the letters, of course. There is no sense carrying a pile of letters out here. But Members representing the interests of their State bring these issues for our consideration.  I will go to the first category and follow up items from the Senate bill.  National care scholarships for nurses--Senator Murray and Cantwell asked for that. It is in the bill.  Sickle cell disease and Medicaid, consideration of sickle cell disease, which is not covered by Medicaid--Senators Talent, Schumer, Campbell, Dayton, Cochran, Bond, Specter, Mikulski, Cantwell, Landrieu, Stabenow, Kennedy, Sarbanes, Voinovich, Lautenberg, Murkowski. It is in the bill.  Some are going to say that Members' provision brought to us under the leadership of Senator Talent should not be considered by this body, and I will explain why this is all in one bill. People watching might think if you have a sickle cell disease issue come before the Senate, maybe it ought to come up as a separate issue. On the next item up is a life insurance taxation issue; maybe it ought to come as a separate bill. Why doesn't it? Because under the rules of the Senate every little bill that comes out here could be amended by anything that is in the Tax Code. Eventually you have a little life insurance bill that becomes a vehicle for every member to bring up any bill they want to bring up.  So we saved the Senate from going through that exercise. That is what committees are about. We consider these issues--not always in committee; sometimes they are discussed when the bill comes to the Senate floor. Most of the time we give them a thorough study in the Senate Finance Committee. Sometimes we reject them and sometimes we include them. If we do not include them, maybe when they come to the Senate Chamber, that Senator is irritated with the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and they add it on the Senate floor. They always end up in one bill.  Somehow that makes all of our journalists concerned, those who seem to not have an understanding of how the Senate works, pointing out that this bill is full of a lot of little things in it that are unrelated to the underlying bill. That is true, but that is how the Senate works.  The House of Representatives does not work that way. They put a bill together, they adopt a rule, and there is never an amendment. I shouldn't say never, but very seldom is a Member allowed to offer an amendment to a Ways and Means bill on the floor of the House. That is why the House of Representatives is like the House of Lords. That is why the Senate is like a House of Representatives. We allow the people of this country to bring anything they want to the floor of the Senate.  Another item is suspension of section 815, a life insurance company taxation issue. That was brought to us by Senator Specter. It is in the bill.  New York City revitalization tax benefits directly related to the attack of September 11, 2001, and the rebuilding of New York was brought to us by Senators Schumer and Clinton--most of that, but not all of it, is in the bill.  Brownfields, unrelated business income tax relief--Senators Lautenberg, Reed, Jeffords, Stabenow, Specter, Sarbanes Dole, Akaka, Chafee, Inhofe--is in the bill. The use of green bonds for economic development in certain areas is something I was not for, but it is in the bill to satisfy Senators Allard, Schumer, Miller, Clinton, and Chambliss.  We have IRS private debt collection. Senator Allen was pushing this. That is something I very definitely favor because this is one way of getting the private sector bringing in money from people who are tax cheats and are not paying their taxes.  Tribal government bonds--Senator Campbell, very active in the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs--was also a matter of importance to Senator Baucus and others, but it is not in the bill despite being raised in conference.  Comprehensive energy tax relief package--Senator Hutchison--is not in the bill despite being raised in conference because the House of Representatives took the position thatthere shouldn't be anything on energy in this bill because they think energy items need to be put together in a bill that ought to be dealt with separately, next session. Quite frankly, the House of Representatives passed a comprehensive energy bill last fall, and we were two votes short in the Senate because of a Democrat filibuster against the bill. They say that instead of doing the energy provisions in this bill before us now, the Senate ought to take up the bill that we obviously have a majority for--but because of a Democrat filibuster we are two votes short--and do the energy stuff there, not in bill before the Senate.  So I cannot blame the House of Representatives because they worked hard to get an energy bill passed, and it comes over here and you get a Democrat filibuster.  By the way, those two votes could be supplied by Senator Kerry and Senator Edwards because now they think we ought to have a national energy policy, and they did not vote last November. If they come in here before we go home and cast the 59th and 60th vote, we would have the comprehensive energy policy, not just little slivers of it that we get in a bill here and a bill there, but we would have a very comprehensive energy policy. They would be fulfilling what they are saying out there on the campaign trail we need to get done: have a national energy policy. We have 58 votes for it. We need a 59th and 60th vote, and they could be that. But at least I am telling you why we do not have the energy provisions in here that a Republican Senator, Senator Hutchison, wanted.  We have a request from Senators Crapo, Bingaman, Voinovich, Biden, Pryor, Talent, Enzi, Chafee, Carper, Clinton, Allard, Bond, Coleman, Sununu, Bennett, Chambliss, Hutchison, Hagel, Nelson of Florida, Dayton, Dole, Reed of Rhode Island, Dodd, Kennedy, and Levin for mortgage revenue bonds liberalization. It is not in the bill, but it was raised in conference.  We have heard a lot about Senator Landrieu's Guard and Ready Reserve amendment. That was raised by Senators Landrieu, Bond, Pryor, Murray, Dodd, Akaka, Cantwell, Dorgan, Schumer, Mikulski, Nelson of Florida, Lautenberg, Johnson, Feingold, Leahy, Dayton, Levin, Sarbanes, Wyden, and Durbin. We discussed that provision a lot, and like the three items above, this item was raised at conference and rejected by the other body.  Mr. President, the letters I have cited reflect items Members raised. On some items we were able to reach agreement with the House, other items the House of Representatives rejected.  Let me point out that I offered three amendments that I filed. I won one and lost two. The House accepted an amendment I put in for rural letter carriers. The House rejected an amendment I had dealing with energy-efficient home appliances. The House rejected another amendment dealing with elderly housing connected to the Warrior Hotel in Sioux City, IA.  As the list above shows, a lot of Members of this body are satisfied because their items are in here; other Members are not satisfied. But that is not an unusual situation when you reach compromise. It also shows that for all of the unfair carping about this bill being a special interest bill, nearly every Member raised narrow-interest provisions. So if there is some fault about different provisions coming up, we all share that. We all do it. There is an old saying. It is: People who live in glass houses should not throw stones. We have a group of Members throwing stones at this JOBS bill. A lot of them are living in glass houses.  I will continue the discussion of Member items. We had the State sales tax deduction. Senators Cantwell and Hutchison wrote Senator Baucus and me asking us to include the House sales tax deduction provision in the conference agreement. We also received letters from delegations of other States where the State tax base is a sales tax base. The House sales tax deduction is in this bill because we decided for our Senators from several States that it ought to be included.  We had timber tax relief provisions: Senators Chambliss, Pryor, Cantwell, Sessions, Shelby, Cochran, Collins, Crapo, Craig, Coleman, Graham of South Carolina, Wyden, Cornyn, Lugar, and Murray.  As many of these Senators know, the timber industry has been hard hit by the tax on our exports going to Europe. By the way, when this bill passes, those taxes go away. The industry is finally recovering from a long recession. Timber mills are reopening. Mill workers are returning to the mills. The House timber provisions are in this bill.  Charitable whaling activities. Senator Murkowski wrote, asking us to accept the House provision that allows a deduction for charitable whaling activities. Now, some will criticize this provision, but it is important to the Natives of Alaska. Senator Murkowski is looking out for the Natives of Alaska. She ought to be applauded for bringing that to our attention. This is in the bill. But it has also passed the Senate several times.  Senator Baucus and I received letters from Members asking us to take Senate provisions out of the conference agreement. One example is Senator Stabenow's letter regarding a revenue raiser involving donations of cars. As you heard yesterday, Senator Hatch shares Senator Stabenow's concerns. The conferees retained the Senate revenue raiser.  There is another category of letters that we received. An example is a letter from Senator McCain and Senator Reed of Rhode Island. In that letter they asked me to keep out a provision dealing with the church tax exemption and political activities. The provision was not in either bill. Chairman Thomas and I kept provisions that were outside the scope of the bill out of the conference entirely. No matter what the merits of that proposal were, we played fair by Senator McCain and Senator Reed of Rhode Island.  The final category of requests dealt with the opposite of the McCain and Reed of Rhode Island request; that is, we had requests for items to be included that were not in either bill. I will give you a couple of sympathetic examples: a liberalization of tax-exempt rules as applied to charitable hospitals. Senator Akaka raised this issue. Unfortunately, this provision was outside of scope.  Another example is penalty-free withdrawals from IRAs for hurricane victims. Right now, if you are hit by four hurricanes in Florida, who is going to argue with Senator Nelson of Florida bringing that to our conference? He asked us to raise this item. It was not in either the House or Senate bill. It would have been an entirely new item that we could have put in in conference. However, there was no way to address the proposal without then opening the door for a lot of other items that were not in either bill that somebody would want included at the last minute.  So at this point, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                               September 21, 2004.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Chairman, Finance Committee, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office          Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Max Baucus,     Ranking Member, Finance Committee, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate          Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Finance Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Baucus:      We write to respectfully request that you include as part of      the FSC/ETI (S. 1637) conference report the sickle cell      amendment that would help treat and expand services for      patients with the sickle cell blood disorder. Sickle cell      disease affects approximately 70,000 Americans and more than      2,500,000 Americans, mostly African-Americans, have the      sickle cell trait. There is still no comprehensive cure.       We are among the 49 Senate cosponsors of the bipartisan,      bicameral legislation that is the basis for this amendment      (S. 874/H.R. 1736) and strongly support its enactment into      law. Passage of this amendment in the Senate was great news      for the tens of thousands of Americans who suffer from this      disease, which affects 1 in 300 African-American newborns.      The disease causes normally round blood cells to take on a      sickle shape that clog the bloodstream. These obstructions      result in severe medical complications including strokes in      infants and limit the average lifespan to 45 years of age.       In summary, this legislation is a disease management bill      that allows states to combine Medicaid-reimbursed services to      target sickle cell disease, and authorizes a small     Health Resources and Services Administration grant for      research, treatment and community outreach through qualifying      community health centers. This bill does not expand Medicaid      eligibility or change the federal Medicaid matching formula      and has a very small cost to the federal government.       This legislation has received exceptional support from      nationally prominent children's, health, African-American,      church and union groups including the National Association of      Children's Hospitals, the American Medical Association, the      NAACP, and the Catholic Health Association of America.       We are hopeful that you will include the sickle cell      amendment as part of the FSC/ETI (S. 1637) conference report      to help tens of thousands of Americans lead longer, healthier      and more productive lives.           Sincerely,         Jim Talent, Chuck Schumer, Ben Nighthorse Campbell, Thad            Cochran, Arlen Specter, Maria Cantwell, Debbie            Stabenow, Ted Kennedy, George V. Voinovich, Norm            Coleman, Mark Dayton, Kit Bond, Barbara A. Mikulski,            May L. Landrieu, Jon Corzine, Paul Sarbanes, Frank R.            Lautenburg, Lisa Murkowski, Sam Brownback, Peter G.            Fitzgerald, Mike DeWine, Lindsey Graham, Barbara Boxer,            Elizabeth Dole, Lincoln Chafee, George Allen.                                  ____                                                  U.S. Senate,                               Washington, DC, September 30, 2004.     Chairman Charles Grassley,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Grassley: As you continue your work on the      FSC/ETI bill conference, I would like to ask your support for      a Native Alaska subsistence whaling tax deduction. This      legislation may be brought up as an amendment by Chairman      Thomas in conference.       For your interest, I have enclosed a letter from the      Inupiat community in Barrow, Alaska. I believe they give a      good summary on the merits of this legislation. Thank you for      your attention to this matter.           Sincerely,                                                   Lisa Murkowski,     U.S. Senator.                                  ____                                                  U.S. Senate,                               Washington, DC, September 30, 2004.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     Chairman, Committee on Finance,     U.S. Senate.       Dear Chuck: As we move closer to consideration of the      conference report on the JOBS bill, I write to reiterate my      request that you retain the Senate two-year suspension of      Internal Revenue Code Section 815.       I wrote to you on July 19, 2004, concerning this matter and      its importance to several of my Pennsylvania constituents. It      would allow stockholder-owned life insurance companies to      eliminate the surtax based on earned income between 21 and 46      years ago that otherwise would be triggered upon reasonable      corporate restructuring. As I had stated, three of my      constituent companies would have large potential liability      under Section 815.       Thank you very much for your consideration of this request.           Sincerely,     Arlen Specter.                                  ____                                                  U.S. Senate,                               Washington, DC, September 30, 2004.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     Chairman, Committee on Finance,     U.S. Senate.     Hon. Max Baucus,     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance,     U.S. Senate.     Hon. Bill Thomas,     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,     House of Representatives.     Hon. Charles Rangel,     Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means,     House of Representatives.       Dear Chairmen and Ranking Members: The Senate-passed      version of JOBS bill, S. 1637, contains an important      provision that will give a well-deserved tax cut to employers      who continue to pay the salaries of their employees who have      been called to active duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. As you      convene the conference committee on this important      legislation, we want to encourage you to retain this      provision in the final conference bill.       Over 410,000 members of the National Guard and Reserve have      been activated to defend our Nation since September 11, 2001.      They have done so with valor and honor, but the frequent and      lengthy activations have exposed problems on the home front.      The Government Accountability Office reports that forty-one      percent of our Guard and Reserve personnel take pay cuts from      their civilian jobs when they put on their uniforms. While a      husband or wife is deployed overseas, spouses back home face      difficulties in making ends meet because active duty pay-     checks are often far less than those received in the civilian      world. This causes our troops to divert their attention from      the mission to worrying whether or not their spouses can      afford the mortgage, auto repairs, or child care.       Many employers have helped to ease this burden by making up      the ``pay-gap'' between the civilian and military pay of      their active duty employees, something that they are not      required to do. However, the economic downturn has made it      difficult for most employers to make up the pay-gap.      Additionally, as we continue to rely on the Guard and Reserve      for future deployments, those employers who currently make up      the pay-gap may no longer be able to provide payments to      employees frequently missing from work for months and years.       The provision in S. 1637 gives employers a 50 percent tax      credit on the salaries they pay to employees during      activations up to $30,000 of salary. This tax credit will      encourage those employers already providing for their      employees to continue this patriotic response. In addition,      the provision also gives small businesses a $6,000 tax credit      for hiring a worker to replace an active duty employee. Small      manufacturers would receive a credit of up to $10,000 to help      find a replacement.       We urge the Conference to retain the Reserve and Guard      employer tax credits in the final JOBS Act. Our troops are      putting everything on the line overseas. Their employers are      helping them at home. These patriotic employers deserve this      tax relief. Thank you for your consideration.           Sincerely,         Mary L. Landrieu, Mark Pryor, Chris Dodd, Daniel K.            Akaka, Byron L. Dorgan, Barbara A. Mikulski, Frank R.            Lautenberg, Kit Bond, Patty Murray, Jon Corzine, Maria            Cantwell, Charles Schumer, Bill Nelson, Tim Johnson,            Russ Feingold, Mark Dayton, Paul Sarbanes, Dick Durbin,            Patrick Leahy, Carl Levin, Ron Wyden.                                  ____                                                      U.S. Senate,                                  Washington, DC, October 1, 2004.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     Chairman, Committee on Finance,     U.S. Senate.     Hon. Max Baucus,     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance,     U.S. Senate.     Hon. Bill Thomas,     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,     House of Representatives.     Hon. Charles E. Rangel,     Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means,     House of Representatives.       Dear Chairmen and Ranking Members: I have been made aware      that my colleague, Sen. Graham, submitted an amendment      dealing with hurricane relief to the corporate tax bill      currently before your conference committee.       Specifically, this amendment, which mirrors legislation      Sen. Graham and I introduced in response to the recent wave      of hurricanes that have ravaged Florida, would allow victims      of disasters to withdraw funds from retirement accounts      without incurring proscribed penalties.       I respectfully request you support Sen. Graham's provision.      I understand that this amendment may go beyond the scope of      the conference, however I would argue that had the spate of      hurricanes happened prior to Senate-consideration of the tax      bill, a similar provision would have been included in the tax      bill.       As you know, along with much of the Southeast, Florida has      withstood a barrage of hurricanes resulting in billions of      dollars in damage. Providing citizens of disaster areas with      the means to access funds that otherwise would carry a      substantial penalty can play an important role in alleviating      their financial hardships.       With the conference working through various amendments to      the corporate tax bill, I would implore you to give serious      consideration to this provision, and to providing Americans      who have seen so much devastation access to the funds they      need to repair damage to their property and their lives.           Sincerely,                                                      Bill Nelson.
