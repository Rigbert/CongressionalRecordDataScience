 President, I rise today to draw attention to key influences in youth drug use as reported ina national study, released by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, SAMHSA, entitled Risk and Preventive Factors for Adolescent Drug Use: Findings from the 1997 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse.  As summarized in the Spring 2001 edition of the magazine SAMHSA News, this study reported ``[p]eer use and peer attitudes are two of the strongest predictors of marijuana use among all young people.'' For youth in the age range of 12-17, using marijuana in the past year was 39 times higher if close friends had used it versus if they had friends who had not used it. The odds for the same age group were 16 times higher if adolescents thought their friends would not be ``very upset'' if they used marijuana. While peer attitudes were more influential than parental attitudes, youth were still 9.6 times more likely to smoke marijuana if they viewed their parents ``would not be very upset'' versus ``very upset.''  Other risk factors for past-year marijuana use were the youth's own use of alcohol and tobacco, the parent's attitude about alcohol and tobacco, if youth could not talk to their parents about serious problems, if youth were not enrolled in school, if youth were receiving poor grades in school, or if they did not attend religious services once a week. Interestingly, the factors that most correlated with cigarette use were the same factors associated with alcohol, marijuana, and other illegal drugs. Finally, youth who had not received in-school drug/alcohol education were slightly more likely to have used marijuana in the past year than those who had not. The analysis results were uniform across race/ethnicity.  The average person, much less a teenager, does not wake up one day and decide to do a line of cocaine or take a hit of heroin. There is a general progression of both actions and attitudes. The so-called ``softer'' drugs of cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, and other club or synthetic drugs are actually ``gateways'' that precede the use of cocaine and heroin. According to a 14-year veteran of drug treatment in New York City, the average age of new users she sees has dropped from 17 or 18 years to now 13. Quoting her from a recent newspaper article, ``[w]e've seen the age of first use drop dramatically''. . .``[k]ids are going from doing marijuana to drugs like ecstasy and rohypnol in months.'' A Spartanburg County South Carolina sheriff, also quoted in a recent newspaper article, reminds us ``[t]hat the first responsibility of parenthood is to protect the child.'' Backing up the SAMSHA observations on peers and peer attitudes, he concluded ``parents need to pay close attention to the way their children act and who they're hanging around with.''  It may be difficult to raise teenagers or keep your children off all illegal substances, but there are some easy first steps and warning signs to heed. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA, handbook ``Preventing Drug Abuse Among Children and Adolescents,'' the best ``protective factors'' include ``strong bonds with parents, experience of parental monitoring with clear rules of conduct within the family unit, involvement of parents in the lives of their children, success in school performance, strong bonds with prosocial institutions such as family, school, and religious organizations, and adoption of conventional norms about drug use.'' With respect to family relationships, NIDA research shows that ``parents need to take a more active role in their children's lives, including talking to them about drugs, monitoring their activities, getting to know their friends, and understanding their problems and concerns.''  These are simple, positive actions that all of us, as friends, peers, coworkers, concerned adults, or parents can start today.                          ____________________
