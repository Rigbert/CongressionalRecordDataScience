 President, I rise today to join my friend from Ohio, Senator Voinovich, and other colleagues in co-sponsoring a Sense of the Senate Resolution regarding the recent elections in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), including advocating the resumption of economic assistance, once democracy is restored in that country.  The Voinovich-Biden resolution congratulates the people of the FRY for their courage in participating in the September 24, 2000 elections; applauds the clear decision of the people of the FRY to embrace democracy, the rule of law, and integration into the international community by rejecting dictatorship and isolationism; reasserts the strong desire of the Senate to reestablish the historic friendship between the American and Serbian peoples; and expresses its intention to support a comprehensive assistance program for the FRY to speed its economic recovery and European integration and access to international financial institutions, once a democratic government that respects the rule of law, human rights, and a market economy is established.  Slobodan Milosevic, one of the most despicable individuals I have ever met, is on the ropes. Even as we meet here today, tens of thousands of brave men and women are refusing to work and instead are demonstrating in the streets of cities throughout Yugoslavia for Milosevic to honor the results of last month's elections. The democratic opposition has called for people to stage a massive rally in Belgrade on Thursday, October 5, in a final push to drive Milosevic from power.  The Voinovich-Biden resolution, Mr. President, puts the United States Senate on record on the side of the people of Yugoslavia and its largest nationality, the Serbs, against Milosevic's tyranny.  As I have said several times on this floor, for the last decade our quarrel has never been with the Serbian people, who were allies of the United States in two world wars in the twentieth century. Vojislav Kostunica, whose victory in last month's elections Milosevic and his cronies tried to steal and are now trying to deny, is an honest man who should be given a chance to cooperate with the Western democracies.  The Voinovich-Biden resolution is a signal to all citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that the path to their country's rejoining the international community, and thereby to restoring their shattered economy, is to honor the results of the elections by immediately and formally installing Mr. Kostunica as President.                          ____________________
