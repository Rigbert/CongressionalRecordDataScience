President, I join the comments made by the Senator from Minnesota. This is a historic moment in this Chamber. It is not just another procedural vote. It is a decision by the majority, the Republican majority in this Senate, to reduce the opportunities that Members in the Senate have to discuss the issues of importance to this Nation. It is being offered in the name of efficiency. It is being offered in the name of saving time.  It was not that long ago, only a few years ago, when the Elementary and Secondary Education Act was debated for several weeks at a time, under both Democratic and Republican leadership, with the offering of a myriad of amendments on both sides. That was considered the deliberative process. That was what the Senate was all about. It was a battle of ideas and the best side would win. We would move forward with legislation in a bipartisan fashion.  What the majority leader is doing today with this point of order is to basically close down debate on the floor of the Senate. I think it is worthy of note that the issue that has precipitated this is gun control. This is the bone in the throat of some of the Members who cannot stand the idea of voting on this issue.  We believe this is an answer to that. Bring the bill to the floor and let's vote for it up or down, bring it out of conference. The idea we are somehow paying homage to efficiency in the name of this institution, in the name of taking away our birthright as Senators to speak to issues on behalf of the American people, I believe, is, frankly, going to penalize this institution.
