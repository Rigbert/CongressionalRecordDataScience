 President, after the Fourth of July recess, as I just indicated, the Senate will begin consideration of the Homeland Security appropriations bill. I encourage Senators to work with the bill managers to expedite the consideration of this extremely important funding bill. Senators should expect the first vote of the week to occur at around 5:30 p.m. on Monday, July 10, and should make their travel plans accordingly. We will alert Members later as to the exact timing and substance of that vote.                          ____________________[Page S7258]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL.
