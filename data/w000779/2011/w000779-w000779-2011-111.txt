President, Oregon Institute of Technology in Klamath Falls has long been a leader in America's effort to develop geothermal energy, and it's also a power in men's basketball, winning national titles in 2004 and 2008.  Now, it is the national champion in women's softball. It is the first women's team to win a national championship at OIT, but I am sure it won't be the last.  The Hustlin' Owls entered the national tournament ranked 18th in the Nation. They came out 1st in the Nation. They were led by a stellar performance from their pitcher and MVP, Jackie Imhof. In the final game, she pitched a shutout, allowing only four hits and striking out seven. Through the tournament, Imhof was 6-1 with an amazing earned run average 0f 0.59. Imhof and two other teammates, catcher Kayde Schaefer and shortstop Shauna Collins, made the all tournament team.  Congratulations to coach Greg Stewart and the Hustlin' Owls of OIT. Clearly, they are doing something right at Oregon Institute of Technology.                          ____________________
