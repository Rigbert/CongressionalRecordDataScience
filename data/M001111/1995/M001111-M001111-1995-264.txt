 President, I thank my colleagues. I do know Senator Hatfield from Oregon is going to return to the floor and wants to make a statement, and I will speak until he does get here.  Mr. President, I do rise today to oppose S. 395, which is a bill that, in part, allows the export of Alaskan North Slope crude oil. This issue, at first glance, may appear very simple. Lifting the ban on North Slope oil exports would increase sales and enhance revenues for many Alaskans. However, that additional income for a few of our citizens must be weighed against the concerns of the rest of the Nation.  Job loss, price increases, dependence on foreign oil, and increased environmental risks are all issues that Congress must review--must review--before placing the needs of one State above the concerns of many.  When Congress agreed to develop Alaska's North Slope--ANS--crude oil resources 20 years ago, it prohibited exports of this oil unless the President and Congress find that exports serve national economic and energy security, and other interests. Those conditions were a direct response to the economic chaos and long gas lines created by the Arab oil embargoes of the 1970's.  Since then, our reliance on foreign oil has not diminished. The arguments for retaining the restrictions remain strong. Over the years, Alaska North Slope crude oil has fueled the west coast. Mr. President, 90 percent--90 percent--of Washington State's crude oil comes from the North Slope, and our refineries are operating at 90 percent capacity. The existence of export restrictions has created an extensive transportation, refining, and shipyard infrastructure in our region.  The North Slope has given us a reliable oil supply, carried aboard U.S.-flag vessels. Ships employ Washingtonians in crew and support positions, as well as in ports and ship repair yards.  Today, this secure supply of oil faces a very serious threat. The State of Alaska and British Petroleum, the principal producer of ANS crude, are mounting a major effort to permit ANS exports. They want to remove the statutory restrictions. Removal of these restrictions will enrich both the State of Alaska's coffers and BP's pockets. But it would seriously hurt consumers, jobs, and the environment in this region.  The tankers that transport Alaska oil are repaired on the west coast. If export restrictions are lifted, this work will go overseas. We could lose 5,000 jobs within our own region, and $160 million in annual employment income. This is more than half of the marine industry's total west coast employment.  For shipyards, Alaska's crude oil exports would result in the loss of $270 million a year. More than 2,000 jobs at refineries in my State would be lost.  In addition, the Pacific Northwest would forego most of the $93 million in annual Federal, State, and local tax payments made by these works and facilities. Mr. President, 90 percent of Alaskan oil is consumed by west coast refineries owned by Atlantic Richfield, Texaco, and Shell, plus independents such as Tosco and U.S. Oil.  Six of these refineries are in my home State of Washington. Competing against foreign buyers willing to pay premium prices, industry experts predict our refineries either will shut down or be forced to pay a premium price to keep their Alaskan supply, or to purchase substitute foreign crude.  Major oil companies may be able to absorb much of the price increase. But the independents, that own 25 percent of the processing capacity in the Pacific Northwest, will not. They cannot compete with the majors by selling their petroleum products at higher prices. As many as 2,500 people could lose their jobs along with the losses of $100 million in annual payroll income and $500 million in annual tax payments.  My concern for our environment makes the case for export restrictions even more compelling. Congress opened Alaska's North Slope for development only after it imposed strict conditions to protect that region's fragile environment. Moreover, Washington State and other west coast States also enacted laws and regulations to assure the transportation and processing of this oil is done in a manner that will not injure our environment.  With 99 percent of Alaska crude coming through Puget Sound and 94 percent of this carried on U.S. tankers, foreign replacement oil would not only be more costly but would be carried on more environmentally risky tankers. The U.S. Coast Guard rates as high-risk one-half of the current foreign tanker fleet that carries crude through Puget Sound.  Our coastal waters would face an added threat: Increased pollution risks from offshore transfers of crude oil from large foreign tankers to smaller ships that can actually deliver the oil to our six refineries.  Exporting ANS crude on less expensive foreign vessels would lower transportation costs for British Petroleum and raise their profits. It would also raise revenue for the State of Alaska because the State's ANS royalty payment is based on the wellhead price, minus transportation costs. BP would also save money by having its tankers built and repaired in foreign countries. In short, North Slope's oil exports would benefit British Petroleum and increase the Treasury of the State of Alaska, but they are clearly not in the interest of the people I represent.  Moreover, I do not believe exports would meet the statutory tests designed to protect broader national interests. When I weigh the benefits to Alaska and BP against these very serious risks, exports make little sense to me. For the sake of our workers and their families, our environment and our energy security, I urge my colleagues to listen and oppose this bill and any other efforts to lift the export restrictions.  Mr. President, I want to read into the Record some of the editorials that have been written in the last several months regarding this bill and the lifting of the Alaska oil ban. The first one comes in the Seattle Times, and it is dated March 3 of this year, 1995.                          Keep Alaska Oil Ban       The export ban on Alaskan crude oil has served this country      well as a domestic source of valuable petroleum. Contrary to      the Clinton administration's desires, this is not the time to      overturn the ban, nor the time to imply that over-dependence      on foreign oil supplies is over.       Oil from the North Slope of Alaska was drilled, pumped and      shipped south as part of a massive enterprise intended to tap      into a huge domestic reserve. The 800-mile Alyeska pipeline      delivers oil to the port of Valdez, Alaska, but it came at      enormous cost and large environmental and cultural questions.      The most immediate beneficiaries are the residents of Alaska,      who receive yearly Permanent Fund checks for the treasure      they are sharing with the rest of the country.       Alaska's representatives are all in favor of ending the      ban--probably because higher prices could give their state      $1.6 billion more in royalties in just four more years. But      while Alaskans rightly share in the profits from oil, those      North Slope holes have since the beginning been considered a      national resource.       Although nothing in the Alaskan oil equation has changed,      the political requirements of Southern California have      apparently been heard in the Clinton White House.       California refineries are full of Alaskan oil; exporting      the oil to its likely buyer, Japan, would stimulate      California's own oil fields. Although Department of Energy      officials testified motorists would see very little price      change at the pump, the very premise of stimulating one      region's fields by exporting oil from another region has      inherent price risks.       There is something smelly about a plan that sends Alaskan      oil abroad when the resource should be carefully used at      home. The only reason the U.S. imports foreign oil is to meet      domestic consumption. Depleting our own resources because      some refineries have too much oil goes against the original      argument for opening the fields. [[Page S6669]]        Shipping Alaska's oil abroad carries a new set of      environmental questions for the Pacific Northwest as new      maritime routes would be opened. That's not the most serious      question about dropping the oil ban, but simply another in      the long list of unnecessary actions that would result from a      misguided White House political strategy.  In addition, the Portland Oregonian, on February 26, 1995, printed this editorial:              [From the Portland Oregonian, Feb. 26, 1995] Keep Alaska's Oil Here--Lifting Ban on Oil Exports Would Raise Prices  Here, Hurt Port's Ship Business, Increase U.S. Dependency on Foreign                                   Oil       Congress should sink a bill to remove the 21-year-old ban      on exporting Alaskan North Slope crude oil.       Instead of lifting the ban, Congress should support      legislation introduced by Northwest Sons, Patty Murray, D-     Wash., and Mark O. Hatfield, R-Ore., to extend the export      restrictions in the Export Administration Act.       Removing the restrictions that limit the sale of Alaska's      oil to domestic markets is being promoted with wildly      optimistic promises. Proponents include BP America, Alaska's      largest oil producer, independent West Coast oil producers,      five maritime unions, the U.S. Department of Energy and the      states of Alaska and California.       They say lifting the ban on Alaskan oil exports would      stimulate production of at least 100,000 barrels of oil per      day and create up to 25,000 jobs, primarily in Alaska and      California, while not causing an increase in the cost of      motor fuel prices on the West Coast.       Those projections are very questionable. An Energy      Department study completed last summer suggested that lifting      the ban would create 11,000 to 16,000 jobs (not 25,000). That      study also ignored potential job losses in the West Coast      ship-supply industry. And it didn't address the potential      threat to the economic vitality of the nation's domestic      tanker fleet.       Here's a more realistic appraisal of the likely outcome of      lifting the ban on exports of Alaskan oil:       West coast gasoline prices would rise. The ban has      depressed West Coast crude oil prices by an estimated $2 a      barrel because Alaska oil is forced onto a surplus market      here.       West Coast oil refiners have enjoyed the world's largest      gross margins because of the Alaskan crude's low price. If      that oil is withdrawn and exported, don't expect the refiners      to swallow their increased costs for      replacement crude. They'll surely pass it on to motorists.      If the total cost were passed through, it could result in      a 7-cent-a-gallon increase at the pump.       Ship repair and maintenance work at the Port of Portland      will all but disappear. Proponents of lifting the oil-export      ban say it would stimulate shipyard work on the West Coast.      Not so, say Port of Portland officials. They say their      contractors believe the lifting the ban would kill the      shipyard business. Alaska tankers account for about 70      percent of the work now, but Port of Portland officials      believe that tanker operators would do most of their      maintenance work in Japan and Korea once the ban was lifted.       U.S. dependency on foreign oil would increase markedly,      because replacement of much of the Alaskan North Slope crude      oil would come from overseas producers.       This comes at a time when U.S. dependency on foreign      sources of oil is at an all-time high. About half of the U.S.      daily consumption of 17.7 million barrels of oil comes from      foreign sources. That's substantially greater dependency than      this nation endured before the 1973 oil embargo or during the      Persian Gulf War. And government officials predict that      imports will represent 59 percent of consumption by 2010.        Lifting the ban on exporting Alaskan crude would add to      this dependency and make the nation even more vulnerable to      international disruptions.       The gain in maritime jobs is not worth the cost to this      nation's security and the adverse effect that foreign-oil      dependency has had on foreign policy.       Hatfield and Murray need other Northwest members of      Congress to rally behind their leadership on Alaskan oil      policy.  Finally, I will read an editorial from The Bellingham Herald called: ``Our View.''              [From the Bellingham Herald, Mar. 19, 1995]              Our View--Don't Export North Slope Crude Oil       Energy: Using the domestic oil ourselves reduces dependency      on foreign supplies, protects jobs.       U.S. Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, has introduced a bill      to lift the export ban on crude oil from Alaska's North Slope      oil fields, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash, has introduced a rival      bill that would continue the ban.       Murray's bill better protects the best interests, not only      of Whatcom County and other regions on the Pacific Northwest      where North Slope oil creates thousands of jobs, but of the      nation.       It makes little sense to propose exporting more domestic      oil when we already depend so heavily on imported oil to meet      needs and demands at home.       Murkowski maintains that lifting the ban would net Alaska      an additional $700 million from increased oil sales and      create as many as 25,000 new jobs there by 2000.       Murray claims that it would cost about 2,000 refinery and      ship-repair jobs in Washington, Oregon and California.       Competing regional interests aside, Congress should look at      what's in the nation's best interest.       If the export ban were lifted, foreign vessels could be      used to transport the crude oil to other nations. That might      pose additional environmental risks as well as eliminate      American jobs.       Nations such as China are developing industrial and      technological-based economies and need more oil. The pressure      to cash in on supplying it is intense. Just last week, the      Clinton administration had to pressure Conoco to abandon a      plan to help Iran develop two large offshore oil fields.       Best that we stay focused on what's in our nation's best      interest regarding North Slope crude oil and use it      ourselves.  Mr. President, I think all three of those editorials very clearly point out that it is in the Nation's best interests to defeat the proposal that is before the Senate now. It is in the Nation's best interest to do so.  I am going to respond to some of the points that were made by my colleague, Senator Murkowski, earlier particularly because he mentioned some with which I have to disagree.  He mentioned that the unions support the bill as he has presented it.  I would like to read for the Senate who opposes the bill the Senator from Alaska has presented to us:  Communication Workers of America; Industrial Union Department, AFL-CIO; Inland Boatmen's International Union; Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, International; National Farmers Organization; National Farmers Union; Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers; Steelworkers of America, United; Sailors' Union of the Pacific; United Auto Workers; Citizen Action; Consumer Energy Council of America; American Independent Refiners Association; Huntway Refining Co.; Indian Powerine LP; Kern Oil & Refining; Pacific Refining Co.; Tosco Refining Co.; U.S. Oil & Refining; Western Independent Refiners Association; WITCO Refining Corp.; Atlantic Marine; CBI Industries, Inc., Celeron Corp.; COSCOL Marine Co.; Pacific-Texas Pipeline Co.; Penn-Attransco.  The list goes on opposing this bill: Avondale Industries; Dillingham Ship Repair; National Steel & Shipbuilding Co.; Northville Industries; Port of Astoria, OR; Port of Portland, OR; Shipbuilders Council of America.  Mr. President, these are just a few of the people, including labor unions, who stand strong in opposition to lifting the ban on Alaskan oil. I think some of the unions that have written to me have very clearly defined why they oppose this bill. I again do this because I heard my colleague from Alaska say that unions support this legislation.  Let me read one from the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers written to Mr. Robert Georgine, president of AFL-CIO.       Dear Mr. Georgine: I understand that an amendment may be      offered * * * to the maritime reform bill that would      eliminate restrictions on the export of Alaska oil. We are      told Senator Stevens is planning to offer the change when the      Senate Commerce Committee takes up the measure.       Our organization strongly opposes this amendment. Exporting      Alaska crude oil across the Pacific would place 500 to 800      jobs at the Portland Ship Yard at extreme risk because the      ships used to export the oil would be repaired in foreign      ship yards, rather than here at home as they are today. The      jobs of more local subcontractors also would be threatened as      well as several thousand refinery jobs on the West Coast.       The proponents of exporting Alaskan oil are the State of      Alaska, which stands to gain increased severance tax revenues      from these exports, and British Petroleum, the major producer      of Alaskan North Slope oil. The losers in this proposal are      U.S. workers, U.S. energy security, and U.S. business.       As you know, the restrictions on the export of this oil      have enjoyed strong bipartisan support over the past 20      years. The last time an effort was made to remove the export      ban, the effort lost on a 70 to 20 vote.       We strongly oppose this amendment and urge you to do      whatever you can to assure that it is not added to the      maritime reform bill.  Mr. President, I have a number of letters from other unions: Sailors Union of the Pacific, Boydoco Oil & Atomic Workers, Metal Trade Union, and their message is one and the same, that union members stand strongly in opposition to the legislation that is in front of us.  Another point that my colleague from Alaska made was that the Department of Energy study supported his language in this bill. I want all of my [[Page S6670]] colleagues to understand that the Department of Energy study addressed the concerns of Alaska and California.  I, too, read that report in its entirety, and it does not address the issues that are important to Washington State, to Oregon, and indeed to the rest of the Nation. It is written in perspective as to what will be good for Alaska and California. I think it is very important to point out that the Clinton administration is not in support as was earlier indicated by my colleague from Alaska. The Clinton administration is not in support as the language stands in front of us right now. They believe that several important concerns need to be addressed, including job protection and environmental issues, before they are willing to endorse it, despite the DOE study. So I remind my colleagues this is not supported by the Clinton administration at this time. They have said that they have very serious concerns and are not supporting it as it is presently drafted.  I also would like to point out the environmental concerns because I can speak for the jobs in my State, and certainly the Senator from Oregon, Senator Hatfield, will speak in terms of jobs from Portland. But the issue that has not been spoken to here is the issue of environmental concern.  I heard my colleague from Alaska say earlier this morning that this bill in front of us is the first step in increasing domestic oil production. I fear, and I feel many of my colleagues fear, that the second step will be lifting the ban on oil drilling off the coast of Alaska, in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. ANWR has been a debate on this floor for many years. Allowing oil drilling there has been debated and defeated many times. Many of us fear that this is, as my colleague from Alaska said, the first step, and the second step will be drilling off the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. And I know most of my colleagues do not want to see that occur. I think that is a real concern particularly since the budget that was passed out of the Budget Committee last week has an assumption in it that in order to get to the balanced budget one of the things we are going to do is allow oil drilling off Alaska. That is how we are going to balance the budget.  So it is a very real concern. We do not need to pass the first step here in this legislation and pass the second step in the Budget Committee, and I will oppose that as adamantly as I oppose the bill in front of us.  I do want to read to this body a letter from the Wilderness Society, Sierra Club, Friends of the Earth, Natural Resources Defense Council, Alaska Wilderness League, and the American Oceans Campaign, because I think it very clearly states for all of us what our environmental concerns should be.  This was written last year, June 23, 1994.       Dear Senator: The Senate will soon be asked to consider an      amendment to the Export Administration Act to end the ban on      the export of North Slope Alaskan crude oil. We urge you to      oppose lifting the export ban for the following environmental      reasons:       Ending the oil export ban would increase development      pressure for sensitive areas like the Arctic National      Wildlife Refuge. It is also likely to increase pressure for      oil development in fragile areas off the shores of Alaska and      California. The expanded development pressure would result      from expanded markets, increases in the wellhead price of oil      per barrel, and faster depletion of North Slope fields. It is      a serious concern that lifting the ban could give nations      like Japan a vested interest in our natural resource      decisions in Alaska. As long as sensitive areas like the      Arctic Refuge and sensitive areas offshore California and      Alaska are still not permanently protected from oil and gas      development, lifting the export ban is a dangerous idea.       Ending the ban is nonsense energy policy. It would be a      dramatic reversal of a national policy we thought Congress      had long ago resolved. Lifting the oil export ban is      inconsistent with any attempt at conservation of domestic oil      for domestic use.       No environmental analysis has been done on ending the ban.      Lifting the ban would open the door to tankers nearly twice      as large. More traffic in Prince William Sound would pose      greater risks from spills. Changed tanker routes would make      Kodiak Island and the fisheries of the Bering Sea more      vulnerable to chronic and disastrous spills.       Ending the oil export ban could increase the flow through      the aging and poorly-maintained Trans-Alaska Pipeline. A      major audit recently conducted by the Bureau of Land      Management said that the pipeline system poses imminent      threats to public and worker safety and the environment.      Until the government ensures that the more than 10,000 safety      problems with the pipeline are repaired, and that the ballast      water treatment and air pollution problems at the Valdez      marine terminal are resolved, the Congress should not take      actions that could increase the environmental and safety      risks.       Lifting the oil export ban would increase oil imports into      the United States. Because refineries aren't set up to refine      the heavier oil produced in California, the Alaska shortfall      would be made up by imports which more closely match the      Alaska oil density. This means that more foreign-flagged      tankers, with less stringent manning standards than U.S.      flagged tankers, would be calling on West Coast ports.      Because increased imports would be necessary to replace the      oil that could now be exported to the Far East, our trade      balance would not improve and at the same time we would have      less control over our U.S. domestic oil supplies.       Ending the oil export ban breaks the promise Congress made      to the American People over 20 years ago. At that time,      Congress sacrificed Arctic wilderness and put Prince William      Sound at risk of tanker spills, but said that the North Slope      oil was only to go to U.S. markets. In 1973, Vice President      Spiro Agnew went to the Senate floor to cast the tie-breaking      vote which ended the intense debate over approval of the      Trans-Alaska Pipeline. The oil export ban was a crucial part      of the deal Congress brokered. Congress chose to override      pending legal challenges to the pipeline, proclaiming the      environmental impact statement to be adequate even though the      major issue of risks to the marine environment from tankers      was poorly considered.       If Congress breaks the deal now and lifts the oil export      ban, foreign oil companies like British Petroleum would reap      the largest benefits, and the American consumers would be the      biggest losers. It would be ironic for Congress to unravel      this deal at the same time as Alaskan jurors found Exxon      reckless and as 10,000 fishermen and Native residents finally      have their day in court.       We urge you to oppose lifting the ban on exports of North      Slope crude oil.  Again, that is signed by the Wilderness Society, National Resources Defense Council, Friends of the Earth, Sierra Club, Alaska Wilderness League, and American Oceans Campaign.  I think this letter very clearly points out to all of us that this is a major step and can put a lot of us at risk and our environment at risk that many of us care about.  It is not a step that should be taken willy-nilly on a Monday, when people are not prepared to think about the long-term, serious consequences. That is why I came to the floor this morning at 9:30 to protest moving to this bill, because it has not gone through the Banking Committee where the Export Administration Act has had jurisdiction over this for a long time.  I do believe we have to look much more carefully at all of the conditions that are put forth in this and all of the consequences that many of us will have to suffer for a long time to come if the Senate, in its haste to get legislation passed, does so without considering the consequences to many of us.  Mr. President, I would also like to read into the Record a statement by the Wilderness Society and the Alaska Wilderness League that I think points to what the environmental impacts of ending the ban on Alaska North Slope crude oil exports will cause.  ``The Department of Energy's claims about environmental impacts are misleading,'' which refers back to the DOE study.       DOE hastily included 2 pages of ``environmental      implications'' in its report on the economics of ending the      oil export ban which were not supported by any analysis or      factual substantiation. The Administration has failed to      carry out comprehensive environmental analysis required by      the National Environmental Policy Act.       Ending the oil export ban would increase development      pressure for sensitive areas like the Arctic National      Wildlife Refuge. It is also likely to increase pressure for      oil development in fragile areas off the shores of Alaska and      California. If the 20-year export ban is lifted, its effects      will be long lasting. Expanded development pressure as      projected by DOE would result in faster depletion of domestic      oil resources. It is naive at best to believe that the oil      industry won't battle to gain access to these ``off-limits''      areas when economic and political factors are right. As long      as these sensitive areas are still not permanently protected      from oil and gas development, lifting the export ban is a      dangerous idea.       Environmental and safety problems plaguing the Trans-Alaska      Pipeline System (TAPS) should be fixed before considering      lifting the ban. It is true that the same old TAPS      infrastructure will continue to be used for exported oil, and      increased flow due to the new markets would increase the      risks. According to a major audit recently done for the      Bureau of Land Management, ``the pipeline system poses      imminent threats to public and worker safety and the      environment.'' More than 10,000 problems were identified,      [[Page S6671]] including ``massive violations of the National      Electrical Code.'' The ballast water treatment plant at the      Valdez terminal is currently inadequate to handle large      volumes of the ballast water which must be removed from cargo      tanks before they are filled with oil, and bigger tankers may      call at the port if the ban is lifted.       The oil industry should not be rewarded with higher profits      from shipping North Slope oil at the same time it is      requesting exemptions from environmental laws. Alyeska, which      runs the pipeline for British Petroleum and the other oil      company owners, has for years avoided limiting air pollution      caused by fumes that are released during tanker loading and      recently requested a 12-year delay in meeting air pollution      standards for the nation's largest tanker terminal at Valdez.      Already, air emissions account annually for over 45,000 tons      of pollutants such as cancer-causing benzene, and the      terminal is the largest source of volatile organic compounds      in the nation.       Exports will expose new areas of U.S. coastlines in Alaska      to increased risk of oil spills. Changed tanker routes would      put Kodiak Island, the Aleutian chain, and the rich fisheries      of the Bering Sea at greatly increased risk of chronic and      disastrous oil spills. Tankers would still travel through      Prince William Sound, placing it at high risk from new spills      even as this area still suffers from the effects of the Exxon      Valdez. Dumping of the segregated ballast water picked up      from foreign ports could introduce exotic organisms that have      serious environmental consequences. Lifting the ban would      open the door to tankers twice as large.       Serious risks to California's coastal environment have been      ignored. Increased imports to California replacing North      Slope crude shipments would involve much larger foreign      tankers. Because of port and draft restrictions at the      refineries, there would be increased risks of oil spills      because there would need to be lightering, the transfer of      oil from the larger tankers to smaller vessels which bring it      into port, and therefore an increased number of times cargo      is offloaded. The lightering would be conducted by foreign      vessels which are less fully exposed to liability claims      under OPA-90 than U.S. companies. Increased refining of      California heavy crude would result in increased foreign      tanker traffic in California waters to export the byproducts      such as residual oil which would be produced in excess of      California demand.       Lifting the ban will not help the U.S. meet its commitments      to reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions. DOE states thermal      enhanced oil recovery in California would increase such      emissions, but dismisses the amounts as trivial. However, DOE      energy policy should be to achieve further reductions, not to      justify increases, in order to fulfill U.S. obligations under      the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change and to      achieve President Clinton's goals in the Climate Action Plan      to reduce emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000.  Mr. President, these are just some of the environmental concerns that we have before us, but they seriously point out the questions that all of us should be asking and have answers to before this ban on oil is lifted from Alaska's North Slope.  Certainly I heard my colleague from Alaska speak this morning about a DOE report and referred to it a number of times as what the basis should be that we vote on, the current amendment before us.  As I indicated earlier, the administration is not supportive of the language as we currently see it before us on the floor because they do have concerns still about jobs and environmental impact. But I want to read to this body a letter from someone who agrees with me on the DOE report. He happens to be a former adviser to the Governor of Alaska. So he is from that region; he is a former adviser to the Governor.  His name is Richard Fineberg, and he lives in Alaska. He says:     Re Exporting Alaska North Slope Crude Oil.       Dear Secretary O'Leary: I read with great interest and      disappointment your department's report, ``Exporting Alaska      North Slope Crude Oil.'' As a former advisor to the Governor      of Alaska on oil and gas issues who subsequently prepared      several reports for the Alaska State Legislature on North      Slope economic issues, I had hoped that your report would      answer many important questions about Alaskan oil      development. I was disappointed because the report's      conclusions appear to be critically dependent on buried,      dubious or false assumptions that undercut the validity of      the report's conclusions.  Again, I remind the body I am reading from a letter of Richard Fineberg, who is former adviser to the Governor of Alaska. These are his words, not mine:       . . . dubious or false assumptions that undercut the      validity of the report's conclusions. For example:       The report asserts that Alaska would gain $700 million to      $1.6 billion in revenues between 1994 and 2000 if the ban      were lifted, and that under low-price scenarios most of that      gain would come in 1994-96. Having prepared numerous reports      on North Slope profits, production prospects and Alaska      revenues since leaving my position in the governor's office      in 1989, I must say that these poorly explained estimates      appear to be highly implausible. Moreover, 1994 is nearly      two-thirds over and if the ban were lifted, ANS sellers and      refiners would then require some time to revise contracts,      arrange shipments and reconfigure their refinery outputs.      With most of 1994 gone, how much of this theoretical amount      remains to be captured and how much is already lost to      history? I cannot make that calculation because I read the      report from cover to cover but could never discover the bases      for the $700 to $1.6 billion estimate.  Again, this is someone who is an expert on Alaskan export of oil.  He goes on to say:       Although there is a known, fixed relationship between      federal income taxes and state revenues on ANS production at      the DOE study prices, the DOE report inexplicably estimates      federal gains to be well outside that predictable range, at      $99 to $188 million. This leads me to believe the DOE report      either omitted federal income taxes or did not account for      them correctly. In either event, it would appear that      producer gains (and, consequently, jobs) may have been over-     stated because federal tax effects were not considered, and      that federal gains may have been understated. This is      precisely the kind of ambiguity that would lead a careful      reader to view with great skepticism the conclusions of the      DOE report.       Regarding incremental North Slope production that might      result from lifting the ban, your authors note that ``If      exports of ANS crude oil raise crude oil prices or save on      costs of shipping and handling, the resulting revenues may be      invested in oil production-related projects in the      geographical areas where the new profits are made. This is      particularly true for small companies, but less so for the      major integrated companies.'' (Report, page E-1.) In a      footnote, the report states that ``The large ANS producers      made it clear in our interviews that they . . . would not      necessarily reinvest in Alaska the incremental revenues made      as a result of exporting ANS oil.'' The same section presents      increased production rates resulting from the ``reasonable''      assumption ``that all incremental revenues for the remaining      producers' share is invested in ANS crude production      activities that add to reserves'' (major producers Arco and      Exxon--45% of ANS production--are      factored out because their oil is transferred rather than      sold, leaving BP as the remaining major producer). Because      major producer BP owns 91% of the remaining production, by      its own terms the report's key assumption on reinvestment      is clearly not reasonable.       The report notes that data ``imply that reserve additions      in the range of 200 to 400 million barrels could be produced      by the investment resulting from exports of . . . ANS crude.      Buy comparison, [c]urrent reserves at Endicott and Point      McIntyre, major secondary fields on the North Slope, are 262      and 356 million barrels respectively.'' (Report, at p. 12 and      p. 50). For some reason, the report makes no reference to the      largest major secondary field on the North Slope, Kuparuk,      whose remaining reserves are three times that of the two      fields named in the report. Is there a reason for this? The      report's second Kuparuk omission referred the reader again to      Appendix E--the same place at which the dubious assumptions      noted above are supposed to be demonstrated; nothing in that      appendix told me whether Kuparuk was included or excluded      from your analysis, or why it was omitted from the text.       I am limiting myself here to clearly demonstrable examples      because time is short; some in your department seem to be      rushing toward a decision on BP's behalf. I write, therefore,      to make sure that you are aware that the DOE report released      June 30 appears to be laced with significant technical      defects. These shortcomings make it difficult for me to      accept the conclusions one must adopt to assume the economic      benefits your report claims the United States will realize      from lifting the ban. The reader is asked to believe that      California refinery acquisition costs can go up without      affecting consumer gasoline prices, and that ANS will realize      a premium in Japan because its product slate matches Japan's      needs. While I am not prepared to state that such heroic      assumptions are invalid, it is my opinion that this report      fails to demonstrate them. These assumptions are contradicted      by the Coalition to Keep Alaska Oil's June 1994 report,      ``Consequences of Exporting Alaska North Slope Crude Oil.'' I      do not presume to know who is correct. But I must tell you      that the latter report is strikingly accurate in those areas      with which I am familiar. More important, the challenging      report is much less dependent on the kind of Herculean and      undocumented assumptions required to reach the conclusions in      the DOE report.  I will continue reading and remind my colleagues that I am reading from a letter directly about the DOE's study that has been referenced throughout speech of the Senator from Alaska and kept referring to it. I wanted someone who is an expert from Alaska to respond to that. I will read the last of this letter:       The latter report also sets up the background of raising      environmental concerns [[Page S6672]] that are casually      dismissed by the DOE report: In particular, California supply      ports, pipelines, refinery storage facilities and refinery      operations appear to be at risk. And, as my colleague Dr.      Riki Ott of Cordova, Alaska, has previously advised you, the      DOE report also dismisses serious environmental concerns in      Alaska concerning the integrity of the Alaska pipeline and      marine transportation delivery system. As a long-time      Alaskan, I share Dr. Ott's interests in the environmental      issues the DOE report fails to address. But it is the      manifest shortcomings in the DOE economic analysis that lead      me to ask you to base your decision on better data than the      report you released June 30.       In sum, I do not believe your department's report provides      sound bases for its fundamental conclusions and      recommendations. In view of the undiscussed problems      associated with lifting the export ban and the absence of      convincing support for taking this action, I oppose lifting      the ban at this time and request that you address the      implications of the DOE report's serious defects before      making your decision.  It is signed Richard Fineberg.  Again, I would like my colleagues to know that the arguments in favor of lifting the ban have referenced a report from DOE that I have just read a letter from, an expert from Alaska who says that a lot of the assumptions are incorrect. In addition, the Clinton administration itself does not support the language that is in front of us because it still does not address many of their environmental and job issues.  I also heard my colleague from Alaska speak about the jobs that would be brought if this legislation is passed. I believe he referenced the number 25,000. From the perspective of the State of Washington, we have many people employed in our independent refineries. I know Senator Hatfield from Oregon will be out here in a few minutes to talk about jobs in his State of Oregon. But while he is on his way, I want to share with my colleagues an article called ``Alaskan Oil Exports Will Eliminate U.S. Shipyard Jobs.''  There has been some question on whether or not jobs would be eliminated in the United States if this oil ban is lifted. I want to read this study to you by the Portland shipyard Port of Portland:       The recommendation of the Department of Energy study on      Alaskan--to lift the twenty-year-old restriction on the      exports of that would a eliminate hundreds of shipyard jobs.      First, it will cause a severe reduction in the U.S. flag      tanker fleet. DOE--  This refers back to the report.     assumes that exported oil will be carried on Jones Act ships,      but Senators proposing that the ban be lifted would only      require that the oil be carried on U.S. flagships, not on      Jones Act ships. This means they need not be repaired in U.S.      yards. This means lost of jobs in our shipyards here in the      United States.  Mr. President, I note the presence of my colleague, Senator Hatfield, on the floor. He is a cosponsor of legislation I introduced earlier. I will yield the floor at this time for him to make his remarks.
