 President, when Americans hear ``USO,'' they often think of Bob Hope. There is no question that he helped to lift the spirits of countless men and women in uniform, but the USO impacts military personnel in a number of other important ways, too, which is something it has been doing literally for decades--in fact, 75 years to the day. I think every colleague will join me in commemorating this impressive 75-year history.  Our men and women in uniform sacrifice a great deal to defend us, and so do their families. One of the things the USO excels at is helping them to stay connected--connected to hometowns, connected to loved ones, connected to the simpler joys in life. From providing deployed soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines with an opportunity to phone home, to providing world-class entertainment, to helping servicemembers find meaningful employment once their service is complete, the USO's mission is broad in scope and has made a lasting and positive impact on many since it was first conceived just before World War II. Much of that credit is due to Americans' willingness to volunteer.  Our military personnel--especially our forward deployed and combat arms units--willingly trade the comforts of home for harsh living conditions. They often forgo life's precious moments, such as celebrating a child's birthday or a first day at school, and they are willing to put everything on the line for us. The USO provides one more platform to say ``thank you'' for that service, to show gratitude for that sacrifice, to let every man and woman in uniform know what they mean to us.  Congratulations to the USO for 75 years of service to our troops and their families. We hope you will continue your important work for many years to come.                          ____________________
