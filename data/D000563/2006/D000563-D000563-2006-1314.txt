President, here is what I understand the law to be and what your amendment says. The law, as I understand it, is if you are in the United States on a student visa from a foreign country, you are required to be a full-time student and to stay. If you are failing a course, you drop out of the course, you are no longer a full-time student and, therefore, you are ineligible to stay on a student visa. At that point, you are subject to a final order of removal which means you can be deported from this country, having a presence in this country that is not recognized by your student visa because you dropped the course.  Now let me read what your amendment says. It says:       An alien is ineligible for conditional nonimmigrant work      authorization and status under this section if the alien is      subject to a final order of removal.
