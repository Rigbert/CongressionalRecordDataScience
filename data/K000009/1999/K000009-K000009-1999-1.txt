Speaker, I just wanted to, as we close out this first session of the 106th Congress, and we close out this century, extend my deepest appreciation on behalf of the people of Ohio and, by affiliation, the people of Michigan, Indiana and Illinois to the chairman, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Hansen), who could not have been more diligent in working with us, and the ranking member, the gentleman from California (Mr. George Miller), to permit the people of our region of the United States to tell the full story of our history, the battle that occurred on this site and the assumption of the northwest territory and the opening of our entire region of the Nation to settlement.  I cannot thank the gentlemen enough on behalf of the people of the Buckeye State and our adjoining sister States for making this possible, before this century ends.  Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today is a matter of great significance to the American Midwest and to the 9th District of Ohio in particular. The bill under consideration today, Senator DeWine's S. 548, is the companion to legislation I have introduced in the House, H.R. 868. I wish to thank Senator DeWine for taking the lead on this measure in the Senate.  Some authorities place the Battle of Fallen Timbers among the three most important battles in the formation of the United States, alongside the battles of Yorktown and Gettysburg. We should note that the Battle of Fallen Timbers did secure and open a large territory--now embracing parts of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, and Illinois--for new settlements in our fledgling nation.  Another, contemporary battle should also be recognized here today. That is the struggle for national recognition of the Battle of Fallen Timbers as a keystone in the Maumee Valley and the Midwest.  In 1991, I was able to secure authorization in the Interior Appropriations bill for the National Park Service to assess the Maumee River Heritage Corridor for historically significant sites. The first site assessed was the Fallen Timbers battlefield.  We will hear later this morning from two people who have served in that more recent battle, Dr. G. Michael Pratt from Heidelberg College and Jean Ward, Director of Metroparks of the Toledo Area. Dr. Pratt heads the Center for Historic and Military Archeology. He led the archaeological study that definitively located the Fallen Timbers Battlefield site. Jean Ward has served the Toledo area as director of its park system for more than 30 years. Toledo Metroparks manages over 7,000 acres of parkland and historic sites in Lucas County.                      The Battle of Fallen Timbers  In 1794, the line of control between British forces and their Native American allies and the forces of the United States lay across the ``Foot of the Rapids'' on the Maumee River. On August 20, 1794, General Anthony Wayne led his legion down the Maumee River valley from near what is now Waterville, Ohio. Coming to an area where a recent storm had toppled much of the forest, Wayne's leading elements were engaged by about 1,100 warriors from a confederacy of Ohio and Great Lakes tribes. The U.S. soldiers fell back to their main lines and a pitched battle surged back and forth over the ``fallen timbers.'' Finally, a concerted charge by the entire legion drove the Native Americans back to within sight of Fort Miamis to the northeast, and their resistance dissipated.  The Native American coalition included members of the Wyandot, Miami, Ottawa, Delaware, Mingo, Shawnee, Potawatomi, andChippewa tribes as well as a few Canadian militia.  The battle was a clear victory for the United States, a policy failure for the British, and a disaster for the Native American Confederacy. The resultant Treaty of Greenville in 1795 gained the City of Detroit, then the largest city on the Great Lakes and secured much of the Northwest Territory for the growing United States.  I am holding here a typical U.S. Department of Defense sketch of the Battle of Fallen Timbers that has been widely displayed in Army installations across our nation for decades.  In addition to the battlefield, the Historic Site would include the nearby site of Fort Miamis, which played a role not only in the Wayne campaign but also in the War of 1812. In the spring  of 1813, British forces landed troops and artillery on the site of the deteriorated Fort Miamis on the lower Maumee River. Together with Shawnee Chief Tecumseh, the British twice attacked the American garrison at Fort Meigs--another military outpost along the Maumee River--and twice were repulsed. These U.S. victories at Fort Meigs frustrated British attempts to regain the Northwest Territory and were a prelude to the victory of Commodore Perry's Battle of Lake Erie victory later in 1813, a large mural of which hangs just outside the House chamber.                     the battle for fallen timbers  The people of northwest Ohio have long held a strong interest in the history of our region and, in particular, in the battle that won the territory for the United States. In the mid-1930's, a 9-acre site on the banks of the Maumee River then thought to be the location of the Battle of Fallen Timbers was dedicated and a statue commemorating the battle erected. As interest in preserving both our local history and natural areas grew earlier this decade, I was able to secure the authorization for a resource study of the Fallen Timbers area by the National Park Service as part of a possible Maumee River Valley Heritage Corridor that lies between Toledo, Ohio, and Fort Wayne, Indiana. It remains one of the most scenic and bucolic stretches in the Midwest.  Beginning in 1995, an archaeological investigation led by Dr. Pratt set out to identify the exact location of the battle. Dr. Pratt's excellent work has proven conclusively that the battle actually took place some distance from the existing Fallen Timbers Monument. Development is beginning to encroach on the battlefield site, but a significant portion of the core battlefield is still in agricultural use and owned by the City of Toledo.  It is that site, along with the Monument site and the Fort Miamis site, that this legislation would establish as a National Historic Site and an interpretive locus for the entire heritage corridor.  Most impressive, however, has been the outpouring of grassroots interest in the Battle of Fallen Timbers and the preservation of its sites. Our office has received hundreds of letters supporting preservation of these sites including this batch of drawings of Fort Miamis sent by the students at the Fort Miami School in Maumee, Ohio. Local press coverage has been extensive.  We should particularly note the efforts of Marianne Duvendack and the Fallen Timbers Battlefield Commission. The Commission has produced a flyer describing the battle and its historic significance. It has also produced an excellent video presentation in support of preservation.  Another person whose efforts must not be forgotten is the former Mayor of the City of Maumee, Steve Pauken. His tireless efforts contributed as much as anyone's to saving Fallen Timbers.  Others that have contributed financial, individual, and organizational resources to the effort include the Ohio Historical Society, the City of Maumee, the City of Toledo, the Maumee Valley Heritage Corridor, Heidelberg College, Toledo Metroparks, and the Toledo Blade and its editorial staff, particularly Ralph Johnson.  The Fallen Timbers Battlefield was listed as number two on the 1996 list of the ten most endangered National Historic Landmarks in a report by the National Park Service. It was included in the 1959 National Survey of Historic Sites and Buildings as one of 22 sites representing the national historic theme ``The Advance of the Frontier, 1763-1830.'' It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960 as ``the culminating event which demonstrated the tenacity of the American people in their efforts of western expansion through the struggle for dominance in the Old Northwest Territory.''  The National Park Service Resource Study concluded that the Fallen Timbers Battlefield site would be ``eligible, suitable, and feasible for recognition as an affiliated area of the National Park System if the 185-acre core battlefield can be acquired for preservation purposes.'' The House should know that we have the commitments of the State of Ohio, the City of Toledo, and the City of Maumee to see this project through to completion.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of our colleagues to support this bill which helps complete the appreciation of our nation's early history.
