 President, before I comment on the Senate Committee on Finance portion of the Deficit Reduction Act, I will go over some ground that has been covered by other Members on our side of the aisle through this chart or similar charts, to point out how three entitlement programs--Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--as a percentage of the gross domestic product are going to continue to grow and grow and grow until reaching a point where it squeezes out almost everything else in the Federal budget.  This is already legislated.
