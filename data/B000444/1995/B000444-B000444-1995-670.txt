 I have no intention of objecting, if they can agree, and I would just like to point out, as back in the bad old days when I was chairman of the committee, this floor never agreed to the amendments from the Judiciary Committee on a bill.  So it is a practice that maybe we should establish, but in my experience in 6 years as chairman of that committee I can never remember one single occasion when I came to the floor where we routinely agreed to the committee amendments from the Judiciary Committee.  I yield the floor.
