 But regretfully, where we are is cloture on this Transportation bill will be viewed as a question of whether we intend to keep the commitment we made to the American people 2 years ago this month to reduce $2.1 trillion in spending over the next 10 years.  The House of Representatives is marking to a $91 billion-a-year lower figure which reflects the law. I believe that if we invoke cloture on this bill and move forward, it will be widely viewed throughout the country that we are walking away from the commitment we made, on a bipartisan basis, that the President signed just 2 years ago, that we would reduce spending by this amount of money, $2.1 trillion over the next 10 years.  Regretfully, I would strongly urge my colleagues to keep the bipartisan commitment we made 2 years ago and to vote no on cloture on this bill.  I yield the floor.
