Speaker, the architects of this appropriation bill have been sipping Potomac water entirely too long. They are out of touch with what the real problems are in America and the real challenges facing working families.  One can judge the priorities of the Republican leadership by their choices in spending. Let me tell you what they think are lower priorities, things that we should cut in today's America: They want to cut the School to Work Program, a program to give high school graduates adequate skills and training so that they can get good paying jobs; they want to cut programs like the Safe and Drug Free Schools Act. Did I miss the headline that said America is now in control of the drug problem, that we no longer have to worry about violence in our schools? I think to the contrary, American families know this is still a serious challenge. Our government and our people need to make a commitment to solving this problem. The Republican appropriation bill runs away from it.  They freeze the Head Start Program, a program which takes kids 3, 4, and 5 years old, and gives them a chance, and they turn around and make deep cuts in environmental protection, programs that we count on to make sure that the water we drink is safe and the air we breathe is clean.  These are the priorities of the Republican leadership, cutting work training, cutting education, cutting the environment, cutting back on programs that really help America's working families.  The unkindest cut of all is cuts in college student loans. How many young men and women from working families will be denied a chance for higher education because of these Republican cuts in college student loans?  This is not what America bargained for in the 1994 election. The Republican spending priorities reflect their values, but not the values of the working families in this country.
