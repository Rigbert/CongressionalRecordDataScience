 President, today I read a story in the Washington Times that ought to absolutely outrage every Member of this body. It should also outrage the American people. The article is entitled ``Democrats Stymie Effort to Pay Travelgate Legal Fees.'' It is written by Mr. Paul Bedard.  The story is about how Democrat Senators are secretly trying to pull the plug on a Republican bill to pay legal fees for this person. The bill would help undo some of the damage that the Clinton White House perpetrated against seven innocent employees of the White House travel office. Mr. Billy Dale was the head of that office. He is the most prominent of the seven and the most harassed by the White House. The bill would restore only a small part of the economic damage done to these citizens and their families. It would simply pay their legal fees. It would do little or nothing to restore their reputations, their dignity, their psychological trauma, or their faith in their Government, especially in this White House.  Now, to make matters worse, Mr. President, the Democrats want to takeaway their legal fees, too. This, of course, is adding insult to injury. By their putting a stop to this bill, the Democrats would deprive these seven of legal fees, even after it has been shown that the seven should not have been targets of the Clintons in the first place.  These seven innocent--let me repeat, innocent--workers were given their walking papers so a Clinton family member and a rich Hollywood crony and a Clinton contributor could reap spoils for themselves. The seven became unjust targets of the enormous power of the Federal Government. Their rights were trampled all over.  Why should our Democrat colleagues be trying to secretly kill the legal fees for the Travelgate seven? Here is what Mr. Bedard of the Washington Times says: ``A Senate leadership official said Democrats hope to kill the aid for Mr. Dale in order to save the President the embarrassment of having to sign it.''  Mr. President, that is no justification whatever. If that is the justification, then that explains why this effort is being done in the secrecy of the back room. First, the President fails to take responsibility for his actions. He points the finger and blames the firings of the Travelgate seven on others. Now it appears that his lieutenants do his bidding to stop the legal fee bill, once again failing to take responsibility as a President of the United States for his own actions.  This is precisely why I have often repeated on this floor my observation that there is an absence of moral leadership coming from this White House. If there was ever an appropriate illustration of what I am talking about, this clandestine maneuvering on the Travelgate bill is it. If all of this is true, these Senators are doing the President of the United States a disservice, as well as Mr. Dale, and the President would best show some leadership by standing up and saying he wants no part of this effort to harass these citizens any longer.  In the Travelgate case, the President and First Lady already have been accused of coverup, damage control, stonewalling, a failure of moral leadership, cronyism, nepotism and, most importantly, a breach of public trust.  Why should these Senators, whom I assume are allies of the President, want to add to this list of accusations legislative as well?  It is all right for the President of the United States to create a fund and have his own legal fees paid by lobbyists, cronies, and high rollers. But if the average ``Joe Citizen'' wants and deserves to be made whole in the face of Federal harassment, he gets, as Mr. Dale has found, the plug pulled on him secretly behind closed doors.  I submit that the harassment of Billy Dale by the Democrats continues. First, it was the Clinton White House doing it to Mr. Dale. Then it was the FBI and the Federal prosecutors. Now it is friends of the President in the U.S. Senate. It seems like everybody in Government is in a league together to frustrate an attempt to help make Mr. Dale whole--at least economically. There is no way you are going to help him with all these other problems he has.  I will urge our leaders--meaning our Republican leaders in this body--to lift up this rock to the light of day and see who scurries away from the refuge of secrecy, closed doors, and the dark. I will urge that a full public debate be allowed on this bill, followed by a recorded vote instead of a voice vote. Let those who are doing their work behind the scenes face the American people and make their case in public.  This is a fairly outrageous position for anybody to take, particularly since the President is trying to get his legal bills paid by donations from his friends. Now, this is outrageous. I have not seen a whole lot like it in the 15 years I have been here. This is not a debate about corporate or trade associations or labor organizations or large grassroots organizations; this is a debate about doing justice for just one person--a man who was wrongly accused and harassed by our Federal Government.  Mr. President, in a sense, this is a debate about our moral leaders in the White House. Mr. Dale and his family have been left financially, emotionally, and psychologically drained. Since a Federal jury acquitted Mr. Dale after all of 2 hours of deliberations, how can anyone in this body defend such action? One thing is for sure: I do not think the people will want to defend such action in public. In that, I have much confidence.  I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Times, May 2, 1993]        Democrats Stymie Effort to Pay ``Travelgate'' Legal Fees                            (By Paul Bedard)       Senate Democrats have ganged up in secret to block      legislation that would pay off ``Travelgate'' figure Billy R.      Dale's $500,000 legal bill in an apparent effort to shield      the president from further embarrassment in the scandal.       Senate leadership sources said yesterday that Sen. David      Pryor of Arkansas, a close ally of the president, put a      confidential ``hold'' on the bill, blocking it from being      considered by the Senate.       They said Mr. Pryor, who is retiring this year, then passed      the hold to other Democrats, and they have kept the      legislation from being considered for passage in a voice      vote.       Pryor spokesman Beau Morrison denied that the senator now      has a hold on the bill, adding that a senator's privilege to      put a hold on legislation is supposed to be confidential.       Senate protocol allows any member to place a confidential      hold on any legislation for any reason. Democratic senators      recently tried to kill that rule.       ``Pryor did put a hold on it, and we expect another      Democrat to drop one on it now that you have caught wind of      it,'' a Republican source said.       Mr. Dale accumulated legal bills of $500,000 in defending      himself against two counts of embezzlement that followed his      surprise ouster as White House travel office director May 19,      1993. A U.S. District Court jury took two hours to acquit him      after a three-week trail.       The firings of Mr. Dale and his six aides sparked the      Travelgate scandal.       A House panel is investigating a former senior White House      aide's accusation that first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton      demanded the firings in order to make room for Clinton      associates. Mrs. Clinton has denied the charge.       Republicans upset with Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole's      refusal to force the issue on the Senate floor yesterday      urged the likely GOP presidential nominee to bring the      legislation to a vote.       ``Please do whatever you can to bring this bill to the      floor, thus allowing those opponents the opportunity to make      their arguments in public, in the light of day,'' Sens.      Christopher S. Bond, Missouri Republican, and Richard C.      Shelby, Alabama Republican, wrote to Mr. Dole in a letter      provided to The Washington Times.       ``The careers of seven long-time employees were put in      jeopardy, their finances devastated and their reputation      forever stained. And now a simple bill designated to attempt      to right one of the wrongs perpetrated against these seven      employees is being held up by at least one Democrat      senator,'' they wrote.       ``We believe the `Travel Office Seven' has suffered      enough--this bipartisan, widely supported bill should be      allowed to pass.''       The House in March voted 350-43 to pay Mr. Dale's bills.      Swift Senate action was promised--along with presidential      approval--but the bill was stopped dead by Democratic      opposition.       The House and Senate previously approved a $150,000 bill to      help cover the legal bills of the other travel office      workers.       Unless Mr. Dole pushes the bill Republicans expect the hold      ``to continue until we begin putting pressure on the      Democrats,'' Senate leadership official said ``We should be      going to the floor every day to force and embarrass the      Democrats, but we aren't there yet.''       The official said Senate Democrats hope to kill the aid for      Mr. Dale in order to save the president the embarrassment of      having to sign it. Mr. Clinton has said he will sign it, but      he isn't pushing Democrats to let the bill go.
