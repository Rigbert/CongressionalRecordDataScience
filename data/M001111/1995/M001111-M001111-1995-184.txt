 President. I thank my colleague from California, Senator Boxer, for this amendment and for her very well-stated words on this issue. I hope that all of our colleagues took the time to listen to what she had to say. She stated it very clearly for all of us why we need this amendment to exempt the Mammography Quality Standards Act regulations from the requirements of S. 343.  I think we all know that breast cancer has taken the lives of far too many women, and the long list of those who have died include many of my own friends. I am sure everyone on this floor knows of someone who has been touched by breast cancer. It is a growing health concern and problem in this Nation, and it is a great threat to women's health. It is estimated that during the 1990's, nearly 2 million women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 460,000 women will die from this deadly disease. I assure everyone listening that will include people you know--your sisters, your mothers, your daughters, your friends.  In 1992, Congress understood that and they passed the Mammography Quality Standards Act.
