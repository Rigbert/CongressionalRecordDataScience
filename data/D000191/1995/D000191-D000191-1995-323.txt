Speaker, there are those on the other side of the aisle who make light of the pending investigation on ethics of Speaker Gingrich. I believe they do so at their own peril, and in contradiction of the position taken by Representative Gingrich in July 1988.  In July 1988, Speaker Gingrich, or at that time Representative Gingrich, waxed very eloquent in a press release regarding the duties and the burdens of the Speaker and the duties and burdens of the House in investigating the Speaker of the House, and the fact that it should not be done by peers in the House of Representatives but in fact by an outside counsel, because it is so important to assure the integrity of that office.  Now, Mr. Speaker, we are confronted with a situation where several Members, several Republican Members of the Ethics Committee, have past associations with GOPAC, the secret and multi-million-dollar slush fund which is the subject of the ethics complaint.  Here we are, we have members of the committee who have a conflict of interest, who should recuse themselves, but if they recuse themselves, only new members could be appointed by the Speaker, so the Speaker in effect would be appointing his own judge and jury.  There is only one way out of this for Speaker Gingrich. That is for Speaker Gingrich to take the advice of Representative Newt Gingrich in 1988 and appoint an outside counsel, so the American people can be assured that the integrity of this office is upheld and the integrity of the U.S. Congress is upheld without any possible assertion of undue influence.                          ____________________
