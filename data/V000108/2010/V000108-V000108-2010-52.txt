Martin Luther King, Jr. and reflect on his life and work, we are reminded of the challenges that democracy poses to us and the delicate nature of liberty. Dr. King's life, and, unfortunately, his untimely death, reminds us that we must continually work to secure and protect our freedoms. Dr. King, in his courage to act, his willingness to meet challenges, and his ability to achieve, embodied all that is good and true in the battle for liberty.  The spirit of Dr. King lives on in the citizens of communities throughout our nation. It lives on in the people whose actions reflect the spirit of resolve and achievement that will help move our country into the future. In particular, several distinguished individuals from Indiana's First Congressional District will be recognized during the 31st Annual Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Breakfast on Saturday, January 16, 2010, at the Genesis Convention Center in Gary, Indiana. The Gary Frontiers Service Club, which was founded in 1952, sponsors this annual breakfast.  This year, the Gary Frontiers Service Club will pay tribute to several local individuals who have for decades unselfishly contributed to improving the quality of life for the people of Gary. Those individuals who will be recognized as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Marchers at this year's breakfast include: Ms. Ella Bush, Ph.D., Mr. Charles Deggans, Mr. Arthur Hoyle, Reverend R.T. Mitchell, and Mr. Linus Scott. Additionally, our distinguished State Senator Earline Rogers and Ms. Era C. Twyman will be honored with the prestigious Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drum Major Award, an award given out annually to outstanding individuals of the Gary community, while Mr. Claude Powers will be recognized as the 2009 Frontier of the Year.  Though very different in nature, the achievement of all these individuals reflect many of the same attributes that Dr. King possessed, as well as the values he advocated. Like Dr. King, these individuals saw challenges and faced them with unwavering strength and determination. Each one of the honored guests' greatness has been found in their willingness to serve with ``a heart full of grace and a soul generated by love.'' They set goals and work selflessly to make them a reality.  Madam Speaker, I urge you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending the Gary Frontiers Service Club officers: President Oliver J. Gilliam, Vice President James Piggee, Secretary Melvin Ward, Financial Secretary Sam Frazier, and Treasurer/Seventh District Director Floyd Donaldson, as well as Breakfast Chairman Clorius L. Lay, Videographer Otho Lyles, Master of Ceremony Alfred Hammonds, the honorees, and all other members of the service club for their initiative, determination, and dedication to serving the people of Northwest Indiana.                          ____________________
