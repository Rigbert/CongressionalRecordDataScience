 Chairman, I yield myself 15 seconds before I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler) to tell my friends that it is not accurate that under this amendment that the FBI cannot go into libraries and book stores. They sure can. They can get subpoenas. They can go to the grand jury. They can do it in the conventional way. We have no objection to that. But they cannot have a carte blanche, no probable cause to check on the reading records of the American people.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler).
