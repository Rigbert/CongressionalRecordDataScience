 President, I ask unanimous consent that there now be a period for morning business with Members to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each, and the time be considered charged against the 90 minutes provided under the unanimous consent agreement previously adopted. This period will run approximately an hour, while the negotiators work on a potential compromise between the Feinstein and Thompson amendments. We will reserve the last 30 minutes of the 90 minutes for debate on a compromise, if one develops.
