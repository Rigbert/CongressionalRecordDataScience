Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Let me say to my colleagues and to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Bonilla), our esteemed chairman of the subcommittee, that this motion is simple and to the point. It instructs our conferees to agree to the highest possible level of funding for international food programs within the scope of the conference, including the Title II Public Law 480 Food for Peace program.  Mr. Speaker, perhaps never in the history, in the recent history of our great country have we had a greater need to use our food power to build a more peaceful world. Three matters individually and collectively within our purview in this legislation justify the need for the highest possible level of funding. I just wish to mention them and make a few remarks.  The first is the Global Food for Education Initiative.  The second is the ongoing need for an expanding emergency need for food assistance for Afghan refugees and other desperate people in and around that beleaguered country.  Thirdly, to offset the administration's proposal to reduce the section 416 commodity assistance with the resultant increase in dependency on the Public Law 480 Title II program for vitally needed development assistance throughout the world.  It is interesting to think about the conditions which breed revolution and instability, and to observe how often that desperate people living in desperate conditions in the countryside provide the seed bed for political instability. If we think historically, just for a second, back to the middle part of the 20th century, the countryside became the killing fields inside what became the Soviet Union through the forced starvation of millions and millions of people by Joseph Stalin and his consequent success in gaining control over what became the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics. The countryside was dead center in what happened with control of the food supply.  If we think to China and the revolution in 1949 and the role of Mao Tse-tung in moving people back to the countryside, the rural countryside became the seed bed for the revolution and the consequences that followed, and the imposition of will over 1 billion people.  Now, today, in the Middle East, in East Africa, we have witnessed the powerful instability that can grow from food insecurity with little to eat and little to hope for; and it is not justin Afghanistan where people are at prefamine levels with millions that have fled that sad state of affairs. If we also think about the madrassas operating inside Pakistan that use the lure of milk to feed hundreds and thousands of little boys who are then systematically taught to hate anyone whose religion is unlike theirs.  Food is being used as a weapon in the conflict that we face with Enduring Freedom.                              {time}  1215  It is best that we understand it, and that we use the power that we have with our food commodities to help build a more peaceful world.  The Global Food for Education Initiative, the program so strongly supported and developed by Senators Bob Dole and George McGovern, can be an important piece of the solution.  Why can we not think about using the Global Food for Education Program to offset what the madrassas are doing in Pakistan, and to feed children out of our good will, and to provide educational opportunity to both boys and girls, and hopefully produce new political leaders for the future that will embrace the world in a more fair open manner?  This body has said we would like to see the funding for this program continued, and we would like to see permanent authorization as part of the farm bill, the authorizing legislation itself being H.R. 1700.  So we want this motion to instruct to place some responsibility on these conferees to see that the Global Food for Education Initiative, and the hard work that the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) and others have done, to make that a permanent authorization and to receive the support it deserves inside this conference.  Secondly, in terms of the starvation and pre-starvation levels that people in Afghanistan and the refugees are facing, there is no question about the ongoing immediate need for expanding emergency food programs for those refugees, whether they be inside the country, if we can find a way to deliver it, or to the adjoining nations, during our Nation's conduct of Enduring Freedom.  We know that the United Nations World Food Program has predicted that we will need to provide a minimum level of assistance for 7.5 million people, and that such aid could last for well over 1 year. Even though the administration has already suggested more resources will be provided, and has done so out of the emergency funding we adopted earlier this year, there is no doubt that more will be needed; and not only direct food, but once stability reigns again, to help people develop their own abilities to raise food so there can be a more permanent chance for development in that region.  Once we complete emergency assistance, we have to look at meaningful development assistance so we can leave the region in a more self-sustaining condition than it is in, obviously, today.  If we want to change the concerns about poverty, malnutrition, and how people are treated, including women, then we must also have long-term development goals in mind, and that is where food for peace, food for progress, section 416, are answers that make the most sense.  Finally, before yielding time, let me say that the administration's proposal to reduce section 416 commodity assistance may have made sense before September 11. I do not really think it did. But after September 11, it makes absolutely no sense at all, because it will force the resultant increase in dependency on the Public Law 480 title II program, which we need for the type of developmental assistance in the Middle East, in East Africa, and other places where instability reigns.  If we are to have longer programs that will end world hunger, a goal to which our Nation leads the world and has subscribed to throughout our existence, then we have to be sure that any emergency food assistance is followed up with a program of meaningful development assistance, and that is why these programs were invented.  This program benefits American farmers and our States seeking to develop new markets for our commodities as the largest food-producing Nation in the world, as well as the countries receiving the benefit of the program, targeted to those who are hungry in the urban areas and to development in the rural countryside, to stem the instability that we know has bred the revolutions of modern history.  Public Law 480 has a long history of turning former recipients into long-standing customers and into stable political allies.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the esteemed gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), who has been such a leader on these international food programs.  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding time to me, and I am very glad to see and strongly support this motion to instruct the conferees to support the highest level of food aid assistance.  I believe that United States food aid programs will play a critical role in averting disaster in Afghanistan and in the Near East. Even before the tragic events of September 11, the United States was the largest contributor of food and humanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistan through the United Nations World Food Program.  But I also believe that the United States should support these programs worldwide. The United States has long fought to end hunger and poverty, and these programs are a critical part of that development effort. They reflect the compassionate, humanitarian character of the American people.  As my colleagues know, along with the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) and the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Emerson) and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Hall) and over 100 Members of this House, I support the establishment of the Global Food for Education Initiative that would fund school feeding programs around the world, including Afghanistan, Pakistan, and throughout the Mideast.  This program was inspired by two great leaders of our country, former Senators George McGovern and Bob Dole, and as I said, has enjoyed incredible bipartisan support, not only in the House but in the other body.  School feeding programs accomplish a number of things. First, they get food and nutrition to hungry kids. We all know that hungry children cannot learn.  Second, school feeding programs increase school attendance. In various pilot programs, as in the pilot program of this Global Food for Education Initiative, we have seen school attendance increase dramatically, especially among girls. Education is really a key tool in combatting some of the terrible effects of poverty and ignorance and illiteracy.  We talk about how do we deal with intolerance and hate around the world. Education is the way to do that. So this program would actually get more young people into schools, and I think it is an effective tool in combatting the types of conditions where terrorists tend to seek recruits.  I am pleased that we have been able to get some language in the farm bill in the House, and hopefully the other body will follow suit, but I would call on President Bush to extend this particular program through fiscal year 2002.  I want to thank the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) again for her incredible leadership on this and so many other food aid issues. I support this motion to instruct conferees to support the highest levels of funding for U.S. food aid programs.  I think this is an important motion. This is an important statement for the Members of this House to make.
