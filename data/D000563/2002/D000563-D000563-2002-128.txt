I say to the Senator from Nevada, he joined me and Democrats and Republicans in passing the No Child Left Behind legislation the President asked for to put more resources in education. The Senator from Nevada is just as aware as I am that when the President's budget came up, he did not fund his own programs. He did not put the money into the schools as he promised.  As I go across my State--and I bet the State of Nevada is in the same situation--we have seen a downturn in State revenues, cutbacks in State budgets, schools are suffering. They are saying: Where is that Federal money President Bush promised us? It is not there, and this administration does not want to talk about that. They do not want to talk about education security for this country. They want to talk only about national security. They do not want to talk about income security, pension security, health care security, Social Security, or doing something to make our schools more secure.  One has to ask oneself: Is that as good as it gets? Is that the best we can hope for from this White House, to focus exclusively on Iraq and the Middle East? I think it is a mistake.  We have made progress. I tip my hat to the President. Let's use the United Nations. Let's bring Saddam Hussein under control, but for goodness' sake, let's get our economy under control, too. It is really out of hand. People across the country--families, small businesses, family farmers--are suffering as a result.
