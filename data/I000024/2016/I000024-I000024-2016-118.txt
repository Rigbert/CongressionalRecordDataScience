The criminal provisions and the preemption have been with us for 6 months--not for 2 days, not for 3 days, but for 6 months. That is exactly what we voted on in December. You can't ask for more time than that to consider the provisions of a bill.  The other thing is that we are all supporting the two components of the bill--that is, the criminal provisions and the preemption. Again, they have been here for 6 months.  I ask that we have a chance to reconsider. We know this is going to pass. We know that when we get back, it will pass. It will pass because we have to go through all the procedures of a cloture vote on the motion to proceed and all that. So we know it is going to pass. That is not the issue. It is just that if we could do it now instead of 2 weeks from now. There are people making decisions today as to what they are going to be doing and what products they are going to be manufacturing and where they are going to do it. And to put that off for 2 more weeks after we have been working on this for 6 months is not a fair way to conduct business.  I hope that later on today we will have an opportunity to get this done. There is no reason not to do it. Everyone is for it. Every group I mentioned is for it. Every Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative is all for it. This is our opportunity to get it done. There is still time today to do that. I hope that between now and 1:45, which is the scheduled time for our vote, that will be a reality.  I yield the floor.
