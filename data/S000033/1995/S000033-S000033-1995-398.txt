 Chairman, I have no argument with my friend that it is important for us to know the costs of the legislation we are proposing, no argument about that. But I think my friends would also not deny that some legislation is cost effective. If one could make the case that by promoting x policy that cost us $1 million we save $10 million in increased health care costs, I am sure all three of the gentlemen would be in agreement that was a good piece of legislation.
