 Last week, the senior Senator from Arizona came to the floor and said it was Durbin's speeches that brought down Corinthian. Correction: What brought down Corinthian was its own malfeasance. They were under investigation by 20 different attorneys general for fraud and deception. They were also under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Education, and the Department of Justice. It was their malfeasance that brought them down, as Senator Schatz has indicated. The victims: Students and taxpayers.  For purposes of this colloquy, I wish to yield to my colleague from Delaware, Senator Carper.
