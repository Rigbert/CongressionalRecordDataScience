Chairman, I include the Committee on Energy and Commerce exchange of letters with the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.         House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space,            and Technology,                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 2015.     Hon. Fred Upton,     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning H.R. 6, the      ``21st Century Cures Act,'' which your Committee ordered      reported on May 21, 2015.       H.R. 6 contains provisions within the Committee on Science,      Space, and Technology's Rule X jurisdiction. As a result of      your having consulted with the Committee and in order to      expedite this bill for floor consideration, the Committee on      Science, Space, and Technology will not seek a sequential      referral. This is being done on the basis of our mutual      understanding that doing so will in no way diminish or alter      the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science, Space, and      Technology with respect to the appointment of conferees, or      to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters      contained in the bill or similar legislation.       I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming      this understanding, and would request that you include a copy      of this letter and your response in the Congressional Record      during the floor consideration of this bill. Thank you in      advance for your cooperation.           Sincerely,                                                      Lamar Smith,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                             Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 2015.     Hon. Lamar Smith,     Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Smith: Thank you for your letter concerning      H.R. 6, the ``21st Century Cures Act.''       I appreciate your willingness to forgo seeking a sequential      referral on H.R. 6 in order to expedite this bill for floor      consideration. I agree that doing so will in no way diminish      or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science, Space,      and Technology with respect to the appointment of conferees,      or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject      matters contained in the bill or similar legislation.       I will include a copy of your letter and this response in      the Congressional Record during the floor consideration of      this bill.           Sincerely,                                                       Fred Upton,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Ways and Means,                                     Washington, DC, July 7, 2015.     Hon. Fred Upton,     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Upton: I am writing with respect to H.R. 6,      the ``21st Century Cures Act.'' As a result of your having      consulted with us on provisions in H.R. 6 that fall within      the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means, I      agree to waive consideration of this bill so that it may      proceed expeditiously to the House floor.       The Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the      mutual understanding that by forgoing consideration of H.R. 6      at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over the      subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and      the Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as      the bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may      address any remaining issues that fall within our Rule X      jurisdiction. The Committee also reserves the right to seek      appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any      House-Senate conference involving this or similar      legislation, and requests your support for such request.       Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter      confirming this understanding, and would ask that a copy of      our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the      Congressional Record during floor consideration thereof.           Sincerely,                                                        Paul Ryan,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                              Committe on Energy and Commerce,                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 2015.
