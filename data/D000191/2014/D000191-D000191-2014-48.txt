  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the end of this week begins the August recess, or district work period. Some of us will go home working--and I am going home to a State that is on fire. We have four major fires, and many dozens of other fires are burning in Oregon, Washington, California, Nevada, and Utah.  The Forest Service and the BLM have about exhausted their budget for fighting fires. They can't stop fighting fires. So they are going to have to gut their other budgets, including budgets that would mitigate future fire risk, fuel reduction, and other programs. They will also cut recreation and other things that people really care about. Congress has not seen fit to give them adequate money.  There is a bipartisan, bicameral proposal, supported by the President--that is about the rarest thing in Washington, D.C., these days--to give the Forest Service and the BLM the tools they need, an adequate budget, and for these extreme fires--the 1 percent that cost 30 percent of the budget--treat those like emergencies, like we do floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes.  What have the Republicans done with this? Nothing. Nada. Zip. Not one hearing. Not one mention, except in the Ryan budget, where he said he didn't support that approach; they should just gut their budgets, or we should kill some other program to pay for fighting fires.                          ____________________
