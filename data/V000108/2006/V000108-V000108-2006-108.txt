Speaker, it is with great sincerity that I take this opportunity to honor one of the most selfless individuals I have ever had the pleasure of working with, Colonel Gary Johnston. Colonel Johnston has spent the past 25 years of his life as a member of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Since his arrival as a member of the United States Army Corps of Engineers Chicago District in July 2003, Colonel Johnston's gracious service to the First Congressional District of Indiana has touched the lives of many of my constituents. For his efforts, and on behalf of my constituents, I take this time to thank Colonel Johnston. Colonel Johnston will be recognized for his accomplishments at an event taking place on June 30, 2006, at the Union League Club of Chicago.  Colonel Johnston has devoted himself to improving quality of life, not only in the United States, but throughout the world. Prior to joining the Chicago District, Colonel Johnston served in many capacities within the United States Army. After being commissioned into the United States Army Corps of Engineers in August 1980 and completing the Engineer Officer Basic Course and Ranger School, Colonel Johnston served as platoon leader and company executive officer of the 84th Engineer Company, 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment. Colonel Johnston has also completed assignments with the 588th Combat Engineer Battalion at Fort Polk, which included assignments to the National Training Center and the Waterways Experiment Station in Vicksburg, Mississippi, as well as deployments to Southwest Asia in Support of Operation Desert Storm and to Kuwait for relief efforts. In addition, Colonel Johnston has been assigned to Fort Knox, Kentucky, where he served as S-3 and executive officer for the 19th Combat Engineer Battalion and as plans officer for the 194th Armored Brigade. As if these accomplishments were not impressive enough, Colonel Johnston has served as an instructor for the Royal School of Military Engineers, British Army, teaching command and control topics to Royal engineer and non-commissioned officers. Following this assignment, Colonel Johnston returned to Fort Polk, where he began his command tour with the 46th Engineer Battalion. This tour sent him to Nicaragua and Haiti. In 2000, at his final stop before coming to the Chicago District, Colonel Johnston was made Engineer Division Chief for the Director of Combat Developments at the Maneuver Support Center at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri.  Colonel Johnston's educational background is equally impressive. As a member of the United States Army, Colonel Johnston completed Airborne School, Ranger School, Engineer Officer Basic and Advanced Courses, Combined Armed Service and Staff School, Command and General Staff College, and Air War College. His civilian educational accomplishments include a Bachelor's Degree in civil engineering from Louisiana Tech and Master's Degrees in structural engineering from the University of Maryland and in strategic studies from the Air War College. Known as a man of integrity and dedication, Colonel Johnston is a recipient of several military awards, including the Meritous Service Medal (with five oak leaf clusters), the Army Commendation Medal (with one oak leaf cluster), the Army Achievement Medal, the Airborne Badge, and the Ranger Tab.  Since joining the Army Corps of Engineers Chicago District in July 2003, Colonel Johnston has been a driving force behind many projects aimed at improving the quality of life in the First Congressional District. While I hesitate to single out one accomplishment, Colonel Johnston has had an immense impact on the preliminary stages of the Marquette Plan, which is aimed at reclaiming Lake Michigan's shoreline for public accessibility. This project is one of great importance to Northwest Indiana residents. In addition, Colonel Johnston has been instrumental in two important flood control projects, the Cady Marsh Ditch Project and the Little Calumet River Project, which, once completed, will protect over 10,000 structures from the dangers of flooding.  Mr. Speaker, Colonel Johnston has given his time and efforts selflessly to people throughout Northwest Indiana, the country, and the world. His life truly exemplifies selfless service to others, and on behalf of the Northwest Indiana community, I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring Colonel Gary Johnston for his outstanding contributions to Indiana's First Congressional District.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E1197]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                     HONORING COLONEL GARY JOHNSTON                                 ______                                                         HON.
