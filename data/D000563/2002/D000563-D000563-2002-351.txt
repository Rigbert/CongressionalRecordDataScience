We made that point over and over with the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota and others, that we do want to increase the exemption, which means fewer estates even than those paying today would be eligible or covered by it, and second, for family farms and family businesses.  I said to a group of small businessmen who came to visit me last week: Don't you think that is a reasonable way to go?  One of them said: No, Senator, I have to tell you, I think this is a moral issue; it's a moral issue; we should eliminate the estate tax as a moral issue.  I am not an arbiter of morality; I just ran for political office. If we are going to stack things against moral relevance, I would certainly put in that list increasing the minimum wage for millions of Americans; providing health insurance for people, 39 million who have none and more losing it every day; paying for college education expenses and prescription drugs for the elderly. Those are certainly moral issues, too, and if we are going to make a choice, the Senator from Texas made it clear what his choice would be: the estate tax.  For the rest of us, there are other issues of equal moral heft that we ought to be considering before we move to the estate tax issue. I hope we get a chance to during the course of this session. It is important during the course of this budget debate that we talk about issues that mean something to families, small businesses, and family farmers across America.
