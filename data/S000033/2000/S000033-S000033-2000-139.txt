 Speaker, I rise in support of the National History Day program. A basic knowledge of history is essential for our Nation's children to become informed participants in our democracy, and the National History Day program is promoting history education in Vermont and throughout our Nation.  National History Day is a yearlong not-for-profit program in which students in grades 6-12 research and create historical projects related to a broad annual theme, culminating in an annual contest. It provides students the critical thinking and research skills used in all subject areas.  I had the opportunity to meet with Vermont students who came to Washington for NationalHistory Day. This program encourages students to draw attention to important historical events that shaped their own hometowns as well as our Nation, and in the process it improves their writing, reading, and critical thinking skills. It gets students excited about learning, while teaching them skills that will help them throughout their lives.  For its efforts to promote the National History Day program, I would like to commend the Vermont Historical Society. National History Day has had a significant impact in history and social studies classrooms in Vermont and across the country. But there is still much to be done. Many teachers are unable to take advantage of the National History Day program because of a lack of funding.  I urge my colleagues to support funding for the National History Day program in the Fiscal Year 2000 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations legislation.                          ____________________
