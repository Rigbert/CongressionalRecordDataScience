  Mr. McCAIN. What does my friend from Delaware make of the argument that this is not the right time, this is not the right time to vote on this? So we are going to table this motion tomorrow and a whole bunch of our colleagues are going to say--including, by the way, my dear friend from Virginia: Yes, this is a problem. It has only been going on for 5 weeks now. Hundreds of thousands of people have been moved from their homes, thousands have been killed, massacres every day--but this is not the right time to vote on this particular issue. So we will vote tomorrow to table it and cut off debate and cut off discussion and abrogate the responsibilities that we have as Senators.  Frankly, does my friend think that maybe they know better?
