 President, 10 years ago, when Kristi started as a teacher, she promised herself that she would take time each day to listen to her students and to understand their needs. Kristi writes to me now:       It is a promise that can only come true if we have small      enough classes with enough qualified teachers in place to      meet the individual learning needs of each child. . . .  She continues:       . . . because of the sheer numbers of children in our      classroom, it is not humanly possible to have the educational      conversations I need and want to have with each child to best      assess their understandings, struggles, challenges, and      progress that can inform where the next day's learning needs      to go.  She says:       I can't tell you how frustrating it is to know how to teach      and not be able to do the very best teaching every moment      because it is difficult with too large a class and without      enough teachers on board as a team to meet the learning needs      of the children.  Mr. President, let's show Kristi and thousands of hard-working teachers that we do support them and want them to be able to do their best in uncrowded classrooms.  I have talked about the research, and I have shared a teacher's perspective, but I have one more example of the importance of small class sizes. It comes from the Houston Independent School District where our Education Secretary, Rod Paige, served as their superintendent.  I show my colleagues this chart. It is actually from a presentation by the former Chief of Staff for Educational Services in the Houston district, Susan Sclafani. By the way, she currently serves as Counselor to Secretary Paige at the Education Department.  Part of her presentation that I am showing on this chart shows how Houston helped turn around low-performing schools. I know we are basing a lot of this education bill on what happened in Houston at the directive of the President and Dr. Paige. They talk about test scores, but they also are very clear about what made a difference in making sure those test scores turned around and that those schools improved.  On the chart, you can see that among the seven things they have done in the Houston school district was to make classrooms less crowded. They made making classrooms less crowded one of the seven things to be done to improve education. They know it works.  In fact, Houston hired 177 new teachers through the Class Size Reduction Program that we funded at the Federal level. Houston also used the funding to provide professional development for more than 600 teachers. That is the type of support we want all communities to have.  We know that making classes smaller works. The research shows it. Parents know it. Teachers know it. Even Secretary Paige used smaller classes to make improvements in the Houston school district. There was not a miracle in Houston. There was hard work. And there was investment in what works. Class size reduction was one of those investments.  We should invest in the things that we know work in the classroom. Parents want to know that their Federal education dollars are making a difference for students.  I served on a local school board. I can tell you that hiring new teachers is difficult because you have to commit today for a new teacher when you don't know what is going to happen 3 months down the road.  That is one of the reasons why many school districts have had a hard time hiring new teachers on their own. Fortunately, they are not all on their own. Local educators have partners at the State and Federal level who are working together to help all students succeed.  That is why in 1998, Congress began the Class Size Reduction Initiative. This program sends Federal dollars to school districts across the country so they can hire new, fully qualified teachers in grades K-3.  And let me remind my colleagues that this is a voluntary program. No school is forced to use this money. If a district wants help hiring teachers to make classrooms less crowded, they simply apply. And there is very little paperwork or administration. In fact, in my own State of Washington you can apply for this class size reduction money over the Internet on a simple, one-page form.  Many educators have told me that they have never seen dollars get so quickly from Congress to the classroom. Local schools, under this, make all the decisions about who to hire based on their unique needs. The money is also flexible. If schools have already reduced classroom overcrowding, they can use the money for teacher recruitment or for professional development. Finally, and critically, these dollars are targeted to disadvantaged students--who can make the most progress when they are in a productive classroom.  This program has been a success story for the Congress. Since 1998, we have helped school districts across the country hire 34,000 new teachers. Over the past 3 years, we have made classrooms less crowded in K-3 and more productive for almost 2 million students. It is a program that works, and we should not abandon it now. This underlying bill does not ensure that this overcrowding will be reduced because it eliminates the targeted funding for class size reduction.  Some say that we should combined funding for teacher quality and class size reduction and just let folks choose. Unfortunately, that is a false choice, and our kids will pay the price. This bill--the underlying bill--pits effective programs against each other and makes educators choose. In the end, our kids will lose if they can't have both smaller classes and qualified teachers. We should be the ones making sure that happens.  Let me repeat that. Smaller classes and qualified teachers go hand in hand. Educators should not have to choose between either making classes smaller or improving teacher quality. They need both. We should fund both. That is what this amendment would ensure.  Finally, I remind my colleagues that there are real consequences to not providing dedicated class size funding. Without my amendment, this bill could put schools in an unwinnable situation with very high stakes. The underlying bill will punish schools that do not improve. At the same time, it takes away the very tools they need to improve, and that is just wrong.  On the one hand, we are telling students to meet high standards, and on the other hand this bill takes away the support they need to get there. We can do better than that. If we want our students to succeed and we are going to punish those who don't, now is the time to increase our investment in smaller class sizes. That is what this amendment does.  This week we are talking about many different education issues from accountability to testing to funding. Right now there is only one question being asked by each of us as Senators: Do you favor targeted funding to make classrooms less crowded or will you take that targeted funding away from your schools? How you vote on this amendment will affect millions of students who are trying to get a good education.  I urge our colleagues to support this amendment by voting yes.                               Exhibit 1                [From the Washington Post, May 8, 2001]            Prince George's Test Scores Show Best Gains Ever               34% of County Schools Meet U.S. Benchmark                         (By Tracey A. Reeves)       Prince George's County students posted their highest gains      ever on a key standardized test used to gauge how local      children measure up to their peers nationally, according to      results released yesterday.       Prince George's has often been criticized for its abysmal      test scores and spotty leadership, but its gains on the      Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills are the first significant      academic increases the county has registered since Iris T.      Metts took over as superintendent in 1999.       According to the results, 34 percent of county schools had      median test scores at or above the national average this      school year, compared with 21 percent last year.       Of the schools tested, 82, or 63 percent, registered      significant gains. Results also show a slight narrowing of      the achievement gap between black and white students and      between Hispanic and white students, an added boon for school      officials who have been struggling for years to close the      gap.       The improved scores brought a huge sigh of relief for      Metts, who acknowledged yesterday that she felt vindicated by      the results and empowered to continue her changes.       Metts said she hoped that county and state leaders would      see the test scores as proof that the county is serious about      improving academic achievement and that they would reward it      with more funding to reduce class size and repair      deteriorating buildings.       ``We're not just achieving,'' an elated Metts said at a      celebratory news conference announcing the test results.      ``We're achieving miraculously.''       The mood was indeed upbeat as school officials asembled in      Upper Marlboro to learn more about the results and to coax      each other on in the effort to improve the school system's      rank as the second-worst in the state, behind Baltimore. In      the hallways, school system employees flashed wide grins as      they toasted the gains with punch. Teachers and their staffs,      who had been summoned to county school headquarters for the      news conference could hardly contain their applause.       Principals hugged their teachers. High-fives were      everywhere       ``This didn't happen by chance,'' said Leroy Tompkins, head      of instruction for county schools. ``We achieved this by      focusing on what we needed to do, and it's paid off.''       School Board Chairman Kenneth E. Johnson (Mitchellville),      who with the rest of the board has accused of not putting the      needs of students first, praised the superintendent for     the results and said the board never doubted her ability.       ``The board always thought she could bring the system      along,'' Johnson said. ``All we need to do now is stay the      course.''       Even Maryland Schools Superintendent Nancy S. Grasmick said      she was encouraged by the results, though she hesitated to      classify the scores an all-out success. She is eager to see      the results of Maryland School Performance Assessment Program      exams, which students are taking this month.       ``I expect to see improvements there, too,'' Grasmick said.      ``But all of these results will have to be sustained over a      two-year period for us to really know what's happening      here.''       Maryland requires all public school sec-     ond-, fourth-, and sixth-graders to take the basic skills      exam, which tests ability in math, reading and language arts.       Prince George's is the first Maryland county to release its      results, in part because it is using the scores to determine      whom to recommend for a new summer program established to      bring along struggling students.       Other school systems are expected to release their test      scores in coming weeks.       The test is given annually to gauge trends in ability among      students. Unlike the MSPAP, which generally measures how well      schools are teaching children, the Comprehensive Test of      Basic Skills is viewed as more useful to parents because it      looks at how students did individually.       The basic skills test is also considered useful to teachers      because it lets them know what areas to concentrate on and      which students need more help.       Until this year, Prince George's scores have been low, flat      and far from the national norm. School officials attributed      the gains to the reforms that Metts has demanded.       For example, she has required all schools to give students      in the early grades 120 minutes of uninterrupted reading time      and 90 minutes of math a day. She has also reduced class      sizes in the lower grades, and efforts are underway to remove      disruptive students from classrooms. Metts and principals      have also put more emphasis on training teachers.       Systemwide, Prince George's scores increased at each of the      three grade levels and in every content area in the March      test. For example, the rate of students scoring above the      national average in reading rose from 24 percent last year to      36 percent. In math, it more than doubled, from 16.7 percent      to 42.4 percent.                               Exhibit 2                                                   April 30, 2001.       Dear Senator Murray: As the U.S. Congress has its focus on      educational programs, I want to take time to thank you for      your tireless efforts on behalf of quality education funding      for our public schools! As a primary classroom teacher in      Washington State, I know first hand the challenges we face in      making sure no child is left behind. While the challenges are      tremendous, it is a challenge which public school teachers      take on day after day, unwilling to give up and unwilling to      do anything less that the very best we can and know how to do      in each moment we have in the classroom. When I interviewed      for my current teaching position ten years ago, one of the      comments I made about my goals as a teacher was that it was      very, very important that I hear each child's voice at school      each day so that each child would know he/she: (1) had      multiple opportunities to be listened to and heard; (2) had      the opportunity to tell me what he/she understood and what      he/she needed help with; and (3) had multiple opportunities      to know he/she was greatly valued as a learner and person.      That is a promise that needs to be reality in order for no      child to be left behind. It is a promise that can only come      true if we have small enough classes with enough qualified      teachers in place to meet the individual learning needs of      each child and to mentor children in meeting the expectations      we share for them as teachers, parents, community, state, and      country.       Each school day, I try to live to that promise . . . and as      I come to the end of each day, I know I have come up short .      . . because of the sheer numbers of children in our      classroom, it is not humanly possible to have the educational      conversations I need and want to have with each child to best      assess their understandings, struggles, challenges, and      progress that can inform where the next day's learning needs      to go. In order to best and most effectively and efficiently      teach primary children, I need time each day to interact with      them as individuals, in small groups and as a cohesive whole      class without distractions and interruptions. I need time to      build the math, literacy, science and social studies      concepts, problem solving and critical thinking skills they      need for today's complex and ever dynamically changing world.      When I have a large class of primary children with very      diverse academic, social and emotional needs and with no      additional adult in the classroom to assist children, the      importantly needed and valued time to work on learning with      children individually and even in small groups or as a      cohesive whole class can be lost.       Presently, every classroom teacher in my building is well      qualified for his/her assignment and has special outstanding      abilities. But we can not do the job we know how to do and      keep learning new and better ways to teach in response to      changing needs and in today's schools, when: (1) the numbers      of students in each class makes it impossible to meet the      challenges each student faces; (2) the number of adults      needed to help provide education is too low; and (3) the      energy toll of the teaching day (which requires planning,      preparation, reflection, collaboration with colleagues and      parents far beyond the time our 8:00 to 3:30 contract time)      leaves teachers unable to engage in much needed professional      development beyond the needs of the daily classroom      instruction. We hear people say that throwing money at the      challenges in education won't help, but I don't know how      we can provide the number of qualified teachers needed to      provide the best education possible for each child without      funding those positions, without providing the funding for      teaching materials and for safe, healthy learning      environments that are needed, and without funding support      for teachers to keep learning and growing professionally!       During this school year, I received a Milken National      Teacher's Award as well as the Presidential Award for      Excellence in Teaching Elementary Science, the Peace Corps      World Wise Schools Paul D. Coverdell Award for Excellence in      Education (which was presented at the U.S. Senate building      with comments from Sen. Edward Kennedy and Sen. Christopher      Dodd), a national Blue Ribbon Classroom Website Award, and      just recently a grant for funding a co-teacher in our      classroom for the remaining weeks of the school year to      sustain and document our innovative primary curricular      program where children are developing the literacy, science,      social studies and math skills they need to meet state      learning goals through local to global collaborative      telecommunications service learning projects. I am      continually learning how to teach. I often work 12 hours per      school day developing and sustaining our curricular program      as well as usually a full weekend day. I often spend recess      time with children as well as after school time building team      support for a child and communicating with parents. I spend      summers reviewing the past school year and preparing for the      next. I spend time taking the course work I need to improve      my teaching skills and keep my certification updated. That is      what it takes to even come close to a goal of leaving no      child behind. Yet, even with developing a classroom which is      being recognized as outstanding, I feel that I come up short      at the end of each day in providing each of the children in      my class the full measure of what they need, deserve, and are      capable of doing. If only we had been able to have two      teachers for this many children all school year, the sky      would not even be the limit for what these children could be      accomplishing!!! There is no substitute for educational      success for all children than critically needed time with an      adult to teach them and enable them to soar! And I don't know      anyway to insure that those adults are in place each day with      needed qualifications without funding!!! There is no      substitute for having the funds to prepare qualified teachers      and have them in classrooms in great enough numbers so we can      do the job of teaching that is needed for today's schools.       Almost every public school class today faces challenges of      helping children with behavior. Some days, the biggest      challenge comes down to making sure each child is safe from      harmful physical and verbal hurt by other peers. Large class      sizes greatly, exponentially exacerbate these challenges of      classroom management to the point of taking away from      valuable teaching and learning time. Additionally problems      are compounded by not having enough school personnel to      assist children facing emotional behavior needs often caused      by circumstances not of their fault. Primary grades are the      school years with the first opportunities for helpful      interventions for children and their families on issues of      academic successes and for meeting the emotional needs that      affect that success. We know what to do to help. We know how      to design learning programs to help children succeed but we      simply can't do it unless we have the people we need to      implement those programs. I can't tell you how frustrating it      is to know how to teach and not be able to do the very best      teaching every moment because it is difficult with too large      a class and without enough teachers on board as a team to      meet the learning needs of the children. People will say      to me, ``You are trying to do too much, Kristi, . . . your      expectations for what we can do in school are too high'' .      . . but, to me, lowering the expectations of what's      possible means some children will be left behind and I'm      not willing to accept that option. How can we ever      possibly be doing too much until we know every child is      succeeding to the best of his/her abilities? And wouldn't      it be wonderful to be at that place where we say, we have      enough of what we need to meet the challenges of educating      our children and we are indeed leaving no child behind? I      dream of someday hearing that conversation nationally . .      . and, until that conversation is truly there, we must do      all we can and more just to insure we meet our educational      vision and goals for all the children in our country!!!       And how can we assess if children are meeting those      educational goals and we as teachers are meeting our teaching      vision . . .       We can administer standardized test to a whole class to      measure how students are doing according to a norm and      against the skills a particular test identifies as      priorities. But, those measurements provide only one form of      reference on student learning and, depending on the integrity      and quality of a standardized assessment, the test data may      or may not be an accurate assessment     of what students understand. I can't tell you how many times,      in working with primary children, I have seen a child's      standardized test results communicate an assessment profile      that does not provide the full measure of what I have seen      that child demonstrate in the classroom learning environment      lessons. Performance on an isolated skill assessment with      primary children simply cannot document the whole of who they      are as learners.       Primary children are growing along a developmental      continuum where many of the skills and understandings that we      need to see in place in these years as indicators of ongoing      successful learning are best demonstrated within the context      of active learning with the teacher rather than being only      demonstrated in individual performance by themselves. Rather      than just being able to demonstrate mastery of individual,      isolated skill tasks that are assessed in a standardized test      without support of a teacher and outside the context of      lesson learning . . . many, many of the skills and      understandings that we need to have in place in the primary      years for ongoing school success are in the category of:      Being able to engage in lessons with the teacher; being able      to learn when being taught during a lesson; being able to      actively think and talk within a teachable moment; and being      able to generate a product or comment when asked to      contribute and work with the teacher and peers on ideas and      work directly with curricular learning materials . . .       While I am successfully using the standardized tests that      are required in our district and state to provide data on      student progress, if I were to rely only on those      standardized skills assessments to measure the success of our      children in our public schools, I would miss important      documentation of learning that is taking place but simply is      best revealed in the interactive teaching and learning      between the student with his/her teacher and peers. A      standardized test, while providing specifically focused      insights on a child's progress, is just a moment of time      in a child's school learning. This is especially true when      assessing primary children. Sometimes, a standardized      assessment presents a profile of student learning that      shows a child not succeeding when in actuality, he/she has      been demonstrating some successes. I have seen a      standardized assessment provide data that looks like the      child and the teaching is failing when in actuality      neither is true. Often, the observation of a child's      behaviors when responding to the challenges of an      individual standardized test tell me as much about that      child's learning strategies and performance as the actual      numerical score that child receives. I often make      documentation notes on a child's behavior during the      process of administering a standardized test. This takes      time for individual observations and writing on my part      while also devoting energy and focus on the rest of the      class . . . which is no easy task but an important one to      fully understand and interpret the results of a      standardized score.       Many of the standardized assessments we are required to do      with our primary students require extended, individual,      uninterrupted time with each student. After we give the      initial instructions, we must time and record their      performance. This is especially true of reading assessments      as those are done while listening to, recording, timing and      notating each child's reading aloud performance (while also      keeping track of the rest of the class). Often these      assessments can take ten to fifteen minutes per child to      implement and additional time to score. While the information      from these assessments can be very valuable, you can well      imagine the time involved in a school day to do this      accurately and reliably with each child when you have a large      class of primary children without any other adult assistance      in the classroom. In order to do the best possible job on all      assessments of student progress, we need to have smaller      class sizes.       Often, the best insights I have had on children's learning      progress have emerged in the process of having a cohesive      whole class, small group or individual conversation about      important basic skills and concepts we have been working on      together and sometimes it comes from listening in on      conversations a child is having with a peer as they work on      their learning with one another. Those avenues of assessment      tell us so much about the successes in children's learning as      well as direction for ongoing learning. Those conversations      will not happen unless we have small enough classes with      enough teachers to hear the voices of what children are      learning each school day.           Sincerely,                                           Kristi Rennebohm Franz.
