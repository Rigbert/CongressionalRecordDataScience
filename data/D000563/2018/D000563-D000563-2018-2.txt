President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3784       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Investing in Tomorrow's      Workforce Act of 2018''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) In 2014, the United States spent just 0.1 percent of      the Nation's Gross Domestic Product on labor market policies,      less than half of what the United States spent on labor      market policies 30 years ago.       (2) The number of workers receiving federally supported      training has declined in the past 3 decades as advances in      technology have simultaneously shifted labor market demand      over time.       (3) As much as 47 percent of all jobs in the United States      are at risk of being replaced by automation technology, and      job losses from automation are more likely to impact workers      making less than $40,000 annually.       (4) Strong Federal investment in expanding training      services for workers whose jobs may be lost due to automation      could prepare the United States workforce to better adapt to      changes in the labor market and enter into skilled positions      in technologically-oriented occupations and industries.       (5) A focus on preparing the workforce of the United States      for jobs that utilize advanced technologies could grow wages,      increase economic productivity, and boost the competitiveness      of the United States.
