President, I thank my friend for yielding.  Earlier today my colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Ayotte, came to the floor and spoke about the Medium Air Defense System known as MEADS. This is a program the United States has been developing for air defense with our NATO allies, so U.S. taxpayers are truly investing in this program, but our allies are as well.  I am new to this assignment as chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, and I don't take any pleasure in what I am about to say, but it is a fact and we have to put the facts out before the American people. As we started developing this system, we reached the point where we concluded, the Department of Defense concluded, it wouldn't work. That happens. Some of the greatest ideas turn out not to be feasible, and that is where we are at this point. The question that has been raised by Senator Ayotte is: Well, if it doesn't work, why do you want to finish the research on it this year?  That is a legitimate question, and the vast majority of Americans would say: Of course, she is right, don't spend another penny on it. The problem is this: We entered into an agreement with our allies that if we terminated the program, there would be penalties assessed to the United States that we would owe to other nations that participated in funding the research, and it turns out the amount of money needed to finish the program is about equal to the penalties we would pay if we terminated it at this moment.  So we have tried to make the best of a very bad situation. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act for 2013 includes $380 million--a reduction of $20 million from the original request--for the Department to bring an orderly close to the Medium Air Defense System by either completing the development program or paying the termination.  This is a NATO program, as I said, that we jointly developed with the Germans and Italians. All of us thought this was a good idea and a good investment. It wasn't until we got into it that we realized it wasn't going to do what we thought it would do. The Department determined it would not procure MEADS but has requested funds for the rest of the year to conclude the program to live up to the agreement with our allies, who have also put money into this. The Department does plan to use the advanced technology we did develop here to upgrade other systems. So it is not a complete waste. And it shouldn't be because the taxpayers have their tax dollars on the line.  I share the frustration of many of my colleagues that we have spent so much money and so many years and have reached this point. But I will tell you, we don't want to build a system that doesn't work. We don't want to create false security. And we do want some honesty from those who are developing these systems if, in fact, something we have spent money on is not going to reach its completion.  The cost to finish the development of this program is almost exactly the same as the cost to unilaterally terminate it--a point not made by the Senator from New Hampshire.  She argues about all the savings from these programs in terminating it but doesn't talk about the termination costs we are liable for as a result of that termination. It is unrealistic to assume that you can terminate a major defense program with our allies and walk away without some obligation.  For example, when the Army's Future Combat Systems Program was terminated, the Department was legally obligated to pay over $500 million in termination liability. In return, we received several technologies that were incorporated into other programs. The same applies to MEADS but only if we fulfill our obligations and pay the termination liability. The Defense appropriations bill is fiscally responsible by providing the funding to the Army to bring this program to an orderly close instead of levying another bill on the Department in times of fiscal constraint.  I urge my colleagues, if the Ayotte amendment does come to the floor, to oppose it--not because I am asking them to vote for a program which we are in agreement is never going to reach the goal it was set out to reach but, rather, let's be honest about this. We are going to pay this money one way or the other. The Army has said, Give us the option to complete the program or pay the termination fee. That to me is a more reasonable approach.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record statements and letters from a variety of different sources, including the Department of Defense, on this program.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         Ministero della Difesa and Bundesministerium der            Verteidigung.     Hon. Leon E. Panetta,     Secretary of Defense,     Washington, DC.       Thank you for your continued support of the MEADS program.      As you are fully aware of the present situation surrounding      the MEADS Program, you will know that Germany and Italy have      grave concerns about the outcome of the MEADS funding      discussion in the USA. This is, unfortunately, not a new      situation.       The results of the Design and Development (D&D) phase of      the MEADS program remain vital for both Germany and Italy as      they will be the basis for our future Air and Missile Defense      System Architecture. As such they are fundamental for the      German and Italian contribution to the ``NATO integrated Air      and Missile Defense'', which is a key element of the Defense      package agreed in Chicago by our heads of State and      Government.       As Germany and Italy have been fulfilling their full      commitments under the MoU, we hope and we do expect that the      United States will live up to their MoU commitment as well.      If the US does not fulfill its funding commitment for 2013,      Germany and Italy would need to interpret this as a      unilateral withdrawal. Under the terms of the MoU, Germany      and Italy expect formal notification of the US intent to      withdraw from the MoU (while funding up to the effective date      of the withdrawal). In addition funding for all contract      modification and termination costs incurred as a result of      the US actions shall be paid by the United States.       We assure you, that this is not negligible. In a first      estimate the current US position results in an economic      damage to Germany and Italy of more than 400 Mio. US$. This      is a result of development activities, which cannot be      executed due to the missing FY 2013 US funding and the      termination liability for terminating those contracts      earlier.       In addition, there are wider implication of the US      withdrawing or breaking the MoU and this would set a bad      precedent for future transatlantic cooperation in principle.      In particular one result would need to be the reconsideration      of multinational cooperation in the context of NATO's SMART      Defense initiative. After the Canadian withdrawal from the      NAEW&C and AGS programs, the current US position would      represent the second evidence in one year of the lack of      reliability and as such would set a bad precedent for future      transatlantic cooperation in principle.       It should be of common interest not to risk the prominent      and significant merits of continued transatlantic co-     operation and collaboration between our nations. We rely on      your intervention to ensure the timely and full availability      of 2013 funds by the end of March 2013 (with no prohibition      on expenditure of MEADS funds) so as not to disrupt      harvesting of MEADS capabilities in order to enable future      meaningful European contribution for NATO Air and Missile      defense.       The three Nations' investments have been very fruitful to      date, which included a successful 360 degree intercept      mission in November 2012. We are in the final year of funding      under this MoU and not funding this effort would put in      jeopardy all of the significant investment made to date by      our countries. After the restructuring MEADS has executed on      schedule and within budget for more than 4 years now, which      is remarkable in particular given the situation of the      program after the US decision not to procure MEADS.       The successful completion of the MEADS activities should be      in our common interests for a large variety of reason. The FY      2013 funds of the US are a prerequisite to achieve this goal.       Thank you for your leadership and support on this important      defense and transatlantic issue.           Yours truly,     Il Ministro della Difesa,     Bundesminister der Verteidigung.                                  ____         Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany, Washington,            and Embassy of Italy in Washington,                                     Washington, January 29, 2013.     Hon. Barbara A. Mikulski,     Chairwoman, Committee on Appropriations,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Madam Chairwoman, First. let us warmly congratulate      you on assuming the chair of the Senate Appropriations      Committee. We wish you all the best in steering this      important committee through all the challenges that lie      ahead.       Among the many issues and decisions to be taken is one at      the very center of transatlantic relationships, the future of      the Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS). This joint      development program has brought together three close NATO      allies to provide their forces with state-of-the-art      technology to meet future threats. The program has achieved      important milestones, including a successful intercept test      in November 2012.       Italy and Germany have met their MoU obligations by      contributing more than 40 percent of the necessary funding      for the program since it has started in 2004. A final      decision by the U.S. Government to prohibit further funding      for MEADS at this advanced stage would lead to a significant      loss of technology for which we have commonly worked so hard.      It would also be perceived as a serious setback for      transatlantic cooperation in general.       The U.S. Department of Defense has acknowledged this fact      and requested further funding for MEADS in fiscal year 2013      to meet its international commitment and also to put itself      and its partners in a position to harvest the technologies in      which we have all significantly invested.       As the debate on an appropriations bill for the Department      of Defense in 2013 continues, we greatly appreciate your      consideration of these aspects.       In concluding, we would like to stress that both our      governments continue to assume that all parties will      ultimately abide by the agreement.           Sincerely,     Dr. Peter Ammon,       Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany.     Claudio Bisogniero,       Ambassador of Italy.                                  ____                                       The Secretary of State,                               Washington, DC, September 19, 2012.     Hon. Daniel K. Inouye,     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I concur with Secretary Panetta's letter      of June 26 and support, within the Department of Defense      budget allocation, funding the final year of Medium Extended      Air Defense System (MEADS) development that includes key      demonstrations, completion of documentation, and an orderly      close of a program of significant importance to two of our      important European allies, Germany and Italy. While we are      encouraged by the recent Senate Appropriations Defense      Subcommittee action recommending $380 million in fiscal year      2013 funding for MEADS, we recognize this development will      need to be reconciled with other Congressional actions.       Honoring our commitment for the final year of the MEADS      ``Proof of Concept'' would signal the U.S. commitment to      working with allies to cooperatively develop capabilities      required for the challenges facing the NATO Alliance.      Commitment of U.S. funds would enable and further encourage      our European partners to make additional contributions to      NATO missile defense. Failing to provide the final year of      funding when we are so close to completion would send the      wrong message to all of our allies and partners at a time      when the global situation requires more, not less,      cooperation.       The United States relies on our NATO allies to share the      burden of defense of NATO territory and peacekeeping in      coalition activities. Difficult domestic budget and economic      situations make it imperative for allies to consider ways to      work together to maintain and build new capabilities to      defend against modern threats, like the proliferation of      ballistic missiles. These are vital capabilities that many      allies can only obtain if they work together to develop and      acquire them. We made a commitment to two of our closest      allies, Germany and Italy, to develop MEADS cooperatively,      share development costs, and realize integrated coalition      capabilities. It is critical that we honor our commitments.       At the NATO Summit in Chicago, allies declared an interim      missile defense capability as an initial step toward      establishing the NATO missile defense capability that allies      agreed to develop at the 2010 NATO Summit in Lisbon. While      the United States is making a significant national      contribution to this system through the European Phased      Adaptive Approach, we expect and have requested additional      contributions from allies to make the capability more      effective and share the burden of missile defense protection      of European NATO territory, populations, and forces.       Germany and Italy envision MEADS not only as an essential      basis for their own future air defense capabilities, but more      importantly as the basis for their respective contributions      to NATO missile defense. The agreement to deploy a      territorial NATO missile defense capability and its      implementation are major achievements of U.S. and Allied      policy. A decision by Congress not to provide or to prohibit      funding MEADS at this late date would diminish the consensus      reached in Lisbon and Chicago for this capability, discourage      allies from participating in cooperative projects in the      future, and ultimately, delay greater European contributions      to NATO missile defense.       My staff is ready to answer any questions you or your staff      may have. Sincerely yours,           Sincerely yours,     Hillary Rodham Clinton.                                  ____                                         Secretary of Defense,                                                   Washington, DC.     Hon. Daniel K. Inouye,     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: In response to your inquiries, I am      writing to ask that you strongly support the President's      Budget request for FY 2013 funding to complete the Medium      Extended Air Defense System (MEADS) Design and Development      (D&D) Proof of Concept (PoC) effort with Germany and Italy.      The Department is seeking $400.9 million in FY 2013 funds to      honor the final year of our MEADS D&D Memorandum of      Understanding (MOU) commitment that will enable completion of      the MEADS development phase as it is currently planned. The      PoC effort enables all three nations to obtain benefit from      our collective program investment to date and will bring the      development program to an orderly conclusion, Failure to fund      our FY 2013 commitment will be viewed by our allies as      reneging on our promises.       During the NATO Summit in Chicago on May 20, 2012, NATO      Allies achieved a major breakthrough on missile defense--10      years in the making--by declaring an interim ballistic      missile defense capability as an initial step towards      establishing a NATO missile defense system. The European      Phased Adaptive Approach will be a major contributor to NATO      missile defense and is designed to protect the U.S. homeland,      U.S. deployed forces, and our allies against the increasing      threats posed by the proliferation of ballistic missiles.      Where ballistic missile defense was once a controversial      subject within the Alliance, we have reached consensus to      operationalize this capability and have the Allies share the      burden of deterring and defending against those who could      threaten us with ballistic missiles. This is a major      achievement of U.S. policy; a decision by Congress to      prohibit any additional funding for MEADS at this late date      would diminish the consensus reached in Chicago.       The United States relies on allies to share the burden of      peacekeeping and defense in coalition activities and the      development of effective defense capabilities that are of      direct benefit to the United States. In this context, I      believe that it is important to live up to our commitments to      our allies. We made a commitment to two of our closest      allies, Germany and Italy, to develop MEADS cooperatively to      achieve those objectives. Failure to meet our MEADS MOU FY      2013 funding obligations could negatively affect allied      willingness to join future cooperative endeavors, bilaterally      or through NATO, that have been strongly supported by the      Administration and Congress at a time when cooperation      through concepts such as Smart Defense is critical to      ensuring NATO and its members are developing needed      capabilities for the future.       In addition, failure by the United States to provide      funding for FY 2013 likely would lead to a dispute with      Germany and Italy, both of which have indicated that they      would assert that the United States has unilaterally      withdrawn from the MOU. On the other hand, full funding of      the final year of the MEADS PoC would ensure that the United      States receives a return on its 8-year investment in the form      of a data archival package for future potential use on other      U.S. air and missile defense improvements.       We must act now to avoid a situation that would cause harm      to our relationships with two of our closest allies. My staff      is ready to answer any questions you or your staff may have      on MEADS.           Sincerely,                                                     Leon Panetta.                          Dietary supplements
