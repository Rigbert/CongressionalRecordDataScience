 I onlywanted to call it up so it will be available for the Senate to consider as we continue to debate this extremely important housing bill that is in front of us.  Late last week, the Senate considered the question of additional funding for housing counseling. When the Senate voted on that matter, there were 16 Senators who were absent from the Chamber. So that amendment did fail at the time on a procedural vote. But I do believe some Senators may have voted against our initial amendment because it added funds to the overall cost of this bill. The new amendment I have just called up will add the necessary funding for housing counselors from within the funds already in the bill.  Senator Schumer and I are going to be talking about this amendment in greater detail at the appropriate time. I think as we continue to try to address the housing issue, we all remember there are up to 2 million families who may go into foreclosure this year, and our main objective ought to be to make sure they do not go into foreclosure. That is what this housing counseling funding does. It is extremely important. I hope as we move this bill along we will be able to add the additional funding.  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
