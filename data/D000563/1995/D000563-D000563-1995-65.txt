Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I do not want to beat a dead chicken, but I do want to try to make clear what this issue is all about. It may strike some people as odd or even amusing that Members of Congress and this great legislative body are talking about frozen chickens today, but what is at stake here is a lot of money.  Mr. Speaker, if a chicken can be sold as fresh, it means a much greater profit for the company that is selling that chicken. I have no objection to people selling fresh chickens as fresh chickens and making the money that might be attendant to that sale. What I object to, what the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Obey] objects to, what people in the administration object to, is deceptive labeling, deceptive advertising.  Mr. Speaker, if a consumer walks into the supermarket, that consumer ought to be confident that what is labeled on that product is a fact. Today a consumer can walk into the poultry section and see in a plastic bag a chicken which is labeled fresh and not know that that chicken has been frozen as hard as a bowling ball.  Now of course the people who sell the chickens would like us to believe that they are all fresh regardless of how much they have been frozen or to what temperature they have been brought to, but that is not right.  A few years ago Dr. Kessler of the FDA angered some of the food giants who were running around the grocery store and labeling everything ``fresh.'' Bottled spaghetti sauce and canned products were being called ``fresh.'' Mr. Speaker, consumers had a right to be suspicious, and Kessler said:       Your suspicions are well founded. Make that labeling      accurate. When a consumer makes a purchase, let them know      that their hard-earned dollars are being spent on something      they actually want to purchase.  So he took on some of the giants in the industry on behalf of this administration, and I am glad he did because it meant better labeling, and it made for authentic and more honest labeling, and now when it comes to poultry products, once again we are fighting some of the giants of this country. They want to sell these chickens, mislabel them, call them fresh. They want the consumers to fall for it, pay more, so that they can get more profit out of the sale.  Mr. Speaker, frankly we spend a lot of time in Congress changing laws. We cannot change the laws of physics. The laws of physics tell us water freezes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit and that chickens freeze, because of their water content, at 26 degrees Fahrenheit.                              {time}  1115  So this administration tried to come up with a reasonable compromise, came up with a bizarre term called hard chilled, something between zero degrees and 26 degrees; I have never quite understood it.  The Chicago Sun Times came up with an editorial a few weeks ago. They thought this was a pretty simple idea. What they said was this: ``We can help the bureaucrats and the Congressmen out. If chickens are frozen, let us call them frozen. If they are thawed but used to be frozen, call them previously frozen. If they have never been frozen, call them fresh.  There used to be an old commercial on television about chickens, saying parts is parts. Well, this debate is about whether fresh is fresh, and I will tell the Members, it goes far beyond the chuckling we have had on the floor this morning. There is a lot of money at stake, and what is even more important, what is at stake here is consumer confidence across this country. Our government is entrusted with the power and authority to regulate advertising so when we walk into the supermarket and see something on the counter and it is labeled, it is labeled honestly and accurately. This is not a buyer beware situation. It is a situation where the consumers have the right to know so their hard-earned dollars are spent on products they actually want to buy and the deception is taken away. I am going to join my friend, the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Obey], in supporting his motion to recommit on an otherwise very good bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
