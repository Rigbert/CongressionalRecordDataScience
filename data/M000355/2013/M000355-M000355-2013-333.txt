 President, Tony Hanagan and Keira Harris are two former pages who returned to the Senate, graciously volunteering to sacrifice some of their Christmas vacation to help here on the Senate floor this past weekend. Tony and Keira have worked tirelessly to complete work typically performed by 14 pages. We appreciate their help during the Senate's recent late nights. We thank them for their great effort and impeccable service to the Senate.                          ____________________
