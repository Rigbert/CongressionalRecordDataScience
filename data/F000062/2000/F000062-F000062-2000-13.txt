 Due to this loss of income, a number of growers are currently unable to pay their bills or prepare for next year's crop.  This assistance is desperately needed, but I believe that more emphasis must be placed on preventing future infestations. I am heartened to see that in Fiscal Year 2001, the USDA will hire 17 new agriculture inspectors for the San Diego ports of entry. This is a badly needed first step. We also need to increase the federal investment in California's Medfly Preventive Release Program. If California's fruits were quarantined from all foreign markets because of Medfly infestations, the State estimates that 35,000 jobs would be lost and economic output would be reduced by $3.6 billion.
