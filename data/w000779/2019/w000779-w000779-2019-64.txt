President, today I wish to recognize the passing of Molly Holt. Known affectionately as the Mother of All Korea's Orphans, Molly Holt dedicated her life to advocating for disabled, often homeless, children and adults in South Korea. Born to international adoption pioneers Bertha and Harry Holt, Molly carried the family legacy with a steadfast dedication to serving those less fortunate.  Molly first traveled to South Korea as a young nursing graduate, eager to assist her father as he attempted to provide care for the many children left orphaned by the Korean war. She spent most of her life working tirelessly with the residents of the Holt Ilsan Center in Korea, a long-term care facility for children and adults who have special physical, medical, or mental needs. Molly was a champion for the children at the Holt Ilsan Center, who affectionately referred to her as Unnie or big sister. It was through her steadfast advocacy that many children housed at the center were able to find permanent, loving homes.  Molly Holt will be remembered as an exceptional Oregonian, a woman who was guided by her strong convictions towards a life of charity and compassion. Even in the face of a debilitating illness, Molly remained committed to serving the people that she loved with her whole heart. Her passing is a loss that will be felt across the world, but her legacy of earnest, passionate service will continue to inspire us for decades to come.                          ____________________
