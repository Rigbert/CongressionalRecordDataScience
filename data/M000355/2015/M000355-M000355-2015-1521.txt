 President, I rise to pay tribute to a team of national champions that comes from the great State of Kentucky. On March 21, 2015, the Thomas More College women's basketball team, the Saints, won the first ever team championship in their school's history.  The Saints notched an 83-to-63 win over George Fox University in the women's Division III championship game and capped an undefeated season with a record of 33 to 0. They are only the sixth team in the history of Division III women's basketball to go an entire season undefeated. Along the way to their perfect season, they defeated four top 10-ranked teams.  The final game was hosted by Calvin College in Grand Rapids, MI, and played in the Van Noord Arena. Thomas More jumped out to an early lead and never trailed in the game. Thomas More's leading scorer in the championship game, Sydney Moss, was also named the NCAA Division III national player of the year by both D3hoops.com and the Women's DIII News. It is the second consecutive year she has earned the award. During the NCAA postseason, Moss broke the NCAA all-division men's and women's scoring record with an incredible 197 points in the Saints' six NCAA tournament games.  Saints head coach Jeff Hans, who guided his team to their first undefeated season and their first national championship, was also named the Division III national coach of the year by both D3hoops.com and the Women's DIII News.  I want to recognize every member of this championship team that is bringing the Women's Division III trophy back to Kentucky. Team members include Kirsten Paul, Kiley Bartels, Abby Owings, Stephanie Krusling, Olivia Huber, Nikki Kiernan, Mikkah Hignite, Sarah Roaden, Kelly McDonald, Sydni Wainscott, Alexa Santamaria, Kaylee Bush, Sydney Moss, Sam Cady, and Hannah Devine. Jeff Hans is the head coach, and he is assisted by Tim Shields, Tanja Speaker, and Jerry Allen. The school's director of athletics is Terry Connor and its president is David Armstrong.  The Kentucky Enquirer recently published an article about the Saints' victory. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Kentucky Enquirer, March 21, 2015]        Thomas More Women Win Division III National Championship                            (By Adam Turer)       Grand Rapids.--The Division III women's college basketball      season began with Mount St. Joseph's Lauren Hill scoring the      season's first points in front of a sold crowd at the Cintas      Center. It ended with head coach Jeff Hans and the Thomas      More Saints hoisting the national championship trophy. With      an 83-63 win over George Fox on Saturday night, the Saints      earned the first team championship in Thomas More history.       In a battle of 32-0 teams-the first Division III women's      championship between two undefeated squads-the Saints      controlled from the opening tip. One night after starting 0-7      from the field, Thomas More hit its first three shots to open      up an early lead. They never trailed.       George Fox, the 2009 national champion and 2012 runner-up,      made it this far behind its relentless full court press. The      Saints had faced very little full court pressure this season,      for good reason. With Abby Owings, Sydney Moss, and Sydni      Wainscott all able to handle point guard duties, the Saints      are nearly impossible to trap. Hans went to a four-guard      lineup at times with Olivia Huber coming off the bench. The      Saints still had to overcome several uncharacteristic      turnovers, but balanced those miscues with a bounty of fast      break points.       Moss was, as always, the focal point of the opposing      defense. It took the nation's leading scorer over 11 minutes      to make her first field goal. The two-time national player of      the year found other ways to help her team win. She led      Thomas More with 19 points, 15 rebounds and 11 assists. The      biggest beneficiaries of her defense-breaking ball handling      were post players Alexa Santamaria and Nikki Kiernan.      Santamaria finished with 14 points on 6-6 shooting, while      Kiernan added 16 points on 7-11 shooting. Most of their      attempts were wide open looks from within two feet thanks to      Moss drawing away helpside defenders and dropping no-look      dimes.       The victory was a culmination for the program which began      its ascension as a national contender under current Xavier      head coach Brian Neal. The success continued under Hans, but      the Saints developed a pattern of underwhelming in the      postseason. The addition of key transfers and the infusion of      several of northern Kentucky's top high school players      elevated this year's team to unforeseen heights. Moss did not      transfer home from Florida expecting to win a national      championship. She drew inspiration from the program's family      atmosphere, and the ability to play in front of her family      nearly every night. This win brought renewed appreciation for      her loved ones.       ``You look up and see your mom and think of all the      practices she drove you to, all the shoes she bought you, and      all the sacrifices she made,'' Moss said after Friday's      semifinal win.       Dozens of Saints students, many athletes in other sports,      made the trek to Grand Rapids not once, but twice this      weekend. They bussed up for Friday's semifinal, back to      Crestview Hills, then back up on Saturday. Thomas More fans      accounted for roughly 70 percent of the crowd and 90 percent      of the crowd noise at Saturday's title game. The team bus      will return to Crestview Hills with some new hardware to add      to the Connor Convocation Center trophy case.       ``The support I cannot say enough about. The pride that      they have in their school and excitement to see our programs      go to another level,'' said athletic director Terry Connor.      ``[There is] a great sense of pride and this is proof that it      can be done.''                          ____________________
