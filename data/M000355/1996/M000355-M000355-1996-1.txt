 President, I rise today to ask my colleagues and all Americans to join me in paying tribute to Liberty Hall in Frankfort, KY. This historic home will celebrate its 200th birthday on October 2, 1996.  Liberty Hall is one of Kentucky's finest 18th-century homes. It served as the residence of Kentucky's first U.S. Senator, John Brown, and four generations of his family. Senator Brown held office from 1792 to 1805. Brown married Margaretta Mason on February 21, 1799; after their wedding they returned to Frankfort and his home, Liberty Hall, which he began building in 1796.  Senator Brown was known as a strong advocate and voice for the developing lands west of the Allegheny Mountains. Brown was one of the first trustees of Harrodsburg. He also was a founding member of the Danville Political Club and a member of the Kentucky Manufacturing Society. At the time of his death he had the distinction of being the last living member of the Continental Congress.  Since 1937, Liberty Hall has served as a house museum. The historic home is a sterling example of the preservation movement in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  Mr. President, I ask you to join me in celebrating Liberty Hall's 200th birthday. This historic site is a Kentucky landmark, and I hope all that travel to Kentucky's capital will take time to stop by and see why we Kentuckians are so proud of this historic mansion.                          ____________________
