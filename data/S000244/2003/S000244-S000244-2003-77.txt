 Madam Speaker, Halloween is coming up, and I am afraid that the argument used by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hinojosa) is designed to scare people into doing something that this bill does not do. First of all, the bill creates no new databases. The basic pilot program relies on both the Social Security Administration and INS database, and there is nothing added to these databases by this bill whatsoever.  Secondly, the bill does expand this voluntary program nationwide so that employers in other States may volunteer to participate in the verification of employment eligibility. Because the problem of illegal aliens taking jobs away from Americans is a problem that exists in more than the 45 States that are not covered by this program, there is nothing wrong with giving these employers the opportunity to volunteer to participate in the program.  Thirdly, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hinojosa) seems to argue against this legislation in that it will allow government agencies to be able to find out the employment and Social Security status and immigration status of people whose names are in an existing database.  The only change in the law is to allow the other government agencies to utilize the pilot program database, which contains information that is already available to the other government agencies through existing law. I think if anybody is to be scared by this bill, it is people who are trafficking in illegal and counterfeit documents which will be the sole source of employment verification should this bill go down and the pilot program be allowed to expire.  Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Hostettler).
