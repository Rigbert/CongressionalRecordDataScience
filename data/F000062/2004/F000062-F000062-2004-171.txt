 Hopewell, M.D., of San Francisco, CA. A pioneer in pulmonary medicine, Dr. Hopewell is being awarded the Edward Livingston Trudeau Medal in recognition of his lifelong contributions to the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of lung disease. Dr. Hopewell has dedicated over 30 years researching national and international tuberculosis control.  Dr. Hopewell's commitment to pulmonary disease serves as an example for all working to preserve the health of this Nation and the world. From the early 1970s, Dr. Hopewell has been concerned with those living with tuberculosis. Dr. Hopewell began his career as a consultant in tuberculosis control to the Nigerian government in the war-affected areas of eastern Nigeria. Later, his interest in tuberculosis control in developing countries was fostered by his work in the Pan-American Health Organization in 1980-1981 and with the Stop TB Partnership, based at the World Health Organization in Geneva in 2003.  Not only has Dr. Hopewell helped countless tuberculosis patients around the globe, he has been instrumental in addressing the problem here at home. Dr. Hopewell has been on the faculty at UCSF, based at San Francisco General, since 1973, where he served as chief of the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine from 1989 to 1998 and Associate Dean 1998 to 2004. Today, Dr. Hopewell continues to practice clinical pulmonary and critical care medicine at San Francisco General Hospital, serving as an attending physician on the pulmonary consultation service and in the medical intensive care unit.  In addition to his clinical work, Dr. Hopewell spends a great deal of his time as a researcher. Dr. Hopewell's research has enabled more specific targeting of control interventions and has helped contribute to a nearly 60 percent reduction in the number of new cases of tuberculosis in San Francisco in the past decade. In 1981, Dr Hopewell became involved in the San Francisco tuberculosis control program through the Department of Public Health. From this association, the Frances J. Curry National Tuberculosis Center, directed by Dr. Hopewell was formed. The Curry Center is one of three CDC-funded model centers in the country and provides important opportunities for training and research in many aspects of tuberculosis and tuberculosis control.  Today, I acknowledge Dr. Hopewell for his lifelong accomplishments in tuberculosis research and tuberculosis control. I also acknowledge Dr. Hopewell's numerous leadership positions in pulmonary medicine. He served on theNational Advisory Council of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease, was president of the California Thoracic Society, the North American Region of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, and the American Thoracic Society.  I am pleased to take this opportunity to recognize Dr. Hopewell for his service to the medical community and to our Nation and to congratulate him on being selected to receive the American Lung Association's Edward Livingston Trudeau Medal.                          ____________________
