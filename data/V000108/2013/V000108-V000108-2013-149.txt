 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the amendment and would want to make a couple of things clear to all of my colleagues.  The fact is the administration did ask for money. For the ballistic missile defense midcourse section in the bill they asked for $1.033 billion this year, fiscal year 2014. This is not absent an administration request.  Secondly, the gentleman from Arizona said that the bad test and the problems that they indicate are not unresolvable. I would absolutely agree with the gentleman, but this is a procurement account. Let us resolve these problems before we procure something that last month has not worked so we don't have to pull them out of silos, we don't have to invest additional taxpayers' money, and we don't have to waste that hard-earned money.  There are threats, and we ought to make sure the systems we deploy to protect our Nation work before we procure and deploy them.  I applaud the gentleman for his amendment and strongly support it.
