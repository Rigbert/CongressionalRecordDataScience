He has said it before. He has voted that way. We understand that. There is very little confusion.  I noted that by the President's own admission when he spoke to the House and the Senate, he was saddled with a $5.6 trillion surplus. He has successfully turned that into a $4 trillion deficit, an almost $10 trillion turnaround the wrong way. So in terms of being saddled, Mr. Leader, the recession, by the admission of the administration, was over some many months ago and we still find ourselves in a place where not only do we have 2.5 million people unemployed but we have some 3 million people who are discouraged and are no longer on the rolls because they are no longer seeking employment.  I guess we could go on all night on this. We have a different view. But I really believe and would hope, as we did in the child tax credit, that we could certainly pass an extension to take care of those 375,000 people who have lost their unemployment insurance over the last 3 months.                          ____________________
