Speaker, if it operates like a slush fund and is administered like a slush fund, then how should we refer to the leadership reserve?  Last week in an a total sham process, the Committee on House Oversight steamrolled through a $1.4 million allocation from the leadership's $7.9 million slush fund to investigate organized labor's political activities. The reserve fund is supposed to be used under House rules in, and I quote, ``extraordinary, emergency, or high priority circumstances.''  The Committee on House Oversight decided not to fund this request in March. What has happened? I ask my friends, what is the emergency? For whom is this investigation a high priority? Is this strictly a research endeavor, as the majority says? Why then a communications director for $70,000 and a media assistant for $25,000 and four additional attorneys for the committee?  I do not have all the answers but I will ask one more question: If it walks like a witch hunt and talks like a witch hunt?                          ____________________
