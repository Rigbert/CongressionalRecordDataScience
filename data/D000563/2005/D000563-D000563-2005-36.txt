 With the 2 reconciliation bills--the bill that we are considering today that cuts services for the poor and the bill that we will see again in January that cuts taxes for the wealthy--we again are saying to the American people that we believe in shared sacrifice . . . so long as this sacrifice is made only by those who can least afford it. Especially in a time of war, this is wrong.  I didn't vote for the Senate version of the spending reconciliation bill a few weeks ago because I didn't think that it was right to try to reduce our huge budget deficit by cutting funding for those who need it most while cutting taxes for those who need it least.  Never mind, of course, that these two bills would actually increase the deficit, and therefore not even meet the purpose they were meant to serve.  Now we have received the conference report on the spending reconciliation bill, after the House passed this report late last night with almost no review or debate.
