Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 212) recognizing and supporting the goals and ideals of the Year of the Korean War Veteran, and for other purposes, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 212       Whereas 50 years ago, 1,800,000 Americans answered the call      to defend freedom in South Korea and fought the common foe of      communism with 21 allied countries under the banner of the      United Nations;       Whereas the United States suffered 36,576 dead and 103,284      wounded during the Korean War in some of the most horrific      conditions in the history of warfare;       Whereas the Nation's Korean War veterans did not receive      the proper welcome home, thanks, or recognition for selfless      service and sacrifice that had been given to veterans of      previous wars;       Whereas the bravery and sacrifices of the Nation's Korean      War veterans and their families and next of kin should be      properly honored and recognized, and the American people wish      to join in thanking and honoring Korean War veterans and      their families;       Whereas it is important to include the history of the      Korean War in the curricula of the Nation's schools so that      future generations will learn about and appreciate the      sacrifices of Korean War heroes;       Whereas the final year of the 50th Anniversary of the      Korean War Commemoration should be recognized by a national      effort of programs and activities to officially thank, honor,      and welcome home the Nation's Korean War veterans and to      officially thank and honor their families and next of kin;      and       Whereas 2003 marks the final year of the United States 50th      Anniversary of the Korean War Commemoration and the 50th year      of the Armistice, and efforts are under way to designate 2003      as the Year of the Korean War Veteran: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That Congress--       (1) declares to the Nation and the world that the American      people will never forget the Nation's Korean War veterans or      those who served the Nation on the home front during the      Korean War;       (2) recognizes and supports the goals and ideals of the      Year of the Korean War Veteran;       (3) requests the President to issue a proclamation calling      on the people of the United States to observe the Year of the      Korean War Veteran with appropriate ceremonies and activities      to thank, honor, and welcome home the Nation's Korean War      veterans; and       (4) urges the chief executive officers of the States, and      the chief executive officers of the political subdivisions of      the States, to each issue a proclamation calling upon their      citizens to ``Pause to Remember'' the Nation's Korean War      veterans and their families and next of kin with appropriate      ceremonies and activities.
