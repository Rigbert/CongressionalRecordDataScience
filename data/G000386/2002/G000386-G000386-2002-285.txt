 President, I am sending to the desk a sense-of-the-Senate resolution on the current situation in Colombia.  The resolution expresses outrage over the current attacks on democracy and democratic institutions in Colombia by a gang of vicious thugs. The most recent outrage, in a long history of outrages, was the hijacking of a commercial airliner filled with innocent people that was forced to land, and then the kidnapping at gun point of a distinguished Colombian Senator. That Senator remains a prisoner, his fate unknown and uncertain. Four other members of the Colombian Congress are also prisoners, and now so is one of the candidates for president in Colombia's upcoming elections. Other members have been murdered, their families threatened, their children terrorized. These are only the most publicly visible victims of Colombia's guerrilla thugs.  There can be no clearer testimony, if further evidence was called for, of the vicious nature of the actions of Colombia's insurgent movement, the FARC. They have branded themselves, if it was not clear before, as outright terrorists. Their actions are an assault on the rule of law and on democracy.  My resolution expresses the concern over the fate of those in a companion institution. Our sympathies must go to their families, our concern to their countryman in their time of threat an menace. I hope that other members will join me in expressing our unanimous concern for the fate of democracy and the rule of law in Colombia. The other body has passed a resolution expressing its concern. I hope we will as well.                          ____________________
