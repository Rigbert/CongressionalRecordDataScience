Speaker, in August 1990, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. The President, a few days later, determined that he would deploy troops to oppose aggression in the Persian gulf, and we as a Nation and as a Congress were united in that deployment. That deployment occurred during August, September, October, November, and December, and over 400,000 troops were sent. The Democratic leadership and the Republican leadership stood together in support of that deployment to oppose aggression.  We did so as a united nation. Yes; there was a vote in January as to whether to go to war, and in a bipartisan vote we determined that the President would have the authority to do so. The President acted, and the Congress shortly thereafter, some few days, passed a resolution, with over 400 of us voting to support the troops and their success.  Mr. Speaker, I believe it is in our national interest to participate in the effort in Bosnia for several reasons. First, our President has told our allies and the warring parties that we would do so. America's credibility and our leadership in the world would be severely undermined if we do not.  The risk for peace is one that the Western alliance and the United States should be willing to take now and in the future. The NATO alliance under United States leadership remains, my colleagues, the stabilizing force in Europe, and it must be kept ready, united, and maintain its will to deter aggression and establish peace.  I suggest to you, my friends, it would be immoral to stand by in the face of the carnage and the rape and the murder and the genocide and the tragedy that is Bosnia.  My colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle, my fellow Americans, if you will, President George Bush recently stated:       It is in our national interest to maintain the integrity of      the United States; credibility in the world. If the President      shifts direction now or if it is seen that the President does      not have the support of Congress, our standing as leader of      the free world and the standing of NATO would be dramatically      diminished.  President Bush concluded his remarks by saying ``That must not happen.''  I will oppose the Buyer-Skelton resolution. They are men of integrity, and they serve their people well. But I am not opposed to the President's policy. It is not my policy. I wanted to lift the arms embargo. I wanted to give to the Bosnian people the right and the ability to defend their homes. I think President Bush and President Clinton were wrong in not supporting that policy. But the issue today is that the President has chosen a policy, and it is not Somalia, where there was no agreement among the warring parties, it is not Lebanon, where there was no agreement among the factions. It is a place in this world where parties brought together by the President of the United States have agreed on peace.                              {time}  2145  I believe it is worth a risk for peace.  I hope many of my colleagues were here yesterday. Shimon Peres spoke to a joint session of Congress. He said to us, as a country, that we saved freedom. He went on to say that wars did not cause us to lose heart, triumphs did not corrupt us, and we remained unspoiled because we rejected the spoils of victory.  He then talked about the risks for peace taken by his friend Yitzhak Rabin and his country, and he observed that just a few years ago he could not have conceived of reaching out to Yasser Arafat, a Palestinian, his enemy of centuries. Not the Arab and the Jews. For centuries. And now he believes there is a chance for peace, and he said that it was worth risking peace because it was more important to win the peace than to win elections.  Mr. Speaker, I think that is the decision our President has made. That is the decision I will support, and that is why I will oppose this resolution.
