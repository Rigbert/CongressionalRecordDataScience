 President, I rise today to introduce two bills that are an important first step in helping Americans prepare for their long-term care needs. The Long Term Care Affordability and Availability Act and the American Worker Long Term Care Affordability Act. I am pleased to have my colleague Senator Graham of Florida join me as a cosponsor of these two bills.  Longer and healthier lives are a blessing and a testament to the progress and advances made by our society. However, all Americans must be alert and prepare for long-term care needs. The role of private long-term care insurance is critical in meeting this challenge.  The financial challenges of health care in retirement are not new. Indeed, too many family caregivers can tell stories about financial devastation that was brought about by the serious long-term care needs of a family member. Because increasing numbers of Americans are likely to need long term care services, it is especially important to encourage planning today.  Most families are not financially prepared when a loved one needs long-term care. When faced with nursing home costs that can run more than $40,000 a year, families often turn to Medicaid for help. In fact, Medicaid pays for nearly 2 of every 3 nursing home residents at a cost of more than $30 billion each year for nursing home costs. With the impending retirement of the Baby Boomers, it is imperative that Congress takes steps now to encourage all Americans to plan ahead for potential long-term care needs.  The Long Term Care and Affordability and Availability Act will allow Americans who do not currently have access to employer subsidized long-term care plans to deduct the amount of such a plan from their taxable income. This bill will encourage planning and personal responsibility while helping to make long-term care insurance more affordable for middle class taxpayers.  The American Worker Long-Term Care Affordability Act will establish a program under which long-term care insurance may be obtained by current and former employees of the federal government. This legislation will make long-term care insurance affordable to the Federal community by using the purchasing power of the federal government to assure quality, competition and choice.  These measures will encourage Americans to be pro-active and prepare for their own long term care needs by making insurance more widely available and affordable. I urge my colleagues to support these bills.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the texts of the bills be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 35       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Long-Term Care Affordability      and Availability Act of 1999''.     SEC. 2. DEDUCTION FOR LONG-TERM CARE HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS                    FOR INDIVIDUALS NOT ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN                    EMPLOYER-SUBSIDIZED LONG-TERM CARE HEALTH                    PLANS.       (a) In General.--Part VII of subchapter B of chapter 1 of      the Internal Revenue Code of     1986 (relating to additional itemized deductions) is amended      by redesignating section 222 as section 223 and by inserting      after section 221 the following new section:     ``SEC. 222. QUALIFIED LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE COSTS.       ``(a) In General.--In the case of an individual, there      shall be allowed as a deduction an amount equal to the amount      of the eligible long-term care premiums (as defined in      section 213(d)(10)) paid during the taxable year for coverage      of the taxpayer and the spouse and dependents of the      taxpayer.       ``(b) Limitation Based on Other Coverage.--Subsection (a)      shall not apply to any taxpayer for any calendar month for      which the taxpayer is eligible to participate in any      subsidized long-term care plan maintained by any employer of      the taxpayer or of the spouse of the taxpayer. For purposes      of the preceding sentence, the term `subsidized long-term      care plan' means a subsidized health plan which includes      primarily coverage for qualified long-term care services (as      defined in section 7702B(c)) or is a qualified long-term care      insurance contract (as defined in section 7702B(b)).       ``(c) Special Rules.--       ``(1) Coordination with medical deduction.--Any amount paid      by a taxpayer for insurance to which subsection (a) applies      shall not be taken into account in computing the amount      allowable to the taxpayer as a deduction under section      213(a).       ``(2) Deduction not allowed for self-employment tax      purposes.--The deduction allowable by reason of this section      shall not be taken into account in determining an      individual's net earnings from self-employment (within the      meaning of section 1402(a)) for purposes of chapter 2.''       (b) Conforming Amendments.--       (1) Subparagraph (C) of section 162(l)(2) of such Code is      amended to read as follows:       ``(C) Long-term care premiums.--No deduction shall be      allowed under this subsection for premiums on any qualified      long-term care insurance contract (as defined in section      7702B(b)).''       (2) Subsection (a) of section 62 of such Code is amended by      inserting after paragraph (17) the following new paragraph:       ``(18) Long-term care insurance costs of certain      individuals.--The deduction allowed by section 222.''       (3) The table of sections for part VII of subchapter B of      chapter 1 of such Code is amended by striking the last item      and inserting the following new items:``Sec. 222. Qualified long-term care insurance costs.``Sec. 223. Cross reference.''       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section      shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31,      1998.                                  ____                                 S. 36       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
