Any announcement made under this Rule shall be promptly      published in the Daily Digest, and promptly made available by      electronic form including the committee website. [XI 2(g)(3)]                        Open Meetings [XI 2 (g)]       (c) Each meeting for the transaction of business, including      the markup of legislation, of the committee shall be open to      the public, including to radio, television, and still      photography coverage, except when the committee, in open      session and with a majority present, determines by record      vote that all or part of the remainder of the meeting on that      day shall be in executive session because disclosure of      matters to be considered would endanger national security,      would compromise sensitive law enforcement information, would      tend to defame, degrade or incriminate any person or      otherwise would violate any law or rule of the House. Persons      other than Members of the committee and such noncommittee      Members, Delegates, Resident Commissioner, congressional      staff, or departmental representatives as the committee      may authorize, may not be present at a business or markup      session that is held in executive session. This rule does      not apply to open committee hearings which are provided      for by Rule 2(d).       (d)(1) Each hearing conducted by the committee shall be      open to the public including radio, television, and still      photography coverage except when the committee, in open      session and with a majority present, determines by record      vote that all or part of the remainder of that hearing on      that day shall be closed to the public because disclosure of      testimony, evidence, or other matters to be considered would      endanger national security, would compromise sensitive law      enforcement information, or would violate a law or rule of      the House of Representatives. Notwithstanding the      requirements of the preceding sentence, and Rule 2(p) a      majority of those present, there being in attendance the      requisite number required under the rules of the committee to      be present for the purpose of taking testimony:       (A) may vote to close the hearing for the sole purpose of      discussing whether testimony or evidence to be received would      endanger the national security, would compromise sensitive      law enforcement information or would violate Rule XI 2(k)(5)      of the Rules of the House of Representatives; or       (B) may vote to close the hearing, as provided in Rule XI      2(k)(5) of the Rules of the House of Representatives. No      Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner may be excluded      from non-participatory attendance at any hearing of any      committee or subcommittee, unless the House of      Representatives shall by majority vote authorize a particular      committee or subcommittee, for purposes of a particular      series of hearings on a particular article of legislation or      on a particular subject of investigation, to close its      hearings to Members, Delegate and the Resident Commissioner      by the same procedures designated in this Rule for closing      hearing to the public: Provided, however, that the committee      or subcommittee may by the same procedure vote to close one      subsequent day of the hearing.                       audio and visual coverage       (e)(A) Whenever a hearing or meeting conducted by the      committee is open to the public, these proceedings shall be      open to coverage by television, radio, and still photography,      except as provided in Rule XI 4(f)(2) of the House of      Representatives. The Chairman shall not be able to limit the      number of television, or still cameras to fewer than two      representatives from each medium (except for legitimate space      or safety considerations in which case pool coverage shall be      authorized).[XI 4]       (B)(1) Radio and television tapes, television film, and      internet recordings of any committee hearings or meetings      that are open to the public may not be used, or made      available for use, as partisan political campaign material to      promote or oppose  the candidacy of any person for elective      public office.       (2) It is, further, the intent of this rule that the      general conduct of each meeting or hearing covered under      authority of this rule by audio or visual means, and the      personal behavior of the Committee Members and staff, other      government officials and personnel, witnesses, television,      radio, and press media personnel, and the general public at      the meeting or hearing, shall be in strict conformity with      and observance of the acceptable standards of dignity,      propriety, courtesy, and decorum traditionally observed by      the House in its operations, and may not be such as to:       (i) distort the objects and purposes of the meeting or      hearing or the activities of Committee Members in connection      with that meeting or hearing or in connection with the      general work of the Committee or of the House; or       (ii) cast discredit or dishonor on the House, the      Committee, or a Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner or      bring the House, the Committee, or a Member, Delegate, or      Resident Commissioner into disrepute.       (3) The coverage of Committee meetings and hearings by      audio and visual means shall     be permitted and conducted only in strict conformity with the      purposes, provisions, and requirements of this rule.       (f) The following shall apply to coverage of Committee      meetings or hearings by audio or visual means:       (1) If audio or visual coverage of the hearing or meeting      is to be presented to the public as live coverage, that      coverage shall be conducted and presented without commercial      sponsorship.       (2) The allocation among the television media of the      positions or the number of television cameras permitted by a      committee or subcommittee chairman in a hearing or meeting      room shall be in accordance with fair and equitable      procedures devised by the Executive Committee of the Radio      and Television Correspondents' Galleries.       (3) Television cameras shall be placed so as not to      obstruct in any way the space between a witness giving      evidence or testimony and any member of the committee or the      visibility of that witness and that member to each other.       (4) Television cameras shall operate from fixed positions      but may not be placed in positions that obstruct      unnecessarily the coverage of the hearing or meeting by the      other media.       (5) Equipment necessary for coverage by the television and      radio media may not be installed in, or removed from, the      hearing or meeting room while the committee is in session.       (6)(A) Except as provided in subdivision (B), floodlights,      spotlights, strobelights, and flashguns may not be used in      providing any method of coverage of the hearing or meeting.       (B) The television media may install additional lighting in      a hearing or meeting room, without cost to the Government, in      order to raise the ambient lighting level in a hearing or      meeting room to the lowest level necessary to provide      adequate television coverage of a hearing or meeting at the      current state of the art of television coverage.       (7) In the allocation of the number of still photographers      permitted by a committee or subcommittee chairman in a      hearing or meeting room, preference shall be given to      photographers from Associated Press Photos and United Press      International Newspictures. If requests are made by more of      the media than will be permitted by a committee or      subcommittee chairman for coverage of a hearing or meeting by      still photography, that coverage shall be permitted on the      basis of a fair and equitable pool arrangement devised by the      Standing Committee of Press Photographers.       (8) Photographers may not position themselves between the      witness table and the members of the committee at any time      during the course of a hearing or meeting.       (9) Phogographers may not place themselves in positions      that obstruct unnecessarily the coverage of the hearing by      the other media.       (10) Personnel providing coverage by the television and      radio media shall be currently accredited to the Radio and      Television Correspondents' Galleries.       (11) Personnel providing coverage by still photography      shall be currently accredited to the Press Photographers'      Gallery.       (12) Personnel providing coverage by the television and      radio media and by still photography shall conduct themselves      and their coverage activities in an orderly and unobtrusive      manner.                            special meetings       (g) Rule XI 2(c) of the Rules of the House of      Representatives is hereby incorporated by reference (Special      Meetings).            vice chairman to preside in absence of chairman       (h) Meetings and hearings of the committee shall be called      to order and presided over by the Chairman or, in the      Chairman's absence, by the member designated by the Chairman      as the Vice Chairman of the committee, or by the ranking      majority member of the committee present as Acting Chairman.
