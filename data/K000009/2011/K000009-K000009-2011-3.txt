Speaker, here we go again. Another phony crisis, courtesy of the extremist bah-humbug House Republicans.  House Republicans have never met a deal they couldn't find a reason to dislike. Now they've resorted to fighting their colleagues in the other body to avoid doing something positive for our country.  Right now, we could be cutting the payroll tax, we could be extending jobless benefits, and approving a Medicare fix for our doctors. The average American family in Cleveland, Lorain, Sandusky, and Toledo now faces a $1,000 tax hike because of the Republican game of chicken.  American middle class families want the payroll tax cut or their taxes will go up on average about $1,000. Millions of Americans need unemployment benefits, but House Republicans need to pick a fight. And it doesn't matter with whom. If they can't fight with Democrats, who are standing up for the middle class, they will fight with their colleagues in the other body.  Here's what I want for Christmas: I want the Republicans to care half as much about manufacturing jobs in America as they care about manufacturing crises. Now wouldn't that be a holiday present?                          ____________________
