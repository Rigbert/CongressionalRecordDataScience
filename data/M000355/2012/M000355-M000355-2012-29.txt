 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a good friend of mine and a distinguished citizen of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Mr. Michael B. McCallister, the highly respected chief executive officer of Humana, will retire from that position at the end of this month. He has served as Humana's CEO for the past 12 years.  Mike has spent his entire career with Humana, Kentucky's largest publicly traded company. After receiving his bachelor's degree from Louisiana Tech University in 1974, he went to work at Humana as a finance specialist. He has steadily risen up the ranks ever since. In 2000, he was named president and CEO of the Louisville-based company.  Humana employs more than 11,000 in Kentucky; thousands of those jobs have been created under Mike's tenure. Mike led the company in innovations such as going all digital to eliminate the use of paper for transactions in 2001, well ahead of the rest of the industry; and in creating consumer-driven products that allowed customers to make more of their own decisions about their health care plans. Under Mike's leadership, in 2004 it was ranked by Business Week magazine as one of the top-performing companies in the United States.  Mike has also been very active in civic and philanthropic endeavors, to the benefit of Kentucky and Louisville, the city we both call home. He headed the most successful communitywide fund drive in the history of the Louisville Metro United Way, raising $30 million in 2006. He was the communitywide chair of the Greater Louisville Fund for the Arts in 2003. He has also served on the board of the Committee Encouraging Corporate Philanthropy. He is the current chairman of the Workplace Wellness Alliance.  Mike's generous spirit of service has also influenced his company as a whole. Under his leadership, the Humana Foundation has donated more than $50 million to education, health, and arts initiatives in Kentucky and across America.  I know my colleagues will join me in extending congratulations and best wishes to Mike as well as his family: he and his wife Charlene have a daughter Megan, and a son Ryan. I am sure they are very proud of him and look forward to seeing more of him. It is my understanding that Mike has promised he will not golf more than twice a week. Also, Mike will not step away from Humana entirely: He will retain a position as its nonexecutive chairman.  Mr. Michael B. McCallister has set a remarkable example of dedication and service to the people of Kentucky. I wish him every success in his next endeavors in life.                          ____________________
