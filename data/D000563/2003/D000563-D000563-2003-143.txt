President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a speech by University of Chicago Law Professor Geoffrey Stone on ``Civil Liberties in Wartime,'' delivered at the annual luncheon of the Chicago Council of Lawyers on July 23. Professor Stone thoughtfully reviews America's history of restricting civil liberties during times of war and our subsequent regret for those decisions. His speech invites reflection by the Members of this Senate as we debate important issues of national security and civil rights, and counsels us to ``value not only [our] own liberties but the liberties of others . . . and to have the wisdom to know excess when it exists and the courage to preserve liberty when it is imperiled.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                       Civil Liberties in Wartime                         (By Geoffrey R. Stone)       We live in perilous times. This is true along several      dimensions, but I focus this afternoon on only one of them:      Civil Liberties in Wartime. Or, more precisely, how are we,      as a nation, responding to the threat of terrorism?       Since September 11th, our government, in our name, has      secretly arrested and detained more than a thousand non-     citizens; it has deported hundreds of non-citizens in secret      proceedings; it has eviscerated long-standing Justice      Department restrictions on FBI surveillance of political and      religious activities; it has vastly expanded the power of      federal officials to invade the privacy of our libraries and      our e-mails; it has incarcerated an American citizen,      arrested on American soil, for almost a year--incommunicado,      with no access to a lawyer, and with no effective judicial      review; it has sharply restricted the protections of the      Freedom of Information Act; it has proposed a TIPS program to      encourage American citizens to spy on one another; it has      laid the groundwork for a Department of Defense Total      Information Awareness program to enable the government to      engage in massive and unprecedented data collection on      American citizens; it has detained a thousand prisoners of      war in Guantanamo Bay in cynical disregard of the laws of      war; and it has established military tribunals without due      process protections. We live in perilous times.       Of course, we have lived in perilous times before. What I      want to discuss this afternoon is how we have responded to      such peril in the past, what we can learn from those      experiences, and what our responsibilities are as lawyers.       I have a simple thesis: In time of war, we respond too      harshly in our restriction of civil liberties, and then,      later, regret our behavior. To test this thesis, I will      review, very briefly, our experiences in 1798, the Civil War,      World War I, World War II, the Cold War and the Viet Nam War.      I will then offer some observations.       To begin, at the beginning. In 1798, the United States      found itself embroiled in a European war that then raged      between France and England. A bitter political and      philosophical debate divided the Federalists, who favored the      English, and the Republicans, who favored the French. The      Federalists were then in power, and the administration of      President John Adams initiated thus a dramatic series of      defense measures that brought the United States into a state      of undeclared war with France.       The Republicans fiercely opposed these measures, leading      the Federalists to accuse them of disloyalty. President      Adams, for example, declared that the Republicans ``would      sink the glory of our country and prostrate her liberties at      the feet of France.'' Against this backdrop, the Federalists      enacted the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798. The Alien Act      empowered the President to deport any non-citizen he judged      to be dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States.      The Act accorded the non-citizen no right to a hearing, no      right to present evidence and no right to judicial review.       The Sedition Act prohibited criticism of the government,      the Congress or the President, with the intent to bring them      into contempt or disrepute. The Act was vigorously enforced,      but only against supporters of the Republican Party.      Prosecutions were brought against every Republican newspaper      and against the most vocal critics of the Adams      administration.       The Sedition Act expired on the last day of Adams's term of      office. The new President, Thomas Jefferson, promptly      pardoned all those who had been convicted under the Act, and      forty years later Congress repaid all the fines. The Sedition      Act was a critical factor in the demise of the Federalist      Party, and the Supreme Court has never missed an opportunity      in the years since to remind us that the Sedition Act of 1798      has been judged unconstitutional in the ``court of history.''       During the Civil War, the nation faced its most serious      challenge. There were sharply divided loyalties, fluid      military and political boundaries, easy opportunities for      espionage and sabotage, and more than 600,000 combat      fatalities. In such circumstances, and in the face of      widespread and often bitter opposition to the war, the draft      and the Emancipation Proclamation, President Lincoln had to      balance the conflicting interests of military necessity and      individual liberty.       During the course of the Civil War, Lincoln suspended the      writ of habeas corpus on eight separate occasions. The most      extreme of these suspensions, which applied throughout the      entire nation, declared that ``all persons . . . guilty of      any disloyal practice . . . shall be subject to court      martial.'' Under this authority, military officers arrested      and imprisoned 38,000 civilians, with no judicial proceedings      and no judicial review.       In 1866, a year after the war ended, the Supreme Court      ruled in Ex parte Milligan that Lincoln had exceeded his      constitutional authority, holding that the President could      not constitutionally suspend the writ of habeas corpus, even      in time of war, if the ordinary civil courts were open and      functioning.       The story of civil liberties during World War I is, in many      ways, even more disturbing. When the United States entered      the war in April 1917, there was strong opposition to both      the war and the draft. Many citizens vehemently argued that      our goal was not to ``make the world safe for democracy,''      but to protect the investments of the wealthy, and that this      cause was not worth the life of one American soldier, let      alone ten or hundreds of thousands.       President Wilson had little patience for such dissent. He      warned that disloyalty ``must be crushed out'' of existence      and that disloyalty ``was . . . not a subject on which there      was room for . . . debate.'' Disloyal individuals, he      explained, ``had sacrificed their right to civil      liberties.''       Shortly after the United States entered the war, Congress      enacted the Espionage Act of 1917. Although the Act was not      directed at dissent generally, aggressive federal prosecutors      and compliant Federal judges soon transformed it into a      blanket prohibition of seditious utterance. The      administration's intent in this regard was made evident in      November 1917 when Attorney General Charles Gregory,      referring to war dissenters, declared: ``May God have mercy      on them, for they need expect none from an outraged people      and an avenging government.''       In fact, the government worked hard to create an ``outraged      people.'' Because there had been no direct attack on the      United States, and no direct threat to our national security,      the Wilson administration had to generate a sense of urgency      and anger in order to exhort Americans to enlist, to      contribute money and to make the many sacrifices that war      demands. To this end, Wilson established the Committee for      Public Information, which produced a flood of inflammatory      and often misleading pamphlets, news releases, speeches,      editorials and motion pictures, all designed to instill a      hatred of all things German and of all persons whose      ``loyalty'' might be open to doubt.       During World War I, the government prosecuted more than      2,000 dissenters for opposing the war or the draft, and in an      atmosphere of fear, hysteria and clamor, most judges were      quick to mete out severe punishment--often 10 to 20 years in      prison--to those deemed disloyal. The result was the      suppression all genuine debate about the merits, the morality      and the progress of the war.       But even this was not enough. A year later, Congress      enacted the Sedition Act of 1918, which expressly prohibited      any disloyal, scurrilous, or abusive language about the form      of government, the Constitution, the flag, the uniform, or      the military forces of the United States. Even the Armistice      didn't bring this era to a close, for the Russian Revolution      triggered a period of intense public paranoia in the United      States, known to us today as the ``Red Scare'' of 1919-1920.      Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer unleashed a horde of      undercover agents to infiltrate so-called radical      organizations, and in a period of only two months the      government arrested more than 5,000 American citizens and      summarily deported more than a thousand aliens on      ``suspicion'' of radicalism.       The story of the Supreme Court in this era is too familiar,      and too painful, to bear repeating in detail. In a series of      decisions in 1919 and 1920--most notably Schenck, Debs, and      Abrams--the Court consistently upheld the convictions of      individuals who had agitated against the war and the draft--     individuals as obscure as Mollie Steimer, a twenty-year-old      Russian-Jewish emigre who had thrown anti-war leaftlets in      Yiddish from a rooftop on the lower East Side of New York,      and as prominent as Eugene Debs, who had received almost a      million votes in 1912 as the Socialist Party candidate for      President.       As Harry Kalven has observed, these decisions left no doubt      of the Court's position: ``While the nation is at war,      serious, abrasive criticism . . . is beyond constitutional      protection.'' These decisions, he added, ``are dismal      evidence of the degree to which the mood of society can      penetrate judicial chambers.'' The Court's performance was      ``simply wretched.''       In December 1920, after all the dust had settled, Congress      quietly repealed the Sedition Act of 1918. Between 1919 and      1923, the government released from prison every individual      who had been convicted under the Espionage and Sedition Acts.      A decade later, President Roosevelt granted amnesty to all of      these individuals, restoring their full political and civil      rights. Over the next half-century, the Supreme Court      overruled every one of its World War I decisions, holding in      effect that every one of the individuals who     had been imprisoned or deported in this era for his or her      dissent had been punished for speech that should have been      protected by the First Amendment.       On December 7, 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. Two      months later, on February 19, 1942, President Roosevelt      signed Executive Order 9066, which authorized the Army to      ``designate military areas'' from which ``any persons may be      excluded.'' Although the words ``Japanese'' or ``Japanese      American'' never appeared in the Order, it was understood to      apply only to persons of Japanese ancestry.       Over the next eight months, 120,000 individuals of Japanese      descent were forced to leave their homes in California,      Washington, Oregon and Arizona. Two-thirds of these      individuals were American citizens, representing almost 90%      of all Japanese-Americans. No charges were brought against      these individuals; there were no hearings; they did not know      where they were going, how long they would be detained, what      conditions they would face, or what fate would await them.      Many families lost everything.       On the orders of military police, these individuals were      transported to one of ten internment camps, which were      located in isolated areas in wind-swept deserts or vast swamp      lands. Men, women and children were placed in overcrowded      rooms with no furniture other than cots. They found      themselves surrounded by barbed wire and military police, and      there they remained for three years.       In Korematsu v. United States, decided in 1944, the Supreme      Court, in a six-to- three decision, upheld the President's      action. The Court offered the following explanation:       We are not unmindful of the hardships imposed upon a large      group of American citizens. But hardships are part of war,      and war is an aggregation of hardships. Korematsu was not      excluded from the West Coast because of hostility to his      race, but because the military authorities decided that the      urgency of the situation demanded that all citizens of      Japanese ancestry be segregated from the area. We cannot--by      availing ourselves of the calm perspective of hindsight--say      that these actions were unjustified.       In 1980, a congressional commission declared that the      Japanese internment had been based, not on considerations of      military necessity, but on crass racial prejudice and      political expediency. Eight years later, President Reagan      signed the Civil Liberties Restoration Act of 1988, which      offered an official Presidential apology and reparations to      each of the Japanese-American internees who had suffered      discrimination, loss of liberty, loss of property and      personal humiliation because of the actions of the United      States government.       As World War II drew to a close, the nation moved almost      seamlessly into the Cold War. As the glow of our wartime      alliance with the Soviet Union evaporated, President Truman      came under increasing attack from a coalition of Southern      Democrats and anti-New Deal Republicans who sought to exploit      fears of Communist aggression. As House Republican leader Joe      Martin declared on the eve of the 1946 election, ``the people      will choose tomorrow `between communism and the preservation      of our American life.' '' The next day, the Democrats lost 56      seats in the House.       Thereafter, the issue of loyalty became a shuttlecock of      party politics. By 1948, President Truman was boasting on the      stump that he had imposed on the federal civil service the      most extreme loyalty program in the entire ``Free World,''      and he had. But there were limits to Truman's anti-communism.      In 1950, he vetoed the McCarren Act, which required the      registration of all Communists. Truman explained that the Act      was the product of ``public hysteria'' and would lead to      ``witch hunts.'' Congress passed the Act over Truman's veto.       In 1954, Congress enacted the Communist Control Act, which      stripped the Communist Party of ``all rights, privileges, and      immunities.'' Only one Senator, Estes Kefauver, dared to vote      against it. Irving Howe lamented ``this Congressional      stampede to . . . trample . . . liberty in the name of      destroying its enemy.''       Hysteria over the Red Menace swept the nation and produced      a wide-range of federal, state and local restrictions on free      expression and free association, including extensive loyalty      programs for government employees; emergency detention plans      for alleged ``subversives''; abusive legislative      investigations designed to punish by exposure; public and      private blacklists of those alleged ``pinkos'' who had been      ``exposed''; and criminal prosecution of the leaders and      members of the Communist Party of the United States.       The Supreme Court's response was mixed. The key decision,      however, was Dennis v. United States, which involved the      direct prosecution under the Smith Act of the leaders of the      American Communist Party. In a six-to-two decision, the Court      held in 1951 that the defendants could constitutionally be      punished for their speech under the clear and present danger      test even though the Court readily conceded that the danger      was neither clear nor present. It was a memorable stroke of      judicial legerdemain.       Over the next several years, the Court upheld far-reaching      legislative investigations of ``subversive'' organizations      and individuals and the exclusion of members of the Communist      Party from the bar, the ballot and public employment. In so      doing, the Court clearly put its stamp of approval on an      array of actions we look back on today as models of      McCarthyism.       In the Vietnam War, as in the Civil War and World War I,      there was substantial opposition both to the war and the      draft. Lest we forget the stresses of those years, let me      quote briefly from Theodore White's eyewitness account of the      1968 Democratic Convention:       The demonstrators chant ``Peace Now'' as they approach the      Chicago police picket-lines. Then, like a fist, comes a      hurtling column of police. It is a scene from the Russian      revolution. Gas grenades explode. Demonstrators kneel and      begin singing America the Beautiful. Clubs come down. ``The      Whole World is Watching.''       Over the next several years, the nation entered a period of      intense and often violent struggle. After President Nixon      announced the American ``incursion'' into Cambodia, student      strikes closed a hundred campuses. Governor Ronald Reagan,      asked about campus militants, replied: ``If it takes a      bloodbath, let's get it over with.'' On May 4, National      Guardsmen at Kent State University responded to taunts and      rocks by firing their M-1 rifles into a crowd of students,      killing four and wounding nine others. Protests and strikes      exploded at more than twelve hundred of the nation's colleges      and universities. Thirty ROTC buildings were burned or bombed      in the first week of May. The National Guard was mobilized in      sixteen states. As Henry Kissinger put it later, ``The very      fabric of government was falling apart.''       Despite all this, there was no systematic effort during the      Vietnam War to prosecute individuals for their opposition to      the war. As Todd Gitlin has rightly observed, in comparison      to World War I, ``the repression of the late sixties and      early seventies was mild.'' There are many reasons for this,      including, of course, the rather compelling fact that most of      the dissenters in this era were the sons and daughters of the      middle class, and thus could not so easily be targeted as the      ``other.'' But the courts, and especially the Supreme Court,      played a key role in this period. In 1969, the Court, in      Brandenburg, overruled Dennis and held that even advocacy of      unlawful conduct cannot be punished unless it is likely to      incite ``imminent lawless action.'' The Court had come a long      way in the fifty years since World War I.       But the Court did not rest there. In other decisions it      held that the Georgia House of Representatives could not deny      Julian Bond his seat because of his express opposition to the      draft; that a public university could not deny recognition to      the SDS because it advocated a philosophy of violence; that      the government could not conduct national security wiretaps      without prior judicial approval; and, of course, that the      government could not constitutionally enjoin the publication      of the Pentagon Papers, even though the Defense Department      claimed that publication would endanger national security.       This is not to say that the government did not find other      ways to impede dissent. The most significant of these was the      FBI's extensive effort to ``expose, disrupt and otherwise      neutralize'' allegedly ``subversive'' organizations, ranging      from civil rights groups to the various factions of the anti-     war movement. In this COINTELPRO operation, the FBI compiled      political dossiers on more than half-a-million Americans.       When these activities came to light they were sharply      condemned by congressional committees, and Attorney General      Edward Levi declared such practices incompatible with our      national values. In 1976, he instituted a series of      guidelines designed to restrict the political surveillance      activities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.       What can we learn from this history? I would like to offer      at least a dozen observations. But time limits me to only      six.       First, we have a long and unfortunate history of      overreacting to the perceived dangers of wartime. Time after      time, we have allowed our fears to get the better of us.       Second, it is often argued that given the sacrifices we ask      citizens (especially soldiers) to make in time of war, it is      small price to ask others to surrender some of their      peacetime freedoms to help the war effort. As the Supreme      Court argued in Korematsu, ``hardships are part of war, and      war is an aggregation of hardships.''       This is a seductive, but dangerous argument. To fight a war      successfully, it is necessary for soldiers to risk their      lives. But it is not necessarily ``necessary'' for others to      surrender their freedoms. That necessity must be convincingly      demonstrated, not merely presumed. And this is especially      true when, as is usually the case, the individuals whose      rights are sacrificed are not those who make the laws, but      minorities, dissidents and non-citizens. In those      circumstances, ``we'' are making a decision to sacrifice      ``their'' rights--not a very prudent way to balance the      competing interests.       Third, the Supreme Court matters. It's often said that      presidents do what they please in wartime. Attorney General      Biddle once observed that ``the Constitution has not greatly      bothered any wartime President,'' and Chief Justice Rehnquist      recently argued that ``there is no reason to think that      future wartime presidents will act differently from Lincoln,      Wilson, or Roosevelt.''       In fact, however, the record is more complex than this      suggests. Although presidents may think of themselves as      bound more by political than by constitutional constraints in      time of war, the two are linked. Lincoln did not propose a      Sedition Act, Wilson rejected calls to suspend the writ of      habeas     corpus and Bush has not advocated loyalty oaths. The fact is      that even during wartime, presidents have not attempted to      restrict civil liberties in the face of settled Supreme Court      precedent. Although presidents often will push the envelope      where the law is unclear, they do not defy established      constitutional doctrine.       Fourth, it is often said that the Supreme Court will not      decide a case against the government on an issue of military      security during a period of national emergency. The decisions      most often cited in support of this proposition are, of      course, Korematsu and Dennis. In fact, however, there are      many counter-examples.       During World War II, the Court upheld the constitutional      rights of American fascists in a series of criminal      prosecutions and denaturalization proceedings, effectively      putting a halt to government efforts to punish such      individuals. During the Cold War, the Court rejected      President Truman's effort to seize the steel industry and      eventually helped put an end to the era of McCarthyism. And      during Vietnam, the Court repeatedly rejected national      security claims by the Executive. So, although it is true      that the Court tends to be wary not to ``hinder'' an ongoing      war unnecessarily, it is also true that the Court has a      significant record of fulfilling its constitutional      responsibility to protect individual liberties--even in time      of war.       Fifth, it is useful to note the circumstances that have      tended to produce these abuses. They invariably arise out of      the combination of a national perception of peril and a      concerted campaign by government to promote a sense of      national hysteria by exaggeration, manipulation and      distortion. The goal of the government in fostering such      public anxiety may be either to make it easier for it to gain      public acceptance of the measures it seeks to impose or to      gain partisan political advantage, or, of course, both. If      all that sounds familiar, it should.       Finally, I want to say a word about our responsibilities as      lawyers. In each of these episodes, lawyers played an      important role, both in imposing the restrictions on civil      liberties, and in opposing them. At the moment, I'm more      interested in the latter. Albert Gallatin offered brilliant      arguments in opposition to the Alien and Sedition Acts.      Gilbert Roe defended the free speech rights of dissenters in      World War I. Professors Ernst Freund and Felix Frankfurter,      of the Chicago and Harvard law schools, played a critical      role in illuminating the civil rights violations of the Red      Scare and bringing that era to a close. Francis Biddle played      a courageous role within the Roosevelt administration during      World War II in opposing both the Japanese internment and the      prosecution of American fascists. Joseph Welsch, a Boston      lawyer, publicly humiliated Senator Joseph McCarthy hearings      with his blistering questions ``Have you no sense of decency,      sir, at long last? Have you left no sense of decency?'' And a      group of lawyers here in Chicago from such organizations as      BPI, the ACLU, the Better Government Association and the      Alliance to End Repression helped put an end to end      COINTELPRO and to the City of Chicago's Red Squad during the      Vietnam War.       Now, to return to our own perilous time. The threat of      terrorism is real, and we expect our government to protect      us. But we have seen disturbing, and all-too-familiar,      patterns in our government's activities. To strike the right      balance in our time, we need judges who will stand fast      against the furies of the age; members of the academy who      will help us see ourselves clearly; an informed and tolerant      public who will value not only their own liberties, but the      liberties of others; and, perhaps most of all, lawyers with      the wisdom to know excess when it exists and the courage to      preserve liberty when it is imperiled.       Thank you.                          ____________________
