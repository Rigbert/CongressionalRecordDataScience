President, I am pleased to introduce the ``Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act of 2002.'' I want to thank the majority leader, and Senators Durbin and Harkin for joining me as original cosponsors in this effort to prevent corporate and criminal fraud, protect shareholders and employees, and hold wrongdoers accountable for their actions.  This bill is a crucial part of ensuring that the corporate fraud and greed that have been on display in the Enron debacle can be better detected, prevented and prosecuted. We cannot legislate against greed, but we can do our best to make sure that greed does not succeed.  The fraud at Enron was not the work of novices. It was the work of highly educated professionals, spinning an intricate spider's web of deceit. They created sham partnerships with names like Jedi, Chewco, Rawhide, Ponderosaand Sundance to cook the books and trick both the public and federal regulators. The actions of Enron's executives, accountants, and lawyers exhibits a ``Wild West'' attitude which valued profit over honesty.  Nor is this web of corporate deceit the end of the Enron story. When they thought that investigators might be coming, what did these ``professional'' men and women apparently do? First, they warmed up the shredders and began destroying evidence. Then, after they successfully shredded thousands of documents, they began the finger pointing. Now, the Enron executives are blaming their accountants at Arthur Andersen; the accountants are blaming the executives right back; and they are both blaming their lawyers.  The truth is that just as there was enough greed to go around, there is now enough blame to go around. But the blame does not end with the people involved in this case. It extends to our courts, our regulators, and to Congress, whose actions in the past decade helped create the permissive atmosphere which allowed Enron to happen. No one in Congress intended for such outrageous conduct to happen, but now it is our job to stop it.  We must restore accountability. Accountability is important because Enron is not alone. At a Judiciary Committee hearing which I recently chaired, experts gave the public markets grave warnings, it is likely that there are more ``Enrons'' lurking out there waiting to be discovered. Waiting to be discovered not only by investigators or the media but by the more than one in two Americans who depend on the transparency and integrity of our markets.  The majority of Americans depend on our capital markets to invest in the future needs of themselves and their families, from their children's college fund to their retirement nest eggs. American investors are watching what we do here and want action. We must act now to restore confidence in the integrity of our markets and deter fraud artists who think that their crimes will go unpunished. Restoring such accountability is what this bill is all about.  This bill has three major components that will enhance accountability. First, this bill provides prosecutors with new and better tools to effectively prosecute and punish those who defraud our Nation's investors, which means ensuring our criminal laws are flexible enough to keep pace with the most sophisticated and clever con artists. It also means providing criminal penalties which are tough enough to make them think twice about defrauding the public.  Second, this bill provides tools that will improve the ability of investigators and regulators to collect and preserve evidence which proves fraud. That means ensuring that corporate whistleblowers are protected and that those who destroy evidence of fraud are punished. Third, the bill protects victims' rights to recover from those who have cheated them. In short, this bill is going to both save documents from the shredder and send wrongdoers to jail once they are caught.  This bill is only one part of the response needed to solve the problems exposed by Enron's fall. Securities law experts, consumer protection groups, and others Members of Congress, both in the Senate and the House of Representatives, have made other proposals and introduced legislation that deserves careful consideration. Working with the majority leader, we have developed a comprehensive plan to attack this problem. Certainly, in light of recent events, we must carefully reexamine both the decisions of the Supreme Court and our current laws. Despite the best of intentions, our laws may have helped create an environment in which greed was inflated and integrity devalued. This bill is an important starting point in that process. Let me explain its provisions.  Section 2 of the bill would create two new 5 year felonies to clarify and plug holes in the existing criminal laws relating to the destruction or fabrication of evidence, including the shredding of financial and audit records. Currently, those provisions are a patchwork which have been interpreted, often very narrowly, by Federal courts. For instance, certain of the current provisions in Title 18, such as Section 1512(b), make it a crime to persuade another person to destroy documents, but not a crime for a person to personally destroy the same documents. Other provisions, such as Section 1503, have been narrowly interpreted by courts, including the Supreme Court in United States v. Aguillar, 115 S. Ct. 593 (1995), and the First Circuit in United States v. Frankhauser, 80 F.3d 641 (1st Cir. 1996), to apply only to situations where the obstruction of justice may be closely tied to a judicial proceeding that is already pending. Still other provisions, such as sections 152(8), 1517 and 1518 apply to obstruction in certain limited types of cases, such as bankruptcy fraud, examinations of financial institutions, and healthcare fraud. In short, the current laws regarding destruction of evidence are full of ambiguities and limitations that should be corrected.  Section 2 would create a new felony, 18 U.S.C. section 1519, for use in a wide array of cases in which a person destroys evidence with the specific intent to obstruct a Federal agency or a criminal investigation. There would be no technical requirement that a judicial proceeding was already underway or that the documents were formally under subpoena. The law would also be used to prosecute a person who actually destroys the records themself in addition to one who persuades another to do so. The law would apply to the intentional shredding of evidence in any matter within Federal regulatory or civil jurisdiction, such as an SEC or civil fraud matter, as well as criminal jurisdiction, eliminating another series of technical distinctions imposed by some courts under current law.  Second, Section 2 creates a 5-year felony, 18 U.S.C. section 1520, to punish the willful failure to preserve financial audit papers of companies that issue securities as defined in the Securities Exchange Act. The new statute, in subsection (a), would require that accountants preserve audit records for 5 years from the conclusion of the audit. Subsection (b) would make it a felony to knowingly and willfully violate the 5-year audit retention period. This section both penalizes the willful failure to maintain specified audit records and sets a bright line rule that would require accountants to put strong safeguards in place to ensure that such records are, in fact, retained. Had such clear requirements been in place at the time that Arthur Andersen was considering what to do with its audit documents, countless documents might have been saved from the shredder.  Section 3 of this bill proposes an amendment to the civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations, RICO, statute, enhance the abilities of Federal and State regulators to enforce existing law. It would give State Attorneys General and the Securities and Exchange Commission, ``SEC'', explicit authority to bring a suit under the civil RICO provisions. Currently, only the U.S. Attorney General has such authority under RICO. At a Judiciary Committee hearing on Enron's fall, Washington State Attorney General Christine Gregoire strongly supported this change, testifying that State and local law enforcers are on the front lines in protecting consumer's rights. Providing such authority to State Attorneys General and to the SEC would provide them a potent weapon in that battle and would allow us to take advantage of their significant expertise in protecting consumers.  Others have suggested that we also consider repealing the one-of-a-kind securities fraud exception to civil RICO, created in 1995 over the veto of President Clinton. Congressman Conyers, the distinguished ranking minority member of the House Judiciary Committee, has already introduced a bill to repeal this unique exemption. As someone who voted against the 1995 Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and voted to sustain President Clinton's veto, I did not support this one-of-a-kind exemption when it became law. Now, given what has happened in our markets, I think that we all need to consider whether or not the exemption for securities fraud makes sense. No one who voted for the 1995 Private Securities Litigation Reform Act or voted to override President Clinton's veto meant for Enron to occur, but now that it has occurred, none of us can ignore it.  In addition to giving the SEC the authority to sue under civil RICO, we have to ensure that the SEC has all the powers and resources that it needs to protect our Nation's shareholders. TheSEC needs to have sufficient attorneys, training, and investigative resources, and enough power to pursue the most complex of cases against the best funded defendants in our legal system. In particular, one idea that is worth serious consideration is amending the statutes related to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to allow SEC attorneys in fraud investigations to seek search warrants from a Federal judge, the same way that Department of Justice attorneys currently may, when they can demonstrate probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed. Taking such a step might allow the SEC to act more quickly and to prevent the destruction of documents and evidence in the future, as they were not able to do in the Enron case. The SEC has to have the tools it needs to protect what has truly become a nation of shareholders.  Section 4 of this bill would amend the Bankruptcy Code to make judgments and settlements based upon securities law violations non-dischargeable, protecting victims' ability to recover their losses. Current bankruptcy law may permit such wrongdoers to discharge their obligations under court judgments or settlements based on securities fraud and other securities violations. This loophole in the law should be closed to help defrauded investors recoup their losses and to hold accountable those who perpetrate securities fraud after a government unit or private suit results in a judgment or settlement against the wrongdoer.  State securities regulators have indicated their strong support for this change in the bankruptcy law, and I have received letters supporting the passage of this bill from the North American Securities Administrators Association, whose membership includes the securities administrators in all 50 States and Vermont's chief banking and securities regulator. Under current laws, State regulators are often forced to ``reprove'' their fraud cases in bankruptcy court to prevent discharge because remedial statutes often have different technical elements than the analogous common law causes of action. Moreover, settlements may not have the same collateral estoppel effect as judgments obtained through fully litigated legal proceedings. In short, with their resources already stretched to the breaking point, these State regulators have to plow the same ground twice in securities fraud cases. By ensuring securities fraud judgments and settlements in State cases are non-dischargeable, precious state enforcement resources will be preserved and directed at preventing fraud in the first place.  Section 5 would protect victims by extending the statute of limitations in private securities fraud cases. This section would set the statute of limitations in private securities fraud cases to the earlier of 5 years after the date of the fraud or 3 years after the fraud was discovered. The current statute of limitations for such fraud cases is 3 years from the date of the fraud. This can unfairly limit recovery for defrauded investors in some cases. As Attorney General Gregoire testified at our recent hearing, in the Enron State pension fund litigation the current short statute of limitations has forced some States to forgo claims against Enron based on securities fraud in 1997 and 1998. In Washington State alone, the short statute of limitations may cost hard working State employees, firefighters and police officers nearly $50 million, lost Enron investments which they can never recover under current law.  Especially in complex securities fraud cases, the current short statute of limitations may insulate the worst offenders from accountability. As Justices O'Connor and Kennedy said in their dissent in Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis, & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 111 S. Ct. 2773 (1991), the 5-4 decision upholding this short statute of limitations in most securities fraud cases, the current ``one and three'' limitations period makes securities fraud actions ``all but a dead letter for injured investors who by no conceivable standard of fairness or practicality can be expected to file suit within 3 years after the violation occurred.'' The Consumers Union also strongly supports the bill, and views this section in particular as a needed measure to protect investors.  The experts agree with that view. In fact, the last two SEC Chairmen supported extending the statute of limitations in securities fraud cases. Then Chairman Arthur Levitt testified before a Senate Subcommittee in 1995 that ``extending the statute of limitations is warranted because many securities frauds are inherently complex, and the law should not reward the perpetrator of a fraud, who successfully conceals its existence for more than 3 years.'' Before Chairman Levitt, in the last Bush administration, then SEC Chairman Richard Breeden also testified before Congress in favor of extending the statute of limitations in securities fraud cases. Reacting to the Lampf opinion, Breeden stated in 1991 that ``[e]vents only come to light years after the original distribution of securities, and the Lampf cases could well mean that by the time investors discover they have a case, they are already barred from the courthouse.'' Both the FDIC and the State securities regulators joined the SEC in calling for a legislative reversal of the Lampf decisions at that time.  In fraud cases the short limitations period under current law is an invitation to take sophisticated steps to conceal the deceit. The experts have long agreed on that point, but unfortunately they have been proven right again. As we know from recent experience, it only takes a few seconds to warm up the shredder, but unfortunately it will take years for victims to put this complex case back together again. It is time that the law be changed to give victims the time they need to prove their fraud cases.  Section 6 of this bill ensures that those who destroy evidence or perpetrate fraud are appropriately punished. It would require the United States Sentencing Commission, ``Commission'', to consider enhancing criminal penalties in cases involving the actual destruction or fabrication of evidence or in serious fraud cases where a large number of victims are injured or when the victims face financial ruin.  Currently, the United States Sentencing Guidelines recognize that a wide variety of conduct falls under the offense of ``obstruction of justice.'' For obstruction cases involving the murder of a witness or another crime, the guidelines allow, by cross reference, significant enhancements based on the underlying crimes, such as murder or attempted murder. For cases where obstruction is the only offense, however, they provide little guidance on differentiating between different types of obstruction. This provision requests that the Sentencing Commission consider a specific enhancement in cases where evidence and records are actually destroyed or fabricated in order to thwart investigators, a serious form of obstruction.  This provision, in subsections 3 and 4, also requires the Commission to consider enhancing the penalties in fraud cases which are particularly extensive or serious. The current fraud guidelines require the sentencing judge to take the number of victims into account, but only to a very limited degree in small and medium-sized cases. Specifically, once there are more than 50 victims, the guidelines do not require any further enhancement of the sentence, so that a case with 51 victims may be treated the same as a case with 5,000 victims. As the Enron matter demonstrates, serious frauds, especially in cases where publicly traded securities are involved, can effect thousands of victims. The Commission may well have not foreseen such extensive cases, and subsection 3 requires it to reconsider whether they merit an additional enhancement.  In addition, current guidelines allow only very limited consideration of the extent of devastation that a fraud offense causes its victims. Judges may only consider whether a fraud endangers the ``solvency or financial security'' of a victim to impose an upward departure from the recommended sentencing range. It is not a factor in establishing the range itself unless a bank is the victim. Subsection 4 requires the Commission to consider requiring judges to consider the extent of the fraud in setting the actual recommended sentencing range in cases such as the Enron matter, where many private victims have lost their life savings.  Section 7 of the bill would provide whistleblower protection to employees of publicly traded companies who report acts of fraud to Federal officialswith the authority to remedy the wrongdoing or to supervisors or appropriate individuals within their company. Although current law protects many government employees who act in the public interest by reporting wrongdoing, there is no similar protection for employees of publicly traded companies who blow the whistle on fraud and protect investors. With an unprecedented portion of the American public investing in these companies and depending upon their honesty, this distinction does not serve the public good.  In addition, corporate employees who report fraud are subject to the patchwork and vagaries of current State laws, even though most publicly traded companies do business nationwide. Thus, a whistleblowing employee in one State may be far more vulnerable to retaliation than a fellow employee in another State who takes the same actions. Unfortunately, one thing that often transcends State lines, as we all know from the State tobacco litigation, are certain companies with a corporate culture that punishes whistleblowers for being ``disloyal'' and ``litigation risks.''  Most corporate employers, with help from their lawyers, know exactly what they can do to a whistleblowing employee under the law. Unfortunately, Enron has supplied us with another grievous example of corporate conduct as shown by a recently released email from one of Enron's lawyers. The email responds to a request for legal advice after an Enron employee tried to report accounting irregularities at the highest levels of the company in late August, 2001:       You asked that I include in this communication a summary of      the possible risks associated with discharging (or      constructively discharging) employees who report allegations      of improper accounting practices: 1. Texas law does not      currently protect corporate whistleblowers. The supreme court      has twice declined to create a cause of action for      whistleblowers who are discharged . . .  This legal advice lays bare the fact that employees who do the ``right thing'' are vulnerable to retaliation. After this high level employee at Enron reported improper accounting practices, Enron is not thinking about firing Arthur Andersen, they are considering discharging the whistle blower. No wonder that so many employees are scared to come forward. Our laws need to encourage and protect those who report fraudulent activity that damages investors in publicly traded companies. That is why this bill is supported by groups such as the National Whistleblower Center, the Government Accountability Project, and Taxpayers Against Fraud, who have written a letter calling this bill ``the single most effective measure possible to prevent recurrences of the Enron debacle and similar threats to the nation's financial markets.''  This bill would create a new provision protecting employees when they take lawful acts to disclose information or otherwise assist criminal investigators, Federal regulators, Congress, their supervisors, or other proper people within a corporation, or parties in a judicial proceeding in detecting and stopping actions which they reasonably believe to be fraudulent. Since the only acts protected are ``lawful'' ones, the bill would not protect illegal actions, such as the improper public disclosure of trade secret information. In addition, a reasonableness test is also provided under the subsection (a)(1), which is intended to impose the normal reasonable person standard used and interpreted in a wide variety of legal contexts. See generally Passaic Valley Sewerage Commissioners v. Department of Labor, 992 F. 2d 474, 478. Certainly, although not exclusively, any type of corporate or agency action taken based on the information or the information constituting admissible evidence would be strong indicia that it could support of such a reasonable belief. Under this bill's new protections, if the employer does take illegal action in retaliation for such lawful and protected conduct, subsection b allows the employee to elect to file an administrative complaint at the Department of Labor, as is the case for employees who provide assistance in airplane safety, or to bring a case in Federal court, with a jury trial available for an action at law. See United States Constitution, Amendment VII; Title 42 United States Code, Section 1983.  Subsection (c) of this section would require both reinstatement of the whistleblower, double backpay, and compensatory damages to make a victim whole. In severe cases, where the finder of fact determines that underlying fraud posed a substantial risk to the shareholders' or the general public's health, safety or welfare, punitive damages would be allowed in the discretion of the finder of fact based on a number of enumerated factors. The bill does not supplant or replace State law, but sets a national floor for employee protections in the context of publicly traded companies.  Section 8 of the bill would create a new ten year felony under Title 18 for defrauding shareholders of publicly traded companies. Currently, unlike bank fraud or health care fraud, there is no generally accessible statute dealing with the specific problem of securities fraud. In these cases, Federal investigators and prosecutors are forced either to resort to a patchwork of technical Title 15 offenses, which may criminalize particular violations of securities law, or to treat the cases as generic mail or wire fraud cases and to meet the technical elements of those statutes, with their 5 year maximum penalties.  This bill, then, would create a new ten year felony for securities fraud, a more general and less technical provision comparable to the bank fraud and health care fraud statutes in Title 18. Specifically, it would add a provision to Chapter 63 of Title 18 which would criminalize the execution or attempted execution of a scheme or artifice to defraud persons in connection with securities of publicly traded companies or obtain their money or property. The provision would provide needed enforcement flexibility in the context of publicly traded companies to protect shareholders and prospective shareholders against all the types of schemes and frauds which inventive criminals may devise in the future.  This bill can only be part of the needed response to the problems exposed by the Enron debacle. It is clear that changes are needed to restore accountability in our markets. As a lawyer and a former prosecutor I am appalled at the role that lawyers and accountants played in the Enron case. Instead of acting as gatekeepers who detect and deter fraud, it appears that Enron's accountants and lawyers brought all their skills and knowledge to bear in assisting the fraud to succeed and then in covering it up. We need to reconsider the incentive system that has been set up that encourages accountants and lawyers who come across fraud in their work to remain silent.  Others have suggested that we restore aider and abettor liability to the law as it existed for almost five decades before the Supreme Court, in another 5-4 decision, took away the ability of private parties to sue aiders and abettors for securities fraud. I hope that Senators on the Banking Committee will seriously consider this change, which restores the ability to hold liable accountants and lawyers who knowingly or recklessly provide substantial assistance in perpetrating a fraud. Others have also proposed to restore joint and several liability in securities fraud cases so that fraud victims are not left empty handed watching the accountants, lawyers, and executives point fingers at each other, until they can blame everything on the one company that files for bankruptcy protection, like Enron, another change worth careful consideration. In short, we have to ask ourselves whether, as a nation, we have unintentionally stacked the deck against fraud victims. I think that we have, and we need to have the courage to admit it and reshuffle the cards to restore basic fairness.  For all of these reasons, I am pleased to introduce the ``Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act of 2002.'' I look forward to working with members on both sides of the aisle to enact its provisions into law.  I ask unanimous consent for this bill to be printed in the Record along with the sectional analysis and a copy of the entire e-mail document to which I referred as well as the letters of support which I have referenced.  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2010       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the      beginning of chapter 73 of title 18, United States Code, is      amended by inserting after the item relating to section 1514      the following new item:``1514A. Civil action to protect against retaliation in fraud cases.''.     SEC. 8. CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR DEFRAUDING SHAREHOLDERS OF                    PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES.       (a) In General.--Chapter 63 of title 18, United States      Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:     ``Sec. 1348. Securities fraud       ``Whoever knowingly executes, or attempts to execute, a      scheme or artifice--       ``(1) to defraud any person in connection with any security      registered under section 12 or 15(d) of the Securities      Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78l, 78o(d)) or section 6 of      the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77f); or       ``(2) to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses,      representations, or promises, any money or property in      connection with the purchase or sale of any security      registered under section 12 or 15(d) of the Securities      Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78l, 78o(d)) or section 6 of      the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77f),     shall be fined under this title, or imprisoned not more than      10 years, or both.''.       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the      beginning of chapter 63 of title 18, United States Code, is      amended by adding at the end the following new item:``1348. Securities fraud.''.                                  ____Sectional Analysis: Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act of                                   2002     Section 1. Title.       ``Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act.''     Section 2. Criminal Penalties for Altering, Destroying, or          Failing to Maintain Documents       This section provides two new criminal statutes which would      clarify and plug holes in the current criminal laws relating      to the destruction or fabrication of evidence, including the      shredding of financial and audit records. Currently, those      provisions are a patchwork which have been interpreted in      often limited ways in federal court. For instance, certain of      the current provisions make it a crime to persuade another      person to destroy documents, but not a crime to actually      destroy the same documents yourself. Other provisions have      been narrowly interpreted by courts, including the Supreme      Court in United States v. Aguillar, 115 S. Ct. 593 (1995), to      apply only to situations where the obstruction of justice can      be closely tied to a pending judicial proceeding.       First, this section would create a new 5 year felony which      could be effectively used in a wide array of cases where a      person destroys or creates evidence with the specific intent      to obstruct a federal agency or a criminal investigation.      Second, the section creates another 5 year felony which      applies specifically to the willful failure to preserve audit      papers of companies that issue securities.     Section 3. Amendment to Improve Enforcement of Civil RICO       This section proposes an amendment to the civil RICO      provision found at 18 U.S.C. Section 1964 which would enhance      the abilities of federal and state regulators to enforce      existing law by giving State Attorneys General and the      Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, explicit authority      to bring a suit under the civil RICO provisions. Currently,      only the Attorney General has such authority under RICO.     Section 4. Bankruptcy       This provision would amend the Federal bankruptcy code to      make judgments and settlements arising from state and federal      securities law violations brought by state or federal      regulators and private individuals non-dischargeable. Current      bankruptcy law may permit wrongdoers to discharge their      obligations under court judgments or settlements based on      securities fraud and securities law violations. This loophole      in the law should be closed to help defrauded investors      recoup their losses and to hold accountable those who      perpetrate securities fraud.     Section 5. Statute of Limitations       This section would set the statute of limitations in      private securities fraud cases to the earlier of 5 years      after the date of the fraud or three years after the fraud      was discovered. The current statute of limitations for      private securities fraud cases is the earlier of three      years from the date of the fraud or one year from the date      of discovery. In the Enron state pension fund litigation,      the current short statute of limitations has forced some      states to forgo claims against Enron based on securities      fraud in 1997 and 1998. Victims of securities fraud should      have a reasonable time to discover the facts underlying      the fraud.       The Supreme Court, in Lampf v. Gilbertson, 501 U.S. 350      (1991), endorsed the current short statute of limitations for      securities fraud in a 5-4 decision. Justices O'Connor and      Kennedy wrote in their dissent in the Lampf decison: ``By      adopting a 3-year period of repose, the Court makes a      Sec. 10(b) action all but a dead letter for injured investors      who by no conceivable standard of fairness or practicality      can be expected to file suit within three years after the      violation occurred. In so doing, the Court also turns its      back on the almost uniform rule rejecting short periods of      repose for fraud-based actions.''     Section 6. Review and Enhancement of Criminal Sentences in          Cases of Fraud and Evidence Destruction       This section would require the United States Sentencing      Commission, ``Commission'', to consider enhancing criminal      penalties in cases involving the actual destruction or      fabrication of evidence or in fraud cases in which a large      number of victims are injured or when the injury to the      victims is particularly grave, i.e. they face financial ruin.       This provision first requires the Commission to consider      sentencing enhancements in obstruction of justice cases where      physical evidence was actually destroyed. The provision, in      subsections 3 and 4, also requires the Commission to consider      sentencing enhancements for fraud cases which are      particularly extensive or serious. Specifically, once there      are more than 50 victims, the current guidelines do not      require any further enhancement of the sentence, so that a      case with 51 victims may be treated the same as a case with      5,000 victims. In addition, current guidelines allow only      very limited consideration of the extent of financial      devastation that a fraud offense causes to private victims.      This section corrects both these problems.     Section 7. Whistleblower Protection for Employees of Publicly          Traded Companies       This section would provide whistleblower protection to      employees of publicly traded companies, similar to those      currently available to many government employees. It      specifically protects them when they take lawful acts to      disclose information or otherwise assist criminal      investigators, federal regulators, Congress, supervisors (or      other proper people within a corporation), or parties in a      judicial proceeding in detecting and stopping fraud. Since      the bill's provisions only apply to ``lawful'' actions by an      employee, it does not protect employees from improper and      unlawful disclosure of trade secrets. In addition, a      reasonableness test is also set forth under the information      providing subsection of this section, which is intended to      impose the normal reasonable person standard used and      interpreted in a wide variety of legal contexts. See      generally Passaic Valley Sewerage Commissioners v. Department      of Labor, 992 F. 2d 474, 478. Certainly, although not      exclusively, any type of corporate or agency action taken      based on the information, or the information constituting or      leading to admissible evidence would be strong indicia that      it could support of such a reasonable belief. If the employer      does take illegal action in retaliation for lawful and      protected conduct, subsection (b) allows the employee to      elect to file an administrative complaint or to bring a case      in federal court, with a jury trial available in cases where      the case is an action at law. See United States Constitution,      Amendment VII; Title 42 United States Code, Section 1983.      Subsection (c) would require both reinstatement of the      whistleblower, double backpay, compensatory damages to make a      victim whole, and would allow punitive damages in extreme      cases where the public's health, safety or welfare was at      risk.     Section 8. Criminal Penalties for Securities Fraud       This provision would create a new 10 year felony for      defrauding shareholders of publicly traded companies. The      provision would supplement the patchwork of existing      technical securities law violations with a more general and      less technical provision, comparable to the bank fraud and      health care fraud statutes. The provision would be more      accessible to investigators and prosecutors and would provide      needed enforcement flexibility and, in the context of      publicly traded companies, protection against all the types      schemes and frauds which inventive criminals may devise in      the future.                                       ____         Vermont Department of Banking, Insurance, Securities and            Health Care Administration,                                    Montpelier, VT, March 8, 2002.     Senator Patrick Leahy,     Russell Senate Office Building,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: Your staff recently forwarded a copy of      a bill you intend to introduce entitled, ``Corporate and      Criminal Fraud Accountability Act of 2002''. I read your      proposed legislation with special interest, as I am a trustee      of the Vermont State Teachers' Retirement Board. That system      recently experienced some losses due to its investment in      Enron, as did the other state retirement systems.       I believe that your bill will have a significant and      positive effect on how we investigate and punish those      involved in cases of corporate and criminal fraud. The      provision of your bill making judgments arising from state      and federal securities law violations non-dischargeable under      the federal bankruptcy code is particularly welcome. This      improvement in the law would materially improve the ability      of defrauded investors to recoup their losses. I also support      your proposed expansion of the statute of limitations in      private securities fraud cases. This longer statute of      limitations will result in investors, including state      retirement funds, enjoying a more level playing field when      they are defrauded by complex schemes that they could not      reasonably be expected to discover within the current three      year period.       I also support the provisions in the bill to clarify the      criminal laws concerning the destruction or fabrication of      evidence and the enhancement of criminal sentences in cases      of fraud and destruction of evidence. As the agency charged      with examining financial institutions, the integrity of      records is essential to our ability to do our jobs. Clear      federal laws and increased criminal penalties will provide      powerful deterrents to evidence destruction and securities      fraud. I also support the expansion of civil RICO to allow      state attorney generals and the SEC to bring civil RICO      suits.       Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance on      this legislation.           Sincerely,                                                 Elizabeth Costle,     Commissioner.                                  ____                                National Whistleblower Center,                                   Washington, DC, March 11, 2002.     Senator Patrick Leahy,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy: Since 1988 the National Whistleblower      Center has aided or defended hundreds of employees who have      disclosed fraud and criminal activities within the public and      private sectors. During this time we have become painfully      aware of the major loopholes which often leave courageous      employees without any legal protection. One of the most      notorious loopholes exists under the securities laws, in      which employees who report fraud upon stockholders have no      protection under federal law. It is truly tragic that      employees who are wrongfully discharged merely for reporting      violations of law, which may threaten the integrity of      pension funds or education-based savings accounts, have no      federal protection. This point was made perfectly clear by      the recently released internal memorandum from attorneys for      Enron. According to Enron's own counsel, employees who raised      concerns over that company's accounting practices had no      protection under federal law and could be fired.       With this background in mind, the National Whistleblower      Center strongly commends you for introducing the Corporate      and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act of 2002. This law would      protect employees who disclose Enron-related fraud to the      appropriate authorities. It is modeled on the airline safety      whistleblower law, which overwhelmingly passed Congress with      strong bi-partisan support. The next time a company like      Enron seeks advice from counsel as to whether they can fire      an employee, like Sharon Watkins, who merely discloses      potential fraud on shareholders, the answer must be a      resounding ``no.'' That can only happen if the Corporate and      Criminal Fraud Accountability Act is enacted into law.           Respectfully submitted,     Stephen M. Kohn,       Chairman of the Board of Directors.     Kris Kolesnik,       Executive Director.                                  ____         Government Accountability Project and Taxpayers Against            Fraud,                                   Washington, DC, March 11, 2002.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chair, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: Thank you for your leadership in      introducing the Corporate Fraud and Criminal Accountability      Act of 2002. This is a landmark proposal, for which we offer      our complete support. The bill promises to make whistleblower      protection the rule rather than the exception for those      challenging betrayals of corporate fiduciry duty enforced by      the Securities and Exchange Commission. It would be the      single most effective measure possible to prevent recurrences      of the Enron debacle and similar threats to the nation's      financial markets, shareholders and pension holders. It also      would be a breakthrough in implementing recommendations      pending since 1985 by the Administrative Conference of the      United States for a consistent, coherent system of corporate      whistleblower protection.       The Government Accountability Project (GAP) is a nonprofit,      nonpartisan public interest law firm dedicated since 1976 to      helping whistleblowers, those employees who exercise freedom      of speech to bear witness against betrayals of public trust      that they discover on the job. GAP has led the campaign for      passage of nearly all federal whistleblower laws over the      last two decades, as well as a model law approved by the      Organization of American States to implement its Inter-     American Convention Against Corruption. Two decades of      lessons learned are summarized in GAP's book The      Whistleblower's Survival Guide: Courage Without Martyrdom.      Taxpayers Against Fraud, The False Claims Act Legal Center      (TAF) is a nonprofit, nonpartisan public interest      organization dedicated to combating fraud against the Federal      Government through the promotion and use of the federal False      Claims Act and its qui tam whistleblower provisions. TAF      supports effective anti-fraud legislation at the federal and      state level and, as part of its educational outreach,      publishes the False Claims Act and Qui Tam Quarterly Review.       This bill is outstanding good goverenment legislation. It      uses the best combination of provisions that have proven      effective in other contexts. It has the modern burdens of      proof in the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, and offers      choices of forum that virtually guarantee whistleblowers will      have a fair day in court. Most significant, it closes the      loopholes that have meant whistleblowers proceed at their own      risk when warning Congress, shareholders or even their own      management or Board Audit Committees of financial misconduct      threatening the health both of their own company and, in some      cases, the nation's economy. You have our unqualified pledge      of helping to finish the public service you started by      introducing this legislation.           Sincerely,     Jim Moorman,       Executive Director, TAF.     Tom Devine,       Legal Director, GAP.                                  ____         North American Securities Administrators Association,            Inc.,                                    Washington, DC, March 5, 2002.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The North American Securities      Administrators Association, Inc., (NASAA), organized in 1919,      is the oldest international organization devoted to investor      protection. Its membership consists of the securities      administrators in the 50 states, the District of Columbia,      Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico. NASAA is the voice of      securities agencies responsible for grass-roots investor      protection and efficient capital formation.       NASAA members collectively bring thousands of enforcement      actions against violators of securities laws in an effort to      protect investors from fraud and abuse in connection with the      offer and sale of securities.       We have reviewed a draft of the Corporate and Criminal      Fraud and Accountability Act of 2002, and we support it. Our      focus is on the section that would prevent the discharge of      certain debts in bankruptcy proceedings. At the present time,      the bankruptcy code enables defendants who are guilty of      fraud and other securities violations to thwart enforcement      of the judgments and other awards that are issued in these      cases.       We support Section 4, as drafted, because it strengthens      the ability of regulators and individual investors to prevent      the discharge of certain debts and hold defendants      financially responsible for violations of securities laws.      This issue is of great interest to state securities      regulators, and we commend you for addressing it in the      proposed legislation.       NASAA and its members are prepared to work with you as the      legislative process continues. We support your effort to      enhance the ability of state and federal regulators to help      defrauded investors recoup their losses and to hold      accountable those who perpetuate securities fraud.           Sincerely,                                               Joseph P. Borg,                                      NASAA President, Director of     Alabama Securities Commission.                                  ____     From: Jordan, Carl.     Sent: Friday, August 24, 2001 7:02 PM.     To: Butcher, Sharon (Enron).     Subject: Confidential Employee Matter.                Attorney Client Privileged Communication       Sharon: Per your request, the following are some bullet      thoughts on how to manage the situation with the employee who      made the sensitive report.       1. I agree that it is a positive that she has requested      reassignment to another department. Assuming a suitable      position can be found, I recommend documenting in memo form      that the transfer is being effected per her request. This      would be worded to convey that the company has considered and      decided to accommodate her request for reassignment. See      comments below re additional items to be addressed in the      memo.       2. I suggest that the memo also name a designated company      officer for her to contact in the unlikely future event that      she believes she is being retaliated against for having made      the report. Case law suggests that she then will have the      burden of reporting     any perceived retaliation and allowing the company a      reasonable opportunity to correct it before quitting and      asserting a constructive discharge. (Note: If there is any      chance that the decision might be made in the future to      discharge the employee for making the report--e.g., if the      company concludes that the allegations were not made in good      faith--then this assurance probably should not be given, at      least until later when (if) the company is satisfied that the      employee was not acting in bad faith or otherwise      improperly.)       3. The memo should contain language that conveys that the      other terms of her employment--specifically, its at-will      status--remains unchanged. This is to avoid any future claim      that the understandings surrounding the transfer constitute a      contractual obligation of some sort.       4. The new position, as we discussed, should have      responsibilities and compensation comparable to her current      one, to avoid any claim of constructive discharge.       5. As we discussed, to the extent practicable, the fact      that she made the report should be treated as confidential.       6. The individual or individuals who are implicated by her      allegations should be advised to treat the matter      confidentially and to use discretion regarding any comments      to or about the complaining employee. They should be advised      that she is not to be treated adversely in any way for having      expressed her concerns.       7. You indicated that the officer in charge of the area to      which the employee may be reassigned would probably need to      be advised of the circumstances. I suggest he be advised at      the same time that it is important that she not be treated      adversely or differently because she made the report. And      that the circumstances of the transfer are confidential and      should not be shared with others.       You also asked that I include in this communication a      summary of the possible risks associated with discharging (or      constructively discharging) employees who report allegations      of improper accounting practices:       1. Texas law does not currently protect corporate      whistleblowers. The supreme court has twice declined to      create a cause of action for whistleblowers who are      discharged; however, there were special factors present in      both cases that weighed against the plaintiffs and the court      implied that it might reach a different conclusion under      other circumstances.       2. Regardless of the whistleblower issue, there is often a      risk of a Sabine Pilot claim (i.e., allegation of discharge      for refusing to participate in an illegal act). Whistleblower      cases in Texas commonly are pled or repled as Sabine Pilot      claims--it is often an easy leap for the plaintiff to make if      she had any involvement in or duties relating to the alleged      improper conduct. For example, some cases say that if an      employee's duties involve recording accounting data that she      knows to be misleading onto records that are eventually      relied on by others in preparing reports to be submitted to a      federal agency (e.g., SEC, IRS, etc.), then the employee can      be subject to criminal prosecution even tho she did not      originated the misleading data and does not prepare the      actual document submitted to the government. Under such      circumstances, if the employee alleges that she was      discharged for refusing to record (or continuing the practice      of recording) the allegedly misleading data, then she has      stated a claim under the Sabine Pilot doctrine.       3. As we discussed, there are a myriad of problems      associated with Sabine Pilot claims, regardless of their      merits, that involve allegations of illegal accounting or      related practices. One is that the company's accounting      practices and books and records are fair game during      discovery--the opposition typically will request production      of volumes of sensitive material. Another problem is that      because accounting practices often involve judgments in gray      areas, rather than non-judgmental applications of black-     letter rules, there are often genuine disputes over whether a      company's practice or a specific report was materially      misleading or complied with some statutory or regulatory      requirements. Third, these are typically jury cases--that      means they are decided by lay persons when the legal      compliance issues are often confusing even to the lawyers and      experts. Fourth, because of the above factors, they are very      expensive and time consuming to litigate.       4. In addition to the risk of a wrongful discharge claim,      there is the risk that the discharged employee will seek to      convince some government oversight agency (e.g., IRS, SEC,      etc.) that the corporation has engaged in materially      misleading reporting or is otherwise non-compliant. As with      wrongful discharge claims, this can create problems even tho      the allegations have no merit whatsoever.       These are, of course, very general comments. I will be      happy to discuss them in greater detail at your convenience.                          ____________________
