That should make us slow up and look at these things.  I wonder what would have happened if, say, during all those times, 10 percent of those amendments had gone through. That would be 1,100 amendments. If 1 percent went through, there would be over 100 amendments. What a different country this would be with much less democracy, if we would be a democracy at all.  The first amendment in our little pocketbooks of the Constitution is only four or five lines. The first amendment really protects the diversity of this country to make sure we remain a democracy, that we have the right to practice any religion we want, or none if we want--both thoughts are protected--that we can say what we want, that we can assemble and petition our Government. All of that is protected. Yet we have something that, when we print out this proposed amendment, goes on for something like 60 lines.  I am a lawyer. I loved doing appellate work. The distinguished Presiding Officer is a distinguished former attorney general. I am sure he would love to do appellate work. I can tell you right now, this is a lawyer's dream. We might as well quadruple the number of courts, the number of judges. They would not keep up with the appeals that would come just from this one amendment alone.  It is hard for me to emphasize enough, and I hate to hold up the Senator from New York on this, but there is nobody else here to express my frustration to.
