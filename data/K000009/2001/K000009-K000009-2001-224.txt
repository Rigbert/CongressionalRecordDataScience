Speaker, I rise to recognize a significant milestone for a community in my district. Pemberville, Ohio celebrates its 125th anniversary this year. The town recently celebrated the 125th anniversary of its incorporation, which took place on June 8, 1876.  The fertile farmland region in Wood County, Ohio was home to pioneering settlers for three generations prior to the establishment of Pemberville--first known as the forks because it was near a fork in the river--in 1854. Well before Pemberville became a town, William Henry Harrison made his camp at the site--which was strategically situated on the Portage River--during the War of 1812. Later, many families found it desirable and by the time it was incorporated in 1876, the town grew from a crossroads for fur traders and a few adventurous farmers into a viable community. Upon incorporation, it became known as Pemberville, named for one of its founders, James Pember.  The town further prospered when railroad lines were completed in 1875 and oil was discovered in 1881. In fact, only a year after being formally incorporated, Pemberville boasted a population of 500. Those earliest citizens were united in their effort to establish Pemberville as a regional hub, and its prime location on the river, along with the development of both roads and rail, helped the growth.  Pemberville became home to many churches and businesses and provided a well-developed school system. Today it remains a vibrant community, rich in tradition, with a small-town, folksy feel. It is a community looking forward while proud of its past. It moves forward through the seasons, adjusting to fit the times, but never losing the essence of the best of small town America: neighborliness, friendliness, and a timeless quality.  Oliver Wendell Holmes said ``Where we love is home, home that our feet may leave, but not our hearts.'' Pemberville is a town that illustrates this sentiment: Though many of its sons and daughters have traveled far afield, often settling elsewhere, still that inexorable feeling of community and home brings them back time and again, whether it is in fact or in mind. I know that they, along with the citizens who assembled at this year's sesquicentennial, are proud of Pemberville and proud of its journey through the past to the present. I am pleased to join those who gather at this 125th anniversary celebration to celebrate that past even as we see a vision of Pemberville's future.                          ____________________
