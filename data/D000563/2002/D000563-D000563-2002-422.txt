 In your bill, as currently written, it says if people have overvoted and spoiled their ballots, we will notify them in jurisdictions that don't have paper ballots, that don't have punchcards and in States such as Washington and Oregon where there are mail-in ballots. I say to my friend from Kentucky, you are, in this bill, already establishing a standard of care for every voting system but three. Why do you make an exception for a punchcard system where one out of three Americans vote with that system, a system we saw in Florida that was rife with problems, where people voted with the best of intentions, and where we lost 120,000 voters in Cook County, IL? Why would you say, if you happen to have an optical scanning system, you have to notify voters if they spoiled their ballots? If you have a lever machine, you have to notify people. If you have an electronic device, you must notify people. But when it comes to the punchcard system, the oldest one, the one fraught with more problems than any others, you have carved out an exception. Why do you make that distinction?  Mr. McCONNELL. More Americans voted on punchcards than any other way in 2000. So if we want to start mandating certain kinds of punchcard voting systems, we are going to have to pay if you want to have funded mandates and not unfunded mandates; we are going to have to pay, in effect, to replace, apparently--most places except Illinois--all of these punchcard machines. I suspect that is a simple answer to the question of the Senator from Illinois.
