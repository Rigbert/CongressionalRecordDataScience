President, I would like to recognize the exceptional generosity and work of Park B. Smith and his wife, Linda Johnson Smith.  Park and I met through our mutual involvement in The Marine Corps--Law Enforcement Foundation, an organization that believes in and supports the potential of our youth. They provide scholarship bonds for children of active-duty Marines and Federal law enforcement personnel killed in the line of duty. Park has become a good friend and someone whom I admire.  Park, an alumnus of the College of the Holy Cross, and Linda have a strong belief in the value of education and have exemplified this dedication. Through their generosity, the College of the Holy Cross has been able to continue to grow and build its community. It is for this reason that I would like to ask unanimous consent to have an article about Park and Linda Smith from The Wall Street Journal printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         [From the Wall Street Journal, Friday, Sept. 15, 2006]               Giving Back--Donor To Turn Wine Into Bread                            (By Kelly Crow)       Park B. Smith has written his share of million-dollar      checks to benefit his alma mater. Now, he has decided to      donate by turning over part of his prized wine collection to      a major auctioneer.       On Nov. 18, Sotheby's in New York will auction the      equivalent of 14,000 bottles from Mr. Smith's private      collection--including 50 cases of coveted 1982 Mouton      Rothschild--in a sale estimated to bring in up to $4.8      million. His proceeds will go to build new athletic      facilities at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester,      Mass. He's also planning a $25,000-a-plate dinner at his New      York restaurant, Veritas, to benefit Holy Cross.       The Sotheby's auction represents a rare mix of beneficence      and big auctioneer. In a more typical charity wine auction,      nonprofits enlist local auctioneers to sell bottles donated      by wineries or collectors. This season brings a range of such      events: In Chicago, Hart Davis Hart Wine Co. is holding a      Sept. 28 auction at Tru restaurant ($1,500 a plate) to help      children with spina bifida. In Harrisburg, Pa., 600 people      will bid to benefit the Whitaker Center for Science and the      Arts. In California, Napa Valley winemaker John Schwartz, of      Amuse Bouche, says he gets 25 letters a week from charities      requesting wine. Mr. Schwartz is organizing his own Oct. 27      wine auction, in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, to benefit a Cambodian      orphanage.       Mr. Smith, known in the home-furnishings industry for his      namesake line of draperies and bedspreads, says he hopes to      capitalize on the marketing muscle of Sotheby's to reach top      connoisseurs. He also moved the auction date up a year to      take advantage of the strong wine and art market. Mr. Smith      is betting a high-profile sale will bring high prices, but by      going with a big auctioneer he is also subject to its      seller's commission rates (20 percent is standard, though      Sotheby's says it will charge less because it's for a good      cause). And he'll have to pay higher capital-gains taxes, as      much as 28 percent, because the wine will be sold rather than      given outright.       Mr. Smith started drinking wine while serving in the      Marines (an early favorite was 89-cent bottles of Beaujolais)      and has since gained a reputation for collecting top wines.      One reason he isn't donating cash: His 65,000-bottle      Connecticut cellar is at capacity. ``I'm raising money for      Holy Cross but I'm also making more room,'' he says.       Mr. Smith, a 1954 graduate and trustee of the Jesuit      liberal-arts college, has given the school $20 million over      the years. Now he wants to fix its ``disgraceful'' field      house. Father Michael McFarland, college president, says he's      awed by Mr. Smith's generosity--and relieved he can accept      auction proceeds rather than thousands of bottles: ``We don't      even have a wine cellar--just a couple cases stuffed under a      sink.''                          ____________________
