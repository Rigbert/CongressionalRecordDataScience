Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.  The Chairman, I appreciate that the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations and the chairman of the subcommittee voted for the Gilchrest amendment. That, I think, made sense, and made this appropriation subject to a prospectus. But it is clear that the level of hostility directed at the Food and Drug Administration is very high. There is a high level of hostility, suspicion and lack of trust in the FDA.  But, Mr. Chairman, this amendment will not save money. If you at some point in time strike all the FDA, then obviously we will not proceed on this. But the fact of the matter is, this is a savings amendment. This money is in here for the food component essentially, not the drug component, which is the most controversial, but this is for the food component of FDA. Located in proximity to the BARC, the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center; the synergy of those scientists has been put together. It makes sense. But I understand we are not talking about that. The gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Livingston] and the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Lightfoot] were voting for that, but it is clear we are not doing that. I would urge the rejection of the Duncan amendment.
