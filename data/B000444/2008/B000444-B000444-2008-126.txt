Res. 534       Whereas drug courts provide focus and leadership for      community-wide partnerships, bringing together public safety      and public health professionals in the fight against drug      abuse and criminality;       Whereas 60 percent to 80 percent of drug offenders      sentenced to prison and over 40 percent sentenced to      probation recidivate, and whereas fewer than 17 percent of      drug court graduates recidivate;       Whereas the results of more than 100 program evaluations      and at least 3 experimental studies have yielded evidence      that drug courts greatly improve substance abuse treatment      outcomes, substantially reduce crime, and produce significant      societal benefits;       Whereas drug courts transform over 120,000 addicts each      year in the adult, juvenile, and family court systems into      drug-free, productive citizens;       Whereas judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, substance      abuse treatment and rehabilitation professionals, law      enforcement and community supervision personnel, researchers      and educators, national and community leaders, and others      dedicated to drug courts and similar types of treatment      programs are healing families and communities across the      country; and       Whereas the drug court movement has grown from the 12      original drug courts in 1994 to over 2,000 operational drug      courts as of December 2007: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) designates the month of May 2008 as ``National Drug      Court Month'';       (2) encourages the people of the United States and      interested groups to observe the month with appropriate      ceremonies and activities;       (3) encourages leaders across the United States to increase      the use of drug courts by instituting sustainable drug courts      and other treatment-based alternatives to prison in all 3,143      counties in the United States, which serve the vast majority      of the highest-need citizens in the justice system; and       (4) supports the goal of robustly funding the Drug Court      Discretionary Grant Program and other treatment-based      alternatives to prison in order to expand these critical      criminal justice programs.
