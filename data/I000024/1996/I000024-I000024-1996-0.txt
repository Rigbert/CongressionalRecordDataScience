President, if I can address one other subject very briefly since we are coming to the end of this session. I noticed an article in the current Reader's Digest. I happen to be one who has such respect for the Reader's Digest.  I was involved with a story 2 years ago with them. It took them 9 months to write the story. Everything is authenticated and documented in a way I don't know any other publication would equal. They were talking about ballistic missiles that increasingly will be used by hostile states and is a real serious problem.  We have stood on the floor of this Senate over and over and over again to try to address this problem, to make the people of America aware that we are probably in a more threatened position today than we have been in this country's history. They point out some things I had not thought about, putting it in proper context.  They said there are five reasons why the Nation must take steps to defend itself:  First, the ballistic missiles are proliferating. More than 20 nations are in the ballistic missile club, as they call it. Others are knocking on the door. This is something we have been saying over and over again. In fact, it has been 2 years since the former CIA Director, the first one under President Clinton, said that we know of somewhere between 25 and 30 nations that currently either have developed, or are in the final stages of developing, weapons of mass destruction, either biological, chemical, or nuclear.  This former CIA Director identifies five nations--Libya, Iraq, Iran, Syria, and North Korea--whose aggressive programs to arm missiles with nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons could threaten the United States.  The second thing they talk about is that missile range and accuracy are increasing rapidly. I suggest, Mr. President, that the reason for this is partly our fault because of what we have done in satellite technology.  I had occasion to become the first Member of Congress to fly a small airplane around the world a couple of years ago. I used that satellite technology. I never lost the satellite all the way around the world. Because of that, there is no way of guarding against other uses, and that means, through our global positioning system, other nations have incredible accuracy, and this is something that has to be taken into consideration.  The third point is warheads of mass destruction are within reach of many new missile powers.  We were shocked when we found out and discovered at the end of the gulf war that Saddam Hussein had a huge biochemical arsenal. Hundreds of tons were destroyed by the U.N. observers. We have no way of knowing where else in the world this could be happening.  The fourth point is, defense against ballistic missile attack is a practical reality. It is for political, not technological, reasons that the U.S. Government has chosen not to build a missile defense. I think that is very significant.  We not long ago debated the START II Treaty and we did, in fact, approve that from this body. I think I was the first one, the only one, who voted against it until later in the vote when three others joined. My argument was we were going back to accepting the confinements and restrictions that were imposed upon us in the 1972 ABM Treaty, which at that time didn't make sense to me, but it made more sense than it does today, because that was a bilateral treaty with a country that no longer exists, which says, ``If you don't defend yourself, we will agree not to defend ourselves,'' therefore, that is a policy that offers some security.  I never really believed it did. However, it is now pointed out by more and more people that that policy was flawed initially and certainly is not one that today makes any sense. In fact, it was Dr. Henry Kissinger, who was the architect of the ABM Treaty in 1972, who said, ``It is nuts to make a virtue out of your vulnerability.''  So that is our posture today, where we are. The last thing they said is the longer we wait, the less time we may have.  We had an NIA estimate not too long ago, a national intelligence estimate, that many of us felt was flawed in many ways. I think it told the President what the President wanted to hear. It came to the conclusion that there is no threat out there for the next 15 years. I think there are many problems with this. First of all, they talk about the continental United States. I agreed with James Woolsey the other day when he said the last time he checked, Hawaii and Alaska were part of the United States.  The article also points out that it fails to mention that both Russia and China have ICBM's right now that have the capability of reaching the United States, along with the weapons of mass destruction.  I remember President Clinton saying in the House Chamber during his State of the Union Message that there is not a single Russian missile pointed at America's children. The head of the Russian strategic missile forces told CBS news on ``60 Minutes'' that his ICBM's could be retargeted in a matter of minutes. I think it is a great disservice to the American people for the President to try to imply that the threat is not out there.  Mr. President, many of the people in the intelligence community throughout the world have said that the United States of America is facing a greater threat today than we have faced since the Revolutionary War. I am deeply distressed that the President has been able to convince many of the American people that the threat is not out there, and I intend, certainly during this recess, to do all I can to be, if nothingmore than a one-man truth squad, to get the American people to understand the real threat that is facing us today.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the missile defense article entitled ``Defenseless Against Missile Terror'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From Reader's Digest, October, 1996]                   Defenseless Against Missile Terror                       (By Ralph Kinney Bennett)       ``Ballistic missiles can and increasingly will be used by      hostile states for blackmail, terror and to drive wedges      between us and our allies.''       This warning, delivered to Congress last spring by R. James      Woolsey, former director of the Central Intelligence Agency,      had a particular immediacy. Just weeks earlier, China had      threatened Taiwan by test-firing missiles off Taiwan's      shores. In a not-so-veiled warning against interference,      China reminded a former U.S. diplomat that Los Angeles was      within reach of its nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic      missiles (ICBMs).       Ballistic missiles are becoming a dangerous factor in      international relations, but the United States has yet to      deal fully with the threat. Here are five reasons why the      nation must take steps to defend itself:       1. Ballistic missiles are proliferating. More than 20      nations are in the ballistic missile ``club.'' Others are      knocking on the door. Although the United States stopped      exporting ballistic missiles over two decades ago, Russia,      China and North Korea eagerly peddle their rockets--often in      the guise of aiding ``space programs.''       Pakistan, which has been developing its own ballistic      missile, the Hatf, has reportedly acquired 30 nuclear-     capable, medium-range M-11 missiles from the Chinese to      counter India's growing missile force. Saudi Arabia owns      Chinese CSS-2 missiles. Iran has added Chinese CSS-8s, a      front-line ballistic missile, to its considerable arsenal of      Soviet-made Scuds. There has even been a report that Peru,      smarting from past reverses at the hands of its neighbors,      entered into negotiations with North Korea last year to      obtain ballistic missiles.       The CIA identifies five ``rogue nations''--Libya, Iraq,      Iran, Syria and North Korea--whose ``aggressive'' programs to      arm missiles with nuclear, chemical or biological weapons      could threaten the United States.       There are indications that Libya is seeking to buy      ballistic missiles from North Korea . Iraq, whose Scud      rockets rained down on Israel and Saudi Arabia in the Gulf      War, is rapidly rebuilding production facilities to turn out      an upgraded Scud called the El-Hussein.       In North Korea, scarce financial resources are being      lavished on long-range Taepo Dong missiles. Intelligence      sources in South Korea report that within five years, these      rockets may be able to reach all of the western, and much of      the central, United States.       2. Missile range and accuracy are rapidly increasing. By      strapping on booster engines, countries can turn shorter-     range missiles into multi-stage rockets--vastly increasing      attack distance.       In December 1989 intelligence officials were astounded when      Iraqi missile scientists successfully tested a powerful      rocket bolted together from five Soviet Scud engines. Iraq's      ballistic-missile research and development facility at Mosul      was destroyed during the Gulf War, but it has been rebuilt      and expanded. North Korea and China are also creating      ``hybrid'' long-range missiles from rocket components.      Moreover, experts add, China is going all-out to make its      CSS-4 ICBM capable of carrying multiple nuclear warheads.       One problem for missile neophytes--accuracy--may have been      inadvertently solved by the United States. Our Global      Positioning System (GPS) uses an orbiting satellite network      to provide an exact location fix on earth. Originally a U.S.      defense program, GPS is now routinely available to anyone--     including foreign governments.       Former CIA Director Woolsey explains that within a few      years, GPS could give ballistic missiles such pinpoint      accuracy that even with nonnuclear warheads, they would have      immense destructive power. GPS could make it feasible,      Woolsey warns, ``for Saddam Hussein to threaten to destroy      the Knesset (the Israeli parliament) or for Chinese rulers to      cause a Chernobyl-like disaster at a Taiwanese nuclear-power      plant.''       3. Warheads of mass destruction are within reach of many      new missile powers. The Grail for those building mass-     destruction weapons is a ``deliverable'' nuclear warhead, one      that is small enough and sturdy enough to be launched by a      missile. Designing one requires technical sophistication and      immensely complex calculations, which is why high-speed      supercomputers are vital to advanced weapon designs.       Thus, national-security experts were dismayed when the      Clinton Administration relaxed supercomputer export      guidelines. Since then, U.S. computers capable of bomb design      have gone to China and Russia. U.S. officials claim they will      keep close track to ensure the technology is used only for      civilian purposes. But as Stephen Bryen, a former Pentagon      official and an expert on strategic technology transfer,      notes, ``It is absurd to believe that in a country bent on      developing high-tech weapons, supercomputers will not end up      being used by the military.''       Meanwhile, countries such as Iran, Iraq, Libya and North      Korea have not ignored the path to a big bang on the cheap:      chemical and biological weapons. Pound for pound, poison gas      and such deadly germs as anthrax can have the same mass-     killing power as a nuclear bomb.       A chilling discovery at the end of the Gulf War was Saddam      Hussein's huge biochemical arsenal; hundreds of tons were      destroyed by U.N. observers. During the war, according to      Gen. Hussein Kamil Hasan, Saddam's son-in-law, Iraq got as      far as filling warheads with deadly germs such as the cancer-     causing aflatoxin.       4. Defense against ballistic-missile attack is a practical      reality. It's for political, not technological, reasons that      the U.S. government has chosen not to build a missile      defense. One of the first anti-missile weapons, the Nike-X,      was ready by the early 1960s. But, partly as a gesture of      good intentions toward the Soviets, then-Defense Secretary      Robert McNamara refused to deploy it.       This restraint culminated in the U.S.-Soviet Anti-Ballistic      Missile (ABM) Treaty of 1972, which limited both countries'      defense systems. Although the Kremlin repeatedly violated the      treaty by enlarging its ABM system to protect greater      portions of the Soviet Union, by 1976 the United States had      closed its sole missile-defense facility in North Dakota.       Only when President Ronald Reagan revived interest in an      effective defense against ballistic missiles did funding pick      up, and the United States went on to make astounding leaps in      technology. The Reagan effort pointed to what is acknowledged      to be the most elegant and effective technique for killing      ICBMs--space-based sensing satellites and interceptor weapons      (either lasers or rockets) that find and destroy missiles at      their most vulnerable stage: shortly after launch. The space-     based system would be augmented by ground-based, hyerfast      anti-missile interceptors to ``clean up'' any remaining      missiles or warheads.       In 1993 a panel of scientists assembled by the American      Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) reviewed a      ballistic-missile defense system. The AIAA found ``no      technical barriers to the development and deployment'' of a      workable missile defense.       5. The longer we wait, the less time we may have. In      November 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order      12938, declaring missile proliferation to be a ``national      emergency.'' However, every Congressional effort to build a      defense against attack has been vetoed by the President or      thrown into a limbo of ``further research.''       A secret National Intelligence Estimate, prepared for the      President last November declared flatly: ``No country, other      than the major declared nuclear powers, will develop or      otherwise acquire a ballistic missile in the next 15 years      that could threaten the contiguous 48 states and Canada.''       Intelligence experts immediately pointed out the report's      flaws. It virtually ignored Alaska and Hawaii (``They're part      of the United States last time I heard, '' says Woolsey);      also, it brushed aside existing Russian and Chinese ICBMs and      the threat of instability in, or accidental launches from,      those countries. At least one freak launch of an armed Soviet      missile during routine maintenance has been reported.       President Clinton has said ``there is not a single Russian      missile pointed at America's children.'' We have no way of      verifying this--nor would it mean much, if true. Gen. Igor      Sergeyev, head of Russia's strategic missile forces, told CBS      News's ``60 Minutes'' that his ICBMs could be retargeted in      ``a matter of minutes.'' Indeed, another Russian general told      Tass news agency last June that a multiple warhead test just      conducted was the 25th launch in the past four years.       The Clinton Administration's missile-defense policy rests      on two slim pillars. One is the U.S. intelligence program--     which, says the report to the President, will spot missile      programs ``many years before deployment.'' But Los Alamos      National Laboratory physicist and missile expert Gregory      Canavan points out that intelligence analysts were completely      surprised by Iraq's big 1989 missile test. Analysts also      thought Iraq was five years away from building a nuclear      weapon; documents and equipment uncovered after the Gulf War      showed Iraq was about two years away.       The other pillar of the Clinton defense is the ABM treaty.      However, this agreement--negotiated with a national entity      that no longer exists--does not reflect the spread of      ballistic missiles to dozens of nations around the globe. By      bending over backward to comply with the treaty, the United      States has purposely blunted what small air defense it has.      This may already have cost American lives.       On the night of February 25, 1991, in the midst of the Gulf      War, a Scud missile was fired from Iraq. The launch was      picked up by American surveillance satellites, which computed      the missile's speed and direction. The pooled information      revealed the target area--Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, where      American forces were stationed.       This vital information was transmitted almost instantly      back to earth--but not to Dhahran's two batteries of Patriot      missiles, upgraded anti-aircraft weapons intended to provide      battle-zone missile defense. Because of concerns about ABM      treaty compliance, the data went to the U.S. Space Command      headquarters near Colorado Springs, Colo.     There, analysts were supposed to evaluate the information and      send it on to Saudi Arabia--a time-consuming process in the      short life of a launched missile.       On that night, analysts were so unsure of the data that      they didn't even phone a warning to the Patriot batteries.      There was no attempt to intercept the missile, which hit a      temporary barracks, killing 28 GIs.       Surveys show that the public believes the United States can      ``shoot down'' incoming missiles. But if an ICBM were fired      at the United States today, here is what would happen:       A vast network of reconnaissance satellites would detect      the launch, compute its speed and predict its trajectory and      approximate area of impact. Ground-based radars would track      it. Then . . .       Nothing.       Untold numbers of Americans might die from a nuclear,      chemical or biological strike.       Surely, no treaty, no faith in our ability to see over the      political and technological horizon, should be allowed to      stand in the way of a missile defense that would prevent this      horrible outcome.
