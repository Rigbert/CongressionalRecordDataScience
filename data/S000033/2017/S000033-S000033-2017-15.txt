  One, yesterday, I challenged my Republican colleagues, after this bill is passed, to tell us and tell the American people that when they rack up a deficit of $1.4 trillion, they are not going tocome back and cut Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, education, nutrition.  Tell the American people that you are not going to balance the budget and compensate for your huge tax breaks to the rich and large corporations by going after the middle class and working class of this country.  I challenged my Republican colleagues yesterday to come to the floor and tell the American people that they would not do that.
