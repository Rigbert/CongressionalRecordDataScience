President, I would like to announce for the information of the Senate and the public that a hearing has been scheduled before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. The hearing will be held on Tuesday, July 16, 2013, at 10 a.m., in room SD-366 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building.  The purpose of this oversight hearing is to explore how U.S. gasoline and fuel prices are being affected by the current boom in domestic oil production and the restructuring of the U.S. refining industry and distribution system.  Because of the limited time available for the hearing, witnesses may testify by invitation only. However, those wishing to submit written testimony for the hearing record may do so by sending it to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, United States Senate, Washington, D.C. 20510-6150, or by e-mail to Lauren_G[email protected]energy.senate.gov.  For further information, please contact Dave Berick at (202) 224-2209 or Lauren Goldschmidt at (202) 224-5488.                    SUBCOMMITTEE ON WATER AND POWER
