Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to announce that Lodge 2365 of the Polish National Alliance of the United States, also known as the Silver Bell Club, held its 25th Annual Hank Stram/Tony Zale Sports Award Banquet yesterday, May 18, 1998, at the Radisson Hotel at Star Plaza in Merrillville, Indiana. Eighteen Northwest Indiana high school students of Polish and Slavic descent received the prestigious Hank Stram/Tony Zale Award plaque at last night's banquet. These outstanding students were chosen to receive the award by their respective schools on the basis of academic and athletic achievement. All proceeds from the banquet will go toward a scholarship fund which will be awarded to deserving students next year.  This year's Hank Stram/Tony Zale Award recipients include: Andrew Bien of Boone Grove High School; Jeff Bozovich of Chesterton High School; Andrew Byrom of Merrillville High School; Luke DeBold of Andrean High School; Tania Fliter of Griffith High School; Stephen Hnatiuk of Hobart High School; Cheryl Jakubczyk of Hammond High School; Richard Jaryszak of Lowell High School; Dan Kaminski of Portage High School; Steve Kaminski of Portage High School; Annie Knish of Munster High School; Ben Lyon of Highland High School; Justin Marcinkewicz of Bishop Noll Institute; Kelly O'Brien of Crown Point High School; Dan Perryman of Lake Station Edison High School; Eileen Stahura of Whiting High School; Becky Turek of Valparaiso High School; and Melissa Wychocki of Lake Central High School.  Hank Stram, one of the most successful coaches in professional football history, was present at yesterday's event. Hank was raised in Gary, Indiana, and he graduated from Lew Wallace High School where he played football, basketball, baseball, and ran track. While attending college at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Hank won four letters in baseball and three letters in football. During his senior year, he received the coveted Big Ten Medal, which is awarded to the conference athlete who best combines athletic and academic success. After college, Hank entered the NFL where he became best noted for coaching the Kansas City Chiefs to a Super Bowl victory in 1970.  The late Tony Zale was a champion boxer from Gary, Indiana. During his boxing career, Tony defeated the National Boxing Association champion in July of 1940, became a world titleholder when he defeated World Middleweight Champion, Georgie Abrams, in 1941, and successfully defended his title against famous boxer, Rocky Graziano, in 1945. When Tony retired from boxing in 1948, he left the profession with the distinction of fighting and beating every contender in the middleweight division during his championship reign from 1941 through 1948 and, in the 1950s, he was inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame. Tony Zale passed away in March of last year.  The distinguished speaker at last night's event was former NFL quarterback and head football coach, Sam Wyche. An NFL player and coach for 27 years, Sam was one of the original Cincinnati Bengals in 1968, and he was the quarterback on the Bengals first playoff team in 1970. Sam began his coaching career with Bill Walsh and the San Francisco 49ers. He coached quarterback Joe Montana from his rookie year through the 49ers first Super Bowl victory in 1981. Sam was then head coach of the Bengals in Super Bowl XXIII, which was against the 49ers. Sam has just completed his first year as one of the members of NBC's pre-game show, ``NFL on NBC''.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending the Silver Bell Club for hosting this celebration of success in sports and academics. The hard work of all those involved in planning this worthwhile event is indicative of their devotion to the very gifted young people in Indiana's First Congressional District.                          ____________________
