President, almost exactly a year ago in April, I was traveling outside the country and was able to get hold of a copy of the New York Times. In it was a list of the Pulitzer Prize winners. Under ``Music'' was listed Morton Gould, ``Stringmusic.''       Morton Gould, an 81-year-old composer who lives in Great      Neck, NY, won for a 30-minute work that was commissioned by      the National Symphony Orchestra and given its premier by that      ensemble, conducted by Mstislav Rostropovich, at the Kennedy      Center in Washington on March 10, 1994.  It then goes on and describes the music. That small piece could not describe what an unbelievable talent Morton Gould had. That is why I and so many others were saddened when he recently died suddenly at the age of 82. Even then, though working actively, he was about to address a group in Orlando and continued to be the prolific and talented musician he had been throughout his life.  I was able to meet him and get to know him over the years. In customary form, after I wrote him to congratulate him on the Pulitzer Prize, he wrote back a long, hand written note in which he joked about what he knew was a great honor and sort of minimized it, although one could tell how pleased he was. This is a man who was accustomed to honors but was not swayed by them, a man who knew he had the gratitude and the esteem of his peers, but did not revel in it, but rather worked with his peers constantly.  I find it a matter of great personal pride to have known him, as I said, for years, since the days my friend Ben Palumbo first introduced us up to the time of his death. Like so many Americans, we will continue to know him through his music. This is music that is truly timeless.  I ask unanimous consent a report sent out regarding his death be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               Ken Sunshine Consultants, Inc.,                                      New York, NY, Feb. 21, 1996.               Composer/Conductor Morton Gould Dies at 82       Former ASCAP President Morton Gould, one of the century's      most celebrated American composers and conductors, died      suddenly this morning in Orlando, FL at the age of 82. Gould      was visiting the Disney Institute in Orlando as an artist-in-     residence. Last evening, the Institute honored him with an      all-Gould program performed by the U.S. Military Academy      Band. Gould attended the concert and received a standing      ovation. According to the Institute, a second all-Gould      concert scheduled for this evening will go on as planned.       Gould received the Kennedy Center Honor in 1994 and the      Pulitzer Prize in Music in 1995. He was elected to the      American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1986. In addition,      Gould was an Award winning recording artist, with 12 Grammy      nominations and a Grammy award in 1966. Gould served on      ASCAP's Board of Directors for over 36 years, and led the      Society as President from 1986 to 1994.       Gould's contributions spanned eight decades and included      significant works for orchestra, chamber ensemble, band,      chorus and soloists, as well as scores composed for film,      television, Broadway and ballet. Throughout his career,      Gould's work was particularly ``American,'' making use of      such ``roots music'' styles as jazz, blues, spirituals and      folk music.       His music has been performed by every major American      orchestra under the direction of such eminent conductors as      Fritz Mahler, Arturo Toscanini, Leopold Stokowski, Sir Georg      Solti, Andre Previn, Leonard Slatkin, Eugene Ormandy and      Arthur Fiedler. As a conductor, Gould led countless      orchestras throughout the world and recorded over 100 albums.       Among his major compositions are Latin American      Symphonette, Derivations for Clarinet and Band (commissioned      by Benny Goodman), American Salute, Spirituals for Orchestra,      ``Boogie Woogie Etude'' and ``Pavane.'' His collaborations      with top choreographers include Clarinade and Audobon (George      Balanchine); Interplay and I'm Old-Fashioned (Jerome      Robbins); Halftime and Santa Fe Sage (Elliot Feld); and Fall      River Legend (Agnes DeMille). His film scores include      Delightfully Dangerous, Windjammer and Cinerama Holiday.      Notable Gould TV scores include Holocaust, F. Scott      Fitzgerald in Hollywood and CBS' World War I Documentary.      Gould composed two Broadway scores, Arms and the Girl, with      lyrics by Dorothy Fields, and Billion Dollar Baby, with      lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green. More recent works      include three major commissions celebrating the 1976      Bicentennial, Symphony of Spirituals, American Ballads and      Something To Do. In 1992, he was commissioned by the      Pittsburgh Symphony Association to compose The Jogger and the      Dinosaur, a concert piece for rapper and orchestra.       Morton Gould was born on December 10, 1913 in Richmond      Hill, New York. A child prodigy, he composed and published      his first work, ``Just Six,'' at the age of six. Growing up      during the worst years of the Great Depression, Gould's music      studies were curtailed by his need to help support his      family. He found work as a vaudeville pianist, backing the      famous ballroom dance team, Renee and Tony DeMarco, and was      part of a piano duo with Bert Shefter.       As a teenager, Gould was house pianist for the 1932 opening      of Radio City Music Hall. He was a pioneer of live radio      broadcasts as the star, host and conductor of long-running      national music programs on the Mutual and CBS Radio Networks.      His radio shows featured leading figures from the symphonic      and popular music worlds, including Frank Sinatra, Benny      Goodman, Lauritz Melchior and Duke Ellington. His Cresta      Blanca theme was among broadcasting's first major commercial      jingles.       Gould joined ASCAP in 1935 and was long active in many      ASCAP and ASCAP F0oundation programs. A tireless advocate for      new American composers, he was constantly seeking      opportunities to help expose     their work. He also served with distinction on the Board of      the American Symphony Orchestra League and on the National      Endowment for the Arts Music Panel.       Commenting on Gould's passing, ASCAP President and Chairman      Marilyn Bergman said: ``America has lost one of its most      distinguished composers and conductors, and the creative      community has lost one of its great leaders. No one I know      was more respected and loved here at ASCAP and throughout the      world for both his musicianship and his great humanity. His      vigor, his wit and his spirit led us to believe he would live      forever. And in fact, through his music and the legacy he      left us, he will.''       Gould, who resided in Great Neck, NY is survived by two      daughters, Deborah Gould of Brooklyn, and Abby Burton of      Plainview; two sons, Eric of Great Neck and David of Port      Washington; and eight grandchildren.       Funeral services will be private. A memorial is being      planned by ASCAP; the date will be announced shortly.
