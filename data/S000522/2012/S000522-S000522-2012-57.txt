Mr. Speaker, at the request of the colleagues and friends of Kevin Frechette of Howell, New Jersey, I submit the fitting tribute they composed following the sad news of his passing at the young age of 52.  Kevin Frechette, Government Relations Executive, New Jersey Public     Service Activist, Life-Long Monmouth County Resident Passes Away       Kevin Frechette, 52, of Howell, NJ, passed away peacefully      at his home on September 5, 2012. Mr. Frechette, who leaves      behind a beloved son, Kyle Frechette, also of Howell, a      student at Ramapo College, was a Senior Vice President and      General Manager at MWW, an independent global public      relations firms with offices across the nation including a      headquarters in East Rutherford and an office in Trenton, NJ.       Mr. Frechette ran MWW's Trenton office and worked for the      company for 12 years. As a member of the firm, Mr. Frechette      was influential in the creation and funding of NJ211, a toll-     free, state-assisted hotline that directs New Jersey      residents to available community resources, and was critical      in successful efforts to curb the privatization of the New      Jersey Turnpike. A respected and knowledgeable figure at the      Statehouse in Trenton, noted for his sense of humor, good      nature and humility, he was a consultant to many leading New      Jersey businesses and nonprofits such as NJCURE, Parsons      Corporation, the New Jersey State Library, the Jewish      Federation of New Jersey and dozens of other prominent      organizations. In a previous career, Kevin served as a court      house and political reporter at the Daily Register of      Monmouth County.       Before joining MWW, Mr. Frechette spent eight years as the      Deputy Director of Press and District Operations in the New      Jersey General Assembly Majority Office, where he worked with      lawmakers on issues of media relations, marshaling district      resources, connecting with constituents and overall      communications strategies. He also served as Chief of Staff      to NJ Assemblyman and later State Senator Joe Kyrillos.       Mr. Frechette was born in Holy Name Hospital in Teaneck, NJ      and grew up and lived in Monmouth County nearly all his life.      He was a product of Holmdel Township Schools and also lived      in Little Silver, Red Bank and, most recently, Howell, New      Jersey.       He received a degree in Mass Communications from St.      Bonaventure University. Active in politics at a young age, he      served in Student Government in Holmdel High School where he      also played a leading role in the school's production of      ``Bye Bye Birdie.'' His family members were long-time      parishioners at St. Catherine's Church in Holmdel, NJ.       Among friends, Mr. Frechette was known for his sharp wit      and sense of humor, but also for the truly selfless way he      cared for people. Even while sick, he would visit friends in      the hospital as if his illness was irrelevant. Mr. Frechette      was known for being very honorable with a relentless work      ethic in every aspect of life; it earned him the respect and      love of all he came in touch with. Ultimately, Mr. Frechette      had two great passions in life, his son Kyle, over whom he      doted, and music, which he collected and immersed himself in      throughout his life.       In addition to his son Kyle, Mr. Frechette leaves behind      his parents, Charles Frechette, a former manager at Anchor      Glass, and his mother, Virginia Bishop Frechette, formerly      the assistant editor of The Catholic Digest, and author of      the children's book, ``Fighting Father Duffy.'' He is      survived by five loving siblings, all of whom adored him, Pam      Galiastro (husband: Frank,); Robin Kjersgaard; Jim Frechette;      Charles ``Chip'' Frechette (wife Donna); Chris Frechette      (wife Heidi); Ami Miano (late husband Charles); Kelly      Davidson (husband: Alistair), and six nieces and nephews:      Farrah Rizzo, Jamie and Kristen Galiastro; Ryan Kjersgaard;      and Tara and Noah Miano. Mr. Frechette is a grandson of the      late Jim Bishop, the syndicated columnist and author of 22      books, including ``The Day Christ Died'' and ``The Day      Lincoln Was Shot.''                          ____________________
