Chairman, I rise today to continue with my statement against H.R. 4546, the fiscal year 2003 Department of Defense authorization act. In my prior comments, I detailed how some quality-of-life improvements for active duty and retired military personnel that I strongly supported were overshadowed by unnecessary spending on weapons systems like the Crusader artillery system and the Comanche helicopter.  Unfortunately, as I mentioned in two previous statements about H.R. 4546, the House Rules Committee blocked any amendments to reform or eliminate unnecessary weapons systems from being considered. Today, I want to talk about another weapons system of dubious value, the F-22 Raptor fighter jet, that was fully funded in H.R. 4546. There is no threat that justifies the pursuit of this fighter jet program. Particularly when the Pentagon is simultaneously pursuing two other new fighter jet programs, the Joint Strike Fighter and the F-18E/F.  I offered two amendments on the F-22 that came directly out of the recommendations in a March 2002 GAO report. My first amendment would have reduced the number of low rate initial production aircraft from 23 to 13. My second amendment placed two conditions on the program: requiring a reassessment of the costs, and requiring the Air Force to monitor key manufacturing processes of the private contractors. Neither of these amendments was allowed to be debated by this House. In addition to the GAO, a variety of independent analysts have raised concerns about the F-22. Even the House of Representatives has gone on record expressing concerns. In the House report for the fiscal year 2000 Department of Defense appropriations bill, the Armed Services Committee highlighted a number of concerns about the program including various technical problems, the inability to control rising costs, and the questionable need for the aircraft. The House report even mentioned suitable alternatives to the F-22.  The problems highlighted in the House report have only gotten worse. Unfortunately, Congress seems content to bury its collective head in the sand and move forward with procuring F-22s that are too expensive, don't work, and are unnecessary. A March 2002 GAO report identified a number of ongoing problems with the F-22. In summary, GAO found ``The F-22 did not meet key schedule goals for 2001, the cost to complete planned development is likely to exceed the $21 billion reported to Congress, and the program is not far enough along in flight testing to confirm Air Force estimates of the aircraft's performance.''  The problems identified by GAO include:  Rising cost concerns: In the FY02 DOD authorization bill, Congress removed the development cost cap. Current estimates are the development costs will be $21 billion. However, that cost is likely to rise because flight testing delays may lead to an extension of the development program, and Lockheed Martin's costs, which are borne by taxpayers, have increased. Over the last two fiscal years, Lockheed's costs have exceeded budgets by $218 million. In addition, restructuring the test schedule increased costs by $557 million.  Delays in testing: The Air Force realigned the testing schedule in June 2001 because development test aircraft are taking longer to assemble than anticipated, available test aircraft are not achieving the number of test objectives per flight hour that are specified in the plan, and completion of the test schedule is highly dependent on a single test aircraft rather than the three as originally planned. The Air Force has a goal of ten test points per hour, but the program is only accomplishing seven per hour, 30 percent less than planned. GAO notes, ``avionics testing with development test aircraft has been limited.'' Only around 22 percent of planned avionics test points have been completed. GAO computations show that development flight testing necessary for the planned start of operational testing might not be completed until March 2004, 11 months later than planned.  However, the Air Force now plans to overlap development flight testing with operational flight testing. But, GAO wams ``there is an increased risk involved in the concurrency, and there is still a high risk of not completing an adequate amount of development flight testing before operational testing is scheduled to begin.''  The Air Force has also decided to dumb down the testing. GAO notes, ``the Air Force eliminated and consolidated some test points (specific test objectives conducted during flight testing) and deferred other test points . . . as a result, the combined total flight test points remaining have been reduced by approximately 4,708 points, or 31 percent.''  A recent review by the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center concluded there was insufficient testing completed to assess nine of the ten key performance parameters. GAO projects that airframe flight testing will have to continue until February 2008 to accomplish all the remaining 8,199 test points with one aircraft, which is almost four years beyond the current schedule. GAO concludes that the Air Force's cheerleading about the success of the test program is largely overblown. GAO wrote, ``the Air Force's estimates are based on limited flight test data, computer models, ground tests, and analyses. Flight test progress has been slower than expected, thusdelaying the confirmation that the F-22 will deliver requirement performance.''  I am also concerned about quality control problems in the F-22 program. According to the GAO, ``The Air Force has estimated that the F-22 should at this point in development be able to complete 1.55 flying hours between maintenance actions . . . However, development aircraft have been completing only .60 flying hours between maintenance.''  GAO also identified problems with the compound that helps make the F-22 stealthy. GAO noted that even the new formula has been prone to cracking and swelling. The Air Force is also investigating a problem with the aircraft's vertical tails that could impact performance. GAO wams: ``Buying production articles before they can be adequately tested can result in buying systems that require significant, and sometimes costly modifications to achieve satisfactory performance; accepting less capable systems than planned; and deploying substandard systems to combat forces.''  Finally, I am concerned about inadequate oversight of private contractors. In November 2000, when the F-22 program office ceased collecting information on the percentage of key processes in control, the contractor had only 44 percent of its manufacturing processes in control. GAO expressed concem about this lack of oversight. ``During our current review, the F-22 program officials told us that neither they nor the prime contractors track the status of manufacturing processes in control because of the cost involved in tracking these processes. They rely on subcontractors to manage their own manufacturing processes. Hence, the program office may be committing to increased production quantities without knowing the percentage of key manufacturing processes that are in control. Continuing to increase the F-22 aircraft production quantities in low rate production before 100 percent of the key manufacturing processes are under control increases the risk that manufacturing and assembly problems evident with the development test aircraft will carry over into the production program.''  In a strongly worded conclusion, GAO wrote, ``The cost involved in correcting manufacturing and assembly problems would most likely exceed ,he cost of tracking and manufacturing processes.'' My amendments would have addressed the concerns of the GAO and protected taxpayers. Unfortunately, as I mentioned before, the Rules Committee refused to allow a real debate and blocked my amendments from floor consideration.                          ____________________
