 President, this amendment is simple and straightforward. It bans any abortion after viability, except when a doctor has determined that it is necessary to save the life or protect the health of the woman.  I have been a part of the Judiciary Committee now for 10 years and I have seen this bill come up in three Congresses and listened to or read testimony on this bill for three Congresses.  The first time it came up, it became very apparent to me that the definition of partial-birth abortion was too vague. I wondered why it was so vague. It looked like it covered different medical procedures. And now, about 8 years later, I believe I know why it is so vague. I believe it is so vague because it could actually cover all abortions and therefore be a major strike against a woman's right to choose. Eighty percent of the people of this country believe that abortion must be safe and legal to preserve a woman's health. People strongly believe that this is a decision between a woman, her clergy, her doctor, and her family.  I deeply believe politicians should not be in the business of making decisions about women's reproductive rights. In my view, the Santorum legislation, S. 3, is a Trojan horse. It is not what it purports to be. It supposedly bans one procedure, D, but actually confuses this procedure with another, D, the most commonly used abortion procedure. In fact, its wording is so vague that it could be construed to criminalize all abortions.  Yesterday's Congressional Record shows that Senator Santorum--and I have great respect for my distinguished colleague--stated:       I have not been asking about medical necessity. . . . I      have not asked for someone's opinion on what ought to be or      what could be. What I have asked for is an example. I wanted      a fact circumstance to be provided as to where this would be      the best, this would be appropriate, this would be medically      indicated.  I would like to answer Senator Santorum's question at this time, through a letter. After we heard this question, we called the University of California San Francisco Medical Center, the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences, and talked to the chief of that department at San Francisco General Hospital, who is also a full professor. His name is Philip D. Darney. Dr. Darney just sent me this letter, and I would like to read that letter into the Record:       Dear Senator Feinstein: I write to provide examples of the      need for a ``medical exemption'' to the proposed restriction      of use of the so-called ``partial birth abortion'' technique      which is now before the Senate. The medical term for the      technique is ``intact D''.       I am Chief of Obstetrics and Gynecology at San Francisco      General Hospital, SFGH, where my department provides about      2,000 abortions yearly to poor women from throughout Northern      California. Patients who are in the second trimester and who      have special medical problems are referred to SFGH for      treatment because our staff has special competence in second      trimester abortion and because we can provide specialized      care for women who are more likely to have a complicated      pregnancy termination. Although I have not reviewed medical      records in order to count the number of times we have      employed intact D, I will provide examples of cases in      which the technique was critical to safe conduct of our      surgery:       A 25 year old with two previous vaginal deliveries and      bleeding placenta previa and a clotting disorder at 20 weeks      was referred for termination of pregnancy. After checking her      coagulation parameters and making blood available for      transfusion, we dilated the cervix overnight with Laminaria      and planned uterine evacuation when adequate dilation was      achieved or bleeding became too heavy to replace. Within 12      hours cervical dilation was 3 cm and heavy bleeding had      begun. We removed the placenta quickly and used the ``intact      D'' approach to complete the abortion and accomplish quick      control of blood loss. The patient required a transfusion of      two units of whole blood and was discharged the next day in      good health.       A 38 year old with three previous caesarean deliveries and      evidence of placenta accreta was referred for pregnancy      termination at 22 weeks because her risk of massive      hemorrhage and hysterectomy at the time of delivery was      correctly estimated at about 75 percent. After SFGH      sonographic studies confirmed placenta previa and likely      accreta we undertook cervical dilation with laminaria and      made blood available in case transfusion was required. To      reduce the 75 percent probability of emergency hysterectomy      in the situation of disseminated intravascular coagulation      (DIC is quite likely with accreta) we decided to empty the      uterus as quickly as possible with the intact D procedure      and treat hemorrhage, if it occurred, with uterine artery      embolization before our patient lost too much blood and      hysterectomy was our only option. This approach succeeded and      she was discharged in good health two days later.       These two patients provide examples from my memory of      situations in which the ``intact D'' technique was critical      to providing optimal care. I am certain that a review of our      hospital records would identify cases of sever pre-eclampsia,      for example, in which ``intact D'' was the safest technique      of pregnancy termination, I hope the law will not deny our      patients the best treatment we can provide them under life-     threatening circumstances. Sincerely, Philip D. Darney.  This letter is from the chief of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at one of the best hospitals in the country. It answers Senator Santorum's question. It provides two examples of where D, or what some also call intact D, may well have been necessary to protect the health of the woman.  Heart disease, cancer, and grave fetal abnormalities are among the many conditions that can make pregnancy especially dangerous to a woman's physical health. Under S. 3, these patients would be forced to continue a dangerous pregnancy. That is why I am offering my health exception amendment today.  Indeed, there are many tragic situations that face women today, situations that most could never imagine. There is one thing that has always characterized these debates. That is that everyone looks at them from their own vantage point without taking into consideration the situations of others. If you have not encountered a difficult situation, such as a possibly dangerous pregnancy, it is hard to know what you would do. But women and their families face these situations daily.  That is as good a reason as any why the Senate should not intrude into this area, and why the reproductive choices of women should be left to the women, their clergy, their morality, their families, their doctors, and not to the Senate.  Having said that, the amendment I am offering strikes a balance between protecting a woman's health and ensuring the D procedure is not abused. This amendment would ban all post-viability abortions unless a doctor determines that these abortions are necessary to protect the life and health of the woman. To ensure compliance with this ban, a doctor who performs a postviability abortion on a woman whose health or life is not at risk could be fined up to $100,000.  What is wrong with S. 3? I will take a moment to explain why I believe Senator Santorum's bill is a bad bill. To begin with, it is unconstitutional because it lacks a health exception. I heard Senator Santorum say a health exception is not necessary. It is necessary. A review of the Supreme Court's abortion decisions and the record makes clear that any ban on D what supporters of the Santorum bill incorrectly call partial-birth abortion--must include a health exception. My amendment includes such an exception.  In 1973, Roe v. Wade grounded the abortion right in large part on the States' compelling obligation to protect maternal health. In fact, the Court states that the States' interest in preserving the health of a pregnant woman grows more important as a woman's pregnancy progresses. Thus, under Roe, the need for a health exception becomes even stronger with second- or third-term abortion procedures.  In 1992, as my colleagues have stated this many times on the floor, the Supreme Court explicitly reaffirmed Roe in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Then in the year 2000, in Stenberg v. Carhart, the Supreme Court ruled that any ban must have a health exception. I have outlined two specific examples of why such a health exception is necessary. Yet Senator Santorum's bill does not have such an exception.  At the same time, S. 3 attempts to ban a specific medical procedure which it calls partial-birth abortion. But the bill offers no medical definition of partial-birth abortion. Now the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, whose more than 44,000 members represent approximately 95 percent of all board-certified OB/GYNs practicing in the United States, has developed a medical definition of what is a D procedure. The American College of OB/GYNs's definition of the procedure is very different from Senator Santorum's.  I have to ask, why? Why wouldn't the proponents of this bill put in a medically acceptable definition so that those physicians who were practicing medicine and may encounter this kind of case would know precisely what is prohibited? I believe I know the answer. The answer is that the bill is calculated to cover more than just one procedure. I think it is calculated to ban all abortions. I believe if the bill becomes law, it would be struck down as unconstitutional.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from the American College of OB/GYNs.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                        ACOG Statement of Policy             statement on intact dilatation and extraction       The debate regarding legislation to prohibit a method of      abortion, such as the legislation banning ``partial birth      abortion,'' and ``brain sucking abortions,'' has prompted      questions regarding these procedures. It is difficult to      respond to these questions because the descriptions are vague      and do not delineate a specific procedure recognized in the      medical literature. Moreover, the definitions could be      interpreted to include elements of many recognized abortion      and operative obstetric techniques.       The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists      (ACOG) believes the intent of such legislative proposals is      to prohibit a procedure referred to as ``Intact Dilatation      and Extraction'' (Intact D & X). This procedure has been      described as containing all of the following four elements:       1. deliberate dilatation of the cervix, usually over a      sequence of days;       2. instrumental conversion of the fetus to a footling      breech;       3. breech extraction of the body excepting the head; and       4. partial evacuation of the intracranial contents of a      living fetus to effect vaginal delivery of a dead but      otherwise intact fetus.       Because these elements are part of established obstetric      techniques, it must be emphasized that unless all four      elements are present in sequence, the procedure is not an      intact D & X.       Abortion intends to terminate a pregnancy while preserving      the life and health of the mother. When abortion is performed      after 16 weeks, intact D & X is one method of terminating a      pregnancy. The physician, in consultation with the patient,      must choose the most appropriate method based upon the      patient's individual circumstances.       According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention      (CDC), only 5.3% of abortions performed in the United States      in 1993, the most recent data available, were performed after      the 16th week of pregnancy. A preliminary figure published by      the CDC for 1994 is 5.6%. The CDC does not collect data on      the specific method of abortion, so it is unknown how many of      these were performed using intact D & X. Other data show that      second trimester transvaginal instrumental abortion is a safe      procedure.       Terminating a pregnancy is performed in some circumstances      to save the life or preserve the health of the mother. Intact      D & X is one of the methods available in some of these      situations. A select panel convened by ACOG could identify no      circumstances under which this procedure, as defined above,      would be the only option to save the life or preserve the      health of the woman. An intact D & X, however, may be the      best or most appropriate procedure in a particular      circumstance to save the life or preserve the health of a      woman, and only the doctor, in consultation with the patient,      based upon the woman's particular circumstances can make this      decision. The potential exists that legislation prohibiting      specific medical practices, such as intact D & X, may outlaw      techniques that are critical to the lives and health of      American women. The intervention of legislative bodies into      medical decision making is inappropriate, ill advised, and      dangerous.--Approved by the Executive Board, January 12,      1997.
