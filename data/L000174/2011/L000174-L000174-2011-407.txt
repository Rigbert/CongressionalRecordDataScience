We must work together to ensure that the Federal judiciary has the judges it needs to provide justice to Americans in courts throughout the country. Judicial vacancies throughout the country hinder the Federal judiciary's ability to fulfill its constitutional role. They create a backlog of cases that prevents people from having their day in court in a timely fashion. This is unacceptable. That is why Chief Justice Roberts, Attorney General Holder, and the President of the United States have spoken out and urged the Senate to act.  Just before the Senate adjourned for its two-week Easter recess, the White House Counsel spoke to the American Bar Association about the need for a sense of greater urgency in filling these judicial vacancies. I hope that we will follow this advice and make real progress to ensure that the Federal courts are able to function for all Americans.  We have a long way to go to do as well as we did during President Bush's first term, when we confirmed 205 of his judicial nominations, bringing the vacancy rate down from 10 percent to 4 percent. We confirmed 100 othose judicial nominations during the 17 months I was Chairman during President Bush's first 2 years in office. So far, well into President Obama's third year in office, the Senate has only been allowed to consider 79 of President Obama's Federal circuit and district court nominees. We remain well short of the benchmarks we set during the Bush administration; 79 is well short of 205.                               Exhibit 1         [From the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Apr. 27, 2011]     Business, Defendants Harmed in Cost-Cutting at Federal Courts                         (By Ashley L. Belleau)       Just as budgets matter, so does justice. The two are      connected. Making sure we have enough judges in our federal      courts will save dollars, not waste them.       The insufficient number of judges in our federal courts is      costing our country in dollars and protracted litigation.      Manpower and money are foolishly wasted. Record caseloads in      many federal judicial districts cause trials to be delayed,      especially civil cases. This is not good for the state of      justice in our nation.       The fact that we don't have enough judges to decide      promptly the federal civil and criminal lawsuits in our      country owes itself to the Congress and the president. Both      have failed to create enough judgeships in high-caseload      areas of the country, like California and the border courts      in Texas. Both have failed to keep the process moving by      timely providing capable, qualified individuals to fill      judgeships as they open up due to retirement, death or      resignations.       As a result our federal court system is bursting at the      seams. With 12 percent of judgeships vacant, temporary      judgeships expiring, and more courts in emergency mode than      ever, there is an unprecedented crisis in our third branch of      government. The phrase ``justice delayed is justice denied''      describes the dire situation in many federal courthouses.      Judicial vacancies plainly undermine the capacity of our      courts to render justice within a reasonable period of time.       Sadly, few Americans understand the impact these judicial      vacancies have on their lives. Those of us who try federal      cases know     its impact in the continuance of cases for months, even      years, without decision. Vacancies and delay add greater      costs to already high litigation expenses. For business      clients, these costs get passed on to customers. And when the      United States is a party to the case, it means that the      public is paying that higher tab.       For criminal defendants awaiting trial, it can mean more      detention time, adding even more costs to the taxpayer. Just      last year, the federal cost of pretrial detention alone was      $1.4 billion, according to the Department of Justice.       At a recent forum sponsored by the Federal Bar Association      and the Brookings Institution, Federal District Judge Royal      Furgeson commented on the enormous impact that vacancies on      the federal bench have on the pace of litigation and      ultimately the American economy: The business of America is      business, and when businesses can't figure out if their      patents are good, their contracts are good, they can't figure      out what to do about their tax situation, things bog down.      Businesses need a strong rule of law and prompt rulings by      judges. Vacancies desperately need to be filled; new judges      desperately need to be added. We owe that to our citizens. We      owe that to our Constitution. We owe that to the rule of law.      And we owe it to the cause of justice.       Prompt and thoughtful justice, not endless delay, is what      the American people expect from their legal system. It is      what we deserve. It is what due process requires. And it is      the most cost-efficient approach to the resolution of      lawsuits in our nation's courts.                                  ____                               Exhibit 2              [From the Arizona Range News, Apr. 27, 2011]                 Lack of Federal Judges a Serious Issue       At the beginning of the year, Judge John Roll, the      presiding federal judge in Arizona, was seeking permission to      delay bringing felons to trial from the usual 70-day      requirement to up to 180 days. That's the same Judge Roll who      was gunned down just days later in Tucson by a deranged      assassin.       Roll termed the problem a ``judicial emergency'' prompted      by the number of cases flooding the judicial docket in      Arizona and the federal court's inability to handle them all      in a speedy fashion.       The problem is and remains a lack of judges and court staff      to handle the caseload.       According to news reports, based on its caseload, the      judicial district of Arizona is eligible for five more      judgeships. The state is authorized for 13, but has three      vacancies, two in the Tucson division.       As a direct result of illegal immigration prosecutions, two      years ago there were 3,023 felony cases filed in federal      court in Arizona. That increased to 4,311 the next year and      5,219 last year. In just Tucson, felony filings went from      1,564 two years ago to 3,289 last year.       The power to appoint more judges lies with Congress, but      our representatives and senators, while reportedly      supportive, have not been proactive.       The problem prompted the Phoenix Chapter of the Federal Bar      Association to issue last month a resolution to congressional      members to get the vacancies filled and to add to the court      staff and its facilities.       In fact, judicial vacancies are a problem across the      nation. According to a CNN report, there are 99 vacancies in      the 857 federal district and appeals court judgeships,      amounting to about 12 percent of the judicial seats. Just 46      names have been put forth by President Obama to fill those      openings. The Administrative Office of the U.S. courts      predicts at least 15 more vacancies this year.       We urge you to contact your congressional members to      champion a solution to the very real needs of the judge and      staff shortages facing the federal courts in Arizona.       And we would ask you to ask them to act not only for our      state's sake, but in memory of Judge Roll who served his      state and country well.
