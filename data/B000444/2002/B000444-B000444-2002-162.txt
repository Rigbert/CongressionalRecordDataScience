 President, recently I was asked by a constituent of mine, Mr. Marshall Miller, if I would seek to have an essay on Central Asia that was written by his son, Leland, reprinted in the Congressional Record. Leland Miller is a second year law student at the University of Virginia. I ask that Mr. Miller's essay be printed in the Record.  The essay follows:           Keeping Central Asia's Kleptocrats at Arm's Length                         (By Leland R. Miller)       As American planes take off from Uzbek airstrips to provide      support for the war against the Taliban, another conflict is      occurring nearby, underneath the radar of the American media.      Kazakhstan, the largest territory in Central Asia, is      undergoing a palace coup. Yet few in Washington seem to know      or care.       As the only major area on earth that is still ``up for      grabs,'' Central Asia may very well become a key geopolitical      battleground of the 21st century. This is nothing new. In the      early 20th century, British strategist Sir Halford J.      Mackinder proclaimed that whoever controls Central Asia has      the key to world domination. Yet a century later, it is      almost an afterthought in American strategic thinking.       This is a major mistake, the result of two phenomena.      First, the war in Afghanistan has convinced U.S. policy      makers that the need for support--both rhetorical and      substantive--from Central Asian regimes trumps all other      considerations.       Second, the promise of the Caspian oil basin and other      large business opportunities in the lucrative Central Asian      energy markets have seduced Washington into turning a blind      eye towards whom we are dealing with.       As a result of these dual factors, America is walking into      a dangerous trap. As we open our arms to these unstable and      authoritarian Central Asian regimes, they are gradually      gaining the status not just of America's temporary allies but      as our friends. This is a disastrous betrayal of U.S.      interests. Granted, the promise of quick rewards is enticing.      However, like all Faustian bargains, the sacrifice could be      considerable.       Perhaps no country sings this siren song more effectively      than Kazakhstan. Although it is one of the world's poorest      countries, its president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, is ranked as      the eighth richest man in the world. The reason? He and his      two venal sons-in-law have run Kazakhstan as a family      business. The family has sustained itself through gross      corruption and the ruthless exploitation of would-be foreign      investors.       The Kazakh leaders entice investments or loans, take over      the investments under some pretext, then ``sell the same      horse'' again to someone else. With abundant oil, uranium,      and other resources, the country always seems able to find      another group of gullible suitors. If that fails, pseudo-     investments can be induced to cover up money laundering from      the Russian mafia.       The recent crisis in Kazakhstan only reinforces this image.      It began when Rakhat Aliyev, son-in-law to President      Nursultan Nazabayev, was forced to resign his position as      deputy chairman of the National Security Committee after      reportedly making an Absalom-like run at his father-in-law's      authority. He re-emerged just days later as the new head of      the presidential guard, seemingly unscathed, but he had      driven the first big split in the ruling family. His      detractors used this opening to form a new party, Democratic      Choice.       While some insiders have suggested that this new group may      be nothing less than a second tier of crooks fighting Aliyev      for a bigger piece of the pie, the government reacted      swiftly. Prime Minister Kasymzhomart Tokayev, a Nazarbayev      crony, angrily demanded (and received) the resignations of      four top cabinet members, all of whom were founding members      of the new party. Tokayev's justification?: ``All those      disagreeing with our policy and wishing to participate in      political movements should resign.''       Perhaps no one outside of the palace in Astana knows what's      really going on. But in the world of Kazakh politics, it      matters little whether this battle was an intrafamily fight      for power or simply a battle amongst politicians unhappy with      the current division of spoils. Either way, this is clearly      not a regime that America should be too identified with.       True, Kazakhstan does draw some favorable comparisons, but      only when contrasted with its neighbors. The fact is, Central      Asian governments are among the most corrupt and repressive      regimes in the world. Most inherited the apparatuses of their      communist predecessors and many have been just as ruthless in      wielding it. Most, like Nazarbayev's and Turkmenbashi's of      Turkmenistan, are even extensions of the same communist party      structure that they allegedly replaced.       Autocratic and corrupt governance is the rule, not the      exception, in Central Asia. The lack of available political      channels is so endemic in these countries that frustrated      citizens are offered but two choices: attempt to mobilize      politically, despite the obvious barriers, or else turn to      extra-political means of empowerment.       It is this second possibility that so desperately deserves      U.S. attention. Across Central Asia, ethnic and religious      differences among the populations constitute a     sizable obstacle to stability and democratic governance.      Unlike the Balkans, however, it is not an insurmountable one.       Despite the pervasive following of Islam in the region,      religious extremism does not have the same roots in Central      Asia that it does in other parts of the world. Radical      groups, such as the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (whose      leader, Jumaboi Khojiev Namangani, was reportedly killed      fighting in Afghanistan--some sources say he has merely gone      into hiding) are fortunately still the exception.       However, this could certainly change if repressive regimes      continue to kindle the flames of religious extremism by      stifling virtually all other opportunities for political      voice. The horrors of Algeria should not be replicated in      Uzbekistan or Tajikistan.       Situated in the middle of Russia, China, and India, and      with virtually untapped energy potential, Central Asia would      be an area of importance to the United States even under the      best of circumstances. However, the War on Terror has now      considerably upped the ante. Support for the cause of Muslim      fundamentalism in Central Asia not only threatens the      region's stability, but is sure to mean more fuel for a      global jihad. As the events of 9/11 have made clear, America      has as much reason to fear that development as any of the      regimes themselves.       The next generation of America's leaders must not be made      apologists for today's policies aimed at the short-term and      short-sighted advancement of U.S. interests. This means      avoiding marriages of convenience with repressive Central      Asian regimes that will inevitably prove harmful to the      nation's future.       The New Great Game in Central Asia is very much a battle of      good against evil. Democracy, not Islamic extremism, must      fill the political void. While the U.S. has no role in      fomenting or aiding these ``coups of the apparatchiks,''      Americans are still beholden to one obligation: We need to at      least make sure we are not rooting for the wrong      side.                          ____________________
