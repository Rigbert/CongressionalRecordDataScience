Speaker, on Friday, October 1, 1999, I celebrated a final day of work with twenty-seven members of the Architect of the Capitol staff from the House Office Buildings. Of the twenty-seven employees leaving us, eighteen are my constituents. These valued employees are retiring under a buyout program developed earlier this year by the Architect of the Capitol and approved by the House Administration Committee, of which I am the Ranking Member. The buyout program has provided excellent retirement opportunities, which at the same time creating new avenues of advancement for the staff of the Architect who continue with us.  The staffers retiring today have an average of twenty-nine years of service each, and together, they have provided 798 years of service. The Architect of the Capitol fields a work force that is indispensable to us, and often labors unnoticed in the shadows, or more aptly, in the basement and tunnels of these buildings. Like public employees everywhere, they do some of the toughest jobs under the most adverse conditions in the country. They do it always with smiles and friendly greetings, and a job well done. These employees were never looking to get rich and they do not do it for public acclaim. They do their jobs and they do them well because they know we all rely on them. Lyndon Johnson understood this. He said of public service ``so much of what we achieve as people depends upon the caliber and the character of the civil service.''  I would like to take this opportunity to say thank you on behalf of all my colleagues, both Democrat and Republican. Farewell to those employees leaving us today, we will miss them and we thank them for their contribution to our daily lives. They are: Lewis Bowles, Jr., John Callahan, Jr., Douglas Colbert, Ernest Cook, Margaret Donnelly, Lillie Drayton, Alvin Gayan, Hubert Gray, David Ingram, Solomon Landers, Earl Lemings, Carroll Lumpkins, Jr., Norman Lynch, James Mattingly, Luke Mattingly, William McWilliams, Bernard Merritt, Robert Merryman, Walter Montgomery, Allen Nichols, Talmadge Nowden, Anthony Pilkerton, James Quade, Robert Quade, Raymond Stager, George Stein, and Leonard Vanryswick.                          ____________________
