Mr. Speaker, on February 9, 2005, I introduced H.R. 3, the Transportation Equity Act: a Legacy for Users, TEA LU. This is a 6-year authorization of Federal highway, transit and highway safety programs. These programs are all currently operating under an extension since the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, TEA 21, expired on September 30, 2003. The current extension--which is the sixth extension of these programs--will expire on May 31, 2005. We must pass this bill and successfully complete conference with the Senate before the Memorial Day recess begins. We must get this job done. American jobs and the continuing growth of the U.S. economy directly depend on the successful enactment of this authorization.  On February 7, 2005, President Bush introduced his fiscal year 2006 budget. I was pleased that the budget includes an updated reauthorization proposal funding Federal highway, transit and highway safety programs at $283.9 billion over 6 years in guaranteed funding. This is a $28 billion increase above the proposal introduced by the administration 2 years ago, and I applaud the administration's recognition of the pressing needs of America's highways and transit systems in this higher number. The bill I introduced also funds the same programs at $283.9 billion in guaranteed funding over 6 years, 2004 through 2009. I strongly believe that we have a much better chance of moving this legislation quickly in the 109th Congress, now that we are working with the same top line funding level that the President has endorsed.  The other reason that this $283.9 billion guaranteed funding level may sound familiar is that it was the total 6-year guaranteed funding level that was under discussion in last year's conference negotiations. I am committed to getting back to conference as fast as possible.  There are no major policy changes between this bill and last year's authorization bill, which passed the House by a vote of 357 to 65 on April 2, 2004. The policies in H.R. 3 represent months of intense negotiations within the committee, with other House Members, and with stakeholder organizations.  I will work closely with the leadership, the Ways and Means Committee chairman, and the chairman of the Budget Committee as we further refine this bill and prepare for committee markup and floor passage. I urge the House membership's strong support of TEA LU, particularly since we now have the administration's endorsement of the total funding level.  Let's get this job done, so that our Nation's commerce can move quickly and efficiently, commuters can get to work faster and easier, waste less gas sitting in traffic, and spend more time with their families. States, communities, workers and industries around the country are waiting for us to act on this reauthorization. Let's get it done.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E226]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]  INTRODUCTION OF TEA LU (H.R. 3) HIGHWAY, TRANSIT AND HIGHWAY SAFETY                            AUTHORIZATION BILL                                 ______                                                              HON.
