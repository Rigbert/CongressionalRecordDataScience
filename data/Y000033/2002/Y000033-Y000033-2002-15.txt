However, we cannot be certain that Congress will move quickly to enact appropriation bills in January. In fact, with reorganization activities and a new majority in the Senate, there is a high level of uncertainty about timing for the entire appropriation process.  Because of this uncertainty, it is imperative we absolutely be clear that the highway program will continue at the full enacted funding level of $31.8 billion, as it is cleared today. That is the level we are spending monies today, not $27.7 billion.  It is important to note that except for the highway program, this program, the one that affects every one of your districts, that this continuing resolution continues all activities under the fiscal year of 2002 funding levels, all activities. But they picked out the highway program. It is unfair to cut the highway programs in your district.  Now, Members should keep that in mind very closely when they cast their vote. Every dollar of the $31.8 billion funding level we support comes from the highway trust fund. It does not come from the general budget. It does not come from the general fund. It is the trust fund. It is the money of the users of the highways. It is funded by fuel taxes, it is paid by the highway users; and those highway funds should be used to sustain jobs and reduce congestion and improve our economy.  Mr. Speaker, I cannot for the life of me, I have talked to my appropriations brother, I have talked to the Speaker, I have talked to the majority leader, I have talked to the minority leader. I do not know where this is coming from. If this is coming from the White House, shame on them.  This is not their money, it is our money; and to this have this one program singled out is inappropriate. I have talked to the Committee on Rules chairman, and I talked to the Speaker, and I have talked to the leadership of this House; and I said this is not fair, we ought not to do this. Leave it at $31 billion, as it should be, come back and do the job right and not continue to nip at us. This is the fourth time we have done this.  I want to know who is responsible. Can anybody give me an idea where this is coming from? They cannot do that. I as the chairman of the committee and all of my 75 Members better understand one thing. If we leave it at $27 billion, you can keep one thing in mind: this is an attempt by this administration to use this trust fund money to try to use it for other uses in the budget instead of as highway funds. So for the first time, I am going to ask my people to vote ``no'' on this rule.  Mr. Speaker, I am somewhat embarrassed, because last month the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) and I had this discussion on the floor, and I had thought I had an agreement to protect this; and I said specifically then to accept the $27.1 billion, the level that was decided, but with the understanding that we would spend it at $31.8 billion if it did not go beyond the first of the year.  What has happened here, again, I have not had anybody tell me where this is coming from. It is not your money. It is not the White House's money. This belongs to the users of the highway. We can come back, pass another rule, and make sure that we do the job right. And, believe me, I will find out where this is coming from.                              {time}  1115  You are not going to take this money away from the users of the highway. They paid for it. They want the highways. They want the infrastructure. We talk about stimulating the economy. Forget all of these other programs they are talking about. Let us create jobs by building our bridges and our highways. Let us do it. If we want to stimulate something, let us stimulate it with real jobs and not make believe.  So I would just keep in mind, let us put this rule down and come back with the right rule.
