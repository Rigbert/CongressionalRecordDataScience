 They are Tim Rieser, Mark Lippert, and J.P. Dowd. I also extend my thanks to Jennifer Chartrand, Billy Piper of my personal staff, and Paul Grove, who replaced my long-time staffer, Robert Cleveland of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee. He has done a superb job with his first bill. I thank them all from the bottom of my heart.  I yield the floor.
