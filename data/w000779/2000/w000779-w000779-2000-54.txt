President, I am pleased today to introduce the Capital Construction Fund Reform Act of 2000.  The Capital Construction Fund (CCF) was originally created by the Merchant Marine Act as a way to encourage the construction and use of American-owned vessels in U.S. waters. For fishermen, the Capital Construction Fund authorizes the accumulation of funds, free from taxes, for the purpose of buying or refitting commercial fishing vessels. The program has been a success in promoting the domestic fishing industry. However, the usefulness of the CCF has not kept up with the times. Today it is actually exacerbating the problems facing U.S. fisheries by forcing fishermen to keep their money in fishing vessels, rather than allowing them to retire from fishing and pursue other interests.  Our nation's fisheries are collapsing. Over the past year, fisheries in New England, Alaska and the West Coast have been officially declared disasters by the Secretary of Commerce. Plainly speaking, there are too many boats and not enough fish. Along the West Coast, a mere 200 of the 1400 boats currently fishing could catch the entire allowable harvest of groundfish. That means we could buyout 85 percent of the boats and still not reduce capacity in our fisheries. Since 1995, Congress has appropriated $140 million to buy fishing vessels and permits back from fishermen. Clearly, more needs to be done. This legislation empowers the fisherman to make his own choices to stay or leave the fishery with his own money.  In these times when we ought to be reducing the number of boats in our fisheries, it does not make sense for federal policy to encourage fishermen to build more of them. Yet current law prohibits fishermen from getting their own money out of CCF accounts for any purpose other than building boats. If they do, they lose up to 70 percent of their money in taxes and penalties. When fishermen have already been hit with increasingly severe harvest restrictions over the past few years, it is just not fair to hold their own money hostage.  That is why I'm introducing a bill that makes it easier for fishermen to withdraw their funds from the Capital Construction Fund if they retire from the fishery. My bill would allow fund holders to roll their funds over into an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) or other retirement fund. It would also allow them to use their own money to participate in buyback programs. This bill also eliminates the tax-penalty for withdrawals for those folks wishing to leave the industry.  Mr. President, this bill enjoys wide support from a variety of organizations with an interest in our nation's fisheries. Environmental groups, trawlers, small boat operators and processors alike have expressed their enthusiasm for this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support the swift adoption of this bill so that our fisherman can start making their own choices about their businesses and lives.  I ask unanimous consent that my statement and the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2960       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
