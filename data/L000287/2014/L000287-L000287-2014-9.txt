Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3865.  For years, Congress demanded action on this issue. In an independent report, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) told the IRS and Treasury to remove the gray and give clear guidance regarding the tax treatment of social welfare organizations.  There were dramatic hearings, and the public demanded clear, fair rules. Members of this Congress from both sides of the aisle agreed that the IRS should implement all nine of the TIGTA recommendations.  This is just what the IRS and Treasury did. They are taking their time, and trying to do the right thing--once and for all. The IRS already received 23,000 comments on the proposed rulemaking--23 thousand, Mr. Speaker.  And today, not even eight months later, this body is trying to tear down long overdue progress and restart the clock at square one. So, you can see why I oppose bringing this bill to the Floor today. It makes no sense, no sense at all.  Mr. Speaker, Members of Congress can be constructive, supportive, and effective. Instead, this bill returns to the old tradition of no, by any means necessary.  I urge each and every one of my colleagues to oppose this unnecessary bill.
