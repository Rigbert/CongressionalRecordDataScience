 President, I know that under the previous order, it is time for the policy luncheons. There are others here who may want to speak. I see Senator Gregg may well want to speak. Senator Lott would like to respond. Senator Byrd also wants a few minutes.  I suggest the following: that Senator Byrd be recognized for 3 minutes, after which Senator Lott be recognized for 5 minutes, after which we recess for the policy lunches. I know there may be others who wish to speak. Hopefully we can accomplish that sometime after the policy lunches. This is the last day we are here for our respective policy lunches. These are important lunches. We are going to have to begin them shortly. Therefore, I ask that consent.
