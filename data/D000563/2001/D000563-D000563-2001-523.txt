Keep in mind the institutions which you are trying to protect by opposing this amendment.  These are people who are preying on our parents and grandparents, living in their retirement, subjected to loan terms and conditions that are outrageous by any moral standard.  We are saying is, after they have perpetrated these frauds to the public, after they have literally threatened to take away a home from a retired person with a loan that is unconscionable and violates the law, we want them to have free rein in bankruptcy court to pursue their claim.  I don't think that is right. Why in the world is this Senate spending its good time and the money of taxpayers on hearings involving predatory lending, coming up with all of these wonderful speeches about how terrible these people are, and when we have a chance in the bankruptcy law to finally do something to stop these awfulpredatory lending practices, we refuse? We refuse.  All of the moral indignation we were able to muster in these committee hearings about the outrageous examples of what is happening to senior citizens and low-income people, we forget as soon as we come to the floor and start talking about a bankruptcy law.  I don't care about committee jurisdiction. That may be an issue to some; it is not to me. I am more concerned about the people who expect bankruptcy code reform to be sensitive to borrowers as well as lenders. I hope my colleagues in the Senate will support my amendment.  I yield the floor.
