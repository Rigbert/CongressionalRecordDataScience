President, I know the minority leader has several speakers who want to speak. I also know that virtually everyone on our side is wanting to stay with the 4:15 vote.  What I would like to do, of course, is encourage the minority leader to use his leader time if necessary but go ahead and allow anyone on the other side to use time at this time.  I yield the floor.
