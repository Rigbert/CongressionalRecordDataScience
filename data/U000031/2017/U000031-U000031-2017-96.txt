Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 2274, was introduced by the gentleman from California (Mr. Peters), and it was passed by unanimous consent by the Energy and Commerce Committee.  The bill, H.R. 2274, amends the Federal Power Act to allow the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, to extend periods relating to preliminary permits and commencement of construction of hydroelectric projects.  This bill is a commonsense bill, bipartisan, and I would hope that all Members would join me in supporting it.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2274, the HYdropower Permit Extension, or HYPE, Act.  I am pleased that the House is considering this legislation, which was recently introduced by my colleague, Mr. Peters, of the committee, to provide the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission with the authority to grant longer periods for preliminary and construction permits and associated extensions under sections 5 and 13 of the Federal Power Act.  Right now, as we have seen from the debating of these six bills today, this is something that can only be done by an act of Congress on a case-by-case basis.                              {time}  1615  As much as we have all enjoyed debating these extensions of time today, it is clear that it would be more efficient and it also would save more time in Congress if these extensions could be done directly by FERC. I commend Mr. Peters. I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I am now pleased to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. Peters), the author of the bill.
