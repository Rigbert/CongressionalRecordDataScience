Coincidentally, I was talking to my friend, Senator Vitter, who went over this with me. I have instructed my staff to add me to the Senator's bill as a cosponsor.  As the Senator from Florida will remember, he and I have agreed on a lot of the problems we are having today with China; for one thing, the threat that is out there, both in terms of energy and military buildup. I have been very much concerned as I go through--and my friend from Florida and I are both very active in trying to get things done in Africa--as we go through Africa, individually or together, we notice one of the major things we see taking place there, particularly in the area of the Sea of Guinea and other places in Nigeria where they have huge oil reserves, is the Chinese are building all of these new and shiny bridges and all that, which is competing with us since we have the same problem they have in terms of a lack of energy.  So I would enjoy joining him in some of these problems we see that we are having with China.  I wanted some time this morning. I actually have four causes going on right now. I am not going to have time to address all four of these. But I will just briefly say what they are, then I will start with the one I think is the most critical right now. First of all, one of my causes is having to do with Guantanamo Bay.  The fact that people are talking about closing it, President Obama has stated--actually in his inaugural address he did not, but then later on said, yes, we are going to close it in spite of the problems that would come to us if we did close it.  I am anxious to have time on the floor to talk about the frequent visits I have made to GITMO. One of the few good deals the Government has today is Guantanamo Bay. It might be that the Presiding Officer is not aware of the fact. It is one of the good deals out there. We only pay $4,000 a year, the same thing we paid in 1903, for the use of this great facility.  There has been no evidence of any kind of abuse of prisoners or detainees. They have a judicial center that is unlike anything in the United States. These are tribunals.       We cannot put these terrorists, these detainees, into our      prison system. That is not going to work. If it does, I would      like to know which Member of the Senate wants to have those      detainees housed in their own State. I am sure the Presiding      Officer is not excited about having them in Illinois. I am      not excited about having them in Oklahoma.  What would happen is, anyplace where they would be detained in the United States would be a magnet to terrorist activity. But I hope I will have a chance to talk about that.                             Climate Change  The next thing would be on some of the recent developments in what they used to call the global warming problem. Since we are in the fifth year of a cooling period, they are trying to change that to ``climate change.'' But this is something a lot of people in this body are pursuing.  I would say this: There are not the votes for a major tax increase. A cap and trade on carbon would now constitute somewhere between $350 and $400 billion each year as a tax increase, and it is something that would not accomplish anything.  In fact, if there are a few people still remaining out there who believe global warming is caused by carbon dioxide and we need to restrict it in some way, let's keep in mind, if we do something unilaterally in the United States of America, then what few manufacturing jobs we have left in this country are going to go to places where they can provide energy in places such as China and Mexico, where they have no restrictions on emissions on CO2.  So I would only say I hope we have time to talk about that.                                  TARP  The last thing is TARP, the program that started here. I was critical of the Bush administration back in October when then the Secretary of the Treasury came along and talked about, well, we have to have $700 billion to buy damaged assets. I looked at that thing and read it. There was nothing in there that compelled the Secretary of the Treasury or the President to use that $700 billion for anything. There is no accountability to Congress. It is unprecedented.  So I was criticizing the Bush administration, only to find out it was Tim Geithner, who is now the Secretary of the Treasury, who was behind this whole thing. He started the Bear Stearns problem. So I no longer criticize the Bush administration and Hank Paulson.  But, nonetheless, if you stop and think, it is so hard for me and for other people to envision what $1 trillion is or $100 billion is. The $700 billion, if you will do your math, you take the number of households who file tax returns and pay taxes and that is $5,000 per household. That is shocking when you tell people.  A lot of people who voted for that in the first place, in fact, 75 of the Senators who voted for that monstrosity back in October now are regretting that they did. Their comments are, well, they lied to us. They said that was going to be used for damaged assets.  They did lie to us. They flat lied. They never had any intention of using that money to buy damaged assets. Now, after they have bailed out several banks and put billions of dollars in banks, now they are saying, well, we need to buy damaged assets. Well, where were they when the problem was there?  I do want to talk about that and will be talking about that in a lot of detail as time goes by.                          ____________________
