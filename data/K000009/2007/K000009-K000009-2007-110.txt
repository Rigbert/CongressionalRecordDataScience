Speaker, the Wall Street Journal reported last week what most Americans may not realize, that for the first time in history, our U.S. military is now guarding the major Iraqi oil pipeline that leads to its major refinery in Bayji. Yes, our brave soldiers from the 82nd Airborne are now maintaining around-the-clock presence at Iraq's largest oil pipeline and refinery to fight the corruption, smuggling and sabotage that characterize Iraq's oil industry, its premier industry.  The article talks about the flourishing market in stolen Iraqi oil. It says U.S. military officials estimate that as much as 70 percent of the fuel processed at the plant is lost to the black market, an amount valued at more than $2 billion. Iraq's oil reserves may be the largest in the world. Future access to them is now being determined by a group of people we generally don't see on the evening news.  Do you know them? It's important to figure out who those people are and who exactly is now involved in writing Iraq's hydrocarbon law. How transparent are these oil deliberations?  Indeed, it is amazing how little we hear about them, as trillions of dollars are at stake. Meanwhile, oil smuggling has earned lots of shady characters hundreds of millions of dollars since the beginning of the war. Why did we let this go on? Until now, we can catch Saddam Hussein in the spider hole, and yet somehow we could not figure out who is smuggling Iraqi oil?  Americans deserve answers to so many questions. Who has been earning the money from the oil smuggling? Which global oil companies will benefit once the U.S. leaves Iraq? What percent of oil resources in Iraq will be left for the Iraqi people?  Traveling to Iraq and Kuwait a few weeks ago, I had the chance to witness how technology and power systems transformed endless deserts into oil supply lines. It is an awesome sight. Yet I couldn't help but ask, what is America doing in these deserts? Who does our oil addiction benefit? How have we let ourselves become tied to oil dictatorships? Why do we pay nearly $400 billion a year to import petroleum rather than become energy-independent ourselves here at home?  Our able colleague, Congressman Bill Delahunt of Massachusetts, gave me a book last week, and I looked on page 96. This is called ``The Price of Loyalty,'' by Ron Suskind. It explains how Donald Rumsfeld used our Defense Intelligence Agency to map Iraq's oil fields and lists companies that might be interested in leveraging the precious asset long before the Iraqi war was declared.  Judicial Watch obtained Mr. Rumsfeld's map through a Freedom of Information request because Mr. Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz would not share it voluntarily. Imagine that. Our taxpayers footed the bill for this map to benefit private firms.  The book attests Rumsfeld and his cohorts in the Bush administration were not concerned with legitimate reasons to go to war; they only concerned themselves with how and how quickly to penetrate Iraq's oil fields. Mr. Wolfowitz had written as early as 1999 that the United States should be committed, should be prepared to commit ground forces to protect a sanctuary in southern Iraq where the opposition could safely mobilize. As we pay dearly for this violent war, and our soldiers die in Iraq, just coincidentally we have to remember the world's largest untapped oil reserves are in Iraq.  Most other nations in the Middle East have guarded their oil reserves as national treasures, but I will tell you what: Halliburton, ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, ChevronTexaco and foreign companies like Total, Royal Dutch Shell and British Petroleum have been identified by reporters like Antonia Juhasz, who said last week in the New York Times, these oil companies would not have to invest their earnings in the Iraqi economy, partner with Iraqi companies, hire Iraqi workers or share their new technologies. In fact, she says, only 13 of the 80 oil wells, oil fields in Iraq would be for the Iraqi people. The other ones are being bargained away as the hydrocarbon law is written. Why do we hear so little about this on our evening news?  John Perkins, in his book ``Confessions of an Economic Hit Man,'' talks about how Saudi oil money through petrodollars has been reinvested in our economy, holding up so many of our equities and certainly our U.S. Treasury securities. Why can't America become energy-independent at home? Why do we have to be dependent to the 20th century view of dependency on foreign oil?  ``Almost immediately after the [1973 oil] embargo ended,'' Perkins writes, ``Washington began negotiating with the Saudis, offering them technical support, military hardware and training and an opportunity to bring their nation into the twentieth century, in exchange for petrodollars and, most importantly, assurances that there would never be another oil embargo.'' Congress did not negotiate this--the overall management and fiscal responsibility lay with the Department of the Treasury, and according to the book, the ensuing agreement, which was negotiated in intense secrecy, ``fortif[ied] the concept of mutual interdependence.'' The very goal of this agreement was to ``find ways that would assure that a large portion of petrodollars found their way back to the United States'' so that ``Saudi Arabia would bedrawn in, its economy would become increasingly intertwined with and dependent upon ours'' and, of course, we on them. It is a ridden economy.  Is this the America you want? Do you want U.S. soldiers risking their lives guarding Iraqi oil? I want an America free of counterproductive foreign entanglements. I want an America free of support for dictatorships, no matter how tempting their treasures. I want an America free of foreign oil. I want to invest our dollars here at home in energy independence--in solar, wind, hydrogen, clean coal, new turbine systems, fuel cells and so much more.  I think most Americans, if they understood the extent to which we are hurting ourselves, would want the same. Some global interests are getting so filthy rich year after year, that they would risk a free America for the sake of their bloodied oil profits. It's worth changing how we do business in order to regain our freedom.          [From the Wall Street Journal Europe, Mar. 15, 2007]                   Iraq's Oil Smugglers Are Targeted                         (By Yochi J. Dreazen)       Bayji, Iraq--Adding another facet to Washington's new      pacification plan for Iraq, U.S. and Iraqi forces have      launched an aggressive campaign to curb the oil smuggling      that is destabilizing the fragile Baghdad government and      helping to fund insurgents.       In concert with stepped-up military and reconstruction      initiatives across Iraq, U.S. troops for the first time are      maintaining a round-the-clock presence at the sprawling oil      refinery here, Iraq's largest. Soldiers from the Army's 82nd      Airborne Division are cracking down on illegal gas stations,      arresting refinery workers suspected of corruption and using      sophisticated data-sifting methods to identify which senior      Iraqi officials might have ties to black-market oil rings.       The Iraqi government, meanwhile, has begun what it calls      Operation Honest Hands, which puts the entire refinery under      Iraqi military control. Iraqi Army soldiers are physically      monitoring each of the facility's pumps and entrances,      assuming many of the responsibilities previously held by a      paramilitary security force employed by the Oil Ministry that      was widely considered corrupt and ineffectual. Iraqi troops      are also escorting many convoys of fuel trucks from the      refinery to destinations around the country.       The move represents another course change for the      administration of U.S. President George W. Bush as it      struggles to craft a new approach for stabilizing Iraq. U.S.      and Iraqi officials have long been aware of the flourishing      market in stolen Iraqi oil but largely turned a blind eye      because Washington feared that stationing American soldiers      in major refineries would spark a nationalist backlash and      renew accusations that the U.S. invaded Iraq for its oil. The      Iraqi government, meanwhile, felt its modest security      resources were better used directly fighting insurgents.       But officials from both governments have concluded recently      that oil smuggling had become too big a problem to ignore any      longer. The loss of so much output to the black market is      sharply reducing the Iraqi government's main source of      revenue: About 94% of Iraq's $32 billion budget last year      came from oil revenue. The stolen oil also gives Iraq's      insurgent groups a ready source of income, helping to      perpetuate the country's civil war.       ``Disrupting the insurgent funding is our main job,'' said      30-year-old Capt. Kwenton Kuhlman, who is leading the      antismuggling operation at the Bayji refinery. ``I'm under no      illusions--we can't stop it. It's too big. But we can try to      disrupt it.''       Iraq produces some 2 million barrels of oil a day, but U.S.      and Iraqi officials believe the figure could rise as high as      5 million barrels a day with improved security and new      infrastructure.       Former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein helped create the      black market in oil in response to economic sanctions imposed      in the wake of the 1990-91 Persian Gulf War. Mr. Hussein used      smuggling, as well as kickbacks on oil sold legitimately      through the United Nations' oil-for-food program, to generate      cash for his regime and to reward allies at home and abroad.       The stepped-up fight against smuggling has no guarantee of      success--and risks triggering more political and economic      turmoil. Senior Iraqi officials regularly pressure the      Americans to call off specific investigations or release      individuals detained for suspected involvement in the black      market, feeding Washington's suspicions that oil-related      corruption extends deep into the government.       The enormity of the task facing the soldiers from the 82nd      Airborne was evident on recent visits, and underscores the      broader challenge Americans face in turning more security      over to their Iraqi counterparts. Several tanker drivers said      Iraqi soldiers at the plant had already begun asking for      bribes. The drivers also said they don't want to be escorted      by Iraqi troops for fear of attracting insurgent attacks. ``I      want coalition forces to guard this place, not the Iraqi      Army,'' driver Suhaib Adil Kareem said. ``The Iraqis don't      care about the law.''       Widespread oil smuggling siphons off as much as $5 billion      per year. At the Bayji refinery--one of three in the country      [U.S. military officials estimate that as much as 70% of the      fuel processed at the plant is lost to the black market, an      amount valued at more than $2 billion per year.]       Iraq's parliament will soon debate a landmark petroleum law      that would clear the way for direct foreign investment in the      battered oil sector and set out rough guidelines for      distributing oil revenue among Iraq's 18 provinces. But U.S.      and Iraqi officials warn the new law will have little      substantive impact unless the smuggling is brought under      control.       The endemic oil-sector corruption is a financial boon to      insurgent operations. A classified U.S. government report in      November estimated Iraqi militants earn $25 million to $100      million every year by stealing tankers full of fuel,      smuggling oil to other countries, carrying out kidnappings      for ransom, and charging protection money from truckers and      gas station owners.       ``The fuel that is stolen comes back as bombs, mortar      shells and Katyusha rockets,'' said Hamad Hamoud al-Shakti,      the governor of the Salahaddin province, home to the Bayji      refinery.       The black market is fueled by three factors. Baghdad      heavily subsidizes gasoline and other oil products, and the      resulting low prices mean they can be resold at enormous      profit in neighboring countries. The government also doesn't      verify that gas-station owners--who are entitled to receive      100,000 liters of fuel per week--sell to retail customers      instead of on the black market.       The biggest issue, though, is pervasive corruption. U.S.      and Iraqi officials say refinery workers routinely allow      tankers to pick up fuel without any paperwork, which makes it      easy to sell off the books. Police officers demand bribes of      as much as $1,000 to let tankers pass through checkpoints or      for ``protection'' along routes, the officials say. And some      government officials work directly with smugglers or secretly      own gas stations and fuel trucks, giving them a share of      money earned through illicit sales, U.S. officials say.       ``You're talking about corruption at basically every      level,'' says Maj. Curtis Buzzard, the Harvard-educated      executive officer of the brigade conducting the interdiction      push. ``And it's deeply entrenched.''       As part of the campaign, the U.S. in coming months will      spend more than $12 million to install video cameras to      monitor the refinery's pumps and new digital scales to weigh      trucks, making it easier to see if truckers are carrying more      fuel than they were meant to receive. The money will also be      used to build parking lots designed to protect drivers from      extortion and insurgent attack.       Over the past few months, U.S. and Iraqi forces already      have quietly begun arresting officials suspected of playing      central roles in black-market rings. As far back as      September, Iraqi forces arrested Ibrahim Muslit, who ran the      Bayji refinery's oil-distribution operation, after he      allegedly allowed 33 tankers in a single day to receive fuel      without any paperwork. In January, U.S. troops arrested Ahmed      Ibrahim Hamad, a senior transportation official at the      refinery, after he allegedly tried to help smuggle out seven      tankers of heavy-fuel oil. Both men are in custody and      unavailable for comment.       Now, U.S. commanders say they are conducting investigations      of senior officials from the Bayji city council, the local      police force and the provincial and national governments. The      American officers say they have made about 40 arrests since      the crackdown began in earnest in early February, when the      Iraqis formally joined the campaign, and they hope to make      additional arrests in coming weeks.       During a surprise inspection of the refinery's gasoline and      diesel pumps one afternoon, Sgt. Stephen Truesdale noticed      that the analog display on one of the machines showed it had      pumped 4,000 liters more than the facility's handwritten      records indicated.       ``He helped steal 4,000 liters of gas,'' Sgt. Truesdale, a      former North Carolina police officer, said of the heavy-set      Iraqi man who had been manning the pump. ``The pumps don't      lie.''       The refinery worker insisted he was innocent, but Capt.      Kuhlman, the brigade leader, told his men they had enough      evidence to arrest him.       On the way back to their base, the U.S. forces saw a large      fuel truck parked on the side of the road, surrounded by      pickup trucks carrying overflowing oil barrels. The 18 Iraqis      at the site freely admitted they had purchased the fuel from      a tanker driver who had left the refinery a short time      earlier. The men said they made such purchases several times      a week and resold the oil to factory owners and other small      businesses in neighboring towns.       The American forces ordered the Iraqis to drive their      pickups back to the refinery, where the men were searched,      photographed and escorted onto a pair of open-backed military      vehicles for transport to holding cells at the U.S.      installation.       The following day, Capt. Kuhlman told a room full of      refinery officials and trucking-company executives about the      arrests. Shakir Hamid, a businessman who said his partner had      been kidnapped from the refinery months earlier, shook his      head.       ``In Saddam's time, oil smugglers were hung,'' he said.       ``And I release them after two days,'' Capt. Kuhlman      replied, shrugging his shoulders. ``But it's a start.''                                  ____       Beneath the surface was a battle O'Neill had seen brewing      since the NSC meeting on     January 30. It was Powell and his moderates at the State      Department versus hard-liners like Rumsfeld, Cheney, and      Wolfowitz, who were already planning the next war in Iraq and      the shape of a post-Saddam country.       Documents were being prepared by the Defense Intelligence      Agency, Rumsfeld's intelligence arm, mapping Iraq's oil      fields and exploration areas and listing companies that might      be interested in leveraging the precious asset.       One document, headed ``Foreign Suitors for Iraqi Oilfield      Contracts,'' lists companies from thirty countries--including      France, Germany, Russia, and the United Kingdom--their      specialties, bidding histories, and in some cases their      particular areas of interest. An attached document maps Iraq      with markings for ``supergiant oilfield,'' and ``other      oilfield,'' and ``earmarked for production sharing,'' while      demarking the largely undeveloped southwest of the country      into nine ``blocks'' to designate areas for future      exploration. The desire to ``dissuade'' countries from      engaging in ``asymmetrical challenges'' to the United      States--as Rumsfeld said in his January articulation of the      demonstrative value of a preemptive attack--matched with      plans for how the world's second largest oil reserve might be      divided among the world's contractors made for an      irresistible combination, O'Neill later said.       Already by February, the talk was mostly about logistics.      Not the why, but the how and how quickly. Rumsfeld, O'Neill      recalled, was focused on how an incident might cause      escalated tensions--like the shooting down of an American      plane in the regular engagements between U.S. fighters and      Iraqi antiaircraft batteries--and what U.S. responses to such      an occurrence might be. Wolfowitz was pushing for the arming      of Iraqi opposition groups and sending in U.S. troops to      support and defend their insurgency. He had written in      Foreign Affairs magazine in 1999 that ``the United States      should be prepared to commit ground forces to protect a      sanctuary in southern Iraq where the opposition could safely      mobilize.''                                  ____                [From the New York Times, Mar. 13, 2007]                        Whose Oil Is It, Anyway?                          (By Antonia Judasz)       Today more than three-quarters of the world's oil is owned      and controlled by governments. It wasn't always this way.       Until about 35 years ago, the world's oil was largely in      the hands of seven corporations based in the United States      and Europe. Those seven have since merged into four:      ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell and BP. They are among the world's      largest and most powerful financial empires. But ever since      they lost their exclusive control of the oil to the      governments, the companies have been trying to get it back.       Iraq's oil reserves--thought to be the second largest in      the world--have always been high on the corporate wish list.      In 1998, Kenneth Derr, then chief executive of Chevron, told      a San Francisco audience, ``Iraq possesses huge reserves of      oil and gas--reserves I'd love Chevron to have access to.''       A new oil law set to go before the Iraqi Parliament this      month would, if passed, go a long way toward helping the oil      companies achieve their goal. The Iraq hydrocarbon law would      take the majority of Iraq's oil out of the exclusive hands of      the Iraqi government and open it to international oil      companies for a generation or more.       In March 2001, the National Energy Policy Development Group      (better known as Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task      force), which included executives of America's largest energy      companies, recommended that the United States government      support initiatives by Middle Eastern countries ``to open up      areas of their energy sectors to foreign investment.'' One      invasion and a great deal of political engineering by the      Bush administration later, this is exactly what the proposed      Iraq oil law would achieve. It does so to the benefit of the      companies, but to the great detriment of Iraq's economy,      democracy and sovereignty.       Since the invasion of Iraq, the Bush administration has      been aggressive in shepherding the oil law toward passage. It      is one of the president's benchmarks for the government of      Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, a fact that Mr. Bush,      Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Gen. William Casey,      Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad and other administration      officials are publicly emphasizing with increasing urgency.       The administration has highlighted the law's revenue      sharing plan, under which the central government would      distribute oil revenues throughout the nation on a per capita      basis. But the benefits of this excellent proposal are      radically undercut by the law's many other provisions--these      allow much (if not most) of Iraq's oil revenues to flow out      of the country and into the pockets of international oil      companies.       The law would transform Iraq's oil industry from a      nationalized model closed to American oil companies except      for limited (although highly lucrative) marketing contracts,      into a commercial industry, all-but-privatized, that is fully      open to all international oil companies.       The Iraq National Oil Company would have exclusive control      of just 17 of Iraq's 80 known oil fields, leaving two-thirds      of known--and all of its as yet undiscovered--fields open to      foreign control.       The foreign companies would not have to invest their      earnings in the Iraqi economy, partner with Iraqi companies,      hire Iraqi workers or share new technologies. They could even      ride out Iraq's current ``instability'' by signing contracts      now, while the Iraqi government is at its weakest, and then      wait at least two years before even setting foot in the      country. The vast majority of Iraq's oil would then be left      underground for at least two years rather than being used for      the country's economic development.       The international oil companies could also be offered some      of the most corporate-friendly contracts in the world,      including what are called production sharing agreements.      These agreements are the oil industry's preferred model, but      are roundly rejected by all the top oil producing countries      in the Middle East because they grant long-term contracts (20      to 35 years in the case of Iraq's draft law) and greater      control, ownership and profits to the companies than other      models. In fact, they are used for only approximately 12      percent of the world's oil.       Iraq's neighbors Iran, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia maintain      nationalized oil systems and have outlawed foreign control      over oil development. They all hire international oil      companies as contractors to provide specific services as      needed, for a limited duration, and without giving the      foreign company any direct interest in the oil produced.       Iraqis may very well choose to use the expertise and      experience of international oil companies. They are most      likely to do so in a manner that best serves their own needs      if they are freed from the tremendous external pressure being      exercised by the Bush administration, the oil corporations--     and the presence of 140,000 members of the American military.       Iraq's five trade union federations, representing hundreds      of thousands of workers, released a statement opposing the      law and rejecting ``the handing of control over oil to      foreign companies, which would undermine the sovereignty of      the state and the dignity of the Iraqi people.'' They ask for      more time, less pressure and a chance at the democracy they      have been promised.                          ____________________
