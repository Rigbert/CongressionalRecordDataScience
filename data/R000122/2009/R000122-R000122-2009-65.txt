President, today I introduce, along with Senator Snowe and Senator Shaheen, the National Oilheat Research Alliance Reauthorization Act of 2009. Since its establishment in 2001, the National Oilheat Research Alliance, NORA, has been a helpful entity for consumers of home heating fuel.  As part of the Energy Act of 2000, Congress authorized the heating oil industry to conduct a referendum to create NORA and to permit a small fraction of the wholesale price of heating oil--2/10 of a cent per gallon--to be paid by oilheat wholesale distributors to fund industry-led research and development, energy conservation, safety, training, and consumer education initiatives.  Since that time, R&D funded in part by NORA has been responsible for gains in efficiency as well as improvement in equipment that run on biofuels. In my home state, the next generation of oilheat technicians is being taught using classes developed by NORA.  NORA's current authorization expires in February 2010. The bipartisan bill we are introducing today extends the authorization for another year to allow NORA to continue operating. This extension will give Congress time to complete a longer-term reauthorization that will make important reforms to NORA. It is essential that this extension be signed into law before the end of this year. Otherwise, NORA will be forced to start shutdown procedures in advance of the authorization lapsing.  Currently, the oilheat industry in 23 states and the District of Columbia--representing more than 8.5 million homes and businesses--participates in NORA. It is important that Congress act quickly on this bill to ensure that the benefits NORA creates for these families and businesses continue uninterrupted.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the bill printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1672       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``National Oilheat Research      Alliance Reauthorization Act of 2009''.     SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION.       Section 713 of the National Oilheat Research Alliance Act      of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 6201 note; Public Law 106-469) is amended      by striking ``the date that is 9 years after the date on      which the Alliance is established'' and inserting ``February      6, 2011''.                                 ______                                       By
