  Seattle, King County, and in fact the entire Pacific Northwest, lost one of our finest statesmen ever with his passing. Norm was known by everyone for his fairness and honesty. He was a thoughtful leader who helped guide our community through difficult times. Over the years, our community was rattled by the Wah Mee Massacre, the murder of the Goldmark family, and the Green River Cases. We all breathed easier knowing that Norm Maleng would handle the cases and that justice would be served.  To me, Norm Maleng was always the King County prosecutor. Norm held the position so long, and did his job so well, that it is hard for me to remember anyone else who held the job before him.  For all of us in public office, Norm was an icon. For me, despite our party differences, he was always a voice of reason and even-handedness. For everyone in King County, we knew that whatever issue came before him, he would handle it with integrity.  As an elected official, Norm Maleng was the best role model for all of us. He treated everyone equally and fairly. He approached every case and every challenge with wisdom and dignity. His voice will be missed. For me, he will always be the King County prosecutor.                          ____________________
