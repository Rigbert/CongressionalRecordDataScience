Speaker, I understand the adjournment resolution has arrived from the Senate, and I just want to advise not only my Members but all Members that there will be a vote following the next vote, which was scheduled to be the last vote, but because the adjournment resolution is now here, I want to advise my Members and obviously other Members as well. I've talked to Mr. Cantor, the leader, who has been helpful on this effort as well, that there will be another vote following this vote.                          ____________________
