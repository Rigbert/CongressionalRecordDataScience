President, today I introduce the Family Self-Sufficiency Act.  The Family Self Sufficiency, FSS, program is an existing employment and savings incentive initiative for families that have section 8 vouchers or live in public housing. The FSS program provides two key tools for its participants: first, it provides access to the resources and training that help participants pursue employment opportunities and meet financial goals, and second, it encourages FSS families to save by establishing an interest-bearing escrow account for them. Upon graduation from the FSS program, the family can use these savings to pay for job-related expenses, such as the purchase or maintenance of a car or for additional workforce training.  My legislation seeks to enhance the FSS program by streamlining the administration of this program, by broadening the supportive services that can be provided to a participant, and by extending the FSS program to tenants who live in privately-owned properties with project-based assistance.  First, to streamline the FSS program, my bill would combine the two separate FSS programs into one. Currently, HUD operates one FSS program for those families being served by the Housing Choice Voucher Program and another for those families being served by the Public Housing program, even though the core purpose of each FSS program, to increase economic independence and self-sufficiency, is the same for both. As a result, Public Housing Agencies, PHAs, have to operate essentially two programs to achieve the same goal. With my bill, PHAs would be relieved of this unnecessary burden.  Second, my legislation broadens the scope of the supportive services that may be offered to include attainmentof a GED, education in pursuit of a post-secondary degree or certification, and training in financial literacy. Providing families in need with affordable rental housing is critical, but coupling it with the support and services to help families get ahead is more effective. This legislation makes it easier for FSS participants to obtain the training necessary to secure employment and the education to make prudent financial decisions to better safeguard their earnings.  Lastly, this bill opens up the FSS program to families who live in privately-owned properties subsidized with project-based rental assistance. It shouldn't matter what kind of housing assistance a family gets, and families seeking to achieve self-sufficiency shouldn't be held back by this sort of technicality.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, which will help give those receiving housing assistance a better chance to build their skills and achieve economic independence.                                 ______                                       By
