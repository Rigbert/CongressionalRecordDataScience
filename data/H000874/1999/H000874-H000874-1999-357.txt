Speaker, I rise today to recognize one of Washington, D.C.'s most dependable and objective sources of news, WTOP Radio, which celebrates its 30th Anniversary today.  WTOP has always been a prime source of information on major news events. Their veteran news staff has covered historical events such as the Watergate scandal, the Vietnam War, the Persian Gulf War and the recent impeachment and Senate trial of President Clinton.  Throughout all of these turbulent times, WTOP has presented comprehensive, up to the minute coverage of events. In an era when some news outlets have diminished the amount of coverage devoted to political activity, WTOP remains committed to their format of bringing the latest developments on Capitol Hill to their listening audience. This, however, would not be possible without Dave McConnell, WTOP's Congressional correspondent.  Dave McConnell has been working with WTOP since 1965 and has been doing a daily broadcast called, ``Today on the Hill'' since 1981. With this show, Dave talks directly to members about issues and developments that are unfolding in Congress. I have had the privilege of working with Dave for almost twenty years. A native of Washington, D.C., he attended the University of Maryland and went on to cover Prince George's County and Maryland politics when I was the President of the State Senate. I have always found Dave to be a fair, dedicated and knowledgeable reporter. He does a great service to the people who depend on WTOP for their news.  WTOP serves a real need of the community, not only providing important political news, but also traffic, weather and sports. I know that all my colleagues join me to commend WTOP on 30 years of dedicated service to the community and wish them even greater success in the next 30 years.                          ____________________
