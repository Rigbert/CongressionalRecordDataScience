 Now, if I may clarify a few more points.  Section 3 of the bill broadly prohibits both individuals and persons engaged in a gambling business from placing, receiving, or otherwise making a bet or wager through the Internet or any other interactive computer service. Then, subsection (e) of that section grants two exceptions related to racing: one is an exception for wagers placed by persons physically present at a racetrack or parimutuel facility; a second exception is provided for persons placing, making, or receiving a parimutuel wager on a ``closed-loop subscriber-based service that is wholly intrastate.''  My first question is this. Am I correct in my analysis that S. 474 does not prohibit or restrict account wagering by telephone?
