President, I am pleased that the Senate today confirmed Victoria Espinel as the Nation's first intellectual property enforcement coordinator. This position was created by legislation that I introduced last year and is vital to protect the intellectual property interests of United States innovators and companies. Intellectual property rights promote innovation and creativity, and the protection of those rights is critical during this time of economic uncertainty.  Ms. Espinel is extremely well qualified to serve as the President's intellectual property enforcement coordinator. She has an extensive background in intellectual property issues, both foreign and domestic, and has experience in government and in the private sector. Ms. Espinel served in the Bush administration as the Assistant United States Trade Representative for Intellectual Property and Innovation. This is a nomination that deserves bipartisan support. American innovation and our intellectual property protection should not be a partisan issue.  The legislation by which we created this position took a comprehensive approach to intellectual property protection by providing Federal, State, and local law enforcement with the tools and resources they need to combat intellectual property theft. The legislation created an interagency advisory committee to develop a more efficient and cohesive approach to protecting American intellectual property. I am confident that Ms. Espinel will work well with that committee.  I look forward to working with Ms. Espinel to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our intellectual property enforcement efforts. I know her family, and was delighted to chair her confirmation hearing. I congratulate her on her Senate confirmation.                          ____________________
