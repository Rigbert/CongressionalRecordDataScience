I make a point, I have served in the House of Representatives where there is a Rules Committee that looks at every amendment and decides what is coming to the floor. In the Senate that was never the practice. We are trying to be extremely cooperative and transparent in what we are doing, going, we hope, the extra mile. I hope it is reciprocated so we can get to amendments and get to votes. That is how in the Senate amendments are decided, not by a committee putting them up or down for consideration, but by Members voting. I do not object.
