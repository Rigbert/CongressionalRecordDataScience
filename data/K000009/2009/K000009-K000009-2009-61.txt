Speaker, these are daunting times for communities in the Great Lake States. Our region's communities have served as production platforms for our Nation for generations--for the generations when America built a solid middle class. Our region did not simply trade wealth, as do Wall Street and other mega-banking centers. We made it.  Our Nation's economy and, frankly, our defense industrial base depend on production platforms such as the motor vehicle industry for jobs, for industrial might, and for real wealth creation for the Republic. One of every seven jobs in our country is tied to the motor vehicle industry. Over half of semiconductors are used in auto production, nearly half of the carpeting, as well as plastics, glass, metals, electric wiring, machine tools, and the list goes on.  In my district and throughout the industrial Midwest, the Big Three and their suppliers still form the bedrock of our economy. And although elite opinion makers try to deny it, the reality remains that as the motor vehicle and auto industry go, so goes the economy of the United States. And that economy isn't looking too good these days.  President Obama is correct in saying that we cannot and must not and will not let our auto industry vanish. Those of us in our Nation's heartland have always known that. America cannot lead the global economy unless it leads in the global auto and truck center. No modern industrial power has ever survived without a thriving domestic motor vehicle industry whose capabilities undergird its defense industrial base. Japan understands that. China understands that. India understands that. Germany understands that. Do we understand that?  Now, we can take a look at the severe challenges facing this industry today. The most important reason that this industry is facing difficulties at the moment is because of the credit crunch and the inability of Wall Street to reach Main Street despite billions, hundreds of billions of dollars put into the TARP that isn't working. Any sales-dependent industry, like the automotive industry, must have credit lines open to the dealerships and to consumers who want to buy those cars.  So that TARP bailout overrides everything else happening. We need to see it. Straightening out what is being done by the U.S. Treasury, aided and abetted by the somnambulant Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Securities Exchange Commission, is essential to righting our economic ship of state. And the failure of those agencies to monitor, let alone regulate, has created today's financial wreckage.  Mark-to-market accounting is killing more value inside this economy than the bailout can possibly replace. And as Treasury and Wall Street still fiddle, Main Streets across this country implode, including those where the automotive sector is predominant.  I am glad the President talked about the pain that is felt across our auto industry. Let me just say, look at the hands and the faces and the legs of autoworkers. They know their work is hard. The predicament we're in isn't their fault. It is a crisis of leadership, as the President has said, starting right here in this city.  Thomas Friedman, a writer, is wrong. He says the world is flat. Well, it's not. It has mountains and has huge valleys, and our auto industry has had to compete on a very unlevel playing field. Take this fact: over half the vehicles sold in this country actually come from other places in the world. In Japan's market, the second largest market in the world, only 3 percent of their cars come from any place else in the world.  Whose market is open? Whose market is closed?  Mr. Speaker, tax policy operates against this industry, and if we look at the number of cars, including the new Buick LaCrosse that was rated No. 1 by J.D. Power, we have an industry ready to compete. Let's give it a chance.                      Mom, Apple Pie, and Hyundai? The auto industry has been a bulwark of the American middle class. If             Wall Street warrants a bailout, why not Detroit?                            (By Pat Choate)       In those happy days of the 1950s, my friends and I      anxiously awaited the moment when the local auto dealers      began displaying their new car models. My uncle was a      Chrysler-Plymouth dealer, and we always began our tours      there. Then we would go from one showroom to another,      collecting the brochures, sitting behind the wheels of the      new Corvettes, Chrysler 300s, Plymouth Sport Furies, and      Thunderbirds, opening the hoods and admiring the powerful      engines. Rare was the teenager of that era who did not know      the specifications of virtually every model produced by      General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler.       ``Car people'' such as Lee Iacocca, then at Ford, were in      charge of America's Big Three automakers. They loved their      cars as much as their customers did. The carmakers and their      suppliers produced an ever changing set of engines,      transmissions, accessories, and gadgets that made buying a      car a family treat unlike any other. So many different types      of hubcaps were produced that there were hubcap stores in all      the major cities. In Texas, stealing them was a state pastime      for teenaged boys.       The differentiated line of cars produced by General Motors      was also a measure of social and economic status. A Chevrolet      was for those starting out. A Cadillac was for those who had      arrived. Pontiacs, Oldsmobiles, and Buicks were stop-offs for      those on the way up or down. A jump from a Chevrolet to a      Buick was an event noticed and commented upon by neighbors as      a measure of success--or of someone acting above himself.       In that postwar period, Americans were on the go, and      though Charlie Wilson was ridiculed for commenting, ``What's      good for General Motors is good for America,'' he was right.      The Great Depression and World War II were memories, people      had well-paying jobs, credit was easy, and a new car could be      bought with a small downpayment. GM and the auto industry      were a major part of the economy and an important contributor      to that prosperity.       The Big Three autos, coupled with the construction of the      42,500 mile Interstate Highway System and the establisment of      a vast network of safe and inexpensive motels such as Holiday      Inns, opened the continent for inexpensive family vacations.      Dinah Shore's perky signature song captures the essence of      America's love affair with its cars: ``See the USA in your      Chevrolet. America is asking you to call. America is the      greatest land of all.''       But success bred complacency and hubris in the industry. By      the mid-1960s and early 1970s, management of the Big Three      had shifted from the car people to ``numbers guys,'' who were      more interested in squeezing every possible penny of profit      from the vehicles. To avoid costly worker strikes, Big Three      management made major concessions to labor on pensions,      healthcare, and vacations, costs it then passed on to      consumers. Meanwhile, quality slipped. Designs were      unimaginative. Buyers would ask whether a car was produced on      a Monday or Friday, fearing that either the workers were too      exhausted and hungover after the weekends to do a good job or      too anxious to leave on Friday to care.       By the late 1960s, the Big Three had become an easy target      for Japanese and European competitors. In 1980, Chrysler      faced bankruptcy, and General Motors' management seriously      considered exiting the auto business altogether. As part of      that strategy, GM bought Hughes Electronics and Ross Perot's      EDS.       Perot and the GM management quickly soured on each other.      He wanted to manufacture the best cars in the world, and they      wanted to enter into businesses in which they were      inexperienced. One of the more interesting business lectures      captured by the Harvard Business School in its case studies      is Perot's speech to the GM board on the day he concluded his      sale of stock back to the company. He ticked off what he      thought was wrong with GM and what it needed to do to assure      its prosperity in the auto industry. The essence of his      message was to treat workers well, be innovative, settle for      nothing less than making the best cars in the world, and sell      them at the lowest possible price. His advice was ignored, of      course, and GM continued to lose position in its domestic      market.       Eventually, GM, Ford, and Chrysler's plodding efforts to      build better vehicles began to pay off in the early and mid-     1990s. Quality improved, styling began to matter once again,      and the Big Three produced the kinds of vehicles Americans      wanted--big, comfortable, powerful, and safe. Easy credit and      cheap gas made owning the behemoths inexpensive, and Detroit      seized control of the market for full-size pickups, vans, and      SUVs.       A key moment for the Big Three and UAW came after their      signing of the 1996 labor contract. GM thought it had bought      three years of labor peace. But the union unexpectedly staged      a series of local strikes in facilities that produced      strategic parts, the shortage of which could stop all GM      production. These snap strikes closed GM for part of 1997 and      cost the company billions of dollars. For whatever advantage      the union may have gotten, its actions enraged GM management,      which accelerated its investment in duplicative plants in      other parts of the world, staffed with nonunion workers.       In 1999, GM spun Delphi, its parts division, into a new      corporation that entered Chapter 11 reorganization in 2005.      The UAW contract was broken, and the workers were left with      $14 per hour jobs, no healthcare, and no defined-benefit      pensions. President Lyndon Johnson was once asked if half a      loaf of bread was better than none. He replied, ``A slice is      better than none.'' The Delphi workers got a slice.       Over the past two decades, each of the Big Three has been      through extensive management changes, downsizing, and      layoffs. Chrysler even became part of the German company      Daimler, which could not make the acquisition profitable and      eventually sold 80 percent of its interest to Cerberus, a      private investment fund.       It is difficult to teach an elephant to waltz, but it can      be done. While the Big Three have been slow to change, they      have adapted well enough that they still hold half the U.S.      market share. It is an amazing turnaround.       Consider quality. In 2007, Ford won 102 quality awards,      including AutoPacific's Best in Class for three models and      Germany's largest auto magazine's Auto 1 of Europe Award for      its S-MAX. Forbes awarded the 2008 Chrysler 300 ``the      highest-quality car in the near-luxury category'' over the      Audi A4, BMW 3 Series, Lexus IS, and Mercedes-Benz C Class.      Of the 15 global finalists for the 2008 Motor Trend Car of      the Year Award, the Big Three manufactured nine, the Japanese      four, and the Europeans two. The 2008 winner was GM's      Cadillac CTS, which Motor Trend described as ``proof that      Detroit can still build a world-class sedan.''       As for innovation, General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler      invest almost $12 billion annually on R&D, making them a      major source of technology development. In 2007, the U.S.      Patent and Trademark Office granted these three corporations      1,030 patents.       James E. Malackowski, CEO of Ocean Tomo LLC, a merchant      bank that specializes in intellectual property products and      services, recently compared four of the green, clean, and      energy efficient patent portfolios held by the Top 15 global      automakers--emission control, catalytic converters, and      related chemistry; fuel cells; hybrid/electric vehicles,      mostly motor and battery innovation; and emerging related      technologies, including solar, wind, and other green      inventions.       GM has higher average quality and newer green technology      and patents than the other 14 auto manufacturers combined.      Together with Ford it holds approximately one-third of all      green-technology patents and the related value. Moreover, GM      has 70 percent of the patents in the emerging-technology      category. This domestic share increases to 85 percent if Ford      is added. Finally, Ford owns 30 percent of all patents with a      similar related-value measure in emission-control innovation.      These Big Three technologies have great potential for      stimulating overall U.S. economic and job growth and creating      a greener and more fuel-efficient world.       There is much of value to be saved in this vital industry,      but relief has been slow in coming. When Wall Street      recklessly gambled with borrowed monies and lost, federal aid      was characterized as a ``bailout.'' The present auto crisis      was created by powerful economic forces, many beyond      Detroit's control. Federal efforts to save the U.S. auto      industry would constitute a ``rescue.''       The primary causes of the current U.S. auto-industry crisis      are threefold: a financial freeze in which even well-     qualified borrowers are denied credit to buy vehicles;      fluctuating oil prices that have driven the price of gasoline      from less than $2 per gallon to more than $4 and then back to      $2, all in less than 10 months; and a consumer panic that has      cut retail sales to 15-year lows.       The failure of the U.S. Treasury Department and Securities      and Exchange Commission to monitor, let alone regulate, Wall      Street has created today's financial wreckage and the      resulting consumer panic. And despite the obvious need for a      far-sighted energy policy, the last four presidents and      Congress have done little but encourage more drilling.       The longer-term inability of America's auto industry to      export competitive products has its origins in U.S. trade      policies that accept closed foreign auto markets and the      payments of massive export rebates by other governments to      their automakers. How can U.S. automakers be expected to      compete in a world where German producers get a 19 percent      export subsidy on every vehicle sold in the United States,      China undervalues its currency by up to 50 percent, Japan      keeps its auto market tightly closed, and the U.S. government      allows South Korean automakers to sell more than 700,000      subsidized vehicles in this market annually, but tolerates      Korea's restriction of U.S. imports so tightly that fewer      than 7,000 American-made vehicles are sold there each year?      The Big Three and the UAW are not at fault for these      distortions of competition.       The three overarching questions that President-elect Obama      and the 111th Congress face are: what will happen if the Big      Three are not saved, how much will it cost, and what is the      best way to execute the rescue?       As to the first question, federal inaction would be costly      and destructive in ways America has not experienced since the      Great Depression. The Center for Automotive Research--     appropriately, CAR--projects that a 100 percent closedown of      the Big Three auto producers would result in the loss of      almost 3 million U.S. jobs in the first year. The majority of      those losses would be Main Street jobs distributed across the      country that depend on spending by the Big Three--steel,      glass, and rubber producers and the 20,000 dealers, who are      major purchasers of advertising in local newspapers, radio,      television, and other small business services provided by      lawyers, accountants, real estate contractors, and      landscapers.       A 50 percent reduction in the Big Three's operations would      be almost as costly. CAR estimates that 2.47 million jobs      would be lost in the first year, 1.5 would still be unfilled      in year two, and slightly more than 1 million in year three.      The lost revenues from either scenario would devastate      federal, state, and local budgets, creating further economic      upheavals. CAR estimates that a 100 percent shutdown would      cost $156 billion in lost tax receipts and increased transfer      payments. A 50 percent shutdown would cost $108 billion.       Job loss is only part of the risk. The U.S. defense      industrial base would be greatly weakened if the Big Three      failed. The collection of machine tools, robots, production      lines, and skilled workers of the auto industry gives the      United States the capacity to shift quickly from domestic      production to the manufacture of tanks, airplanes, and other      war materiel as happened in World Wars I and II. The foreign      auto transplants are not a substitute, for they are mostly      facilities for putting together kits manufactured abroad.       As for the cost of the auto rescue, it is impossible to      estimate the final number. Certainly, $38 billion for an      operational bridge loan is too little and will require      supplements. GM alone has a cash-burn rate of $2 billion per      month, and will use its portion of the first loans within      months. Yet the earliest that GM says that it can produce its      new line of vehicles is 2010. Inevitably, the automakers will      be back for more, much like the banks and insurance      companies.       As CAR has documented, however, the costs of inaction will      also be great. Its estimates of a collapse, moreover, do not      include the costs of shifting more than $100 billion of Big      Three pension liabilities to the Pension Benefit Guaranty      Corporation, which is currently operating with a $10 billion      deficit. Only about a quarter to a third of the Obama      administration's proposed stimulus of massive investment      infrastructure expenditures will be felt in 2009, half in      2010, and the remainder thereafter. As presently defined, it      will have little effect on the Big Three.       They need more sales now. The fastest and surest way to      stimulate such activity is for the federal government to give      a massive one-to-three-year tax deduction for sales of U.S.      vehicles with a high U.S. or North American content, such as      70 percent. This     would help clear the dealer backlog and immediately put      people to work. It also would allow taxpayers to get great      bargains on new vehicles.       Some have suggested that Chapter 11 is the only viable      option for the Big Three. But it would create an economic      avalanche in which dozens, if not hundreds, of suppliers and      dealers would be forced into bankruptcy. No institution other      than the federal government is now able to provide the      billions of dollars necessary for the industry to operate      during reorganization. And at the very moment that these auto      giants need to act quickly and be flexible, they would be      constrained by a federal judge and trustees to get approval      for even the most basic decisions. Those who advocate      bankruptcy need only look at the cumbersome and costly Delphi      experience, which is now in its fourth year.       But rescuing the American auto industry will require more      than vast sums of public monies. Basic policy changes in      trade and tax laws are essential. One of the most difficult,      but unavoidable, challenges will be to end the Value Added      Tax discrimination faced by the Big Three in both their      domestic and foreign markets. Soon after World War II ended,      U.S. trade negotiators agreed to allow the rebate of Value      Added Taxes on their exports and the imposition of VAT      equivalents on their imports of U.S. goods and services.      Europe was rebuilt decades ago, but 153 nations now have a      VAT, and its average rate is 15.5 percent. Japan has a 5      percent VAT, China's is 17 percent, Germany's is 19      percent, and France imposes 19.6 percent. The economic      consequences to the Big Three and other U.S.-based      manufacturers have been devastating.       When a German automaker exports a vehicle into the U.S.      that costs $50,000, for instance, it receives from the German      government a 19 percent VAT export rebate, worth about      $9,500. But when one of the Big Three exports a $50,000      vehicle to Germany, it must pay the German government a 19      percent, $9,500 VAT-equivalent tax at the dock. Thus the Big      Three products are price disadvantaged in both markets.      Moreover, these discriminatory VAT rules provide a powerful      incentive to outsource production from the United States. In      the Tokyo, Uruguay, and Doha trade negotiations, the U.S.      Congress instructed American trade negotiators to eliminate      this tax disadvantage, but other governments refused to      discuss the issue.       In addition to pressing for the adoption of new global      trade rules to end VAT discrimination against U.S.      manufacturers, the incoming administration should focus on      eliminating the many protectionist national tariff and non-     tariff trade barriers crippling the Big Three. India, for      example, imposes a 100 percent tariff on imported U.S.      vehicles. China's tariff rate is 25 percent. Korea has long-     run national anti-import campaigns that include targeting for      tax audits anyone who buys a foreign car. Unless foreign      economic protectionism is confronted immediately and at the      highest levels of the U.S. government, the American auto      industry cannot survive.       Three other principles are essential to the rescue. First,      taxpayers should receive substantial equity in these      ventures, plus long-term warrants, whose purchase price is      set at today's stock values. After all, we are taking the      risk. When any public loans are repaid, the terms and      conditions should require a sale of those stocks, hopefully      at a substantial public profit. Taxpayers made almost a 30      percent profit on the Chrysler loans three decades ago.       Second, demands for a reduction in worker pay should be      eschewed. The UAW and its members have already made massive      wage and benefit concessions in recent negotiations. Delphi      is only one example. Almost a century ago, Henry Ford paid      his workers a then unheard of $5 per day so they could buy      the products they were making, and the auto industry led the      way in creating an American middle class. This rescue should      not undermine broader efforts to provide secure jobs and      benefits, nor should it allow the pitting of well-paid      American workers against the penny-wage labor of other      countries.       Without question, the UAW has often been smug, arrogant,      and inflexible. But rather than punishing it by requiring      reduction in its members' pay, we should expect the union to      contribute to the rescue. It should enter into a no-strike      agreement until the federal loans are paid and invest its $1      billion ``rainy day'' reserve, commonly called its ``strike      fund,'' in the preferred stock of the Big Three until the      loans are satisfied. The rainy day has come, and if taxpayers      are putting up money to save UAW jobs, so should the union.       While U.S. antitrust laws allowed the UAW to target one      company at a time, those same laws prevented the Big Three      from negotiating together on an industry-wide contract. Any      rescue should permit the Big Three and UAW to negotiate an      industry wage and benefit package.       Third, executive pay at the Big Three should be capped at      some simple multiple of the average annual pay of Big Three      workers, such as 10 or 15 to 1, with any bonuses being      provided in corporate stock, at least until any federal loans      are paid off. Also, the Big Three executive pension funds      should be required to have at least a majority of its capital      invested in Big Three stock. The goal, of course, is to      create a common incentive for labor and management to work      together.       As of mid-November 2008, the U.S. Treasury and the Federal      Reserve had advanced $2 trillion to salvage the financial      wreck created by Wall Street. In late November, the FDIC      announced that it was ready to loan another $1.4 trillion to      stabilize the banks. The Bush administration and Congress      seem to have no limits to their concern about Wall Street.       The Big Three automakers, their suppliers, and dealers are      on Main Street. They employ millions of workers and provide      essential goods for American consumers. If the Big Three      fail, an economic tsunami will quickly roll across the United      States, destroying jobs, incomes, and national confidence at      historic levels. The challenges faced by the new      administration at that point would be similar not to those      faced by Franklin Roosevelt, but to those that confronted      Herbert Hoover in the first years of the Great Depression.       In this instance, what is good for General Motors is good      for America.                          ____________________
