Madam Speaker, I am proud to sponsor the Fostering Success in Education Act. This legislation is the House companion to Senator Franken and Senator Murray's bill and lays out a clear road map to assisting young people in the child welfare system.  This legislation continues the efforts of the P.L. 110-351, Fostering Connections Act by improving educational assistance for those most in need--children and youth in the child welfare system. I hope that the Fostering Success in Education Act will enjoy the same bipartisan support and consideration to help these young people who have no one else.  Today, more than half a million children are living in foster care. As a member of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support, I have constantly heard from young people who struggle as they are constantly moved from home to home, and school to school when they are in foster care. Those in the child welfare system have not chosen this life; they did not ask to be victims of neglect and abuse. For a variety of reasons beyond their control, foster care children are uprooted from all that they know and rely on us for help.  We all remember our years in elementary, middle, and high school. We recall our friends, classmates, teachers, extracurricular activities, favorite classes, and hardest subjects. For foster care youth, it's a whirlwind of memories. Names, faces, classes, teachers, grades, and subjects are a blur. Imagine being the new kid, over and over and over again without the support you need. Imagine maneuvering the bureaucracy and politics of different schools and school districts on your own as a 12-year-old, as a 16-year-old, as a 6-year-old. This bill ensures that youth in foster care have school stability, immediate access to tools and resources, and the necessary support for academic success.  Madam Speaker, I believe that each and every young person has a right to a childhood; each has a right to a basic education. I believe that in addition to consistency, friendships, and healthy relationships, education is the key to opportunity, stability, and success. It is a cornerstone of our nation's values of democracy, hope, and infinite possibility.  The Fostering Success in Education Act takes us one step further in the right direction and responds to these all-too-real issues. Madam Speaker, I hope all of my colleagues will support this worthy and important legislative effort.                          ____________________
