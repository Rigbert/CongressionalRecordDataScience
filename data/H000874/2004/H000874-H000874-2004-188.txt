Speaker, there will be some Members who will speak on behalf of this bill, but I have not talked to one of them that thought this was a good bill. They think there are provisions in this bill, as the chairman said, that have not been considered for some time, and they are voting for that provision. Not one Member have I talked to on this side of the aisle or that thinks this is a good bill.                              {time}  1315
