President, I join with my colleagues in submitting this resolution condemning the subsidized sale of European barley into the California barley market.  Today several of us met with the European Union Ambassador, Mr. Hugo Paemon, to express our extreme concern about this shipment and about the future it bodes for the trade relationship between the United States and the European Union. Quite frankly, Mr. President, I think that we were heard but I am not sure, in the American vernacular, that Mr. Paemon quite ``gets it.''  Mr. President, I want to suggest that whether this is just a skirmish, or whether it is the first battle in what many believe could become a rapidly escalating conflict over trade in agricultural goods, for barley producers in Oregon and across America, there has been no more serious matter in the past decade.  My language is strong, Mr. President, because it is very important that Senators understand that if this shipment proceeds it sets an extremely dangerous precedent for our agricultural trade practices.  There is a very real concern in Oregon that if we allow this shipment of grain, the shipment of which would simply not be possible without an extraordinary level of European Union subsidy, then we will have opened the door to further shipments that could have devastating effects on our domestic commodity prices.  For my colleagues who have not yet heard about this issue, a shipment of European Union barley, at a restitution subsidy rate of $51 per metric ton, that was originally targeted into the Saudi Arabian market was not sold. In search of a buyer, this shipment was subsequently sold into the California feed barley market at a price well below the then-current market price.  Mr. President, the United States is the world's largest producer of feed grains and the world's largest exporter of feed grains. Were this European barley not subsidized at half of its value, we would not be having this discussion because there is no way it could have been priced competitively with domestic feed barley.  I met this weekend with barley producers in Klamath Falls, Oregon. These folks are already seeing very tough barley prices this season, down about $5 a metric ton from what they have normally received over the decade. They are taking some hits as a consequence of our national policy through the Farm bill of phasing out income maintenance programs. And now the European Union is sending us a heavily subsidized shipment that is causing collapse of the market. Enough is enough.  This European Union shipment, because it has the capacity to flood the California market for the next 9 months, has caused prices to drop $10 per ton in one week. One individual who operates a grain elevator in the Klamath described telling a local producer that he had lost some $20,000 in 48 hours as a result of this dumping of this subsidized barley into California.  These farmers ask, correctly, that if ever there was a time for the federal government to come to the defense of American agriculture, now is that time. We face collapse of our American barley market because of this relatively unique occurrence; now is the time to go to the mat in defense of our producers against wholly subsidized foreign dumping.  Mr. President, we should also recognize, and thank, the larger wholesalers of barley in California who passed up this sale, which to them represented I'm sure a very lucrative marketing opportunity. These companies understood the damage that the sale would do to their customers and most reliable suppliers, the U.S. barley producers. But surely if this sale is allowed to go forward, and other fire sales are allowed to follow, those firms will no longer be able to afford that posture.  Mr. President, as a supporter of free trade, and of providing fast track authority, if we are to retain our credibility with American farmers then we must show the ability to act forcefully when faced with these sorts of irritants to free trade. There is no precedent for this sale, and if we allow it to go forward then those of us who believe in the promise of freer trade will have some difficulty explaining to our farmers that greater trade freedom is in their best interest.  Mr. President, It is very important to all Oregon producers that the U.S. Senate act quickly to respond to this unprecedented attack on one segment of our agriculture industry. I urge the swift adoption of this resolution.                          ____________________
