Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this very irresponsible amendment. We often debate the proper roles and responsibilities of the Federal Government, but I thought we all agreed that Congress exists in large part to provide for our national security.  This amendment strikes at the heart of our country's defense. If we pull support from the National Ignition Facility, we would cripple our nuclear weapons stockpile, the cornerstone of our national defense.  NIF is the only facility that can create the extreme temperature and pressure conditions that exist in exploding nuclear weapons. Without NIF, we would lose our ability to fully understand the operations of our arsenal.  NIF is also the only facility that can create fusion ignition-and-burn in the laboratory. Without NIF, we would not be able to access and certify the aging nuclear stockpile unless we renew underground testing.  Do not just take my word for it. The head of the National Nuclear Security Administration in DOE has said that, without NIF, we will need to begin underground tests once again.  We need to ensure that our weapons are safe and that they will work. NIF gives us this assurance. Stand up for the defense of our Nation. I urge my colleagues to vote against this ill-advised amendment.
