Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the Kennedy amendment. I say to the gentleman, ``Shame on you, Mr. Kennedy.''  Mr. Chairman, this would cause a loss of $250 million of receipts to the Treasury, and these figures are the Treasury figures, a loss of $60 million in revenue for sharing of counties and schools around these areas, a loss of 15 jobs for every 1 million board feet not harvested, and, if we reduce it by 1 billion board feet, think how many jobs will be lost there, 25-percent reduction to the timber program which is already four times slower than it was 5 years ago.  Let us not kid ourselves. My friends, this amendment is to stop the total timber industry in the United States, especially in the States of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and California. This is what this is about.  I ask, ``Where else do you have 3,000 acres that don't have roads in it already?'' This is an attempt to stop all logging so we no longer have the opportunity to reduce a renewable resource.  That is why I say, ``Shame on you.'' This is a renewable source. This is not something that will not grow back. This is something that has to be done, and managed, and should be, and we are not cutting the timber we were 5 years ago, so I suggest respectfully this is a bad amendment, and I urge a ``no'' vote.
