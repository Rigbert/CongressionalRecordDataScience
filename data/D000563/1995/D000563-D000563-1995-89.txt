Chairman, I rise in support of the Skaggs amendment and opposed to the Istook language.  Why do the Gingrich Republicans fear free speech?  Six screwballs burned the American flag last year and these so-called conservatives want to amend the Bill of Rights for the first 5 in over 200 years.  Garrison Keillor needles them on public radio and these rightwingers run to eliminate public broadcasting.  And now this Istook proposal to muzzle political rhetoric for organizations he finds objectionable.  But these conservatives know full well that after all these voices are silenced their special interest friends, their big business buddies, will still be politically articulate.  Big business will have a bigger voice and the average American will lower their voice to conservatives supposedly committed to strict construction of the Constitution.
