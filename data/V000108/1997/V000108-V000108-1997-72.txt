Speaker, it is truly my pleasure to rise today to congratulate Mr. Adam James on winning the 1997 Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States and its Ladies Auxiliary Voice of Democracy broadcast script writing contest for Indiana. A resident of Hobart, IN, Adam is one of 54 high school students Nation wide to win a college scholarship for his script on the topic, ``Democracy--Above and Beyond.''  The Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States and its Ladies Auxiliary is now in its 50th year of sponsorship for the Voice of Democracy audio-essay scholarship competition. The program requires high school student entrants to write and record a 3- to 5-minute essay on an announced patriotic theme. Adam James was sponsored by VFW Post 5365 and its Ladies Auxiliary in Hobart, IN. He was named the recipient of the $1,000 Department of Arizona and Auxiliary Harry A. Kosht Memorial Scholarship Award earlier this year. A junior at Hobart High School, Adam aspires to pursue a career in law.  Adam's winning broadcast script reads as follows:       Living in the United States, the one thing that I cherish      is democracy. Waking every morning and not donning this cloak      of freedom is a notion I cannot fathom. Many Americans,      myself included, often take our freedom for granted. We treat      it as a right instead of the privilege that it is.      Fortunately for us, in our democratic society, freedom is a      right.       I wish that I could praise my ancestors for providing me      with freedom, but I cannot. I am not related to any of the      soldiers who fought or played a part in the American      Revolution. My father's family were immigrants who came here      in the 1800s. My mother's side of the family came to the      states after World War II.       Although they did not fight for America's freedom, my      grandparents on my mother's side are subjects of a story that      truly demonstrates what democracy is. My grandfather Nikola      was a leader of a European underground movement against the      Communist government. He used to tell stories about having to      carry a semi-automatic pistol with his whenever he took my      grandmother on a date. In fact, on the day he died, three      years ago, he was still wanted dead or alive in the former      Yugoslavia. In the 1940s, my grandfather was fighting against      his government when Adolf Hitler invaded Eastern Europe.      Being a high-ranking soldier, my grandfather knew that Hitler      would imprison him, so he and my grandmother packed up their      few possessions and escaped. They made it back on foot to      middle Italy, where they were captured by German soldiers and      placed in a work camp. Held as prisoners there, they slaved      until the United Nations freed Europe from the grasp of the      demoniacal Hitler. After the war, my grandparents were put in      a detention camp, where my mother was born. Later, they moved      to America, settled in the Midwest, and my grandfather became      a steelworker. Here they bought a home and raised five      children.       This is what makes democracy what it is. In their former      country, my grandparents had to hide to prevent being killed      and would     have been lucky to live to the age of thirty. In America,      they had a choice of how they wanted to live their life, and      how they wished to raise a family. Few countries of this      world would allow this to happen. Many countries claim to be      democratic but impose laws similar to those of a third world      dictatorship. If these and all other countries had a      government like the one in the United States, the world would      not carry the burden of wars, both civil and global. These      disputes claim thousands of lives and ruin the families of      those who die. Besides wars, millions of people die each year      from starvation because of dictators withholding food from      the poor citizens. If these people lived in the United      States, they would still be alive today.       A democracy has many benefits for its citizens. Those who      live in a democratic system are allowed to make choices that      those in a communist or socialist society are not allowed to      make. We are allowed to choose what career to pursue, and the      amount of education we need in order to train for this      career. Communist societies choose careers for their people      at an early age and force them to endure the government's      choice. Even if the people are successful with this venture,      they cannot keep all profits made. These governments take all      money earned by their subjects, then dole out an equal amount      to each of them.       Although this provides a proverbial safety net for people,      this monotonous equality cannot make for an enjoyable life.      Under the quilt of democracy, people are allowed to choose      their livelihood. People are allowed to strive to be better      and not worry about giving extra earnings to the government.      Democratic societies are fertile fields of hopes and      aspirations.       Democracy is a way of life that all people should respect,      although some people do not. I often become angry when I see      images of people burning American flags or building militias      against our government. I cannot comprehend how anyone could      disagree with the concept of democracy. Then I have to stop      and think of why this angers me. These people are just      expressing themselves as our democracy allows them to do.      This ability to express ourselves freely is what makes      democracy so great. Burning the symbol of freedom that      thousands of men have given their lives for is ignorant and      wholly disrespectful, but these people are entitled to their      opinion in a country such as America. The human mind has no      boundaries in democracy. People can choose to do what they      please, even if it is disrespecting the very idea that allows      them to be free. This is what first attracted my grandfather      to this great country. I am proud to live in a country where      democracy is the type of government practiced.       Mr. Speaker, I would like to once again extend my most      heartfelt congratulations to Mr. Adam James on his receipt of      the Veterans of Foreign Wars and its Ladies Auxiliary ``Voice      of Democracy'' national scholarship. His parents, Doug and      Zagorka James, can be proud of their son for the tenacity he      has displayed in achieving this most noteworthy      accomplishment. This young man has a promising future ahead      of him, which will undoubtedly include improving the quality      of life in Indiana's First Congressional District.                               ____________________
