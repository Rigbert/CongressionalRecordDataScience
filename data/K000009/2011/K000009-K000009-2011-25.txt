And I wanted to follow on something you said.  This is actually a chart which shows our trade deficit with China. Like your community, our communities are just loaded with goods that are coming in here from China. And if we just look back at the last decade, the enormous rise in those goods on our shelves, when you really put the math of it on a chart, it looks like an avalanche. It is just crowding all this money--in 2010, over $273 billion of hard-earned American money was actually used to purchase Chinese goods, and that money then went back to, not the United States, but to China.  And you think about the displacement of production in this country, for everything from tableware to sometimes food products now, and I had an experience over the weekend because I like to work with small businesses, and I ran into a woman who was blending coffee, she's called a master roaster, and her product is called Bea's Blends, Bea's Blends from Toledo, Ohio.  And she was asking me, I want to expand my company but I need a very small loan, and I don't want to go into debt and, oh, gosh, what should I do next? And I told her I would try to put her in touch with the Small Business Administration.  But it was really, when you said the optimism that you have, I'm meeting companies all the time that are inventing new products--incidentally very good products--and trying to counter this trend of more imports versus our exports. And her product is a product that can be sold locally, it can be sold interstate, and ultimately it can be sold internationally because it's vacuum packed.  And I was thinking about the creativity of this individual American trying to make it in a very tough economy. And then a couple of days later I was over at a coffee shop in Lakewood, Ohio, and I happened to tell the owner of that shop--also a woman--that I had met this master roaster. And she said to me, well, you know, Congresswoman, it's interesting you should say that. I'm trying to bring together all these master roasters across the coast.  I said, gosh, we have coastal roasters or roaster coastals? But the point was people were thinking, they were creative, they were bringing something new to the market, beautifully labeled, an excellent product, and trying to counter these trends.  And because small business is located in our communities, it's interesting to look at the last several years as well, which conform to the rise of Chinese imports and other imports into our country. And look at the distribution of income of people in our country. And what's happening is what the American people obviously know, which is why we need to maintain the payroll tax holiday and to make those in the top 1 percent pay their fair share.  The divergence between people who are in the lower income spectrum and the upper has just exploded. It is just that before, those who had much and those who had just enough and those who had little were not so far apart. But the gap has just widened to a level where the American people know something is fundamentally wrong, and that the ship of State is very out of balance, and that somehow we have to begin to make sure that all boats are lifted in this society and not just some boats get lifted.  And we know that job creation, business growth, business startups, business expansion of American-made products are essential; products that can be exported, that can help to close the trade gap but also then begin to narrow the income gap that we see as we allow more income to be earned by those who are in the middle class and who are in some of the categories of income where they're stretching just to make it every day, every week, to put enough food on the table.  This is really almost un-American. This looks more like an old, stratified society from times past that was very, very undemocratic, places where we wouldn't want to live, the kinds of places that our relatives fled because they couldn't get enough to eat, because they didn't have a chance to earn a fair day's wage.                              {time}  1820  We are joined this evening by Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee from the great State of Texas, such a hardworking and able Member who is such a voice for citizens across our country and our world every day.  We thank you so much for joining us this evening.
