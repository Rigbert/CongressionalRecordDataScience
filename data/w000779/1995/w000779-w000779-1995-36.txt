Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Dingell] and the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Markey] for their many courtesies shown to me with respect to the provisions I am going to discuss, and also the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Fields] and the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Bliley], who have been exceptionally patient.  I take this floor first to talk as the father of two young computer literate children who use the Internet. As a parent, I and other parents want to make sure that our youngsters do not get access to the kind of smut and pornography and offensive material that we now see so often on the Internet.  Tomorrow, the gentleman from California [Mr. Cox] and I, who have worked together in a bipartisan way, will offer an amendment based on a very simple premise. Our view is that the private sector is in the best position to guard the portals of cyberspace and to protect our children. In the U.S, Senate, they have somehow come up with the idea that our country should have a Federal Internet censorship army designed to try to police what comes over the Internet.  I would say to our colleagues, and, again, the gentleman from California [Mr. Cox] and I have worked very closely together, that this idea of a Federal Internet censorship army would make the keystone cops look like Cracker Jack crime fighters. I look forward, along with Mr. Cox, to discussing this more in detail with our colleagues tomorrow.  Second, Mr. Chairman, and very briefly, I would like to discuss an issue of enormous importance to westerners, and that is the problem with service in the U S West service territory. We learned today, for example, that there has been a 47 percent increase in delayed new service orders in the west. These are problems with waits for phone repairs, busy signals at the business offices, inaccurate information provided by company customer representatives.  An amendment I was able to offer, with again the help of the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Dingell], the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Fields], and the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Bliley], stipulates that local telephone companies have to meet certain service conditions as a factor prior to entering the long-distance market. This is a measure that will be of enormous benefit in the fastest growing part of our country, the U S West service territory.  Mr. Chairman, I want to thank our colleagues and the leadership on both sides for their patience.  Mr. Chairman, as telecommunications companies enter new fields, we must ensure current customers are not discarded and left without basic phone needs. The drive to streamline and downsize has subjected local telephone customers in my region of the country to poor customer service.  During Commerce Committee consideration of this legislation, I added a provision dealing with customer service standards. My amendment is in section 244 of the bill which outlines the conditions that local telephone companies must meet prior to entering the long distance market. My amendment will give state utility commissions additional leverage to pressure the local phone companies to meet established customer service standards and requirements.  Local telephone customers complain vociferously about long waits for telephone repairs, busy signals at business offices, and inaccurate information provided by company customer representatives.  Just today, the Associated Press ran a story detailing customer service woes in the Pacific Northwest. According to the story, delayed new-service orders have increased 47 percent just this year. Across the West, more than 3,500 orders for new telephone service have been delayed in excess of 30 days. I ask that several articles addressing this situation be printed in the Record. Additionally, I submit a letter from Oregon Public Utilities Commissioner Joan Smith be included for the Record.               [From the Associated Press, Aug. 2, 1995]      Utility Regulators Question Held Orders--Consolidation Link                            (By Sandy Shore)       Denver.-- U S West Communications Inc.'s delayed new-     service orders have increased 47 percent this year, and      utility regulators blame it partially on the company's      consolidated engineering operations.       Joan H. Smith, chairwoman of the utility Regional Oversight      Committee, said her panel identified two common problems      contributing to the delays.       ``The committee speculates that it is the removal of      engineers from each state and the current centralization of      engineering services in Denver that are causing the      problems,'' she said in a June 9 letter to Scott McClellan of      U S West.       U S West spokesman Dave Banks said the consolidation did      not cause the problems.       ``The intent of going through the re-engineering effort is      to do just the opposite of what regulators might be saying,''      he said. ``I think the problem is more of a result of the      fact that we haven't been able to complete our re-engineering      process in total yet.''       For more than a year, U S West has battled customer-service      problems, ranging from persistent busy signals at business      offices to delays of months and, in some cases years, in      filing new-service orders.       The company has said the problems were caused by      unprecedented growth in the Rockies, which occurred as it      launched a re-engineering program to consolidate work      centers, cut jobs and upgrade equipment.       As part of that re-engineering, U S West last month opened      the Network Reliability Center in Littleton, which houses      employees and equipment needed to monitor the 14-state      telephone network.       In a June 30 letter to Smith, Mary E. Olson, a U S West      vice president in network infrastructure, said the major      cause of engineering delays has been the company's inability      to readily access updated records on the network plant.       The company hopes to complete mechanization of that      information by year-end, she said.       When the consolidation occurred, Olson said many engineers      declined to transfer, which caused some delays, but the      center is 95 percent staffed.       At the end of June, U S West had 3,588 held orders new-     service requests delayed more than 30 days. That compared      with 4,406 at the end of June 1994; 1,797 in January and      2,443 in March.       The largest increase occurred in Utah, where held orders      reached      422 at the end of June, up from 197 in June 1994. Increases      also were reported in Idaho, Minnesota, Nebraska, Utah and      Washington.       Held orders decreased in Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Montana,      New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota and Wyoming.       U S West exceeded its company goal of answering within 20      seconds at least 80 percent of the calls to residential      telephone service office. It answered within 20 seconds 75.5      percent of the calls for residential repairs; 79.9 percent of      for business repairs; and 72 percent to business service      offices.       The regulators also have seen an increase in delayed repair      orders and an increase in consumer complaints across U S      West's 14-state region.       ``Held orders are the biggest problems,'' said Montana      regulator Bob Rowe. ``Some of the problems concerning access      to the customer-service centers have seen some real      improvements.''       Banks of U S West said, ``We're not exactly where we want      to be, but again, June is a much busier season for us.'' The      numbers ``are basically going to be higher in the summer      months because we have much more demand for service,'' he      said.       U S West spokesman Duane Cooke the company has scheduled      250 major construction projects in Utah this year and      increased its capital improvement project to nearly $100      million to offset the problems.       It is kind of ironic because the re-engineering process      designed to improve customer service in the short-term has      aggravated the situation,'' he said. ``But, now we're      starting to see the benefits of re-engineering.''       For example, the consolidated engineering group can      complete work on a major construction project in three months      to four months, compared with a year to 18 months previously.                                                                    ____                             Oregon Public Utility Commission,                                         Salem, OR, July 19, 1995.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     U.S. House of Representatives, Longworth Office Building,          Washington, DC.     Re H.R. 1555 [Quality of Service].       I write to you about H.R. 1555, the telecommunications      deregulation bill, as a member of the Regional Oversight      Committee (ROC) for U S WEST. Representing a state served by      U S WEST, you should be aware of the effect H.R. 1555 may      have on the quality of Oregon's phone service. I urge your      support for stronger service quality protections, as      suggested below.       The ROC was formed as a result of state regulatory concerns      about affiliated interest transactions and cross-subsidy      issues arising out of the Modification of Final Judgment      (MFJ) that divided the nationwide telecommunications monopoly      into separate regional companies. The ROC assists state      commissions to perform their duties through positive, open      relationships in a cooperative process. Since its creation,      the ROC has identified other regulatory issues of mutual      interest to state regulators, including privacy, competition,      and service quality.       The prolonged deterioration in U S WEST's service quality      and the opportunity to strengthen the language in H.R. 1555      related to service quality prompted me to write to you.      Declines in service quality have occurred because U S WEST      (and other RBOCs) have reduced and reassigned staff.      Technical staff needed to maintain service quality were      centralized. Total staffing was reduced. The result has been      a marked increase in consumer complaints and unacceptable      delays for consumers trying to obtain service.       Currently, H.R. 1555 specifically allows states to consider      compliance with state service quality standards or      requirements when reviewing statements from local exchange      carriers (LEC) that they are in compliance with requirements      set forth in Section 242 of the bill. State Commissions      appreciate the inclusion of service quality considerations in      the bill. However, the particular section in which service      quality considerations currently reside lacks enforcement      mechanisms. Disapproval of a statement submitted by a LEC,      whether the disapproval is issued by a state or by the FCC,      carries with it no penalty.       In contrast, enforcement authority with respect to many of      the same conditions under Section 245 (Bell operating company      entry into interLATA services), allows for three enforcement      mechanisms that can be used by the FCC: an order to correct      the deficiency, a penalty that may be imposed, or possible      revocation of the company's authority to offer interLATA      services.       From our work, we know that service quality is especially      important to customers. States need clear authority, with a      means of enforcement, over service quality issues in order to      be effective.       The Senate bill (S. 652) allows states to require      improvements in service quality of Tier 1 carriers (which      would include RBOCs) as part of a plan for an alternative      form of regulation, when rate of return regulation is      eliminated. The Senate bill lists many possible features of a      state ``alternative form of regulation'' plan that would      provide ongoing consumer protection from potential adverse      effects of the change in the way companies are regulated. The      language of the Senate bill could easily be included in H.R.      1555 by changing the existing Section 3 to Section 4, and      including the Senate language as a new Section 3. (See      attachment.) I support this modification.       I urge your support for such an amendment.       We sent this to the House delegation.                                                    Joan H. Smith,                                                         Chairman.                    Proposed Amendment to H.R. 1555       Including the attached language in H.R. 1555 would make it      clear that states have the authority to respond to local      conditions and take action to protect consumers when      necessary. The plan for an alternative form of regulation      could include penalties for failure to meet service quality      standards. While the transition to a full competitive      marketplace for telecommunications services is a goal that we      all share, consumer protection in the present is an important      consideration that should not be ignored in our enthusiasm      for the future.       (3) THE NEW REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT       (A) In instituting the price flexibility required in this      section the Commission and the States shall establish      alternative forms of regulation that do not include      regulation of the rate of return earned by such carrier as      part of a plan that provides for any or all of the      following--       (i) the advancement of competition in the provision of      telecommunications services;       (ii) improvement in productivity;       (iii) improvements in service quality;       (iv) measures to ensure customers of non-competitive      services do not bear the risks associated with the provision      of competitive services;       (v) enhanced telecommunications services for educational      institutions; or       (vi) any other measures Commission or a State, as      appropriate, determines to be in the public interest.       (B) The Commission or a State, as appropriate, may apply      such alternative forms of regulation to any      telecommunications carrier that is subject to rate of return      regulation under this Act.       (C) Any such alternative form of regulation--       (i) shall be consistent with the objectives of preserving      and advancing universal service, guaranteeing high quality      service, ensuring just, reasonable, and affordable rates, and      encouraging economic efficiency; and       (ii) shall meet such other criteria as the Commission or a      State, as appropriate, finds to be consistent with the public      interest, convenience, and necessity.       (D) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Commission,      for interstate services, and the States, for intrastate      services, from considering the profitability of      telecommunications carriers when using alternative forms of      regulation other than rate of return regulation (including      price regulation and incentive regulation) to ensure that      regulated rates are just and reasonable.
