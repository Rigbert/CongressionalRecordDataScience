 President, as we all know, the Senate voted unanimously last night to proceed to the FAA bill, despite the fact, as the majority leader indicated, at the time we voted, we had not yet received the Senate substitute. We did have a chance to receive it overnight and will now review it before proceeding. We can talk again after the respective policy lunches, at midday today, about that. It is my expectation when we do get on the bill that we, indeed, allow amendments. The majority leader has indicated that is his intention. Many on our side would like to offer amendments and there will be debate on this bill.  I would also like to point out that while the FAA is an important agency, the No. 1 issue for Americans right now, and their greater concern, is the price of gas at the pump. The price of gasoline has jumped by more than $1.25 a gallon since the beginning of the current Congress. The cost of oil has nearly tripled to $120 a barrel now. According to the AAA, the average price of a gallon of gas in Kentucky is $3.58, the highest ever. I was happy to read the majority has tasked their chairman to come up with ideas to work on this issue, but I fear the answer that comes back will be the same two-word prescription that has been offered in the past--higher taxes.  But higher taxes will only raise the price at the pump, not lower it. So while we move forward on the FAA bill, the Senate should not forget what Americans are most concerned about, the dramatic increase in pain at the pump over the last year. We should be able to stipulate at the outset that raising taxes as a way of addressing the problem is not even worth serious consideration.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
