 How can anyone possibly render due diligence and oversight if they don't know what is being presented nor have access to what is being presented to the Commission on which they make their judgments?  I have spoken four times now about Miguel Estrada and the general state of the nominations process. I regret where these weeks have taken us, frankly. I hope we can come together to overcome what is increasingly separating the two sides of this great body, marring judgments and actions relating to the Judiciary Committee's hearing process and that process through which we advise and consent on nominees by the President to Federal judgeships.  In order to understand this filibuster over Miguel Estrada, we also have to understand what has led us to this point.  I would like to speak specifically to the nominations debate because this is a key area where the administration has, with few exceptions, acted in many ways as if the Senate simply doesn't matter. If this debate were only about whether or not we should vote on Miguel Estrada, that would be enough. Make no mistake about it.  There are serious questions about this nominee that we can't answer without more information, information that this nominee and the administration have essentially refused to provide.  My colleagues and I have outlined these concerns over and over again over the past few weeks. I have pointed out that the District of Columbia Circuit is a very critical circuit. Every Member of this body knows that and accepts it. It is a circuit that presides over many of the areas of appeal that are of extraordinary concern because they involve laws we have passed in areas such as worker rights, OSHA, Superfund, wetlands, all environmental concerns, and so on and so forth. It has assumed a particular role, if you will, because of the fact that two of President Clinton's nominees to this circuit never had a committee vote--one did not even have a hearing--this is a different kind of filibuster. So there are a number of vacancies on this circuit. And the circuit as it stands is equally divided, Republicans and Democrats equally divided. Therefore, who breaks this equal division is really important because it will swing the court one way or another.  Into this mix comes a very young man, 41 years old. When his nomination came over, it came over with substantial concerns. The Hispanic delegation of the House had sat down and met with Mr. Estrada for an hour and a half. They sent out alerts that they did not believe this was a nominee who really represented the concerns of Hispanic citizens. That in itself is not dispositive. I am the first one to admit that.  This is a young man. He spent a lot of time on his education. It is not necessarily a requirement that someone serve on a number of civic groups. But it was a point.  Immediately, the Hispanic-American community indicated that there was a great and serious split over this nominee. That in itself is not, again, dispositive.  Then we note that he had never been a professor. He had never been a judge. He has no writings and no speeches. So when one turned to look for the due diligence, there was very little to see. We have none of his work product or other memos that would give us an idea of what kind of thinker he is or what kind of judge he would be. And he refused to answer in the public hearing a number of simple, basic questions that go to the heart of whether he could be a truly impartial judge and set aside his advocacy. I mentioned on the floor of the Senate that my office had spoken with Professor Paul Bender, who had been his direct supervisor in the Solicitor General's Office. Mr. Bender told my staff, ``Well, I could not give him certain assignments because I could not be assured that he was impartial.''  This, again, in itself is not dispositive, but it is a danger signal.  I talked to individuals who had been interviewed by him in a screening capacity when he was a clerk for Justice Kennedy, and each I talked to indicated that in fact there was a kind of litmus test and that they were told they were too liberal.  Again, that is not dispositive. But what all this points out is that we needed--some of us--to find out whether this was a man who could put aside his advocacy, his strong feelings about certain issues, and follow the law with impartial and wise judgments.  I came to the conclusion--and some have faulted me for it--after listening to Jeffrey Sutton, that here was a man who had strong views and beliefs, but who was willing to be very fulsome in his answers to the committee, very forthright in his views, and sent a very clear signal--at least to me--that he would, in fact, separate his personal views and the law that he would be charged and constitutionally pledged to uphold. So I voted for him.  There has been substantial dismay expressed by many of my constituents in California, and I heard them loud and clear when they picketed virtually every one of my offices. Nonetheless, I made that judgment after listening in a public hearing to questions and answers and, at least for myself, came to a conclusion. Only history will tell whether I am right or wrong.  Then, several weeks ago, in a markup in committee, I think another aspect of this situation that perhaps was caused by the strain and the raw nerve endings in the Senate came upon the scene.  The Judiciary Committee rules contain a clause providing ``on the request of any member, a nomination or a bill on the agenda of a committee will be held over until the next meeting of the committee, or for one week, whichever occurs later.'' That appears in the rules of the committee.  I ask unanimous consent that those rules be printed in the Record, and I particularly call attention to the rule I have just quoted.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                Rules of the Committee on the Judiciary                      i. meetings of the committee       1. Meetings may be called by the Chairman as he may deem      necessary on 3 days' notice or in the alternative with the      consent of the Ranking Minority Member or pursuant to the      provision of Sec. 133(a) of the Legislative Reorganization      Act of 1946, as amended.       2. Each witness who is to appear before the Committee or      any Subcommittee shall file with the Committee, at least 48      hours in advance of the hearing, a written statement of his      testimony in as many copies as the Chairman of the Committee      or Subcommittee prescribes.       3. On the request of any member, a nomination or bill on      the agenda of the Committee will be held over until the next      meeting of the Committee or for one week, whichever occurs      later.                              ii. quorums       1. Nine members shall constitute a quorum of the Committee      when reporting a bill or nomination; provided that proxies      shall not be counted in making a quorum.       2. For the purpose of taking sworn testimony, a quorum of      the Committee and each Subcommittee thereof, now or hereafter      appointed, shall consist of one Senator.                              iii. proxies       When a record vote is taken in the Committee or any bill,      resolution, amendment, or any other question, a quorum being      present, a member who is unable to attend the meeting may      submit his vote by proxy, in writing or by telephone, or      through personal instructions. A proxy must be specific with      respect to the matters it addresses.                    iv. bringing a matter to a vote       The Chairman shall entertain a non-debatable motion to      bring a matter before the Committee to a vote. If there is      objection to bring the matter to a vote without further      debate, a rollcall vote of the Committee shall be taken, and      debate shall be terminated if the motion to bring the matter      to a vote without further debate passes with ten votes in the      affirmative, one of which must be cast by the Minority.                            v. subcommittees       1. Any member of the Committee may sit with any      Subcommittee during its hearings or any other meeting, but      shall not have the authority to vote on any matter before the      Subcommittee unless he is a member of such Subcommittee.       2. Subcommittees shall be considered de novo whenever there      is a change in the Subcommittee chairmanship, and seniority      on the particular Subcommittee shall not necessarily apply.       3. Except for matters retained at the full Committee,      matters shall be referred to the     appropriate Subcommittee or Subcommittees by the Chairman,      except as agreed by a majority vote of the Committee or by      the agreement of the Chairman and the Ranking Minority      Member.
