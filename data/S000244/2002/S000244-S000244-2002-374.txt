 Madam Speaker, I would like to respond to two of the points that have come up during this debate, first with respect to the comments on section 245(i) made by the distinguished gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee). The House of Representatives has passed 245(i) legislation twice, once in May of last year and once in March of this year. The second passage of the 245(i) legislation was coupled with the same visa security and Border Patrol legislation that we are discussing here today.                              {time}  1815  The Senate, however, chose to pick this bill without 245(i), without the other bill which had 245(i) in it. That is why we are debating a 245(i)-less bill today. So the decision to hold up 245(i) this time does not rest with the House of Representatives, but, unfortunately, with the other body.  Secondly, with respect to the comments on student visa tracking made by the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Gekas), he is absolutely right on that, but I would like to amplify the point that he made with one other fact.  Much was said about the fact that Mohammed Atta and one of the other September 11 hijackers had their student visas approved by the INS 6months after they died flying planes into the Twin Towers in New York City. But the really shocking statistic was not that, it was the fact that the student visas were approved 13 months after these two terrorists graduated from flight school. The purpose for which the student visas were applied for had been fulfilled, and they should have left the country promptly after their course of study was concluded. They did not, and the rest is history, and over 3,000 people died as a result of that.  What this legislation does is that it provides a student visa tracking system so if someone enters the United States on a student visa and either does not show up at school, drops out of school, gets kicked out of school, or graduates from school, then the INS will know about it and take the appropriate action to make sure that those students return to their home countries.  Had this type of a system proposed by this bill been up and functional on September 11, Mr. Atta and his conspirator would not have been in the United States to go to an American airport to hijack two American planes and to kill thousands of people.  That is why it is important that this bill be passed, so that future Attas who wish to exploit the weaknesses in our visa system and to abuse the hospitality that is extended to them by the American people at American institutions will no longer be able to do so. I urge the House to concur in the Senate amendments.
