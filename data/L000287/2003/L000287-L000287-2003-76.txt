Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I would say to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings), Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for what you are suggesting, your recommendation and your plan of action. It reminds me of another period in our history when we just got out there and did what we had to do.
