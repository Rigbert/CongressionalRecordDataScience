 Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Chairman, I would remind my friend that Chevron has stated that it could cut operating costs by a minimum of $30 to $40 million and extend its producing life, which would ultimately boost revenues.  Most importantly, Mr. Chairman, what we are talking about is that in this great country, the United States of America, there are millions of people who face cold in the wintertime. This is not a question of putting storm windows on; this is a question of maintaining a shred of dignity for low-income senior citizens who just do not have enough money to keep their homes warm and who are living in houses where all of the warmth is running out of deteriorating roofs and walls.  What kind of society are we when we cannot take care of and keep warm the weakest and most vulnerable amongst us? We are talking about $11 million, that is all we are talking about, to keep people warm in America, to keep people from dying in Chicago when the weather there goes above 100 degrees. I do not think that is asking too much.
