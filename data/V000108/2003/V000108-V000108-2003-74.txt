Speaker, it is with great sincerity and enthusiasm that I wish to congratulate a distinguished member of the First Congressional District of Indiana. Mr. Tom Higgins has been a fixture of the Northwest Indiana community since his radio career began in 1955. The Communicators of Northwest Indiana will deservedly honor him on Thursday, February 20, 2003 as a salute to his dedicated service, and to congratulate him on his retirement. Proceeds from the event will benefit the Scholarship Fund of the Communicators of Northwest Indiana.  Mr. Speaker, Tom Higgins carried a passion for broadcasting throughout his educational career at Indiana University, where he earned a degree in Radio Journalism in 1955. During this tine in Bloomington, Tom worked at WFIU as a news and scriptwriter, on-air personality, and news director. He also found an outlet for his talents at WTTS, where he hosted a weekly program. It was at Indiana University where Tom began to pursue his interest in radio and television journalism, and he was able to hone and perfect his talents while at this prestigious university.  After graduating from Indiana University, Tom began his broadcasting career at WLOI radio station in LaPorte, Indiana. After a tour in the military, he returned to Northwest Indiana in 1957 and began working at WWCA in Gary. Tom not only blessed the citizens of Gary with his talents, but he also worked part time at WAKE in Valparaiso, Indiana, eventually calling football games for Valparaiso University. He later returned full time to WWCA, where he used his talents in various positions, including announcer, air personality, producer, and station manager, until July 1983. During his tenure at WWCA, Tom developed a four station network to expand an existing live radio show named ``Third Tuesday'', which aired with a live audience, orchestra, and notable guests, for two years.  Mr. Speaker, station managers in Northwest Indiana recognized the talent that Tom possessed for broadcasting in radio and, because of this strong background, provided him an opportunity to pursue a television career in 1967. He served as the play-by-play announcer for the regional telecast of the Indiana State High School Basketball Tourney for six years. During his work for the Senior Little League World Series, Tom was given the opportunity to broadcast games that were featured in Delaware, California, Aruba, and Taiwan, as well as locally. He also worked as the play-by-play announcer for the Indiana All-Star football game in 1982.  In search of a new challenge, Tom joined the staff at Indiana University Northwest in Gary as the Director of Community Relations and development in 1984. He was eventually named the Director of Alumni Relations, a position he successfully held for sixteen years. During that time, Tom was quickly asked to return to the broadcasting business. He worked part time at WWJY-FM in Crown Point, and later tackled the additional responsibility of co-anchor of a new television news hour at WYIN. Tom recalls an extensive period of time where he would work the morning shift at WWJY, direct the Alumni Affairs office during the workday, and co-host the Indiana Nightly Report each day. It is this work ethic and dedication on which the people of Northwest Indiana pride themselves, and it allowed Tom to achieve the success that he has enjoyed.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating Mr. Tom Higgins for an outstanding career, not only in broadcast journalism, but in service to his community. Tom's leadership and passion for his career are to be commended, and his professional absence from the Northwest Indiana community will surely be missed.                          ____________________
