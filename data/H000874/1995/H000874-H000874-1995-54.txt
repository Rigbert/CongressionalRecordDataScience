Speaker, before the gentleman yields back his time, my point was that historically, in many instances, what we do is we go to special orders while we wait for the negotiations or other items to go on. If special orders concludes and there is still a reason that the majority would want to stay here pending negotiations, or perhaps come back to the floor to do additional legislative business, to have that time filled up by Members on both sides of the aisle going back and forth who want to do special orders.                              {time}  1445  My question was a legitimate question, since as we do have Members who had signed up to do special orders, whether or not they might accomplish that objective within the time frame that we are waiting for the negotiations or other decisions to be made by the leadership.
