'  It is a fitting tribute to name the building that houses the Department of Education after President Lyndon B. Johnson. Under his watch, over 60 education bills were signed into law, several of which changed the face of education in America.  One such bill enacted by President Johnson is the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. For the first time, Federal funds were explicitly directed to elementary and secondary public schools. These funds have improved the quality of education received by millions of students over the past 42 years.  President Johnson soon followed this measure with the Higher Education Act of 1965. This legislation made a college education possible for millions of Americans by creating the Federal student aid program.  Additionally, the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 contained the provisions creating the Head Start Program, which has put generations of preschool-age children on the path of learning and success. Head Start gives children the foundation they need in order to be successful in school in the future.  As President Johnson himself once said, ``Poverty must not be a bar to learning and learning must offer an escape from poverty.'' By opening the doors of education to millions of Americans, President Johnson improved countless lives and put the American dream within the reach of many.  I thank Congressman Green for bringing this bill to the floor so that we all may recognize the contributions of President Johnson to this Nation and to our educational system.
