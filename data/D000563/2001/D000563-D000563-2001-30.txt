Our Governor has given consent to thisplan to move forward on the airport, and we are memorializing that consent in this agreement.  I would like to ask the Senator from Texas, who said that the language of this amendment somehow--at one point he said--threatens safety and lives and at another point calls it a harmless limitation, could I just refer the Senator from Texas to the part that says: The Secretary of Transportation shall ``encourage a locally developed plan.'' That is the operative language. That is the only condition.
