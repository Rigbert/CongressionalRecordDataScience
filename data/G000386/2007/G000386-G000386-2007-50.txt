 President, I am pleased we are finally discussing solutions to the alternative minimum tax problem that is poised to swallow 19 million more filers this year. I would have rather gone through this process several months ago but better late than never.  Over the course of the year, I have given many speeches analyzing the AMT and describing the problem it poses for middle-class taxpayers in great detail. On February 12, I gave a speech on the history of the AMT. On February 13, I highlighted how the AMT affects individual income tax liabilities. On February 15, I discussed ways to reform the AMT and made the case that complete repeal is the best way to deal with the AMT.  Incidentally, I made the case that dealing with the alternative minimum tax 1 year at a time could be problematic, and current events have proven me right.  On March 20, I pointed out the Democrats' budget had no room for AMT relief, not even for 1 year. On March 22, I explained why we need to repeal the AMT. On April 18, I made an appeal for quick action on the AMT to help taxpayers making estimated payments who are already paying the price for the lack of action in Congress. On May 14, I explained why the AMT relief or repeal should not be paid for with a tax increase someplace else on other people. On May 17, I criticized the conference report on the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution for not realistically addressing the alternative minimum tax problem. On that same day, I gave another speech exposing how Democratic offsets to the AMT relief would result in massive tax increases on other people.  On June 13, I discussed the inadequacy of the lead trial balloons House Democrats were floating as possible fixes for the AMT. This was to mark the occasion of the second quarter estimated tax payments coming due because we had taxpayers who file quarterly already being hit by the lack of action on the part of the Congress.  On July 24, I introduced legislation to protect taxpayers who should have been making estimated payments for 2007 but weren't because they did not realize Congress was failing to protect them from the AMT. In other words, if they didn't have to pay the AMT in 2006, why would they think they had to pay the AMT in 2007? By not doing it, they were violating our tax laws, probably innocently.  On September 19, I marked the occasion of the third quarter estimated tax payments coming due by again discussing the AMT problem and how little congressional leadership was doing about it.  I just cited 12 speeches delivered on the Senate floor over the past year. That doesn't even include press conferences, Finance Committee meetings, and other events where I have talked about the need for repeal of the AMT or, in the case of a shorter term fix, just making sure it was fixed for this 1 year and kicking the can down the road. I have been talking about the alternative minimum tax literally all year now. House Democrats finally managed to introduce a bill on October 30, and the majority leader turned to it in the Senate right before the Thanksgiving recess. Democratic leadership cannot blame Republicans for their own failure to act until almost literally the last minute.  As I said, I am glad we are finally discussing solutions, and the Senate leadership seems to realize that the AMT should not be offset. I also want to thank my good friend, Chairman Baucus, for all his hard work this year,and for several years, to protect middle-income taxpayers from the alternative minimum tax. Chairman Baucus is doing our country a great service now by trying to work out a compromise between those who want to pay for the AMT relief and extenders with a tax increase and those who are opposed to tax increases to offset AMT. He has consistently, meaning chairman Baucus, avoided bitter partisanship and always worked to do the right thing.  Those obsessed with pay-go--and for the public watching, that is pay as you go--those who are obsessed with pay-go, who want to raise more taxes to pay for a tax that was never meant to raise revenue, are punishing the American taxpayers for their obsession. Unfortunately, right now, I cannot support a package with roughly $45 billion of offsets in it for the extenders, even though the AMT relief is not offset.  I am still reviewing some of the revenue raisers, but my issue is not with the raisers themselves. I will only support a raiser if I think it is good policy and will not support a raiser simply for the revenues.  I am concerned then if we send this package to the House, they will try to use the offsets not for what we put them in for, for the extenders, but send it back to us as offsets against the AMT, increasing taxes on others to pay for a tax that was never meant to be collected, and then still not get the extenders passed, as we should be passing them right now.  The House has shown it does not respect the need to get 60 votes in the Senate, and I do not expect that to change right now. If the majority leader is serious about reaching a compromise, and really respects the minority, as he claims, he needs to get his colleagues in the House on board. I have been around long enough not to make it too easy to stab me in the back by having things that even leadership in the House has suggested could happen with this tax ping-pong operation that might go on here.  It is unfortunate congressional leadership took so long to deal with the alternative minimum tax and that some are still putting an obsession with pay-go and narrow partisan interests over the wellbeing of their own constituents. We can talk until we are blue in the face, but the bottom line is we need to change the tax laws with respect to the alternative minimum tax. That law change needs congressional action and a Presidential signature, and anything else is just plain talk.  I would like to end this part of the remarks I am making today with a suggestion. I hope we get all parties to an agreement by changing the law on the AMT patch. By all parties, I am referring to House Democrats, House Republicans, Senate Democrats, Senate Republicans, and, of course, nothing is going to happen if the President can't sign it. Without an agreement, we will not get a law. And without a law change, this is what is going to happen: 23 million families face an unexpected tax increase that is going to average about $2,000 per family. Without a law change, we make worse the filing season fiasco for yet another 27 million families and individual taxpayers. That is on top of the 23 million who, for the first time, are being hit by the alternative minimum tax.  So here is my suggestion. It is simple. It is black and white. It is in a letter from Chairman Rangel and Chairman Baucus and ranking Republicans McCrery in the House and myself for the Republicans in the Senate Finance Committee. We are the senior tax-writing committee members from the Congress. That letter was dated October 31 this year assuring Treasury Secretary Paulson and Acting IRS Commissioner Stiff that we would work to pass an AMT patch bill expeditiously. That letter contains the test that ought to be applied to any proposal in substance and process on an AMT patch.  Let me remind you, this is a bipartisan letter by the most senior tax-writing Members of the Congress. And it starts with ``we,'' meaning Chairman Rangel, Chairman Baucus, and ranking Republican members, McCrery and Grassley. Here is what that sentence says:       We plan to do everything possible to enact AMT relief      legislation in a form mutually agreeable to the Congress and      the President before the end of the year.  That is the end of the quote, but I want to put emphasis within that quote on these words: Passing legislation in a form mutually agreeable to the Congress and to the President before the end of the year, meaning the end of 2007. Chairmen Rangel and Baucus and their ranking members made it clear in this letter.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the letter I have been referring to be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               Tax Writers Notify IRS of Upcoming AMT Fix  Finance Ways and Means leaders intend to prevent tax from affecting  more Americans, urge IRS to begin planning now for accurate tax forms       Washington, DC.--Leaders of the congressional tax writing      committees notified the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) today      of imminent changes to the alternative minimum tax, and      encouraged the agency to plan now to produce accurate tax      forms for the 2007 filing season. Senate Finance Committee      Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.), House Ways and Means Chairman      Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.), Finance Ranking Republican Chuck      Grassley (R-Iowa), and Ways and Means Ranking Republican      Member Jim McCrery (R-La.) sent a letter to Acting IRS      Commissioner Linda Stiff, indicating their intention to      complete legislation preventing the AMT from affecting any      additional American taxpayers for 2007. The AMT was      originally meant to ensure that wealthy Americans paid some      income tax, but without indexing for inflation it has begun      to affect middle-income American taxpayers.  The text of the Tuesday letter follows here.                                                 October 30, 2007.     Ms. Linda E. Stiff,     Acting Commissioner, Internal Revenue Service, Washington,          DC.       Dear Acting Commissioner Stiff: Under present law, more      than 23 million taxpayers will be subject to higher taxes in      2007 unless legislation is enacted to limit the reach of the      Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). We realize that this fact is      causing concern for many taxpayers and is creating      administrative difficulties for the IRS as the agency      prepares for the upcoming filing season.       As the leaders of the Congressional tax-writing committees,      we want to assure you that legislative relief is forthcoming      so that no new taxpayers will be subject to the AMT for      taxable year 2007. To accomplish this, we are committed to      extending and indexing the 2006 AMT patch with the goal of      ensuring that not one additional taxpayer faces higher taxes      in 2007 due to the onerous AMT. In addition to allowing the      personal credits against the AMT, the exemption amount for      2007 will be set at $44,350 for individuals and $66,250 for      married taxpayers filing jointly.       We plan to do everything possible to enact AMT relief      legislation in a form mutually agreeable to the Congress and      the President before the end of the year. We urge the      Internal Revenue Service to take all steps necessary to plan      for changes that would be made by the legislation.       Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.           Sincerely yours,     Max Baucus,       Chairman, Committee on Finance.     Charles E. Grassley,       Ranking Member, Committee on Finance.     Charles B. Rangel,       Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means.     Jim McCrery,       Ranking Member, Committee on Finance.
