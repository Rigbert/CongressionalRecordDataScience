 Chairman, this bipartisan amendment which is being introduced by the gentleman from New Hampshire [Mr. Bass] and myself does two important things that most Members of this body agree with.  First, it deals with the very serious problem of underfunded mandates, of forcing citizens in close to 2,000 counties in all 50 States to pay more in local property taxes than they should be paying because the Federal Government has fallen very far behind in its payment in lieu of taxes on federally owned lands. This amendment addresses this problem by increasing payments in lieu of taxes by $19 million, from $113.5 million to $132.5 million.  Mr. Chairman, I should add here that this amount is exactly the amount authorized for fiscal year 1995, when Congress passed the reauthorization for PILT in 1994. In other words, this amendment provides what the Congress promised cities and towns all over this country 3 years ago that we should be doing. We made a commitment, we should honor that commitment, and that is what this amendment does.  Mr. Chairman, the PILT program was established to address the fact that the Federal Government does not pay taxes on its own land.                              {time}  1745  These Federal lands can include national forests, national parks, fish and wildlife refuges, and land owned by theBureau of Land Management. Like property taxes, PILT payments are used to pay the school budgets, law enforcement, and other municipal expenses. Communities all over this country are upset by the lack of fairness that they are receiving from the Federal Government, which is why this amendment is endorsed by the National Association of Counties.  Mr. Chairman, despite an increase that was granted 3 years ago in the PILT authorization levels, the actual appropriations have been kept nearly level, resulting in a revenue shortfall to local communities in real terms. For fiscal year 1997, for example, local governments will receive only 60 to 70 percent of the payment level which was set in the authorization. This amendment would begin to address this unfunded mandate by increasing the payment in lieu of taxes program to where it was in real terms 10 years ago.  The formula by which payments in lieu of taxes are made is a complicated one, and each property is treated somewhat differently, but on average, on average, if this amendment passes, each local government would see a 17-percent increase in PILT money, and that is a significant advantage to thousands of communities all over this country.  Mr. Chairman, we have heard a great deal of discussion recently about evolution and our concerns for local communities and local government. It is high time that the Federal Government accepted its responsibility to do right by local communities.  Mr. Chairman, the $47.5 million that we are using for these purposes, in other words, deficit reduction and increasing PILT payments to local communities all over America, would be transferred from the Fossil Energy Research and Development Program. According to the report of the fiscal year 1997 budget resolution which passed the House last year, the Republican resolution, and let me quote from that, and I quote:       The Department of Energy has spent billions of dollars on      research and development since the oil crisis in 1973      triggered this activity. Returns on this investment have not      been cost effective, particularly for applied research and      development which industry has ample incentive to undertake.      Some of this activity is simply corporate welfare for the      oil, gas and utility industries. Much of it duplicates what      the industry is already doing. Some has gone to fund      technologies in which the market has low interest.  Mr. Chairman, these are not my words. These are the words from the report of the fiscal year 1997 budget resolution produced by the leadership of the Republican party. But obviously it is not only Republicans or conservatives who feel this way; progressives agree. Public Citizen has this to say about the Fossil Energy Research and Development Program, and I quote:       Fossil energy programs have received over $15 billion in      Federal funding since 1974. The fossil energy industry is      prosperous and mature, and it is not deserving of a      continuing large share of taxpayer support.  Mr. Chairman, the bottom line is, progressives and conservatives support this concept. I would urge Members from both sides of the aisle to vote for it.
