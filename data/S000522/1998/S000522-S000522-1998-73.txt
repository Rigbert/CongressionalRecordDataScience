Madam Speaker, 25 years after Roe v. Wade, I believe it is time for a serious reality check and a compassion check as well.  Supreme Court imposed abortion-on-demand in America has claimed the lives of more than 36 million boys and girls and, although grossly underreported, has resulted in death, injury, and emotional trauma to women.  It is time to come to grips with the truth and to ask the question why we seem to care so little about a whole generation of babies lost.  Abortion methods, Madam Speaker, are violence against children. Abortion methods dismember and chemically poison kids. There is absolutely nothing compassionate about dousing a baby with superconcentrated salt water or lethal injections into the baby's beating heart, or hacking the baby to pieces with surgical knives.                              {time}  1100  Why do so many of us live in denial concerning this pernicious violence against children?  Today, Planned Parenthood and the rest of the abortion lobby is asking the House to sustain a misguided veto so as to permit and empower abortionists to continue to murder children as they are being born. To legally sanction such an execution begs the question: Is there nothing the Congress or President will not embrace under the banner of ``choice''? Are the lives of little girls and boys so cheap?  Madam Speaker, earlier this month a 6-pound baby girl, ``Baby Phoenix'' as she is now called, was born with a skull fracture and lacerations on her face after an abortionist, Dr. John Biskind, unsuccessfully attempted to perform a partial-birth abortion on her 17-year-old mother. ``Baby Phoenix'' is the first known survivor of this brutal procedure.  It has taken years, and the deaths of thousands of children and at least two women, who he left to bleed to death, but Dr. Biskind now will not be allowed to continue his murderous ways. This week the State medical board voted to suspend his license. The irony is that it is not the deaths he caused that brought the board's disfavor, but the fact that a baby whom he was trying to kill actually survived and was delivered alive.  Madam Speaker, some on this floor, and in Dear Colleagues that have been sent out, suggest that the Hoyer-Greenwood proposal somehow will prohibit all late-term abortions. Nothing, I would say, is further from the truth.  Lest any of us be deceived, the Hoyer-Greenwood bill places no restriction whatever on late term abortions. While it is not on the floor today but it is being referred to in this debate as an alternative, the plain meaning of the language places no restriction whatsoever, not even symbolic limitations, on partial-birth abortions performed before an individual baby can be proven to be viable; that is, definitely able to survive if born prematurely. The vast majority of partial-birth abortions are performed in the 5th and 6th months of pregnancy, when the baby's lung development is not quite sufficient or barely sufficient to allow independent survival.  Second, even after the baby is demonstratively viable, the Hoyer-Greenwood bill would permit abortion by partial-birth abortion or any other method, if in the medical judgment of the attending physician, that is to say the abortionist, that the abortion is necessary to avert serious adverse health consequences to the woman.  In a March 12, 1997 press conference in the House Radio-TV gallery, which was tape-recorded, my good friend and colleague, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), was asked directly what the word health means in his proposal. The gentleman responded. ``It does include mental health. Yes, it does.''  He then went on to explain that mental health would include psychological trauma. Thus, unless my colleagues believe that it should be permissible to kill a baby, even during the final 3 months of pregnancy, a premature infant, for reasons of mental health or psychological trauma, they should not support H.R. 1032. And if my colleagues believe that it should not be permissible to pull a living baby feet first into the birth canal, puncture her skull and remove her brain in the 5th and 6th months, please vote to override the President's veto. Support the motion to override the President's misguided veto.
