 President, I yield myself a final 30 seconds to ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter in support of the amendment from the American Farm Bureau Federation.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                              American Farm Bureau Federation,                                    Washington, DC. July 13, 2000.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: Farm Bureau supports a proposed      amendment to add several key agricultural tax provisions to      H.R. 8, the Death Tax Elimination Act of 2000. Included in      this amendment is the creation of Farm and Ranch Risk      Management Accounts (FARRM accounts), repeal of self-     employment taxes on farmland rental, and clarification that      farm income averaging does not trigger the Alternative      Minimum Tax (AMT).       Using a FARRM Account, producers would be able to save up      to 20 percent of net farm income in a tax-deferred account      where the funds could be held in reserve for up to five years      for financial emergencies. Unpredictable weather and      uncontrollable markets impact supply and demand making farm      income difficult to predict. Serious financial problems can      arise when agricultural producers are unable to cover      expenses with current income. Farmers and ranchers need      financial management tools that encourage savings as a means      of stabilizing their incomes.       Recent Internal Revenue Service (IRS) activities have      wrongly broadened the application of the self-employment tax.      Until 1996, farmers and ranchers paid the 15.3 percent self-     employment tax on income from labor and employment as      intended by Congress. In that year, a tax court case expanded      the tax to include income from the cash rental of farmland.      This was done even though the tax code does not generally      require nonagricultural property owners to pay self-     employment tax on cash rental receipts.       Congress enacted three-year averaging for farm and ranch      income in 1997 to protect agriculture producers from      excessively high tax rates in profitable year. The intended      benefits of income averaging, however, are being eroded by      the imposition of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) which      limits tax savings for farmers and ranchers. Producers most      at risk, those whose incomes vary greatly from year to year,      are hurt most by AMT-imposed limits on farm and ranch income      averaging.       Farm Bureau urges your support for the agricultural tax      amendment to H.R. 8. Thank you for your consideration.                                                     Bob Stallman,                                                        President.
