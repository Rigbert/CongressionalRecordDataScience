(2) The Central and Eastern European countries,      particularly Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania,      Slovakia, Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, are in      the midst of dramatic reforms to transform their centrally      planned economies into free market economies and to join the      Western community.       (3) It is in the long-term interest of the United States to      encourage and assist the transformation of Central and      Eastern Europe into a free market economy, which is the solid      foundation of democracy, and will contribute to regional      stability and greatly increased opportunities for commerce      with the United States.       (4) Trade with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe      accounts for less than one percent of total United States      trade.       (5) The presence of a market with more than 140,000,000      people, with a growing appetite for consumer goods and      services and badly in need of modern technology and      management, should be an important market for United States      exports and investments.       (6) The United States has concluded agreements granting      most-favored-nation status to most of the countries of      Central and Eastern Europe.       (B) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress      that the President should take steps to promote more open,      fair, and free trade between the United States and the      countries of Central Europe, including Poland, Hungary, the      Czech Republic, Slovakia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia,      Romania, and Slovenia, including--       (1) developing closer commercial contacts;       (2) the mutual elimination of tariff and nontariff      discriminatory barriers in trade with these countries;       (3) exploring the possibility of framework agreements that      would lead to a free trade agreement;       (4) negotiating bilateral investment treaties;       (5) stimulating increased United States exports and      investments to the region;       (6) obtaining further liberalization of investment      regulations and protection against nationalization in these      foreign countries; and       (7) establishing fair and expeditious dispute settlement      procedures.                                 ______                                                 SPECTER (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 5042  Mr. McCONNELL.
