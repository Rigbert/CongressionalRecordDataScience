 President, respected public servant and renowned historian Tom Owen has announced that he will be retiring from the Louisville Metro Council after next year. Tom is a friend of mine, and I want to take this opportunity to express my gratitude for his many years of public service. His deep knowledge of Louisville's past and his great passion to shape our city's future will be greatly missed and impossible to replace.  Tom is one of the original members of the metro council, having served since that body's inception in 2002. In 2010 he served as metro council president. Tom previously served on the old Louisville Board of Aldermen from 1990 to 1998.  Tom represents district 8, which includes most of the Highlands neighborhood. I should mention here that Tom is not only my friend but also my councilman. He is currently the chair of the committee on sustainability and a member of the committees on public works, bridges and transportation and planning, and zoning and land design.  Tom is also a full professor at the University of Louisville; and he has served as a history instructor, an archivist, and a community relations associate at the University of Louisville since 1968. His knowledge of the city of Louisville is vast, and he frequently speaks on local television and radio about Louisville history. He also leads walking tours of historic Louisville and famous city landmarks and makes videos of these walking tours available to the public.  Tom earned his Ph.D. in American history from the University of Kentucky, a master's in history from the University of Louisville, a bachelor of divinity from Methodist Theological School in Ohio, and a bachelor's degree from Kentucky Wesleyan. He is an elder at Highland Presbyterian Church, and of his many hobbies, I know he enjoys bicycling and commuting by bicycle, as he has championed bicycle commuting as one his causes on the metro council.  Tom has been awarded the Distinguished Service Award from the Louisville Historical League, the Outstanding University of Louisville Employee Award, an honorary membership in the Kentucky Chapter of the America Institute of Architects, and a Patron Service Award at the University of Louisville libraries. As all these awards make clear, Tom is widely respected as Louisville's unofficial historian, and his absence from city government will be felt deeply.  Tom and I don't always see eye to eye on every issue, but I have great respect for Tom as a legislator, as an advocate for the citizens of the 8th district, and as someone who set out to make a difference for all the citizens of Louisville. Our shared hometown is better off thanks to Tom's many years of service. I wish him well in retirement, and I am sure his wife, Phyllis, and his children and grandchildren will be glad to spend more time with him. I wish my friend, Tom, all the best in whatever exciting endeavors await him after his time in office draws to a close.  The Louisville Courier-Journal published an article detailing Tom's career and decision to retire. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, Nov. 25, 2015]                 Highlands Councilman Tom Owen Retiring                         (By Phillip M. Bailey)       Longtime Metro Councilman Tom Owen announced Wednesday he      will not seek re-election next year, opening up a possible      avalanche of candidates who will run for his seat      representing much of the Highlands neighborhood.       Owen, 76, who is an archivist at the University of      Louisville, has served on the council since 2003 and was a      member of the old Board of Aldermen before that. He told The      Courier-Journal last week he was still deliberating on      retirement, but said after careful and lengthy consideration      that now is the time to step away.       ``I had been mulling on this decision for a good two months      and that's why there had been rumors out there,'' Owen, D-8th      District, said. ``Once I got closer to pushing the send      button the more hesitant I became.''       Owen, a former council president, was first elected to the      old board in 1989 when he defeated incumbent Alderwoman Linda      Solley in the Democratic primary. In that campaign, Owen ran      on his credentials as a local historian, saying at the time      he was the ``only candidate who knows the city of Louisville      edge to edge and has a vision of the whole city's history and      needs.''       Among those needs in 1989, Owen said, was a trolley service      for the Bardstown Road corridor, safer pedestrian traffic and      a citywide paper recycling program. He was the only      challenger to beat an incumbent in the nine board primary      races that year.       ``I love being involved and I'm honored as a historian to      think I have shaped the destiny of Louisville even one      percent,'' Owen said Wednesday.       In a statement, Mayor Greg Fischer said, Owen ``has long      been the city's unofficial city historian, quite literally a      walking encyclopedia of Louisville history.''       Former Councilwoman Tina Ward-Pugh, who also served with      Owen on the Board of Aldermen for four years, said the two      were political soulmates on a number of issues such as the      environment, transportation and gay rights. She said Owen's      departure will create a ``vast cavern of institutional      knowledge'' for the council.       ``Tom and I were virtually joined at the hip on many      progressive and social justice issues over the years,'' Ward-     Pugh said. ``I probably pushed him a little more than he was      comfortable and he held my hand when I was headed out a      little too far, so we balanced each other.''       Owen ran for mayor in the 1998 Democratic primary where he      came just shy of beating Dave Armstrong, who went on to be      the last mayor of the old city.       The newspaper archives show Owen was one of the early      supporters of a Fairness law when the city was first debating      adopting an anti-discrimination legislation to protect gay,      lesbian, bisexual and transgendered individuals in housing      and other public accommodations. Today, Owen is most      associated with his push for better public transportation and      bicycle advocacy, and he has championed the city adding more      bike lanes to major thoroughfares.       As a UofL professor of libraries since 1975, colleagues say      Owen was always able to put the council's current actions in      a historical context.       ``Tom's a person I always go to for that information, so I      hope he keeps his same phone number,'' Councilman David      James, D-6th, said.       ``Tom has institutional knowledge, he has brains, he is      thoughtful and I have thoroughly enjoyed working with him,''      said Councilman Kelly Downard, R-16th, who is also retiring      after this year. ``The council is going to miss him heavily,      and boy, there's going to be a hole.''       Only half of the Metro Council's 26 members are from the      original class who were elected when city and county      governments merged in 2002.       Owen said he doesn't want to look back on his career just      yet and has a lot more he'd like to accomplish in his last      year, but he said there are plenty of talented people who can      represent the district.       William Corey Nett, a member of the Tyler Park Neighborhood      Association, filed as a Democratic candidate this month. It      is expected that several more contenders will jump in the      race to represent the district, which encompasses most of the      Highlands neighborhood.       The deadline for candidates to run for Metro Council is      Jan. 26.                            ____________________
