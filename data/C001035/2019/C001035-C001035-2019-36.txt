President, today I am pleased to be joined by my friend and colleague from Maryland, Senator Cardin, to introduce the Girls Leadership, Engagement, and Advocacy in Development, or Girls LEAD, Act. Our legislation would support and expand civic engagement and political leadership of adolescent girls around the world.  Despite comprising over 50 percent of the world's population, women are underrepresented at all levels of public sector decision-making. Recently, Congress has taken steps to combat this issue with new laws, including the Women, Peace, and Security Act and the Women's Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment Act. The Girls LEAD Act will complement these efforts by specifically addressing the civic involvement and leadership of adolescent girls, an area where there is currently a gap in U.S. foreign assistance programing. The United States can help foster a pipeline of adolescent girls who will aspire to assume leadership roles in their communities.  Adolescence is a pivotal time in a girl's life that brings about significant physical, emotional, and social changes. Yet, according to UNESCO, 132 million adolescent girls between the age of 6 and 17 are not enrolled in school. As reported by UNICEF, more than 150 million girls will marry as children by 2030. It is vitally important that girls and young women in childhood are empowered, and that we invest in their leadership potential early so that they can develop pathways to positions of political leadership and civic engagement.  The Girls LEAD Act would combat these terrible statistics by making it the policy of the United States to promote and ensure that all adolescents are able to fully participate in society, and are specifically able to exercise their civil and political rights in their communities and countries. We know that women's political participation results in tangible change for democracies and the United States must continue to be a leader in this arena.  Specifically, our legislation would direct the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development to implement a strategy that strengthens adolescent girls' participation in democracy and governance. This strategy would include U.S. foreign assistance programs that focus on increasing adolescent girls' civic and political knowledge, advocacy, leadership, and research skills, while addressing the common barriers that can preclude their participation. The bill would require that this strategy be developed in consultation with civil society, including the participation of adolescent girls.  As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, for years I have pushed to set aside resources in the annual State Department funding bill for women's leadership and political participation programs, and I have seen first-hand the positive effects of greater political involvement on the part of women here in the United States. I believe our Nation can and must continue its leadership role in empowering women and girls worldwide, and turning more attention to the civic engagement of adolescent girls will help advance that mission.  I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Cardin in supporting the Girls LEAD Act, which will help to improve and create a more secure world now and in the future.                          ____________________
