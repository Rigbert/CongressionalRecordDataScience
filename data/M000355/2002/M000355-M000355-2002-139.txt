 President, This is a very simple amendment that addresses a serious concern raised by State and local election officials.  The underlying bill provides a mechanism for voters to ascertain the disposition of their ballot--through a free access system, such as a telephone or internet site or another means which they can create.  The bill goes further to require State or local officials to notify in writing if a provisional ballot is not counted. This is the provision which has caused a great deal of angst among those who administer our elections.  The administrative task and cost involved with implementing this requirement could be enormous in heavily populated States. It also will subject the individual who signs the letter to a great deal of criticism, scrutiny and potential legal action.  This amendment makes sense and does not undermine a voter's ability to determine whether their provisional ballot was counted. The free access system will provide unfettered access to this information.  I urge my colleagues to join with the bipartisan cosponsors in support of this amendment.
