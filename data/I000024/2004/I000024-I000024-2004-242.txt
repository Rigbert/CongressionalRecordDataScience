President, yesterday when we were discussing the seatbelt law, quite frankly, I was opposed to it. I am opposed to any kind of mandate. I cannot find anyone in this body who has either been a former Governor or mayor of a major city that won't oppose mandates. Of course, that would have been a great one, with three penalties. That is behind us now.  During that time, the assistant minority leader had a suggestion that we might want to consider what they have done in Nevada. They had this requirement just for the babies and small children, which was interesting. I commented that I am very familiar with that, having 11 grandchildren. I know all about the seatbelts and all these little requirements they have and how expensive they are. In an attempt to outdo me, as sometimes happens on the floor of the Senate, the Senator from Nevada commented that, yes, you have 11 grandchildren, but I have 14. I got a phone call after that and found out that I in fact have 12 now. So I want to get the record straight that we are still working on it and we are going to catch the Senator from Nevada. A new Swan will be born; that happens to be my daughter's name.
