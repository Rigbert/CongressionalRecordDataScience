I was going to suggest that if the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from Hawaii want to accept the amendment, we could actually get some significant business done right here.  While they are thinking about this, I must say there are few people in this Senate more senior than I, but certainly the Senator from Hawaii is much more senior, the Senator from Alaska is much more senior. They are only two of five people senior to me, and they want a quorum.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
