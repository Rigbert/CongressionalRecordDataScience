First of all, Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from Hawaii [Mr. Abercrombie] for his work and cooperation on this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of the Greens Creek Land Exchange Act of 1995.  This act will approve a land exchange agreement between the U.S. Forest Service and Kennecott Greens Creek Mining Co. (``Kennecott''). These lands surround the Greens Creek Mine, a zinc-lead-silver-gold mine, located on Admiralty Island in southeast Alaska. The land exchange agreement is the product of a nearly 10-year-long negotiation between the two parties.  Under the Greens Creek Land Exchange Agreement, Kennecott receives the right to mine mineral deposits on about 7,500 acres of land, located in Admiralty Island National Monument. In return, Kennecott will: First, pay a royalty to the Federal Government on any production from these lands, and second, purchase and donate to the U.S. Forest Service 1 million dollars' worth of inholdings located within the Admiralty National Monument--an amount of land equal in value to the land received under the agreement.  The royalty is based on the value received from 1 sales after deduction of shipping, smelting, and refining charges. The royalty has two tiers depending on the value of the ore. When metal prices are average or better, the royalty will be 3 percent, and at low metal prices, the royalty will be three-quarters of 1 percent. This two-tier royalty will encourage the Greens Creek Mine to continue operation in times of low metal prices.  This land exchange will help promote sound economic and environmentally responsible resource development, support land consolidation in conservation system units within the Tongass National Forest, and raise revenues for the Federal Government.  Mr. Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote on H.R. 1266 and thank George Miller for his leadership in the effort to approve this land exchange agreement. I look forward to the successful completion of the Greens Creek land exchange and hope that it will help provide new economic opportunities for those who live in southeast Alaska.  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record the text of the Greens Creek Land Exchange Agreement:                               Agreement       This Agreement, by and between Kennecott Greens Creek      Mining Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation (``KGCMC'') and      The United States of America, by and through the U.S.D.A.      Forest Service (``USFS''), dated     , 1994.       Whereas, on December 2, 1980, Congress established the      Admiralty Island National Monument (the ``Monument'') by      enactment of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation      Act (``ANILCA'') (P.L. 96-487):       Whereas, the Monument was established as part of the      Tongass National Forest for the purpose of protecting objects      of ecological, cultural, geological, historical,      prehistorical and scientific interest, in particular its      wildlife and supporting habitats;       Whereas, Congress designated approximately nine hundred      thousand acres of the Monument as wilderness under ANILCA;       Whereas approximately 17,000 acres of the Monument was      designated as non-wilderness to permit the development of a      silver, lead, zinc and gold deposit;       Whereas, KGCMC, as manager of the Greens Creek Joint      Venture (``GCJV'') has developed the Greens Creek Mine (the      ``Mine'') on 17 claims which were located prior to the      establishment of the Monument (the ``Existing Claims'');       Whereas, operation of the Greens Creek Mine, which is      located approximately 15 miles from Juneau, Alaska, can      produce 450,000 tons of ore per year and contribute over 265      jobs to the local economy of Southeast Alaska;       Whereas, KGCMC hopes that the life of the Mine and the jobs      it provides can be extended by further exploration and      development of subsurface lands within the non-wilderness      portion of the Monument adjacent to the Existing Claims;       Whereas, such development can occur without significant      adverse environmental effects by utilizing existing      facilities of the mine for the most part and minimizing      surface disturbance on Monument lands;       Whereas, further exploration and potential development of      the Mine can be accomplished without significant impact to      the Monument and its purposes;       Whereas, KGCMC has proposed a land exchange to acquire      rights to explore and mine adjacent subsurface lands in      return for conveyance to the United States, through the USFS,      of important private inholdings located within the Monument      and/or other Conservation System Units within the Tongass      National Forest, the      assignment to the United States of a royalty interest in the      returns from any future development from mining the lands      acquired by KGCMC through the exchange, and a restrictive      covenant and future interest in the Existing Claims, Mill      Site #1 (MS 2514), and other lands held by KGCMC located      on Admiralty Island;       Whereas, the result of such land exchange would include      consolidation of Federal land ownership in the Monument      Wilderness in return for the right through title to explore      and mine the subsurface lands adjacent to the Mine within the      existing non-wilderness area of the Monument, in an      environmentally sound manner.       Whereas, the accomplishment of such land exchange for the      purposes of Conservation System Unit consolidation and for      the purpose of permitting further exploration and development      of the Greens Creek Mine is in the pubic interest under the      terms of Section 1302(h) of ANILCA; and       Whereas, this land exchange is being accomplished under the      land exchange authority of Section 1302(h) of ANILCA:       Now, therefore, the parties to this Agreement agree as      follows:       1. General Description of the Exchange. The USFS agrees to      exchange the mineral estate, subject to a future interest and      other provisions of this Agreement, in 7500 acres, more of      less, of subsurface public land (the ``Exchange Properties'')      delineated on a map and description title ``KGCMC Exchange      Properties'' dated March 26, 1993, designated Exhibit A of      this Agreement. KGCMC agrees to exchange in return: i) title,      or alternatively, funds to acquire title, to private      inholdings (``Exchange Inholdings'') totalling no less than      $1,000,000 in fair market value from lands located within      Admiralty Island National Monument and, if necessary, other      Conservation System Units within the Tongass National Forest,      from a list titled ``KGCMC Exchange Inholdings'' dated      November 6, 1993, designated Exhibit B hereto; ii) a royalty      interest in ``Net Island Receipts'' realized from the sale of      minerals that may be mined from the Exchange Properties,      (excluding those minerals which are property of KGCMC by      operation of extralateral rights); and iii) a restrictive      covenant and future interest in the Existing Claims, Millsite      #1 (MS 2514), and any other lands held by KGCMC located on      Admiralty Island. The specific interests to be exchanged and      terms and conditions thereto are described elsewhere in this      Agreement.       2. Effective Date. This Agreement shall become effective      upon its execution by both parties and approval by Act of      Congress. The effective date of this Agreement shall be the      date of enactment of Federal legislation approving this      exchange.       3. Termination. In the event the exchange closing described      in Section 4.A is not completed within seven years from the      effective date of this Agreement, this Agreement shall      terminate and become null and void upon expiration of      seven years from the effective date. The terms of this      Agreement shall otherwise be incorporated in the      conveyances completed pursuant to this Agreement. Both      parties state their intent to exert reasonable best      efforts to complete the exchange closing as soon as      practicable in advance of seven years from the effective      date.       4. Exchange Details.        A. there shall be a single exchange closing. At the      closing, the following conveyance shall occur:       (i)(a) the United States shall receive fee title via      general warranty deeds to the surface and subsurface estate      of Exchange Inholdings totalling no less than $1,000,000 in      fair market value, subject only to any reservations,      exceptions, or conditions approved prior to closing by the      USFS. Upon conveyance, each Exchange Inholding shall become      [[Page H4921]] and be managed by the USFS as part of the      Conservation System Unit having exterior boundaries within      which the Inholding is located.       (b) In the event that the Congress enacts legislation      establishing a special fund in the Treasury for the deposit      of monies to be available until expended, without further      appropriation, for the acquisition by the Forest Service of      lands and interests in lands within the exterior boundaries      of Admiralty Island National Monument or other Conservation      System Units within the Tongass National Forest, KGCMC shall,      in lieu of the conveyances described in (i)(a), pay to the      United States the sum of $1,100,000 at the closing, for      deposit in said fund. Monies from said fund shall be      available for the purchase of lands and interests in lands      and related administrative costs.       (ii) KGCMC shall receive title to the entire interest of      the United States in the form of a patent upon completion, at      KGCMC expense, of a survey meeting Bureau of Land Management      standards, to the Exchange Properties, comprising the      subsurface mineral estate of the lands described in Exhibit      A, along with rights appurtenant to such estate identical to      those provided for an ``unperfected claim'' as defined in      section 504 of ANILCA (16 U.S.C. 432 note) once patent to the      minerals of such claim is conveyed by the United States.      Provided, the Exchange Properties conveyance shall      specifically reserve the restrictive covenant and future      interest in the United States as described in Section 8, and      shall specifically except extralateral rights as described in      Section 4.B;       The Exchange Properties conveyance shall furthermore be      specifically subject to:       a. valid existing rights;       b. the covenants described in Sections 4.C. and 4.D;       c. the Net Island Receipts interest described in Section 6      and Exhibit C hereto; including but not limited to the right      of USFS to enter and inspect the Exchange Properties as      provided in Exhibit C hereto;       d. a coextensive right of USFS to enter and inspect the      Exchange Properties to monitor compliance with Sections 4.B      and 4.C;       The Exchange Properties conveyance shall be furthermore      subject only to any other exceptions, reservations, or      conditions approved prior to closing by KGCMC.       B. The parties expressly agree that no extralateral rights      for the Exchange Properties shall be conveyed under the terms      of this Agreement. This Agreement shall not enlarge nor      diminish any extralateral rights which KGCMC may now have or      in the future establish with respect to its existing claims.       C. The parties expressly agree that no minerals extracted      from the Exchange Properties other than hardrock and      metalliferous minerals available for location and patent      under the general mining laws of the United States (30 U.S.C.      21-53 et seq.) may be sold for commercial purposes. Any other      mineral or mineral material on the Exchange Properties may be      extracted and utilized by KGCMC in the exploration,      development, mining and beneficiation process of Existing      Claims and Exchange Properties for hard rock and      metalliferous minerals, without payment to the United States.       D. Use and occupancy by KGCMC, its successors, or assigns      of the surface overlying the Exchange Properties shall be      limited as follows:       (1) Use and occupancy of the surface estate overlying the      Exchange Properties shall be minimized to the maximum extent      practicable, including but not limited to consolidating      facilities and operations to the maximum extent practicable      with facilities and operations related to the existing Greens      Creek Mine, and reclamation in accordance with applicable law      and regulation.       (2) There shall be no use or occupancy of the surface      estate overlying the Exchange Properties until the operator,      as defined in the regulations referenced herein, has applied      for and received approval of a plan of operations, including      reclamation, in accordance with the provisions of 36 CFR      228.80 and 36 CFR 228, Subpart A in effect on the effective      date of this Agreement.       (3) There shall be no use or occupancy of the surface      estate overlying the Exchange Properties for purposes of      open pit, hydraulic, or other surface mining, or smelting      operations.       (4) Neither the existence of privately owned minerals nor      any provision of this Agreement shall be construed to      preclude the United States and its assigns, including the      general public, from occupancy or use of the surface estate      overlying the Exchange Properties. The USFS shall as      appropriate impose reasonable restrictions upon public      occupancy and use for purposes of avoiding conflict with      KGCMC operations, to protect public safety, or for other      purposes. This provisions shall not be construed to alter      respective tort liability, if any, between USFS and KGCMC or      other entities under applicable law.       E. Evidence of title to Exchange Inholdings shall be in a      form acceptable to and in conformance with standards of the      Attorney General of the United States.       F. USFS shall bear its own attorney fees, costs of document      preparation for conveyance of the Exchange Properties to      KGCMC, and costs of recording documents conveying Exchange      Inholdings and other property interests to the United States.      KGCMC shall bear all other closing costs, including abstract      of title or title insurance, transfer taxes, brokerage fees,      its attorney fees and recording costs. KGCMC shall also bear      the cost of survey required for issuance of patent to the      Exchange Properties and any survey required by the United      States to complete conveyance of any Exchange Inholdings to      the United States. Provided, if USFS completes the      acquisition of Exchange Inholdings pursuant to Section      4.A(i)(b), the USFS shall bear all closing costs for the      Exchange Inholdings. All costs borne by KGCMC pursuant to      this paragraph shall not be credited against the $1,000,000,      Net Island Receipts interest, or other consideration owing to      the United States under this Agreement. The provisions of      Public Law No. 91-646 shall not apply to this Agreement.      KGCMC shall not be construed as an agent of the United States      in acquiring Exchange Inholdings or otherwise under this      Agreement.       G. The USFS agrees to cooperate with KGCMC in attempting to      effect the transactions contemplated herein as tax free      exchanges pursuant to Section 1031 of the I.R.C. (26 U.S.C.      1031 et seq.), but expressly disclaims any jurisdiction to      determine or influence Internal Revenue Service      determinations of the tax consequences of any transactions.       5. Valuation of Exchange Inholdings       A. Attached as Exhibit B of this Agreement is a list of the      properties which the USFS lists as qualified for conveyance      as Exchange Inholdings. KGCMC shall be permitted to acquire      and designate any such properties as Exchange Inholdings and      convey or cause to be conveyed to the USFS such properties as      is necessary to effect the Exchange. No particular lands are      required to be      conveyed, and there is no priority for these potential      Exchange Inholdings except as described in Section C      below.       B. The fair market value of each Exchange Inholding shall      be the lesser of the actual amount paid for the Inholding by      KGCMC, excluding closing costs borne by KGCMC described in      Section 4.E above, or the fair market value adjusted to the      effective date of this Agreement, determined by an appraisal.      The appraisal for each Exchange Inholding shall be completed      by KGCMC at its own expense and the appraisal report provided      to USFS no sooner than 1 year and no later than 60 days in      advance of closing for the Inholding concerned, for review      and approval. Said appraisal shall be completed according to      the then current Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land      Acquisitions. In the event KGCMC is not able to acquire      Exchange Inholdings totalling exactly $1,000,000 in fair      market value, KGCMC shall be obligated without further      consideration to convey and bear the expense of acquiring any      additional Exchange Inholding required to bring the total      fair market value of the Exchange Inholdings conveyed to at      least $1,000,000.       C. Exhibit B is divided into two parts: Part A lists lands      located within Admiralty Island National Monument. Part B      lists lands located within other Conservation System Units      within the Tongass National Forest. KGCMC shall use      reasonable efforts to acquire lands from the Part A list when      available at fair market value and only acquire lands from      the Part B list upon a determination by the USFS that lands      from the Part A list are not available at fair market value      after such reasonable efforts. KGCMC shall otherwise consult      and cooperate with USFS in identifying opportunities of      acquisition at fair market value of particular lands listed      in Exhibit B, and use reasonable efforts to acquire such      lands.       6. Net Island Receipts Royalty Interest--The Parties agree      that the United States shall receive a percentage of the Net      Island Receipts from mineral production from the Exchange      Properties as described in Exhibit C of this Agreement. The      United States shall be provided reasonable access by KGCMC to      the Exchange Properties and any books, records, documents,      and mineral samples, to audit the payment of the Net Island      Receipts interest as provided in Exhibit C.       7. Existing Extralateral Rights--This Agreement, including      the grant of the Net Island Receipts interest described in      paragraph 6 and Exhibit C shall not enlarge or diminish any      rights KGCMC may now have or in the future establish to      minerals lying with the Exchange Properties through      application of extralateral rights extending from KGCMC's      Existing Claims. The Net Island Receipts interest to be      granted to the United States under this agreement shall not      burden, nor entitle the United States to any monies realized      by KGCMC from the sale of concentrates or other mineral      products from ores, the title to which belongs to KGCMC by      operation of extralateral rights extending from KGCMC's      existing claims and property interests.       8. Restrictive Covenant and Future Interest in the United      States.       A. KGCMC shall grant the United States a restrictive      covenant and future interest in (i) the Existing Claims; (ii)      Millsite #1 (MS 2514); and (iii) the Exchange Properties, and      the right to a future interest in (iv) the ``Future Acquired      Lands,'' defined as follows: any lands on Admiralty Island to      which KGCMC, its successors, or assigns acquires title after      the effective date of this agreement and prior to the vesting      of title in the United States as defined in Section 8.B.      occurs, excepting Exchange Inholdings conveyed to the United      States pursuant to this Agreement. The grant shall be      effected by: (1) a conveyance by deed regarding the Existing      Claims and Millsite; (ii) a reservation and/or exception in      the conveyance from the [[Page H4922]] United States      regarding the Exchange Properties; and (iii) a contractual      right to conveyance by deed upon KGCMC acquiring title,      regarding the Future Acquired Lands. KGCMC shall grant the      restrictive covenant and future interest and rights thereto      described herein at the exchange closing.       B. The terms of the restrictive covenant and future      interest to be granted to the United States in Section 8.A.      are as follows:       (1) Restrictive Covenant: Use of the subject lands by      KGCMC, its successors, and assigns shall be limited solely to      bona fide good faith mineral exploration, development, and      production activities, including reclamation work. This      covenant shall run with the land until such time as the      vesting of title to the United States occurs.       (2) Future interest: Right of Reentry: The United States      shall have a right to reenter and take title and possession      to all right, title, and interest in the subject lands upon      the following, whichever occurs earlier:       (a) abandonment by KGCMC, its successors, or assigns, of      all bona fide good faith mineral exploration, development,      and production activities, including reclamation work, on      each and all of i) the Existing Claims; ii) Millsite #1 (MS      2514); iii) the Exchange Properties; and iv) the Future      Acquired Lands. Complete cessation for ten consecutive years      of all bona fide good faith mineral exploration, development,      and production activities, including reclamation work, on all      the lands listed in i) through iv) herein, shall be      conclusively deemed to constitute abandonment, without      prejudice to abandonment occurring otherwise.       (b) January 1, 2045; if as of December 1, 2044, KGCMC, its      successors, or assigns are not engaged in bona fide      good faith mineral exploration, production, or production      activities, including reclamation work, on any of the      lands listed in (i) through (iv) in (a) above.       (c) January 1, 2095, irrespective of any ongoing activities      and subject to the right of reentry occurring sooner based      upon abandonment as described in (a) above.       The right of reentry and all other terms herein shall not      in any way relieve KGCMC, its successors, or assigns of      obligations described in Section 9 [indemnity] of other      obligation otherwise applicable.       9. Hazardous Waste and other Indemnity. KGCMC, Kennecott      Corporation, and their successors and assigns shall      indemnify, defend and hold harmless the United States, its      various agencies and employees, from any damage, loss, claim,      fines, penalties, and costs whatsoever arising in any way and      at any time from any use, occupancy or activities, past,      present or future (provided said use, occupancy, or      activities occur no later than the time at which title      reverts to the United States), by any entity, on the Exchange      Inholdings, Existing Claims, Millsite #1 (MS 2514) and other      property in which a restrictive covenant and future interest      is granted to the United States under this Agreement,      specifically including, but not limited to: (a) those      activities by which hazardous substances, hazardous      materials, or wastes of any kind were generated, released,      stored, used, or otherwise disposed on the described property      or facility thereon, and (b) any response or natural resource      damage actions conducted pursuant to any federal, state, or      local environmental law, regulation, or rule, and related in      any manner to said hazardous substances, hazardous materials,      or wastes.       10. Disclaimer of Value Warranty. The parties expressly      disclaim any warranty of value for any of the lands or      interests exchanged under this Agreement. It is expressly      recognized by the parties that potential revenues or proceeds      from any of the lands or interests exchanged herein are      purely speculative.       11. Loss or Damage Prior to Conveyance. Both parties agree      not to do, or suffer others to do, any act prior to the      conveyance described in this Agreement by which the value of      the real property herein identified for exchange may be      diminished or further encumbered. In the event any such loss      or damage occurs from any cause, including acts of God, to      the real property herein identified for exchange before      execution of deed, the party who is grantee under this      Agreement as to that property shall not be obligated to      accept title to said property, and an equitable adjustment in      the consideration shall be made at the option of said party.      Information obtained from exploratory drilling or other acts      otherwise authorized shall not be construed as diminishing or      further encumbering the identified property, for purposes of      this Agreement.       12. Status Quo Ante. In the event this Agreement becomes      null and void prior to the completion of the exchange closing      by operation of its terms or by order of a court of competent      jurisdiction, the parties shall return to their status and      rights prior to execution of the Agreement.       13.

The      Parties further acknowledge that a transfer from KGCMC to      Greens Creek Joint Venture, operating as a joint venture, is      expressly permissible upon written notice to the USFS. An      assignment, transfer conveyance, lease, sale or other      alienation of rights, however, shall not release a party from      its duties under this Agreement, except that an agency of the      United States shall be released from its duties if the      transfer is to a successor agency.       B. An assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease, sale or      alienation shall not release any of the covenants or      conditions which run with the land imposed by this Agreement.      The covenants and conditions contained in this Agreement      shall be construed as running with the land unless they are      clearly intended as personal to a party to this Agreement.      The parties may contract for the disposition or utilization      of any rights granted by this Agreement.       23. Equal Value and Public Interest Determination. The      Parties recognize the impossibility of precisely valuing the      respective considerations flowing between the United States      and GCJV pursuant to this Agreement. In accordance with      Section 1302(h) of ANILCA, the USFS Regional Forester, Region      10, pursuant to authority delegated by the Secretary of      Agriculture, has determined that although the mutual      consideration flowing between the Parties may be unequal, it      is in the public interest to consummate this exchange. This      paragraph shall be construed as a finding by the Secretary      that the public interest values of the interests in land      exchanged pursuant hereto are equal.       In Witness Whereof, Kennecott Corporation, Kennecott Greens      Creek Mining Company, and the USDA Assistant Secretary for      Natural Resources and Environment, acting for and on behalf      of the United States Department of Agriculture, has executed      this Agreement.

Exhibit C--Net Island Receipts Royalty                  a. definition of net island receipts       ``Net Island Receipts (NIR)'' shall be any excess of      ``Revenues Received (RR)'' over ``Allowable Deductions (AD)''      for any calendar year. Net Island Receipts shall be      calculated using the following formula: NIR = RR - AD.       Where:       NIR = Net Island Receipts for the calendar year (in      dollars);       RR = Revenues received during the calendar year, as defined      in Section D. below (in dollars);       AD = Allowable deductions incurred during the calendar      year, as defined in Section D. below (in dollars);                         b. royalty calculation       The dollar amount of the royalty payable to the Interest      Holder shall be calculated using the following formula:      Royalty = (X) (NIR).       Where (X) = three percent (3%) of NIR when NIR exceeds      $120/ton, and three-fourths of one percent (0.75%) when NIR      is equal to or less than $120/ton. Provided, the $120/ton      threshold shall be adjusted annually according to the Gross      Domestic Product Implicit Price Deflator, until the sooner of      the following dates, whichever occurs earlier:       (1) the date 20 years subsequent to the date upon which      mining operations commence at the Greens Creek Mine, whether      or not operations include the Exchange Properties; or       (2) the date 30 years subsequent to the effective date of      the Agreement.                         c. payments of royalty       The payor shall deliver to the Interest Holder a payment      equal to the percentage, as set forth in section B. above, of      all NIR realized by the Payor during any calendar year      (January 1-December 31), within thirty days after the end of      said calendar year, together with a copy of the accounting      made in connection with such payment. All payments of royalty      to the Interest Holder shall be subject to adjustment,      including interest on any such adjustment at the rate      provided by 31 U.S.C. 3717, on March 31.                          D.

Sales to affiliates of KGCMC shall be valued at the      fair market value of the products sold. Any credits or      payments received from a buyer by KGCMC shall be credited as      RR.       5. ``Allowable Deductions'' shall mean the following actual      costs incurred by Payor: costs of all transportation and      insurance for ores or products produced from ores mined from      the Exchange Properties, between KGCMC Admiralty Island      loading facilities and the point of delivery of said ores or      products, smelting and/or refining charges, treatment      charges, penalties, umpire charges, independent      representative charges and all charges by purchasers of said      ores or products.                         E. Accounting Matters       All Revenues Received (RR) and Allowable Deductions (AD)      shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted      accounting principles and practices consistently applied. RR      and AD shall be determined by the accrual method.                     F. Costs of Common Facilities       Where any AD are incurred in conjunction with like costs      for mineral products from other Properties controlled by the      Payor, such costs shall be fairly allocated and apportioned      in accordance with generally accepted practices in the mining      industry.                         G. Audit and Disputes       1. The Interest Holder, upon written notice, shall have the      right to have an independent firm of certified public      accountants or utilize its own personnel at its own cost to      audit the records that relate to the calculation of the NIR      royalty within 24 months after receipt of a payment described      in Section C of this Exhibit.       2. The Interest Holder shall be deemed to have waived any      right it may have had to object to a payment made for any      calender year, unless it provides notice in writing of such      objection within 25 months after receipt of final payment for      the calendar year. The parties may elect to submit the      dispute to a mutually acceptable certified public accountant,      or firm of certified public accountants, for a binding      resolution thereof.                               h. general       1. Unless otherwise specified, capitalized terms used      herein shall have the same meaning as given to them in the      Agreement.       2. Accurate records of tonnage, volume of products,      analyses of products, weight, moisture, assays of pay metal      content and other records related to the computation of the      NIR royalty hereunder shall be kept by the Payor.       3. Up to four times per year, the Interest Holder or its      authorized representative on not less than five (5) business      days written notice to the Payor, may enter upon all portions      of the Exchange Properties for the purpose of inspecting the      Exchange Properties, all improvements thereto and operations      thereon, and may inspect and copy all records and data      pertaining to the computation of the NIR royalty, including      without limitation such records and data which are maintained      electronically. The Interest Holder or its authorized      representative in exercising entry and inspection rights may      not unreasonably hinder operations on or pertaining to the      Exchange Properties. This provision does not diminish any      other independent right which the Interest Holder may have to      enter and inspect Payor's properties, records or data.       4. All notices or communications hereunder shall be made      and effective in accordance with the provisions of the      Agreement.       5.

All information and data provided to the Interest holder      shall be treated as confidential by the USFS and disclosed to      other parties only to the extent, if any, required by law.       7. The Payor shall have the right to commingle ore and      minerals from the Exchange Properties with ore from other      lands and properties; provided, however, that the Payor shall      calculate from representative samples the average grade of      the ore and shall weigh (or calculate by volume) the ore      before commingling. If concentrates are produced from the      commingled ores by the Payor, the Payor shall also calculate      from representative samples the average recovery percentage      for all concentrates produced during the calendar year. In      obtaining representative samples, calculating the average      grade of the ore, and calculating average recovery      percentages the Payor shall use procedures accepted in the      mining and metallurgical industry suitable for the type of      mining and processing activity being conducted.
