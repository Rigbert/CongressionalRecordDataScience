 It totally guts the estate tax reform. It postpones rate decreases. It postpones meaningful unified credit increases until the year 2011. The RELIEF Act gives American taxpayers $3 million by the year 2006 and Senator Dorgan does not.  The RELIEF Act is simple. Under our bill, there are no requirements, no long-term obligations to the IRS. I ask you to give real relief now and do that by defeating this amendment.
