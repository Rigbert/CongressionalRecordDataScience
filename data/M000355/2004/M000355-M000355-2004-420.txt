 There are currently seven amendments pending to the bill. Additional amendments will be offered and debated on Monday afternoon. Those Senators who still wish to offer amendments should contact the bill managers so they can schedule time for consideration of the amendments, although we are certainly not encouraging any additional amendments. We have quite enough.  Chairman Warner and Senator Levin will be here Monday to work through any remaining amendments. Any votes ordered with respect to defense amendments will be stacked to occur at approximately 5:30 on Monday. The leader expects that we will have more than one vote on Monday evening.  Also, I remind my colleagues that last night the majority leader vitiated the cloture motion with respect to the Defense bill. He did so with the expectation that we will finish this bill on Tuesday of next week. It is our hope that we will continue to work in good faith on Monday to move toward completion of this important Defense bill. Senators can expect a busy week next week as we conclude our business prior to the scheduled recess.                          ____________________
