Speaker, I appreciate the leader's advice that I have the opportunity to go before the Committee on Rules. I always enjoy the opportunity to go and testify before the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier) and his committee.  Let me move on to some other legislation. I mentioned a number of pieces that we have not done, Defense Department authorization, I mentioned, and the Higher Education Act. My question, does the gentleman anticipate that we will leave next Friday or Saturday having accomplished some or all of those pieces of legislation?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would yield and repeat all the legislation he is talking about?
