Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Bishop) for his comments. And as I was standing here, I thought to myself Sanford Bishop Sr. would indeed be proud of his son, a leading educator in our country. His father was a very distinguished American, and his son has become someone of whom his father would be indeed be extraordinarily proud. I thank the gentleman for his participation.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my very good friend, the gentleman from Chicago, Illinois (Mr. Rush), a distinguished representative, and one of the very significant leaders in our country for most, if not all, of his adult life.
