President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the attached editorial from the Vermont newspaper The Time Argus, titled ``Another Bad One,'' and dated March 19, 1997, be printed in the Record.  The editorial follows:                            Another Bad One       The arguments against amending the U.S. Constitution over      campaign financing are the same as the arguments against a      balanced budget amendment or a prohibition amendment. It is a      waste of effort to target specific evils by way of the      Constitution.       The U.S. Senate wisely rejected a campaign finance      amendment by a wide margin on Tuesday.       States which have encumbered their constitutions with      numerous amendments have found their documents have become      just that: encumbrances.       A constitutional amendment will not stop candidates from      getting money, and it will not stop people who want to      influence candidates from using their money to promote that      influence. You might as well have an amendment that said:      ``Candidates for public office shall not spend money in their      quest for the office.''       Then there would be a court case to argue whether a      candidate who filled his automobile gas tank while on the way      to a campaign forum had ``spent money in his quest'' for the      office.       A constitutional amendment against bank robbery would not      stop the number of bank robberies that occur. There is a law      against bank robbery, and in fact Congress finally got the      federal government into the investigations by making it      possible for the FBI to enter bank robbery cases immediately.       And something similar relating to campaign financing would      be the proper course of action, instead of an amendment to      the Constitution. A congressional statute putting greater      controls over campaigns would have the same effect as an      amendment without the permanent encumbrance of the amendment      on matters unforeseen.       In some cases the courts have ruled that specific laws      limiting contribution limits infringe on free speech. It      ought to be possible for a congressional statute to impose      some sort of constraint on money without interfering with      speech.       The huge sums spent on campaigns may very well be      considered immoral, but history has given ample illustrations      of the futility of trying to legislate morality. Prohibition      is a relatively recent example. Did it stop people from      consuming alcohol? No. In fact, it helped increase the power      of law-breaking organizations geared to providing illicit      substances, a baneful influence that is still with us.       The present spotlight in Washington on campaign      contributions and the methods of solicitation for such funds      makes it easy for people to think an amendment to the      Constitution would be an appropriate response. But however      tawdry such actions have been--and they certainly are      tawdry--there will be no change merely by passing an      amendment that says, in effect: ``Thou shalt not be tawdry.      Thou shalt not be greedy.''       The existing amendments to the U.S. Constitution that come      closest to addressing a specific subject are the 13th and      14th, which after the Civil War abolished slavery and      codified equal protection under the law. But even they were      not so specific that they can't be applied to races other      than African-Americans, and questions of equal protection      arise even today.       Efforts for a balanced budget amendment are an abdication      of congressional responsibility. Efforts for an amendment on      campaign financing constitute a similar abdication.                          ____________________
