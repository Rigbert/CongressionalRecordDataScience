President, would the Senator yield for a question? I am going to be speaking at the end of this hour that has been allocated to our side, and I don't want to interrupt the Senator from Ohio but for one reason. I don't know if the Senator from Ohio heard or is aware of a statement made earlier today by our colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Coburn, who came to the floor and said:       What the American people ought to pray is that somebody      can't make the vote tonight. That is what they ought to pray.  I have been trying to reach Senator Coburn because he is on a committee on which I serve and I work with him. This statement troubles me. I am trying to reach him to come back to the floor and explain exactly what he meant about a Senator not being able to make the vote tonight.  I don't know if the Senator from Ohio is familiar with this statement, but I am reaching out to Senator Coburn. I will be on the floor in the next 45 minutes, and I hope he will join me.  I thank the Senator from Ohio for yielding.
