Speaker, the committee report which accompanies the Labor, HHS, Education appropriations bill, as approved by the Appropriations Committee, encourages the National Institute for Environmental Health Science (NIEHS) to cooperate with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to support provisions in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), as amended, relating to the registration and re-registration of public health pesticides.  In 1996, FIFRA was amended by a set of reforms which were enacted in the Food Quality Protection Act (P.L. 104-170). This legislation authorized $12 million per year for the creation of a public health pesticide data collection program within the department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Many pesticides are specialized products with a low-volume sales markets. for many of these products, the cost of generating the data necessary to maintain registrations far exceeds return on sale. Consequently, many EPA registered pesticides are cancelled for economic reasons.  The EPA Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of HHS should promote research on products used in combating and eradicating urban pests, including rats, mice, cockroaches, flies mosquitos, ticks, and fleas.  These pests pose a serious health risk to the general population in densely populated cities and suburbs. Vulnerable sub-populations such as children, the elderly, and individuals with compromised immune systems are particularly at risk. Pesticides registered for public health uses are utilized to prevent the spread of bacteria which are carried by pests, such as Salmonella, Legionnaire's Disease, E. Coli, Lyme Disease, Encephalitis.                          ____________________
