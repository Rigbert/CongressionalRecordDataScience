 President, first of all, I thank the Senator from Florida for a very clear-cut statement about why we are where we are and how we can get out of it. Basically, it is the President of the United States doing what he said he would do.  We are where we are today, Mr. President, because on November 20, the President signed an agreement with Congress. This is the wording of that agreement:       The President and the Congress shall enact legislation in      the first session of the 104th Congress to achieve a balanced      budget not later than fiscal year 2002 as estimated by the      Congressional Budget Office * * *  We have said several times that the President himself on November 20   signed legislation that said he agreed to three things: One, that he would send a budget to the Hill that was balanced. That budget he was going to send to the Hill would be the third one, because remember, he sent one in February, he sent one again in June and this would be the third one. It would be balanced by the year 2002, the same as when Congress said that we would balance the budget.  What is magic about 2002? It could be 2001, it could be 2003, but really what is magic about 2002 is that in February of this year, we had 66 Senators--that is Republicans and Democrats, because there are not 66 Republican Senators--a bipartisan vote that the budget should be balanced by the year 2002. The House of Representatives had a vote about a week or two earlier with 301 votes. That is Republicans and Democrats. That is a bipartisan vote that said we should do it by 2002.  There is nothing revolutionary about 2002. That is an evolution to a balanced budget. That is a Republican evolution to a balanced budget.  For a lot of people, it is too, too slow. We probably got more people in this country mad at us because we are taking until the year 2002 to balance the budget than by 2002. The President says that is extreme. Well, it cannot be extreme if he signed the agreement that he was going to be in favor of balancing the budget by 2002, because if that is extreme, the President is extreme. I do not think anybody in this town is extreme.  The most difficult process in this town is just making the tough decisions. For our constituents, taking 7 years to balance the budget is not a tough decision. That is too evolutionary of a process for balancing a budget. They would like us to be more extreme than that. They would like us to do it sooner.  Do you know why they think we should do it sooner? Because each month they have to balance their checkbook, live within their income or, if they are a small business or small farmer, they have to live within their income. They cannot be like Government, borrowing money all the time.  But the President signed that he would submit by December 15 a balanced budget and that it would be scored by the Congressional Budget Office. Those three things are pretty key to the President keeping his word when he signed this.  The first budget that they sent up here about 2 weeks ago was not in balance, $400 billion out of balance, as scored by the Congressional Budget Office; $115 billion deficit even the last year.  We are here today because we are still waiting for the President to deliver on what he signed into law on November 20. Where I come from, that means you sit down to make a deal, you put some numbers on the table, and those numbers should be within the guidelines of the debate. The debate is to have it balanced and scored by CBO, the Congressional Budget Office. By the way, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, not scored by the Office of Management and Budget which is part of the White House which is headed by a Presidential appointee. The Congressional Budget Office, nonpartisan, people who do things based upon their study of forecasting the future and what programs are going to cost in the outyears, not what some Republican or Democrat says it is. Their reputation of being a true judge of what things are going to cost when they score it is at stake.  Last Friday, they made another attempt to come up here. I suppose that would be the fourth budget this year. It was still off. But what did they do about the Congressional Budget Office scoring? They said, ``Well, we don't agree with it.'' This does not say anything about agreeing with it. You just simply present your numbers and let the nonpartisan budget office score it. Let the chips fall where they may.  ``Mr. President, if you come up short someplace, we understand. Just go back to the table and submit a new number, but get something that the Congressional Budget Office can say is in balance.''  The only thing we Republicans--maybe I should not speak so definitively--the only thing we Republicans care about is that the budget is balanced by 2002, because I suppose each one of us has an opinion on that. But I have heard enough of the people who do the negotiating for the Republicans--and for a few days I was one of the eight doing the negotiating--that when the President puts a budget that is balanced, as scored by the CBO, on the table, then within the parameters, anything is on the table, including what to do about Washington spending, which we call discretionary spending, where we let the Washington bureaucrats spend it, those programs. Entitlements like Medicare and Medicaid, and even defense and taxes, are all on the table.  All we want the President to do is to play in the same boundary. If you want to keep the cows within the pasture, that means you build a fence around the pasture. Then you operate within that. And what you do within that fence is all in the ball game. Everybody negotiating with the White House and the Congress can reach an agreement. But what is so important about the fence, what is so important that is scored by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, is simply that it is an end to business as usual here in Washington, that the big black hole of Government borrowing can go on and you can spend any amount of money. For the first time in 27 years, we are saying, once again, there is some limit on what you can spend--just some limit.  Now, I came to the floor to speak about another point because we always talk about the budget deficit. But there are two deficits that we can defeat in the process of balancing the budget deficit. The Senator from Florida spoke very well about what good is going to come to the economy. There was an economist quoted in a USA Today article, ``What Life Would Be in the Year 2002 With a Balanced Budget.'' Some of the things they spoke to have been referred to by my colleagues on the floor. A larger economy by $150 billion--this is by the year 2002--a $150 billion bigger economy, more in goods and services, and lower interest rates. We would see 30-year fixed-rate mortgages below 5 percent. The last time I remember mortgages for under 5 percent was when I purchased a house in 1960. I think it was 4\3/4\ percent. Half a percent was for FHA insurance for the 4\1/4\ percent. You have to go back a long way to see the good that can come to the pocketbooks of the American people, such as $2,300 per person--that is a figure for my State of Iowa--$2,300 less per mortgage that families will be paying. If they have student loans, they will be paying $608 less in interest on that student loan. Our economy will grow dramatically. So we are going to have lower inflation besides lower interest, we are going to have higher incomes, and we are going to have a stronger dollar.  Then the second deficit that will be eliminated besides the budget deficit is the trade deficit. Now, since, I think, 1982, 1983, or 1984 at the latest, we have been worried and scared to death about the trade deficit--that we import more than we sell and that we need to do something about it. This article quotes an economist at Meyers & Associates, who said that when we do away with the budget deficit by the year 2002, we will also be doing away with the trade deficit, as well.  So here we have a chance to accomplish this and kill two birds with one stone--get rid of the budget deficit, if we make the tough decisions that must be made on the budget deficit, and get lower interest rates, a stronger dollar, and reduce the trade deficit as well. As chairman of the International Trade Subcommittee of the U.S. Senate, there is nothing I would rather have happen than to get rid of the trade deficit at the same time we get rid of the budget deficit.  Another reason we are here is that we have been hearing for a long time, Mr. President, about how the President wants to protect Medicare. Well, my friend who is still here, the Senator from Utah, Senator Bennett, spoke a half hour ago about how we are very dramatically increasing Medicare spending. But do not forget why we are dealing with the Medicare issue at all. It is because the President's trustees--three members of the President's Cabinet, the Commissioner of Social Security and two private citizens, appointed by the President of the United States last year--studied the problems with Medicare funding and the fact that there was a potential bankruptcy of Medicare. A potential bankruptcy of Medicare means that at some time Medicare is going to run out of money. With the insolvency of Medicare, it will run out of money. There is no authority in the law to borrow money for Medicare, so no bills would be paid after a date stated by the trustees.  These trustees are Robert Rubin, Secretary of the Treasury; Robert Reich, Secretary of Labor; Donna Shalala, Secretary of HHS; Shirley Chater, Commissioner of Social Security, and two trustees are private citizens who are expert in this area of economic forecasting, Sanford G. Ross and David M. Walker. They unanimously, on April 2, asked the Congress of the United States to take very drastic action to end the pending insolvency of Medicare by the year 2002.  As shown on this chart, you can go back to 1985, and this is what you see--money coming in, money being paid out. Next year is the first year that there is more money being paid out of Medicare than is being paid in in taxes to the Medicare trust fund. And then it spends down very dramatically to the year 2002 when it goes into deficit. You do not pay anything on the deficit because there is no authority there to borrow.  So we responded to the appointees of the President of the United States, the trustees of the Medicare system, in their report to us. We made the commitment earlier this year to respond to that need, to save Medicare, but not only to save Medicare, but to strengthen Medicare, and not only strengthen it, but go beyond strengthening it to give people, for the first time in 30 years, some choice in the type of medicine that they want applied to them by giving them the opportunity of keeping what they have had for 30 years if they want to do so, or taking the $4,900 this year that we paid for each beneficiary per year and let that be used by that individual, by their own free choice, to buy a managed care plan if they want to do that; let them roll their own dollars by giving them the $4,900 to put in a medical savings account; or, lastly, that they could keep a plan that they had where they last worked, like a union or association plan. That would be a choice that the individual Medicare enrollee could choose to do. You could choose to do that once a year. You could choose to leave the traditional Medicare plan and go into a managed care plan for a year. If you did not like that, come back to Medicare, or go over to a medical savings account, or go over to an association plan that you might want to have.  We responded to that. It was in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 that we sent to the President a month ago, the same one that the President vetoed.  Mr. President, the Senate majority leader would like to have me yield. I yield as long as I do not lose my right to the floor.                     A Step in the Right Direction
