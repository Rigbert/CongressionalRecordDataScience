President, I first want to thank Senator Kennedy for yielding me time and I add my commendation along with that of my colleagues to both Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy for the remarkable work they have done. This has been a long process, but it has been one that has been very positive, collaborative, and collegial. Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy have been very supportive of efforts by all the members of the committee and Members of this Senate to incorporate, to improve, and to bring forth today legislation of which I think we can all be proud.  This legislation does so much to improve the quality of educational opportunity in the United States. One of the keys to our country, not just its economic prowess but its social progress, is the ability of all of our citizens to go on to higher education. This bill will advance that goal significantly. I applaud all of those who participated in this process.  As my colleagues have mentioned, there are many important aspects of this legislation that should be noted. First of all, there is an increase in the authorization of the Pell grant, which will allow, particularly many low-income students, further access to higher education. There is a reduction in the interest rates which students will pay on loans, which will help them bear the burden of the ever-increasing cost of college. There is loan forgiveness for teachers, a revamping of our early intervention efforts, and a strengthening of the TRIO Program, which is a very important program that targets low-income students who will be the first in their family to attend college. Without TRIO, these students may not have the guidance, the information, and the support to make it into and stay in college. Also, there has been some significant effort to begin to address cost issues with respect to college education.  All of these are commendable, but there are two very important issues which I would like to stress. First, this Senate last year restored the State Student Incentive Grant Program, a very important program which takes limited Federal resources, matches them with State dollars, and providesgrants to needy undergraduate and graduate students. The Conference Report contains legislation I introduced with Senator Collins to reform this program. It is now the LEAP Program, the Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership Program. This revamped program will be a continuation and a strengthening of our commitment to ensure that all Americans have access to quality higher education.  Also, there is a very, very strong teacher training title in this bill. Again, I thank both Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy for their efforts in this regard. We built on legislation I proposed, and we created a situation in which now there will be incentives for teacher colleges to have active partnerships with elementary and secondary schools.  We are trying to move in a direction of more clinical training for teachers. One of the sad commentaries I have heard--and I am sure my colleagues have also--is that for so many teachers, on the first day of school, it is practically their first day in a classroom as a teacher. This should change. This approach of partnerships between higher education institutions and elementary and secondary schools, particularly one partnership model known as professional development schools, is a positive way to increase the professional development of our teachers, which could be the single most important factor in improving and reforming education in the United States today.  This legislation is not perfect, but it is a remarkable achievement based upon cooperation and a collegial approach to this issue.  I commend and thank my colleagues, particularly the chairman, Senator Jeffords, and the ranking member, Senator Kennedy, for all of their work. I look forward to the speedy acceptance of this conference report.  I yield back my time to the Senator from Massachusetts.        inclusion of the faculty retirement incentive provision
