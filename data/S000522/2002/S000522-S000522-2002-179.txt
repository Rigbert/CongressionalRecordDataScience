Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Let me conclude and thank the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Shows) for managing the bill on the floor; I thank my good friend and colleague, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health for his leadership; I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Filner) for his leadership; and I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans) who is our ranking member. We have worked hand in glove on these veterans issues. It has been a delight to work with him on this important legislation.  I also want to thank our staff. As we all know, Mr. Speaker, without the staff, committees would not function. They are hard working and very, very competent. They are professionals in every sense of that word. I want to thank Pat Ryan, our chief counsel and chief of staff; Kingston Smith; Jeannie McNally, who is our coordinator for legislation--by the way, it is her birthday, and I want to extend her a happy birthday--I also want to thank Summer Larson; John Bradley, who is the staff director for the subcommittee; Kimberly Cowins; Stacy Zelenski; Mike Durishin; Kathleen Grove; Art Wu; Veronica Crowe; Johnathan McKay; Bernadine Dotson; Andy Napoli; and Peter Dickinson; and others, all of whom played a vital role in this legislation. I hope I did not leave anyone out.
