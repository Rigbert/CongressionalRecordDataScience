Speaker, this week, The New York Times reported that Credit Suisse, the largest Swiss bank, stated how it will overhaul compensation for its banking executives. The changes go into effect in January and include their compensation for 2009 and 2010.  Importantly, Credit Suisse ties compensation and bonuses to the firm's future performance and return on equity. In other words, if your decisions yield solid performance, you will be rewarded on that, not on arbitrary bonuses taken just because you can. I'd like to commend Credit Suisse's experience to other big banks in our country. We should follow suit in an even more rigorous reimposition of discipline.  By contrast, in a speech on September 9, 2009, Goldman Sachs' Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein put forth some principles on compensation. We asked when Goldman Sachs was going to implement those changes; we haven't heard back. But Credit Suisse already did it; they did it in line with the principles established by the G-20 in Pittsburgh earlier this year.  In their press release, Credit Suisse reaffirms the bank's commitment to fair, balanced, performance-oriented compensation policies that align long-term employee and shareholder interests.  So, once again, Wall Street could have led the charge and embraced, for the sake of our Nation, reforms of employee compensation which rewarded short-term gains and encouraged excessive risk-taking as well as increased moral hazard. Instead, Wall Street stood up only for themselves again, first, last, and always. They simply have too much power.  Moreover, Credit Suisse's approach claws back bonuses if the banks perform poorly. Why should America accept that if a bank performs poorly, that bonuses should be paid out when our taxpayers' money is propping them up and at risk? In particular, if the government saved your bank and therefore your pay despite your poor performance, why should you get a huge bonus? It makes no sense.  Congress and the administration, by allowing huge bonuses in the wake of huge bailouts, have ceded our people's power to Wall Street. These individuals are making three, four, five, six--10 times as much as the President of the United States.  Today, Obama pay czar, Kenneth Feinberg--who was not vetted by the Senate through normal procedures--is supposed to address this situation for our country. Feinberg is expected to cut the average pay only of the top earners at the seven bailed out firms, AIG, Bank of America, Citigroup, General Motors, Chrysler, GMAC, and Chrysler Financial. Remember, the American taxpayer saved them all--for example, they saved Citibank from its downfall. So their jobs were saved, their companies were saved by us, yet they get bonuses?  Some say we would be a lot worse off if this lopsided approach had not been imposed, but far too many Americans find it hard to imagine that as they have lost their jobs, their homes, their access to credit, their sense of hope, and their self-respect. Meanwhile, they see Wall Street titans enriching themselves even more and the biggest banks getting even bigger. That's what is happening across our country.  Wall Street should have been leaders for our republic, helping the Americans whose money saved them, but their culture of ordinary greed continues to stampede forward. They simply don't care about the rest of us. The distance between those elites and our people are growing, and with each step the have-nots suffer more and pay for those that have far too much.  Amidst the compensation fiasco is the core problem: These megabanks are too unaccountable and too big--some call them ``too big to fail.'' As many have said, those institutions too big to fail are actually too big to exist. It's time to break up the biggest banks, sell off their healthy parts, and never let another bank or financial institution become too big to fail. Wall Street comeuppance is long overdue.  Main Street USA is paying close attention to your shenanigans. We don't intend to take the spotlight off until justice prevails and the stampeding bulls are put back in very tight cages.                [From the New York Times, Oct. 21, 2009]                  Credit Suisse Overhauls Compensation                           (By Graham Bowley)       As Wall Street looks forward to a new era of blowout      bonuses, the unthinkable is happening, at least at Credit      Suisse, the big Swiss bank. It said on Tuesday that it would      radically change the way it paid its employees.       In a break with longstanding industry practices, Credit      Suisse intends to alter the     mix of salaries and bonuses for its top employees, tie the      bonuses to a specific financial measure and effectively claw      back the payouts if the bank's fortunes dim.       The move will not necessarily reduce compensation at Credit      Suisse, which is moving aggressively to compete with American      banks on Wall Street. But the shift nonetheless brings Credit      Suisse in line with pay practices endorsed in September by      the Group of 20 nations and puts the bank ahead of resurgent      rivals like Goldman Sachs, some of which are contemplating      similar changes but have yet to make their plans public.       Goldman, for its part, announced new pay principles in May,      which it says embrace best practices on compensation.       A year after Washington rescued the financial industry,      bonuses are once again front and center as some big banks      roar back in profitability. Goldman, for instance, is on      track to award bonuses that could rival the record payouts it      made at the height of the boom.       But the likelihood that Wall Street will enjoy big paydays      as many ordinary Americans are struggling has angered some      policy makers and created a public relations headache for      banks. Many are struggling to defuse the resentment directed      at the industry.       The Credit Suisse plan will cover roughly 2,000 employees      in the United States. Top executives will receive a greater      portion of their total compensation in the form of their      monthly cash salaries, while bonuses will be split evenly      between cash and stock.       The stock will vest over four years, and the cash portion      will pay out in three. But both components will be adjusted      based on the bank's performance over that period, with a      particular emphasis on its return on equity, a closely      watched financial measure. The performance of an executive's      business will also be taken into account.       By tying payouts to a specific measure like return on      equity, Credit Suisse will essentially be able to take back      bonuses in the event the bank's fortunes take a turn for the      worse. Credit Suisse earlier introduced a bonus plan linked      to some of the bank's troubled assets.       Claw-back provisions are becoming increasingly common on      postcrisis Wall Street. Critics say the industry's decades-     old bonus culture, which focused on short-term profits,      encouraged the excessive risk-taking that led to the crisis.      Morgan Stanley introduced provisions for a portion of its      employees' bonuses last year, and another Swiss banking      giant, UBS, imposed similar rules on deferred pay.       But Credit Suisse executives and compensation experts said      the bank's plan was the most detailed and comprehensive yet      to take back pay if senior executives--and the bank--failed      to perform adequately.       ``As far as we know, we are the first major bank to      announce a compensation structure that is consistent with the      best practices laid out at the recent G-20 summit,'' Brady W.      Dougan, chief executive, said in a statement.       The bank is also introducing a minimum share ownership      requirement for members of management committees and the      executive board to align the most senior executives' pay with      shareholders' interests, although it did not specify the new      thresholds.       Lynn A. Stout, professor of securities law at the      University of California, Los Angeles, said Credit Suisse's      four-year stock deferral was at the outer limit of what many      banks were considering.       She said many other banks were thinking of changing      compensation practices along similar lines to rein in      practices that made multimillionaires out of many financial      executives during the housing bubble.       ``You get a sense that there is a cultural shift in      boardrooms and a new awareness about looking to the longer      term,'' she said.       At a meeting of the G-20 last month, leaders agreed on      recommendations to defer bonus payouts for several years and      reduce the incentives for people to take short-term gambles,      although they avoided any explicit call for a ceiling on      remuneration. The return to big profits at some banks and big      bonus payouts, even at firms that received billion-dollar      federal bailouts, has raised questions about whether      compensation should be even more tightly controlled.       In the summer, the Securities Industry and Financial      Markets Association, a financial industry trade group, put      forward guidelines on best practices, which included tying      bonuses more closely to long-term performance and a more      independent role for bank compensation committees.       The Federal Reserve is now preparing to release its own      guidance on compensation for the more than 5,000 banks it      regulates. It would cover staff at all levels within banks,      not just at the most senior levels, and would apply to      Goldman and Morgan Stanley, which became bank holding      companies last year.       In broad scope, the new rules being considered depart from      the largely hands-off approach that dominated bank regulation      in the United States for the last three decades. They give      banks freedom in how they structure their compensation. The      rules are intended to inhibit pay plans that encourage      reckless behavior by rewarding only short-term gains. But      they would not stop million-dollar pay packages or address      issues of fairness.       The stimulus bill that President Obama signed into law this      year restricts companies that accept federal bailouts from      paying bonuses that exceed one-third of an executive's total      annual compensation.       Now, Kenneth R. Feinberg, the administration's pay czar, is      due to publish by Oct. 30 his finding on pay at the seven      major banks that still have not returned large amounts of      federal support.       His report will include judgments on the 25 most heavily      compensated executives at each of the banks--citing pay      levels and composition of pay, and whether compensation is      properly aligned with performance.                                  ____  Credit Suisse Announces Its Compensation Structure for 2009 and 2010       Zurich.--October 20, 2009.--Credit Suisse today announced      its compensation structure for 2009 and 2010. The new      structure is consistent with the guidelines for best practice      that were recently announced at the G-20 summit and reaffirms      the Bank's commitment to fair, balanced and performance-     oriented compensation policies that align long-term employee      and shareholder interests.       Brady W. Dougan, CEO of Credit Suisse Group, said: ``At a      time of strong focus on executive compensation, we are      announcing a compensation structure that enables us to strike      the right balance between paying our employees competitively,      doing what is right for our shareholders and responding      appropriately to regulatory initiatives and political as well      as public concerns.''       ``We have been using deferred, share-based compensation      instruments for many years and we continue to be committed to      these principles. They are at the heart of our compensation      structure for 2009 and 2010.''       ``The changes to our compensation system follow a number of      measures Credit Suisse has taken over the past two years in      response to changes in the financial services sector. These      measures include making adjustments to our business strategy,      significantly reducing our risk exposures, including      introducing a reduced-risk, capital-efficient business model      in the Investment Bank, and strengthening our capital base.''                        Overview of key features       The changes announced today will be effective from January      1, 2010 and will apply to compensation awarded for the year      2009. The most important features of the structure are:       1. A shift in the mix of discretionary variable (bonus) and      fixed compensation for Managing Directors and Directors,      which will result in a change in the proportion of non-     deferred compensation paid as fixed base salary.       2. The introduction of two new instruments for deferred      variable compensation awarded to Managing Directors and      Directors: Scaled Incentive Share Units (SISU) and Adjustable      Performance Plan Awards (APPA). A significant proportion of      this population's variable compensation will be delivered in      these new type of awards (50% each).       SISU are similar to Incentive Share Units (ISU), an equity      based instrument that has been in place for the past three      years. The new SISU will deliver a base share amount on a      four-year pro-rata basis. Delivery of additional shares will      depend on the average share price as well as return on equity      (RoE) over four years.       APPA is a cash-based award which will have a notional value      that adjusts upward annually based on Credit Suisse's RoE      over three years. A mechanism will adjust the outstanding      awards downward, should the business area of the employee be      loss-making.       The principles and instruments used for Managing Directors      and Directors also apply to members of the Executive Board      but not to employees at the level of Vice President or below.       In addition, Credit Suisse will introduce minimum      requirements relating to Credit Suisse share ownership for      members of Divisional and Regional Management Committees and      for the Executive Board.       Conformity with G20 guidelines and regulatory environment       The new structure and the new vehicles are consistent with      the guidelines for best compensation practices that were      recently announced at the G-20 summit and reaffirm the Bank's      commitment to fair, balanced and performance-oriented      compensation policies that align long-term employee and      shareholder interests. Credit Suisse will continue to refine      the provisions of the plan as well as the governance process      for compensation decisions and disclosure to shareholders,      based on competitive factors and the evolving regulatory      environment.            Details of the changes in compensation 2009/2010       The following is a brief summary of the changes and the new      compensation instruments announced today. A detailed      description will be included in the Group's Annual Report      2009.      Changes to base salary for Managing Directors and Directors       In order to strike an appropriate balance between fixed and      variable compensation, Credit Suisse is planning a shift in      the mix of variable and fixed compensation for Managing      Directors and Directors. This will result in the payment of      an increased proportion of compensation in the form of fixed      base salary. Employees up to and including Vice Presidents      will continue to be reviewed for potential annual salary      adjustments, consistent with previous practice.                         Variable Compensation     Cash Awards       Discretionary variable compensation will continue to be      paid in unrestricted cash for amounts below CHF 125,000 / USD      100,000 (or the local currency equivalent). For higher      amounts, table will indicate the proportion of variable      compensation subject to deferral. Deferred compensation will      be split 50/50 between SISU and APPA.                      Scaled Incentive Share Units       Scaled Incentive Share Units (SISU) are similar to the      existing Incentive Share Units (ISU) with a new element that      increases or decreases in value based on Credit Suisse's      average RoE. As with traditional ISU, the base share amount      vests annually, in the case of SISU on a four-year, pro-rata      basis. My additional shares will vest on the fourth      anniversary of the award date, based on the price of Credit      Suisse Group AG registered shares. A new feature will link      the final number of additional shares to an additional      factor: If Credit Suisse's average RoE over the four-year      period is higher than a pre-set target, the number of      additional shares will be adjusted upwards, and if it is      below the target, the number of additional shares will      decrease.                   Adjustable Performance Plan Awards       Adjustable Performance Plan Awards (APPA) will have a      notional cash value subject to a three-year, pro-rata vesting      schedule. Awards adjust upward on an annual basis using      Credit Suisse's RoE in the respective year as a multiplier.      However, should a business area be loss-making, outstanding      APP awards held by employees of that business area will be      adjusted downwards. The metrics within the revenue divisions      will be based on each business area's financial contribution.      The metrics for Shared Services, Regional Management and      embedded support functions within the divisions will be based      on the financial performance of Credit Suisse Group.                                  ____                     [From Reuters, Oct. 22, 2009]                 Czar to Substantially Cut Pay: Summers                  (By Caren Bohan and Karey Wutkowski)       Washington (Reuters).--Top White House economic adviser      Lawrence Summers said on Wednesday the administration's pay      czar will ``substantially reduce'' the paychecks at firms      that have received billions of taxpayer dollars.       ``With respect to the companies that have been major      recipients of federal support, Ken Feinberg is reviewing them      . . . (and) will, I suspect, produce an outcome where they      will be very substantially reduced,'' Summers told the      Reuters Washington Summit.       Feinberg, the pay czar appointed by President Barack Obama      in June, is expected to cut total compensation by an average      of 50 percent for the top earners at seven bailed-out firms,      sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.       The administration has faced public outrage, as Wall Street      firms that were recently propped up by federal assistance      have brought their bonuses back to pre-crisis levels even as      the general population faces the highest unemployment level      in 26 years.       Summers said Feinberg's rulings--which are expected to be      publicly released in the coming days--will ensure taxpayers'      interests come before those of shareholders and incumbent      management at the beleaguered firms.       The seven bailed-out firms under Feinberg's jurisdiction      are AIG, Bank of America, Citigroup, General Motors,      Chrysler, GMAC and Chrysler Financial.                   SEES FINANCIAL REFORM BY YEAR END       Summers also said he was still hopeful that legislation to      broadly rewrite U.S. financial regulations would pass by the      end of the year.       ``I don't see any reason why it can't get done this year,''      Summers said.       Analysts following the debate on Capitol Hill have become      increasingly skeptical that Obama can meet his goal of      enacting it by year-end. Some say that early next year might      be a more realistic time frame.       While some critics say the bill is not robust enough,      Summers said he believed the changes would have a chance to      have a major impact on financial stability for years to come.       He said that while the administration wants to guard      against efforts by the financial industry to water down the      bill, he said the main principles behind it were not at risk.       ``I've always put this in terms of some core principles,''      Summers said.       If an institution is big enough and interconnected enough      that its failure could damage the financial system, then it      must have a regulator that is accountable, he said. ``And      there has to be a plan in place for managing your failure if      it comes.''       Summers said the proposals under consideration achieve that      goal.                            TAXPAYERS FIRST       The administration is also committed to fundamentally      reforming pay, starting at the firms that have received      multiple government bailouts, Summers said.       ``It is important where taxpayers have made a central      contribution to make sure that taxpayer interests are being      put first rather than those of shareholders and certainly      rather than those of incumbent management and that's why Ken      Feinberg is involved in reviewing compensation levels at the      companies where the TARP has made the most major      investments.''       Officials have also proposed a broad crackdown on pay,      including giving shareholders more say on compensation      packages, forcing firms to disclose more on their pay      practices and encouraging regulators to shut down risky      compensation schemes.       ``With respect to companies that are not currently      recipients of major support, the focus is really going to be      more on process and more on the incentives they create,''      Summers said.       Amid the rhetoric of a strong clampdown on compensation      that encourages risk taking, the administration has been      careful to say it does not believe in setting explicit caps.       Summers said the administration is sensitive to the need      for firms to keep top talent and remain competitive, while      not letting Wall Street return to its old ways.       ``We are concerned that some in the financial sector would      like to go back to the regulatory nonculture and risk      management nonculture of the recent past. That wouldn't be      acceptable to us,'' he said. ``But the president's always      said that we think it's very important that people succeed in      America so framing this in terms of the goal being to reduce      profits or to eliminate compensation, that would not be our      approach.''                                  ____                 [From Financial Times, Oct. 21, 2009]              UK Bank Governor Calls for Lenders' Break-Up                            (By Chris Giles)       Banks should be split into separate utility companies and      risky ventures, governor of the Bank of England Mervyn King      urged last night, saying it was a ``delusion'' to think      tougher regulation would prevent future financial crises.       Mr. King's call for a break-up of banks to prevent them      becoming ``too important to fail'' puts him sharply at odds      with the direction of domestic and international banking      reform.       Mr. King borrowed Churchillian language in a speech in      Scotland to highlight the burden banks had placed on      taxpayers. ``Never in the field of financial endeavour has so      much money been owed by so few to so many. And, one might      add, so far with little real reform.''       The forcefulness of Mr King's language reflects his belief      that the structure of the banks needs to be put firmly on the      international regulatory agenda, where focus has been on      strengthening capital and regulating bankers' pay. The Bank      governor wants to see the utility aspects of banking--payment      systems and deposit taking--hived off from more speculative      ventures such as proprietary trading. ``There are those who      claim that such proposals are impractical. It is hard to see      why,'' he said.       Although he said ideas to force banks to hold debt that      automatically turns into equity in a crisis were ``worth a      try'', he downplayed their likely effect. ``The belief that      appropriate regulation can ensure that speculative activities      do not result in failures is a delusion.''       Many experts believe the governor will get his way on      separation but by default rather than by design, because      proposals for tighter capital regulations on risky parts of      banking will make these unprofitable and banks will choose to      ditch them.                          ____________________
