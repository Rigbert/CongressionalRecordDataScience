 President, what this letter simply does is make it clear that DOT is willing and ready to discuss this matter, but it also makes clear that there are other issues, especially in aviation, as the Senator from Alaska has said, that really have to be worked through as we move toward this, and I ask that we have those considerations.  Again, I hope the language that Senator Stevens has proposed is something that can be worked out because I think that would be amenable to all of us.
