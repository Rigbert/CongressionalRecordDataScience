Speaker, I rise to recognize the contributions to our Nation by Christine Taylor of Grover Hill, OH. In June of this year, Christine was elected State President of the Ladies Auxiliary to the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States on June 30, 2002.  Born in Eye, Suffolk, England and the oldest of the four children, Christine immigrated with her family to the United States in 1955. She graduated from Oxnard (California) High School in 1964 and became a naturalized citizen the following year.  She married Roger Taylor, a Navy Seabee veteran in the Vietnam War, in August 1966 and they moved to Ohio. Roger and Christine are the proud parents of three children, Kent, Jennifer, and Matt, and the grandparents of Krystal and Dustin Taylor.  Since 1975, Chris has been employed as a legal secretary and office manager for the DeMuth Law Office in Paulding, OH.  In 1974 she joined the Ladies Auxiliary to the V.F.W. as a charter member of the Grover Hill Auxiliary 2873, under the eligibility of her husband. Serving as the auxiliary's first Treasurer, she progressed through the various chairs to serve as Auxiliary President in 1980-1982. She currently serves as Auxiliary Trustee and program chairman.  Chris's activity on the District level started when she was asked by her friend, Susie Moon, to serve as District Secretary in 1981-1982. Elected as Conductress in 1985, she progressed through the district chairs to serve as District #1 President in 1988-1989, being named as runner-up Outstanding District President for that year.  Commencing in 1987-1988, Chris served as State chairman for number programs, including National Home, Youth Activities and the Voice of Democracy, Community Service, Cancer Aid & Research, Americanism, Buddy Poppy, Safety, Hospital, and Historian, in addition to serving as Assistant Conductress and Chief of Staff.  Elected as Department Guard in 1977, Chris has served as a State officer, culminating in her election and installation as the leader of the Ohio V.F.W. Ladies Auxiliary. During her term of office, Chris will lead the 51,600 members of the Ohio delegation under her theme of ``Teamwork--The Key to Success.''  Mr. Speaker, I salute the dedication, patriotism, and commitment of Christine Taylor and congratulate her on her election as leader of the Ohio V.F.W. Ladies Auxiliary.                          ____________________
