President, I again want to commend the Senator from Wisconsin for his leadership on this issue. It has been a great pleasure to work with him. I mentioned we have 24 cosponsors of the amendment. I did want to acknowledge that Senator Lieberman and Senator Coleman have played important roles in drafting this bill, and both the chairman and the ranking minority member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Warner and Senator Levin, are cosponsors as well.  Finally, I want to thank the two floor managers, Senator Hutchison and Senator Feinstein, for working with us on this bill. Senator Feinstein is also a cosponsor of it, and I very much appreciate Senator Hutchison assisting us to bring this to the floor. So I say thank you to my colleagues.  Mr. President, if there is no further debate on the amendment, I ask that the amendment be brought to a voice vote.
