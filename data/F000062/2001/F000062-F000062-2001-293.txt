 President, today a new government has been formed in Israel under the leadership of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, with Shimon Peres as Foreign Minister and the broad-based participation of many across Israel's political spectrum.  I would like to take a few minutes today to share my assessment of the present situation, where things stand, and what this may mean for U.S. policy in the region. I rise today as one who has supported the peace process, believed that a peace agreement was possible, and who has worked in the Senate, along with many of my colleagues, to see that the United States played an active role in helping Israel and the Palestinians seek peace.  Prime Minister Ehud Barak was elected two years ago to make peace and to bring about an ``end of the conflict'' with both Syria and the Palestinians. He was elected with a mandate to complete the Oslo process, a goal at the time supported by the majority of the people of Israel.  Over the past two years Prime Minister Barak tried, heroically and energetically, to achieve a comprehensive peace with both parties.  Indeed, it has been said I believe, that Prime Minister Barak went further than any other Israeli Prime Minister in an attempt to reach a comprehensive agreement with the Palestinians which includes:  The creation of a Palestinian state;  Palestinian control of all of Gaza;  Palestinian control of approximately 94 to 95 percent of the West Bank, and territorial compensation for most of the other five percent;  A division of Jerusalem, with Palestinian control over the Arab neighborhoods in East Jerusalem and the possibility of a Palestinian capitol in Jerusalem; and  Shared sovereignty arrangements for the Temple Mount.  The issue of Palestinian refugees, was addressed with tens of thousands of Palestinians to be allowed into Israel as part of a family reunification program, and compensation in the tens of billions of dollars provided to other Palestinian refugees as well.  Not only was the Palestinian response to these unprecedented offers ``no,'' but, even as Prime Minister Barak attempted to engage Chairman Yasser Arafat at the negotiation table, the Palestinians took to a campaign of violence in the streets, and threatened to unilaterally declare an independent Palestinian state:  When the violence began, the Fatah's militia, the Tanzim, fired upon Israelis with submachine guns. The Fatah and the Tanzim have been active in the violence--even encouraging its escalation--to this day;  Chairman Arafat freed a number of Hamas terrorists who instantly turned around and vowed violence against Israel;  The Palestinian media, under the control of the Palestinian Authority, has been used to disseminate inciting material, providing encouragement to damage holy Jewish sites, to kill Israelis, and carry out acts of terror; and,  Palestinian schools were closed down by the Palestinian Authority allowing Palestinian children to participate in the riots and violence.  And in reaction, all too often, Israel, too, has resorted to violence in an effort to protect its security and safeguard the lives of its people.  This new Intifadah has been characterized by a level of hate and violence that, frankly, I did not believe possible in view of the extensive concessions Israel had offered.  And it is clear, I believe, that much of this campaign of violence, this new Intifadah which continues to this day, has been coordinated and planned.  Because I was at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos two months ago which was also attended by Shimon Peres and Yasser Arafat, I read with great interest Tom Friedman's op-ed in The New York Times 3 weeks ago.  As Mr. Friedman's column reports, when Mr. Peres extended the olive branch to Mr. Arafat at Davos, ``Mr. Arafat torched it.''  I urge all of my colleagues to read Thomas Friedman's op-ed article: ``Sharon, Arafat and Mao,'' which I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Feb. 8, 2001]                         Sharon, Arafat and Mao                        (By Thomas L. Friedman)       So I'm at the Davos World Economic Forum two weeks ago, and      Shimon Peres walks by. One of the reporters with him asks me      if I'm going to hear Mr. Peres and Yasir Arafat address the      1,000 global investors and ministers attending Davos. No, I      tell him, I have a strict rule, I'm only interested in what      Mr. Arafat says to his own people in Arabic. Too bad, says      the reporter, because the fix is in. Mr. Peres is going to      extend an olive branch to Mr. Arafat, Mr. Arafat is going to      do the same back and the whole love fest will get beamed back      to Israel to boost the peace process and Ehud Barak's re-     election. Good, I'll catch it on TV, I said.       Well, Mr Peres did extend the olive branch, as planned, but      Mr. Arafat torched it. Reading in Arabic from a prepared      text, Mr. Arafat denounced Israel for its ``facist military      aggression'' and ``colonialist armed expansionism,'' and its      policies of ``murder, persecution, assassination, destruction      and devastation.''       Mr. Arafat's performance at Davos was a seminal event, and      is critical for understanding Ariel Sharon's landslide      election. What was Mr. Arafat saying by this speech, with Mr.      Peres sitting by his side? First, he was saying that there is      no difference between Mr. Barak and Mr. Sharon. Because      giving such a speech on the eve of the Israeli election, in      the wake of an 11th-hour Barak bid to conclude a final deal      with the Palestinians in Taba, made Mr. Barak's far-reaching      offer to Mr. Arafat look silly. Moreover, Mr. Arafat was      saying that there is no difference between Mr. Peres and Mr.      Sharon, because giving such a speech just after the warm      words of Mr. Peres made Mr. Peres look like a dupe, as all      the Israeli papers reported. Finally, at a time when      Palestinians are starving for work, Mr. Arafat's subliminal      message to the global investors was: Stay away.       That's why the press is asking exactly the wrong question      about the Sharon election. They're asking, who is Ariel      Sharon? The real question is, who is Yasir Arafat? The press      keeps asking: Will Mr. Sharon become another Charles de      Gaulle, the hard-line general who pulled the French Army out      of Algeria? Or will he be Richard Nixon, the anti-Communist      who made peace with Communist China? Such questions totally      miss the point.       Why? Because Israel just had its de Gaulle. His name was      Ehud Barak. Mr. Barak was Israel's most decorated soldier. He      abstained in the cabinet vote over the Oslo II peace accords.      But once in office he changed 180 degrees. He offered Mr.      Arafat 94 percent of the West Bank for a Palestinian state,      plus territorial compensation for most of the other 6      percent, plus half of Jerusalem, plus restitution and      resettlement in Palestine for Palestinian refugees. And Mr.      Arafat not only said no to all this, but described Israel as      ``fascist'' as Mr. Barak struggled for re-election. It would      be as though de Gaulle had offered to withdraw from Algeria      and the Algerians said: ``Thank you. You're a fascist. Of      course we'll take all of Algeria, but we won't stop this      conflict until we get Bordeaux, Marseilles and Nice as      well.''       If the Palestinians don't care who Ariel Sharon is, why      should we? If Mr. Arafat wanted an Israeli leader who would      not force him to make big decisions, which he is incapable of      making, why should we ask whether Mr. Sharon is going to be      de Gaulle and make him a big offer? What good is it for      Israel to have a Nixon if the Palestinians have no Mao?       The Olso peace process was about a test. It was about      testing whether Israel had a Palestinian partner for a secure      and final peace. It was a test that Israel could afford, it      was a test that the vast majority of Israelis wanted and it      was a test Mr. Barak courageously took to the limits of the      Israeli political consensus--and beyond. Mr. Arafat      squandered that opportunity. Eventually, Palestinians will      ask for a makeup exam. And eventually Israelis may want to      give it to them, if they again see a chance to get this      conflict over with. But who knows what violence and pain will      be inflicted in the meantime?       All we know is that for now, the Oslo test is over. That is      what a vast majority of Israelis said in this election. So      stop asking whether Mr. Sharon will become de Gaulle. That is      not why Israelis elected him. They elected him to be Patton.      They elected Mr. Sharon because they know exactly who he is,      and because seven years of Oslo have taught them exactly who      Yasir Arafat is.
