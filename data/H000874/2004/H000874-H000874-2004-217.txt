Leader.  Mr. Leader, lastly, the budget enforcement bill, is that going to be on the calendar at any time soon?  Mr. DeLAY. As the gentleman knows, in March the Committee on the Budget passed a bill that would extend statutory pay-as-you-go rules on new mandatory spending to ensure that new programs are offset by spending reductions. In addition, the bill would instate statutory spending caps on statutory programs. Now that the House has passed the budget resolution conference report, we look forward to quick consideration of this bill.  We have a very busy schedule planned for next week. We had planned on bringing this bill up next week and still may do so. But we may not be able to consider this bill next week; and, therefore, we most probably would schedule it for the following week.
