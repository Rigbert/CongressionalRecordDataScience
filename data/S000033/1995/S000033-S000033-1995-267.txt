 Chairman, this is a bad bill and a very unfair bill. This is, in fact, a bill based precisely on the principles of class warfare. That is exactly what it is.  I say to my colleagues, ``When you take from the poor, and you give to the rich, that's class warfare. When you take from hungry children and give to profitable multinational corporations, that's class warfare.''  Mr. Chairman, half of the individual tax breaks in this bill go to families earning $100,000 a year, and this bill cuts back on nutrition programs for hungry children. That is class warfare. A quarter of the tax breaks go to people earning $200,000 a year, and the bill cuts back on loans to college students whose families today cannot afford the high cost of college. That is class warfare.
