  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, April Fool's Day has come early to the United States House of Representatives. The Republicans are in charge. They control everything, and in the last 5 years our debt has increased 60 percent to $8 trillion. That is $27,000 for every American. Well, not for every American, only for working Americans because the rich are exempt from taxes.  What they are talking about here, the hard-working Americans, the only people who got a pay raise last year, the people who earn over $1.3 million a year.  Madam Speaker, 99 percent of the people in this country had their real incomes go down last year, but not that group. That is who the Republicans want to protect here. It is trickle-down economics. They say we need it now more than ever. How else are we going to recover from Hurricane Katrina? They want to give the wealthiest among us, the top one-tenth of 1 percent, the millionaires, tax breaks, and they will trickle-down on America.  Well, the people of the Southeast have been trickled down upon. And, in fact, some of them drowned because of the incompetence of these people.                          ____________________[Page H8923]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                 APRIL FOOL'S DAY COMES EARLY TO HOUSE  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
