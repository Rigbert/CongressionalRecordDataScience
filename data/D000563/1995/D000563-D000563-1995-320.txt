Speaker, it is a very common thing after a congressional break for Members to come back to the Congress and reflect on, what they have heard at home. I have to say that, although there were many opportunities for me to meet and discuss local issues with my constituents, our attention was focused on a city several hundred miles away, as was the attention, not only of the entire Nation, but the world. Of course, I am speaking of the tragedy which occurred in Oklahoma City.  In the rubble of that Federal building in Oklahoma City we find both tragedy and hope. And, as we look at the events of the last several days, I think we can see literally the very best and the very worst in our Nation. In terms of the best, the courage of these rescue workers, to think that they would literally risk their lives on a day-to-day basis to plow through this rubble in the hopes of finding someone alive or, at the very least, to bring out the remains of those who have passed away, men and women who frankly could never be paid enough for the sacrifice and courage which they are showing. The strength of families praying for the missing; we have seen it so often on television and accounts in the media, the mourning of those families who lost a loved one as a result of this tragedy.  As my colleagues know, on the floor of this House of Representatives Federal employees are often vilified as just faceless bureaucrats, numbers on a page, people to be moved around here and there in the budget debate, and yet we find out they are real human beings, going to work every day, doing something for their country, and in this instance literally giving their lives because of what they have shown in terms of sacrifice and commitment to this country.  And what a story of Oklahoma City. I have only visited there once, had a nice impression of the town, but little did I know the inner strength of that American community that would rally and come together, black and white, rich and poor, to help those who were touched by this tragedy. And across the country so many people were inspired by this tragedy to do a little bit more, to become a community, to become a Nation. In my own district a local individual, Don Eastep, Jr., of Virden, IL, went down to Oklahoma City, volunteered, went into the rubble, risked his life in order to try and help in that situation. I think we all watched in awe at the prayer service that was held in Oklahoma City. Gov. Frank Keating, a fellow who went to Georgetown University a year ahead of me, did an exemplary job as the leader of that State. He welcomed President Clinton, who made very eloquent remarks at that prayer service, and then, of course, the Reverend Billy Graham, who called on the United States to begin the healing process.  These were the very, very best of America coming forward at a time of great trial and tragedy. But unfortunately we have also seen the worst. It is still hard for me to believe that this heinous crime was the work of an American citizen, and of course that is the allegation. What kind of demented mind filled with hatred would bring a person to the point where they would destroy innocent lives, as apparently occurred here at the hands of another American citizen?  And we have heard since this event on television and radio the venomous rhetoric of those who would find some rationale or support this idea that the only way to express oneself politically is through violence. We have heard talk show hosts, the lunatic fringe among them, and most of them are not; most them are in the middle, speaking to the American people, as they should, under the Constitution, but there are a handful, and we all know it, who just go entirely too far. We have heard them and their divisive language testing the limits of free speech in this country.  President Clinton was right when he said they have the right to speak. We must fight to protect that. But those of us who disagree also have an obligation to speak out, too. As my colleagues know, I think, if one needs a gun or a bomb to express their political point of view in America, they really have no place in this Nation. They have really crossed the line.  I hope in the weeks ahead, as we contemplate this tragedy and what it means for America and its future, that both Democrats and Republicans can come together and draw a very clear line, and say we will not accept violence on the right or on the left as political expression. We will make it very clear that we want to protect our Bill of Rights, but we will not allow those who will turn to violence to be in any way honored. I think, Mr. Speaker, if we do that on a bipartisan basis, the American people will have new confidence that we, too, understand in Congress the need to come together as a Nation. It is time for both parties to draw that clear line and do everything in our power to make certain that another Oklahoma City tragedy never occurs.                          ____________________
