Mr. Chairman, he who oppresses the poor shows contempt for their Maker, but whoever is kind to the needy honors God. Words from Proverbs.  Mr. Chairman, the Republican budget is unfair to the neediest and most vulnerable Americans. In addition to being unfair, the Republican budget is also immoral. Through its cuts to CDC, NIH and veterans health care programs, this budget ignores the health care crisis that our Nation faces today.  Mr. Chairman, the Republican budget is not only unfair and immoral, it is also unreasonable. Pell grants and public school programs get no new funding.  Assisting our neediest and most vulnerable Americans is not a choice, it isa moral obligation. By reducing funding for public housing and food stamps, the Republican budgets falls short of this moral obligation.  The Republican budget is unfair, immoral and unreasonable. Both the Democratic and the CBC alternative budgets provide a better way, a more excellent way to help all of our people. I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the Democratic and CBC alternatives, to vote ``no'' on the Republican budget resolution.
