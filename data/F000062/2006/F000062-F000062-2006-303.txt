 President, I would like to make a couple of comments.  I very much appreciate my service and Senator Cornyn's service on the same committee and have great respect for him and also for Senator Martinez who has introduced the Hagel-Martinez plan with the best of motives. Senator Cornyn said we shouldn't throw up our hands. I am not throwing up my hands. I want strong borders. I voted for a fence. I believe we should put National Guard on the borders. We provide 12,500 additional Border Patrol, 2,500 border inspectors, over $1 billion of equipment for the border. We should have our border enforced. We should get the help of Mexico to enforce it.  Secondly, with this plan, there is no jumping in line ahead of anyone waiting legally for a green card.
