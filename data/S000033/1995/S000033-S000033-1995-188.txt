 Let me just ask the gentleman this question: Every day we hear about the crisis of our national debt, every day, every day, and we all understand the importance of that. Is the gentleman suggesting that one of the major ways the Republicans are proposing to deal with our national debt is to give huge tax breaks? Is that a strategy to deal with the deficit?  Mr. DeFAZIO. We are revisiting trickle-down economics, the theory that, if we give those people who are much smarter than we are, who earn, you know, over $200,000 a year and control these corporations more money, that they will create more jobs and the [[Page H6038]] effects will trickle down. We are right back to the failed trickle-down policies of the mid-1980's. Those policies brought us record debt, record deficits and, as the gentleman pointed out, consistently caused the decline in the standard of living of middle-income families.
