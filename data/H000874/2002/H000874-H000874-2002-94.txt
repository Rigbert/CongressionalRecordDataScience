 Madam Chairman, because the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Menendez) was concerned under the unanimous consent that he might not get the time to speak, and he is not a member of the Committee on Appropriations, in fairness, my understanding with the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Istook), and I think everybody's understanding, was that the proponents would have 6 minutes and the opponents would have 6 minutes, so that my only intent, Madam Chairman, is to ensure that the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Menendez) get his 3 minutes. I also want to ensure that the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Roemer) gets his 3 minutes. So I am not claiming the time.
