For the last decade, intelligence officials have been relying on secret interpretations of their authorities that have been very different from the plain reading of public law. The public has seen the consequences of that, and they are angry because the American people know we can have policies that promote both security and liberty.  I would just like to ask a question of my colleague with the respect to what the implications would be of hollowing out the good work you and Senator Leahy have done with respect to having more transparency and both sides making a case on key questions with respect to the FISA Court. I would like to note that the majority leader's second amendment delays implementation of other important reforms that you all have dealt with.  For example, one question I was asked about at a townhall meeting just this past weekend in Tillamook, OR, where I was, is people were concerned about what would we do to protect our Nation when there was an emergency. You all, in your good work, have, in effect, said you would strengthen the language to make sure that when there was an emergency--government officials already can issue an emergency authorization to get the business records and you would then seek court approval, and you all strengthen that.  All of you on the Judiciary Committee said: We are going to provide another measure of security for the American people; in other words, we are going to protect their liberty and we are going to strengthen their security. It looks to me like the combination of the majority leader's two amendments scaling back the reforms, the transparency reforms in the FISA Court, and delaying the strengthening of emergency authorities that can protect the American people without jeopardizing their liberty would really roll back the kind of reforms the American people want.  I would be interested in my colleague's reaction to that.
