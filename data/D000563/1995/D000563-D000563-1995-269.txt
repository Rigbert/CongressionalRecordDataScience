I am sorry I had to cut him short, as we have run out of time this evening in this important special order. Perhaps we can resume it later on at a different time.  If you listened to the debate in Washington over the last 6 months, you would be convinced that all we are talking about tonight are faceless Federal bureaucrats meddling into the affairs of business people, making their life miserable with fines and inspections and all sorts of minutiae that in fact weighs heavily on their profit statements.  What I hope we have conveyed tonight in this special order is we are talking about something much larger. We are talking about dignity of workers. We are talking about safety in the workplace. We are talking about a history in America of danger in the workplace that we do not want to see repeated again.  The fact is since OSHA was created in 1970, we have seen deaths on the job in America cut in half. In factories deaths on the job have been cut by more than half. In construction, deaths have been cut by 60 percent. Can OSHA be improved? Yes, it can. But for those who address this issue in terms of terminating the Federal responsibility and the Federal authority to help protect workers and their families in the workplace, I would say they are really going in the wrong direction.  I hope that the special order this evening, the stories that you have heard and I guess the information that we have shared with you, will help people to understand that the debate which goes on on the floor of this House of Representatives each day is a relevant and important debate to every working family in America. We hope that those on the Republican side of the aisle who take an extreme position of doing away with this Federal responsibility will stop and think twice about the legacy of pain and the legacy of death which we have seen in America's workplace, certainly something we never want to see repeated again.                          ____________________
