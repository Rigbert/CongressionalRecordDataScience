 President, will the Senator yield for a brief comment? Because I know the Senator from West Virginia wishes to speak on this.  I want to be clear. I think the recommendation and the suggestion of the Senator from Alaska, which is consistent with what the Senator from West Virginia and he both said today to the President, is a good idea. I personally am prepared to accept that.  I just add one caveat. I need another 3 or 4 minutes to run the traps. I want to make it clear, I accept this. I accept this personally. I think it makes sense. But I have calls in to several of our colleagues as to whether or not, since they were part of this on our side, they will go with this. I am confident. I believe they will. But I just want to be absolutely clear, and I think we should proceed. But I see the Senator from West Virginia who wishes to speak. I think it is a great and significant commitment that he has made with regard to the nonpermissive piece of this. I think it makes sense.
