We addressed it first during the budget consideration when we were going to increase impact aid by $300 million. Unfortunately, the appropriators have brought it down to an amount a little less than half that.  Democrats and Republicans have set a goal so we will have impact aid fully funded sometime in the next 4 or 5 years. This will bring the amount of basic support for impact aid equal to the House figure.  That is essentially the amendment.
