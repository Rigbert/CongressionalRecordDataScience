Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. I will close as I began. First of all, I do not adopt the premise it was an irresponsible budget that was adopted. The gentleman from Illinois has acknowledged that these expenditures are good. Secondly, the gentleman from Georgia asked, where do these numbers come from? Frankly they came from the President, adopted by the United States Senate, as well, and I think they ought to be adopted by us. Thirdly, I would say to my colleagues, this is about real children, disadvantaged children, 2.4 million children who will be served if this amendment passes that will not be served at the level you suggest.  Now, maybe you think there are not 2.4 million children in America who need help. Maybe you think like, as the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi) said, that it is those 400 people who are going to get $200 billion under the tax cut that are more important than those 2.4 million children. That is quite a balance; 400 very rich people getting $200 billion while we cut $1.8 billion in this amendment for 2.4 million children. What kind of Nation has that kind of priority? It is a Nation that will not long succeed. It is a Nation whose children will not compete effectively in world markets. It is a Nation who will see itself increasingly becoming a Nation of the rich and the poor. Let us adopt this amendment. Let us set our priorities straight. Let us act to help those 2.4 million children.
