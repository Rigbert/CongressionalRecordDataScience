President, I rise today to introduce the Small Business Y2K Compliance Act of 1999. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Dodd, the ranking member of the Senate Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem, as an original cosponsor of this measure.  Our legislation would offer small businesses a tax deduction of up to $40,000 towards the expenses of purchasing and installing Year 2000 compliant computer hardware and software in 1999. In addition, our bill would reward those small businesses that have acted responsibly by allowing an accelerated depreciation of up to $40,000 for the purchase and installation of Year 2000 compliant computer hardware and software made in 1997 and 1998. These tax incentives have been endorsed by thousands of small business owners at last year's White House Conference on Small Business, the American Small Business Alliance and the Small Business Administration.  Unfortunately, not all small businesses are doing enough to address the year 2000 issue because of a lack of resources in many cases. They face Y2K problems both directly and indirectly through their suppliers, customers and financial institutions. As recently as last October a representative of the National Federation of Independent Businesses testified: ``A fifth of them do not understand that there is a Y2K problem. . . . They are not aware of it. A fifth of them are currently taking action. A fifth have not taken action but plan to take action, and two-fifths are aware of the problem but do not plan to take any action prior to the year 2000.''  Indeed, the Small Business Administration recently warned that 330,000 small businesses are at risk of closing down as a result of Y2K problems, and another 370,000 could be temporarily or permanently hobbled.  Federal and State government agencies have entire departments workingon this problem. Utilities, financial institutions, telecommunications companies, and other large companies have information technology divisions working to make corrections to keep their systems running. They have armies of workers--but small businesses do not.  Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, from the city corner market to the family farm to the small-town doctor. In my home State of Vermont, 98 percent of the businesses are small businesses with limited resources. That is why it is so important to provide small businesses with the resources to correct their Y2K problems now.  A few months ago, I hosted a Y2K conference in Vermont to help small businesses prepare for 2000. Hundreds of small business owners from across Vermont attended the conference to learn how to minimize or eliminate their Y2K computer problems. Vermonters are working hard to identify their Y2K vulnerabilities and prepare action plans to resolve them. They should be encouraged and assisted in these important efforts.  This is the right approach. We have to fix as many of these problems ahead of time as we can. Ultimately, the best business policy and the best defense against any Y2K-based lawsuits is to be Y2K compliant.  That is why it is so important to provide small businesses with the resources to correct their Y2K problems now. Our legislation would provide targeted tax incentives to encourage small businesses round the country in their Y2K remediation efforts. Our bill encourages Y2K compliance now to avoid computer problems next year.  Moreover, the tax incentives in our legislation would have a negligible revenue cost. Indeed, the Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that companion legislation introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Karen Thurman, H.R. 179, would reduce revenue by $171 million from 1990-2003, but would increase revenues by the same $171 million from 2004-2008. Thus, this bill is fiscally prudent as well.  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor and support the ``Small Business Y2K Compliance Act of 1999.''  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 962       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
