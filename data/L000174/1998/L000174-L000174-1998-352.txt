President, while the leader is on the floor--if the Senator from Iowa will withhold for just a moment--I know the leader is trying to get a schedule together. I just wanted to note, because there has been some question over here on this side of the aisle, that on S. 2037, the WIPO bill, or the digital new millennium copyright legislation, there is absolutely no objection to going forward with it. I suggest that there will be unanimous support for it over here. I just wanted to advise the distinguished majority leader of that fact.
