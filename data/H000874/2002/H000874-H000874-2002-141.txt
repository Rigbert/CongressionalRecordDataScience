Speaker, I thank the distinguished ranking member of the Committee on Ways and Means.  There may be no more serious issue that we consider on the floor of this House this year. The gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs. Capito) that just spoke said why it was so important. She is right. This issue is critically important to the women that she mentioned, critically important to the individuals that the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Mrs. Johnson) mentioned, and I would say critically important to the citizens that every one of the women on this side of the aisle represent and came and said they were concerned about and, therefore, are not supporting this rule.  The gentlewoman from Connecticut said she was polite to those people, and she was. But I suggest to the gentlewoman that this rule is not polite. This rule denigrates the importance and seriousness of this issue.  When your side took over in 1995, Gerald Solomon, the then-chairman of the Committee on Rules, said this, ``The guiding principals will be openness and fairness. The Rules Committee will no longer rig the procedure to contrive a pre-determined outcome. From now on the Rules Committee will clear the stage for debate and let the House work its will.''  You have, of course, retreated from that statement. You have not honored the seriousness of this issue.                              {time}  2130  The gentlewoman from Connecticut who the gentleman from California (Mr. Thomas) says wrote this bill will not have the opportunity to defend this bill against an alternative that can be fully debated as to whether or not the seniors to whom she refers will, in fact, be protected.  The gentlewoman served with Bill Gradison. Bill Gradison for those who are relatively new to the House was a member of the Committee on Ways and Means and one of the senior members of the Committee on Ways and Means, and then Bill Gradison left here, and he went to head up the Insurance Industries Association in this country.
