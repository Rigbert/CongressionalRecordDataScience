 Mr. Krauthammer is a very bright fellow. The thesis of his piece is that no one really listened to what George W. had to say. Everybody misunderstood what he meant when he stood up, with Henry Kissinger and Colin Powell and George Shultz standing behind him, and laid out his position, at least his position on nuclear weapons and on national missile defense.  He said that what Governor Bush really means is that this is a new era. No more arms control, period. START I, START II, START III, START anything, START V--no more. He ends his article by saying we should make our judgments about whether to reduce our weapons or to increase our weapons, or whether to build a national missile defense, irrespective of anything other than what we believe should be done at that moment. And that dictates, he says, the end of arms control.  That is what this debate is about. Cut through all the haze here. The problem with the Senator from Delaware, the Senator from Michigan, the Senator from Nebraska, and my two colleagues on the floor now, is that we know too much about this. We are like nuclear theologians. I have been doing this for 28 years. I used to know what the PSI of the Soviet SS-18 missile silo was. That is very valuable information for someone to have to walk around with. The old joke is that we have forgotten more about these details than most people ever learned. In the process, we also forgot what this is really about.  What is the logic of the Warner amendment? The logic is that this President cannot enter into any more agreements. Really he doesn't need an agreement to go down, but what they are worried about is that he could decide, either with Russian President Putin or without Putin, to take numbers down to the START II levels, and that that will be offered as a sign of good faith to Putin that the President, in fact, is ready to go lower, which is what the Russians want in a START III agreement.  This is about arms control. Let's cut through all the malarkey. Before this next 12 months are over, in the next administration--Democrat or Republican--it will finally be out in the open. This place will be divided between those who say that arms control has a place in our strategic doctrine and those who say it has no place. We are getting there. We are getting there, inching to it. They are feeling their way, I say to my friend from Nebraska, feeling their way around this because, up until now, arms control has been the Holy Grail of both Republicans who are informed and Democrats who are informed. Nobody except the wackos has been flat opposed to any arms control. But there is a feeling emerging in the intellectual community on the right, as well, that what we should be doing as the United States of America, because of our overwhelming military political and economic superiority relative to the rest of the world, not just the Russians--is taking advantage of the luxury of dictating outcomes without consultation.  My friend from Virginia knows that a lot of his friends and my acquaintances in think tanks on the right believe what I just said. I am not saying the Senator does. But that is the genesis, the root, the cause of this debate--a legitimate debate to have. But they are just a little afraid, in this election year, to say they don't like arms control: If we are elected, no more arms control. We will adjust, or not adjust, to the levels that we choose independently, not in the context of a negotiation with anyone else. That is what this is about, with all due respect to my friends who support the amendment; even if they don't think that is what it is about, that it is just logical, rational, political purpose.  Think what you are saying. You are telling the President of the United States of America: you can't go down--although, by the way, constitutionally we probably can't do this. He is Commander in Chief. Nobody has been more aware than I of the prerogative of the Senate as it relates to the war clause and the Constitutional relationship of the authority between the executive and legislative branches relative to the ability to use force and/or control the forces we have.  The reason that there was a provision on the Commander in Chief was not to allow Presidents to go to war unilaterally. It was rather to make sure Congresses didn't tell George Washington he could or could not move troops out of Valley Forge. They had a bad experience during the Articles of Confederation. So they wrote it in saying, hey, don't tell the Commander in Chief he can't steam here with the fleet or he can't move the flanks there, or he can't move troops from one place to another. That is what somebody should do day to day. We are telling him in the law and in the Warner amendment that he cannot reduce force numbers to something that has been negotiated and that everybody says makes sense.  Let me return to the Krauthammer piece, entitled ``The End of Arms Control; George W. Bush Proposed a Radical New Nuclear Doctrine. No One Noticed.''  Byline: Charles Krauthammer. Concluding paragraph:       We don't need new agreements; we only need new thinking. If      we want to cut our nuclear arsenal, why wait on the Russians?      If we want to build a defensive shield, why ask the Russians?      The new idea--extraordinarily simple and extraordinarily      obvious--is that we build to order. Our order.       Read my lips. No new treaties.  That is what this is about. Whether old ``W'' knows it or not--and I don't know that he does; I mean that sincerely; he may know more than all of us on the floor combined; he may know as little as it appears that he knows; I don't know--this approach says ``no new treaties.'' That is what this is about.  So I would like us to have national elections. There should be a national referendum as well. We should have a national debate on that. I urge my friends to come out of the closet completely. Let's have an up-or-down debate. It is a little embarrassing to make the case for the Warner amendment on either logical grounds or constitutional grounds or political grounds, based on the way it is now. It doesn't add up.  I thank the Chair. I see my time is up. I thank my colleagues, and I have a feeling this is only the beginning of what is going to be a big, big, long debate--not on this particular amendment, but for this Nation.                               Exhibit 1                                                    June 12, 2000.       There have been two revolutions in nuclear theology since      the doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction became dominant      four decades ago. The first came in 1983. President Reagan      proposed that defensive weapons take precedence over      offensive weapons. The second happened last week. It came      from George W. Bush and was almost universally misunderstood.      Bush was said to have proposed the primacy of defensive      weapons over offensive weapons. That is old news. In fact, he      did something far more important: he proposed the end of arms      control.       This seems strange to us. For more than a generation we      have been living in a world in which arms control is the      norm. But for all of history before that, it was not: if you      needed a weapon to defend yourself and had the technology to      build it, you did not go to your enemy to get his agreement      to let you do so.       When the world was dominated by two bitterly antagonistic      superpowers, arms control made sense. Barely. The world was      made marginally safer by the U.S. and the Soviet Union having      a fairly good idea of, and a fairly good lid on, the nuclear      weapons in each other's hands.       For the U.S. it was important because of a rather arcane      doctrine called extended deterrence: we pledged to defend      Western Europe not by matching the huge Warsaw Pact tank      forces (which would have been outrageously costly) but by      threatening nuclear retaliation against any conventional      invasion.       Not a very credible threat to begin with. And as the      Soviets overcame the American nuclear monopoly, it became      less credible by the year. We needed arms control to ensure      that there would be enough American nuclear firepower      (relative to Moscow's) to make our security guarantee to      Europe at least plausible.       As I said, arcane. But then again, the whole arms race with      the Soviets had a distinctly academic, almost unworldly      quality. It was really a form of bean counting. Like money to      billionaires, it had little intrinsic meaning: it was just a      way of keeping score.       Perhaps most important, arms control gave the Soviets and      us something to talk about at a time when there was very      little else to talk about. We were fighting over every inch      of the globe, from Berlin to Saigon. So, every few years, we      would trade beans in Geneva, shake hands for the cameras and      thus reassure the world that we were not going to blow it up.       But now? That late-20th century world of superpowers and      bipolarity and arms control is dead. There is no Warsaw Pact.      There is no Soviet Union. What is the logic of tailoring our      weapons development against various threats around the world      to suit the wishes of a country--Russia--that is not longer      either an enemy or a superpower?       Yet that is exactly what President Clinton has been intent      on doing in Moscow this week. He is deeply enmeshed in arms-     control negotiations (1) to revise the treaty that radically      restricts America's ability to defend itself from missile      attack (the ABM treaty) and (2) to set new numbers for      American and Russian offensive missiles (a START III treaty).       The parts of this prospective deal that are not      anachronistic are, in fact, detrimental to American security.      One of the reasons the development of an effective missile      defense has been so slow and costly is that the ABM treaty      prevents us from testing the most promising technologies,      such as sea-based and space-based weapons. Even today, we      cannot test a high-speed interceptor against any incoming      missile traveling faster than 5 km per SEC, because the      Russians are afraid it might be effective against their      ICBMs. This is quite crazy. It means that because of a cold      war relic, the U.S. has to forgo building the most effective      defense it can against nuclear attack by a rogue state such      as North Korea.       But Bush's idea is significant because it goes beyond      questioning why we should be tailoring our defensive weapons      to Russian wishes. He asks, Why should we be tailoring      offensive weapons--indeed, any American military needs--to      Russian wishes?       He proposes to reduce the American nuclear arsenal      unilaterally. The Clinton idea--the idea that has dominated      American thinking for a generation--is to hang on to      superfluous nukes as bargaining chips to get the Russians to      reduce theirs.       Why? Let the Soviets keep, indeed build what they want. If      they want to bankrupt themselves building an arsenal they      will never use--and that lacks even the psychologically      intimidating effects it had during the cold war--let them.       We don't need new agreements; we only need new thinking. If      we want to cut our nuclear arsenal, why wait on the Russians?      If we want to build a defensive shield, why ask the Russians?      The new idea--extraordinarily simple and extraordinarily      obvious--is that we build to order. Our order.       Read my lips. No new treaties.
