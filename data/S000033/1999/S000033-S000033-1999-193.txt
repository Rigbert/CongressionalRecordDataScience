 Speaker, I submit for printing in the Record this statement by high school students from my home State of Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people today. I believe that the views of these young people will benefit my colleagues.                       Regarding School Violence   (On behalf of Sarah Mayer, Jessica Normand and Colleen McCormick)       Jessica Normand: Set aside the accusations, the anger and      the 20-20 hindsight about the massacre of twelve students and      one teacher at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado,      on April 20th. The fact remains that Eric Harris and Dylan      Klebold's disturbed states of mind are the result of problems      that our society has a responsibility to acknowledge and      change.       This event has broken the already damaged national spirit,      but it has brought to our attention the moral decline in      American society. The lack of spiritual guidance among the      nation's youth that was once thought to be politically      correct has only made it easier for young Americans to feel      lost. Why did Eric Harris believe so strongly that life held      no value, and why did Dylan Klebold feel so alone that he      followed the demonic beliefs of his friend? These are the      questions America must ask itself. Parents, teachers,      administrators, friends, relatives, religious leaders, and      especially our government need to take an active role in the      lives of young Americans if future tragedies like the one at      Columbine High are to be avoided.       Sarah Mayer: Why is it that prayer is forbidden in public      schools, yet at the memorial service for those who died in      Littleton, the theme of every speech was that the only way to      heal such a wound was through faith in God and prayers of the      spiritual community?       My fellow classmates and I at Rice Memorial High School are      privileged to have prayer in our everyday lives. We feel that      teaching kids about their spirituality gives them a stronger      moral base to make better decisions throughout their      lifetime. An anonymous student from a Catholic high school      once said, ``We do not kill together because we pray      together.''       Colleen McCormick: Kids need to be able to differentiate      between fantasy and reality. But can they do this when video      games like Doom, which teaches children how to kill people,      are readily available? In order to curb the availability of      those games, greater restrictions need to be placed on the      Internet and sale of home games. Although the Internet has a      lot faster communication and is an effective learning tool,      it has also made unhealthy influences such as pornography and      deadly games to be at the fingertips of the young.       The media is another aspect of our society that needs to be      more careful about what images they present to children in      this country. While freedom of the press is a trademark right      of Americans, perhaps that right needs to be restricted in      terms of violence and sex.       Our proposal is that legislation be passed to more strictly      enforce the age limits at movie theaters, and all television      channels be required to rate their shows according to a      government rating system.       Jessica Normand: Besides the media and schools, the most      important influence every child has are their parents. As a      society, we need to implore all parents to be involved in      their children's lives, and to keep track of the outside      influences, such as the Internet and the harmful media we      mentioned earlier.       Sarah Mayer: Kids need to understand that this isn't a      video game, it's life, and there is no reset button.       Thank you.                                  ____                        Regarding Teen Violence                      (On behalf of Alicia Prince)       ALICIA PRINCE: I am Alicia Prince, here to speak on      reducing teen violence.       I think we are all ready affected by what happened in      Littleton. It has definitely given me the passion to come up      here to say it.       I am originally from East Los Angeles, California, and I      experienced firsthand the type of violence that happens      throughout our neighborhoods, communities, and in our      schools. I think that firearms are a really big part of that,      and I think that that should be discussed. I'm not antigun; I      understand peoples' rights to carry firearms, private      collectors, and households as well. But when they're in the      wrong hands, there is trouble, there is a problem there. And      a child's hands are the wrong hands, and there is no reason      why they should even be accessible.       My specific suggestion would be that there is absolutely no      reason why every gun in this country, in this state, cannot      be locked up, and ammunition locked up separately. There is      no reason to have a loaded gun in your car, in your house. I      understand where it is an issue in big cities. But it is not      an issue where you have to carry a 9 millimeter strapped to      your ankle and walk into a school in Vermont.       I think that this also goes to a deep-rooted problem of the      way our parenting is in this society. Too many times, I have      seen people perpetuate these cycles of poverty and violence      because they just don't know any better. They don't know how      to direct children in a different direction, because that's      the way they have been taught. I think that mandatory      parenting classes are absolutely essential. It is very      important, and no harm can be done in it. I think it should      be mandatory, and I think it is very important that parents      know how to take care of their kids and know how to prevent      this from happening.       There is no reason why these kids, especially in Littleton,      should not have been--you know, this couldn't have gone      unnoticed. Okay? They were in the garage five hours, you      know, working on bombs, and they had it written in diaries.      This was accumulating for the past year and a half before it      was, you know, executed. And I think that that is a direct,      you know, obvious thing, that the parenting is just not      happening adequately enough.       I am also a ward of the state. I am a foster kid. And all      of the foster parents in which I live in their homes, every      gun that is in their house and ammunition must be locked up      separately. There is no reason it should not be done in every      other house throughout this country.       So my two main suggestions would be, really good family      counseling. Parents need to know how to create safe families,      so that a teenager or a child has a sense of safety and      belonging in their home and in school, instead of having to      fight or shoot their way out of safety in school or in the      community. And I think it is absolutely ludicrous this is      happening when we have every power of preventing it.       CONGRESSMAN SANDERS. Thank you, Alicia.                               ____________________
