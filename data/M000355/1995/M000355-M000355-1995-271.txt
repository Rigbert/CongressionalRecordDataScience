 President, I ask unanimous consent that at 11 a.m. on Tuesday the Senate resume consideration of S. 1060, and at that time Senator Lautenberg be recognized to offer a relevant amendment; further, that the amendment be limited to a 60-minute time limitation to be equally divided in the usual form, and that there be no second-degree amendments in order to amendment.  I further ask that the only other amendment in order to S. 1060 be a managers' amendment to be offered following the disposition of the Lautenberg amendment; that it be considered under a 5-minute time limitation equally divided in the usual form; and, that immediately following the disposition of the managers' amendment S. 1060 be advanced to third reading and final passage occur all without any intervening action or debate.
