 President.  Let me thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his statement. He has been a strong supporter of education. He understands that on this issue of class size reduction, parents, families, community members, police, mayors, school board members have all stood behind us and said this will make a difference for young children's learning.  I remain baffled by the majority leader not allowing us to simply offer the amendment with an up-or-down vote. We are more than willing to have a time agreement, a short time agreement, and move this bill along.  We all know that Ed-Flex has been asked for by 50 Governors. Well, reducing class size has been asked for by thousands of parents. It has been bipartisan--maybe it is not anymore; it certainly was last fall--a bipartisan initiative to reduce class size. I still believe that is true. It is timely, again, as school boards are looking at those budgets. If we can come to an agreement that will allow us to have an up-or-down vote, I am happy to offer my amendment. I will stay tonight; I can be here tomorrow morning.  Let me conclude by saying it is frustrating to be told no and no and no time and time again when we want to offer an amendment. I am beginning to feel like one of those kids in one of those large classes who has been told by the teacher time and again, ``You have to wait.'' When that happens, you get frustrated, you start to think of other things to do. You can become a discipline problem. I don't want to be, but I will tell my colleagues that we want to offer this amendment, we want an up-or-down vote, and as long as we are told we can't move ahead with it, we will think of other things to do.  I yield the floor.
