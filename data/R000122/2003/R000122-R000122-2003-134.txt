President, I rise today to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the American Political Science Association, APSA, Congressional Fellowship Program.  The APSA Fellowship Program is a highly selective, nonpartisan legislative working experience that provides fellows with ``hands-on'' experience as legislative assistants on personal or committee staff. Founded in 1953, the APSA Congressional Fellowship Program helps to expand the knowledge and awareness of Congress to professionals from academia, journalism, health care, foreign countries, and government agencies. It enables fellows to observe and participate in the inner workings of Congress and the policymaking process. In doing so, fellows gain a greater appreciation for and knowledge of the policymaking process. Overall, the APSA Congressional Fellowship Program offers an enriching experience for its participants by providing a 3-week orientation program, allowing fellows to select their own placements, and conducting ongoing seminars throughout the fellowship period.  I have been fortunate to host four APSA fellows. In 2000, Hanna Marter, a Federal fellow from the Central Intelligence Agency joined my staff to work on health issues. In 2002, Joyce Iutcovitch, an American Sociological Association fellow, worked in my office on education issues, and Deborah Wolf, a Federal agency fellow from the Food and Drug Administration, worked on health care issues. Currently, Susan Dimock, an American Sociological Association fellow, is serving on my staff working on health care issues. APSAfellows have contributed to my office by applying their expertise and analytical skills to policy issues, and have functioned as full members of my staff.  Let us recognize the APSA Congressional Fellowship Program and its 1,800 alumni for their contributions to the legislative work of Congress and to furthering participation in the democratic process.                          ____________________
