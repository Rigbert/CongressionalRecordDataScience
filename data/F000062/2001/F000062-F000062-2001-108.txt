 President, I am pleased to introduce on behalf of myself and Mr. Hagel, the Family Sponsor Immigration Act of 2001. This legislation would address the situation of those whose U.S. sponsor dies while they have the chance to adjust status or receive an immigrant visa.  Under current law, a family member who petitions for a relative to receive an immigrant visa must sign a legally binding affidavit of support promising to provide for the support of the immigrant. This is the last step before a green card is issued. If the family sponsor dies while the green card application is pending, the applicant is forced to find a new sponsor and restart the application process, usually a 7- to 8-year process, or face deportation.  The legislation I have introduced today would correct this anomaly in the law by permitting another family member to stand in for the deceased sponsor and sign the affidavit. Without this legislation, another relative who qualifies as a family sponsor would have to file a new immigrant visa petition on behalf of the relative and the relative would have to go to the end of the line if the visa category is numerically limited. Thus, the beneficiary would lose his priority date for a visa based on the filing of the first petition, and in some cases, face deportation.  With the passage of this legislation, even though there may be a different sponsor, the beneficiary would not lose his or her priority date to be admitted as a permanent resident of the United States. Nor will the beneficiary be subject to deportation even though they meet all the requirements for an immigrant visa.  A classic example of this situation was presented to my office just recently. Earlier this year I introduced a private bill on behalf of Zhenfu Ge, a 73-year-old Chinese grandmother whose daughter died before the Immigration and Naturalization Service, INS, was able to complete the final stage of application process: her interview. As a result, her immigration application is no longer valid and she is now subject to deportation. The private bill I introduced would allow her to adjust her status, given that she has met all the requirements for a visa.  In previous years, I have introduced other private bills which eventually became law. One bill was on behalf of Suchada Kwong, whose husband was killed in a car accident just weeks before her final interview with the INS. In 1997, I introduced a private bill on behalf of Jasmin Salehi, a Korean immigrant who became ineligible for permanent residency after her husband was murdered at a Denny's in Reseda, California, where he worked as a manager.  In all of these cases, a family's grief was compounded by the prospect of the deportation of a family member, who had met all the requirements for a green card. This legislation is an efficient way to alleviate the need for private legislation under these circumstances by making the law more just for those who have chosen to become immigrants in our country through the legal process.  We introduce the ``Family Immigration Act of 2001,'' in the hopes that it will go further to alleviate some of hardships families face when confronted by the untimely death of a sponsor. Similar legislation has gained bipartisan support in the House of Representatives. I look forward to working with my colleagues to move it quickly through the Senate.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1167       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Family Sponsor Immigration      Act of 2001''.     SEC. 2. SUBSTITUTION OF ALTERNATIVE SPONSOR IF ORIGINAL                    SPONSOR HAS DIED.
