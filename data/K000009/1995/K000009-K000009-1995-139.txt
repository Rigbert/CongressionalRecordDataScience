Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me, and let me sum up by saying nothing is more important in this debate than the integrity of our Constitution and meeting our constitutional responsibilities in this body. We have never had a chance to vote on the merits of this issue. The economic stabilization fund has never been used for this purpose.  I say to my colleagues, You can try to slide around it, but the point is $20 billion is at risk, and we have not been able to vote on it, 20 times more than that fund has ever been used for in the past only to defend the dollar, and now to prop up the currency of another government.  A few years ago in the Committee on International Relations, and I commend my colleagues to read it, there was a magnificent hearing in which the gentleman from New York [Mr. Gilman] and the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Hamilton] talked about the dangers of this economic stabilization fund and the fact that we should not be permitting the kind of intended interventions that were being contemplated even back then but were not permitted in the case of Poland, and they said the money should be put on budget, we should not be doing back-door foreign aid through the economic stabilization fund. So Poland could not get help. It was discriminated against through that fund, but in this instance the policy was executed against the best wisdom of the highest ranking people at the U.S. Treasury Department. They advised against that years ago.  So let me say to the gentleman from Vermont, I commend you on your amendment. No Member of Congress can hide under a rock on this one.  Stand up for the Constitution. Stand up for our responsibilities. Support the Sanders amendment.                         Parliamentary Inquiry
