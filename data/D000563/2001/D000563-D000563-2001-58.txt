President, I rise today to share with you and the rest of my colleagues the thoughts of one of my younger constituents, for I think they are noteworthy for their insight, their honesty and their prescience.  Stephanie Kaplan, who lives in Highland Park, IL, is a junior at Highland Park High School. Stephanie recently submitted her writing to the Jewish Press in Omaha, NE, in response to their request for essays about patriotism. Out of all the responses that arrived at the newspaper, the editors deemed Stephanie's the best among them.  Perhaps most remarkable is that this essay, in which Stephanie explains what life as an American means to her, was written in August, before Osama bin Laden became a household name and when the top news stories did not mention Afghanistan.  Our enemies have attacked us for who we are and what we believe. The very freedoms we love inspire their hatred. As our freedoms are the source of this conflict, we cannot allow them to become its casualties.  Stephanie's writing is a timely reminder of what it is we value and what it is we are defending.  Her essay follows:                   What Being an American Means to Me                         (by Stephanie Kaplan)       Ice cream for dinner. Sitting on the bleachers through a      muggy afternoon, cheering heartily for a favored team or      player. An early-morning walk, as the trees that line the      street wave their green leaves in the     wind, scintillating drops of dew falling down to join their      brethren on the glistening grass. Air conditioning with the      twist of a knob.       This is America!       But luxuries, the majority of which can be purchased by      money, do not define what being an American means to me.       Freedom. Yes, there are rules and regulations, a moral      code, and systems of punishment for those who infringe and      sever them. They are in place to protect the people, however,      and are not oppressing as some governments, which implement      so many restrictions that the citizens are suffocated by the      layers upon layers of laws.       I can keep my lights on through the night, if I so wish. No      policies prohibit me from befriending a Jew, a Muslim, or a      person of color. And only my own predilections will rule my      summer afternoon activities, be it in-line pick-up hockey on      the basketball court down the street, or a lazy afternoon      perched before my computer, like a dog passing away the hours      chewing on rawhide.       Being a United States resident, to me, translates into the      simple joy that I can ride my bike to the places that defined      my carefree youth, mainly the elementary school's playground.      And if I so wish, I'll stray from the paved trail and take      the long route, or cut across the grass.       Most importantly, I possess no fear when being out alone.      For I feel safe, in this country, that I will not be a victim      of hostility based on any outward appearance. And I'd never      really noticed how wonderful and rare that is until I spent      three weeks on a teen tour with students from 21 different      countries.       My best friend became a girl from Hong Kong, and, as we      were walking along one overcast afternoon, she stated, ``I      hate the Beijing government.'' Then, she added, ``If I said      that in Hong Kong, in a casual conversation, I might be okay.      But if I was in Beijing, I could get shot. That's why I like      America, it's free for opinions.''       Never experiencing any sort of political oppression, it's      difficult for me to grasp what she must feel, or the fear of      a simple slip translating into death.       And this country is not perfect.       But as the anthem states, this is ``. . . the land of the      free.'' Sovereignty is a daily part of life. What may have      seemed like a burden--all the decisions one must make, and      the consequences that can only be blamed on an individual--     now seems liberating.       Existing in America means much to me, but the most poignant      example is that I can pray, out loud, in Hebrew, with the      shades drawn up and the door gaping, invitingly open.       On the trip, while occupying a dorm room, I prayed every      morning, just as I do at home. The glaring difference was      that the people who passed by my open doorway were not all      Jewish. Openly, I expressed my faith and reinforced my      beliefs to myself, my dedication to the Hashem.       How far we've traveled, in place, time, and pure      progression, since my grandmother hid below ground in      Germany, with but one dress, and could not even talk, let      alone pray aloud, for fear of SS men. And the advances since      my grandfather fought for survival in the same foreign      country, with outlandish limitations, are miraculous.       Could, I wonder, either of them imagined a time in which      their granddaughter--yes, a family!--could be so audacious as      to flaunt her prayer?       It's not the passing of years, though, but the changing of      countries that made it possible.       America may never be able to be defined, as being American      means so many different things to millions of unique people.      For the country, when drawn, should not be its traditional      shape, as seen on a map, but as a 3-D shape, with as many      angles as it has citizens, for the people shape America as      much as the land.       Being an American means choices, luxuries, decisions,      freedoms, and a feeling of not importance, but      responsibility, in illustrating the greatness of my country,      and endeavoring to uphold the lofty ideals of the founders of      this Nation, inhabitants who, like my grandparents, escaped      tyranny and a role of inferiority to pull freedom to their      chests and keep it there, chained 'til a death that does not      come prematurely due to discrimination.       Being an American means I am an individual and have the      independence to be just that--an American, because I believe      in the country and the opportunity. While it may take a      little digging, opportunity is available; even if found, one      must clean off the dirt before pursuing it.       I am a living, breathing, original American, and that I can      exist unscathed is what being a citizen of this realm is all      about. Existing as a member of this free country means, to      me, that if in 60 years my family can go from savoring every      drop of water to survive to having a house with a mezuzah on      each doorway, I can savor the prospects presented by freedom      and find a way to take it a step farther.       After all, my door is always open.                          ____________________
