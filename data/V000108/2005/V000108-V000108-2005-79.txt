Speaker, it is with great honor and pleasure that I stand before you today to recognize the many accomplishments of the Pangere Corporation throughout its 100 years of service in Northwest Indiana. To commemorate this special occasion, the Pangere Corporation will be holding an anniversary celebration on September 24, 2005, at the Center for Visual and Performing Arts in Munster, Indiana.  John T. Pangere established The Pangere Corporation in 1905 as an industrial painting contracting company. He built the framework of a company that today offers a complete line of construction services. Because their roots are in Gary and they wanted to give back to the community what it had given them over the years, the Pangere family built its headquarters in the center of Gary, Indiana. Northwest Indiana has certainly been rewarded by the true service and uncompromising dedication this company has displayed to the community.  Throughout its growth and expansion, the officers and owners of the Pangere Corporation have strived to maintain the corporate culture and values of being a family business. The Pangere family recognizes the need and importance of community involvement. The company contributes financially to many charitable and community organizations and its employees are encouraged to participate in community events. Steve Pangere has given his time and efforts selflessly to the people of Northwest Indiana. He serves as a board member of several charitable organizations and he has taught his employees the true meaning of service.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating the Pangere Corporation on their 100th Anniversary. This company has contributed to the growth and development of the economy of the First Congressional District. Their service and devotion deserves the highest commendation, and I am proud to represent them in Congress.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E1896]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]              100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PANGERE CORPORATION                                 ______                                                         HON.
