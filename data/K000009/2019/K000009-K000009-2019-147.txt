 And I thank our very distinguished ranking member for his interest in helping to solve the real challenge of Cano Martin Pena.  I have to say to the people of Puerto Rico and our fellow citizens, those who reside in Puerto Rico and those who reside stateside here: We are very aware, from Congresswoman Velazquez's work, how devastated Puerto Rico is. She has spent so much of her substance in trying to educate the membership here. We are very fortunate for her abiding leadership.  We all need to stand up for the residents of Puerto Rico. I appreciate her work, and all of our colleagues' efforts, to do just that.  I am committed to working with her to address any issues with this amendment as we move forward. Its intent is absolutely on point. I think that, working together on a bipartisan basis, we can find a way to help heal our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico and bring a better way of life there in the future.
