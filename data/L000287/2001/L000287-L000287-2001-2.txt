Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) for bringing this bill to the floor. I want to thank my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), for yielding me time. I know this has not been easy for the two of you, but you brought us to where we are today.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of moving the process of election reform forward. It has been over a year since the 2000 election and other elections have already been held. What happened in Florida last year and so many other places in our Nation must never ever happen again. Voters were denied the right to vote by incorrect voting lists, confusing ballots, and out-of-date voting machines.  The right to vote is precious. It is almost sacred. People died for the right to vote, and we must do whatever we can to protect that right. This is not a perfect bill. This bill is not a cure-all, but it is a step forward in correcting the problems with our election system and opening up the political process.  Many, many years ago I fought to give people a voice in the outcome ofelections, to get people included in the political process, to ensure their right to vote. And 40 years later I remain committed to that goal.  As I said before, this bill does not solve all of the problems, and it is not all that many of us wanted; but it does help to move this process forward this year, right here and now. It is past time that we address this important voting rights issue, and this bill is a necessary step in the right direction. I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill. It is the most important voting rights bill since the passing of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, 36 years ago. Vote for this bill.
