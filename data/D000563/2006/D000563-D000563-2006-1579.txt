President, if the Senator will yield for one question which I think gets to the concern people have about tax reform, it seems like a zero-sum game in this respect: If you end up lowering the taxes paid by someone in order to keep the same return to Government in revenue, you have to raise the taxes for others.  So I ask the Senator to step back from his proposal for a minute. Who are the winners and losers?
