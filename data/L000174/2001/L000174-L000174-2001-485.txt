President, I believe we are dealing with a bill with a drafting error and I am trying to correct it. For example, in the bill before the Senate, a battered spouse who flees the home with children can be denied bankruptcy relief regardless of circumstances because the bill would count her husband's income, as well, even though she did not receive any money from him.  Without the Leahy amendment, it is hard to imagine a more antiwoman, antichild, or antifamily result. My amendment would not allow separated spouses to somehow shield assets when they file for bankruptcy because the bill already counts income of the debtor from all sources. That is why my amendment is supported by virtually every group in the country that has advocated for battered women and battered spouses. They say, we support this effort to correct this oversight which ``if left unrepaired would create a severe injustice to many women, children, and families across the country.''
