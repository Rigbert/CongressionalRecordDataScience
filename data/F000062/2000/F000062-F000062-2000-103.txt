 President, I thank the President for this Executive order. It is the right thing to do and it is a major help. I very much hope that the African countries will make use of this Executive order and acquire the necessary pharmaceuticals that we here in this country know can extend the lives and well-being of people.  Almost 1 year ago, on May 11, the World Health Organization declared that HIV/AIDS is now the world's most deadly infectious disease. As of December of last year, the AIDS Epidemic Update, published by the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS, U.N. AIDS, and the World Health Organization, notes the following:       As the 20th century draws to a close, some 33.6 million men      and women worldwide face a future dominated by a fatal      disease, unknown just a few decades ago. According to new      estimates from the Joint U.N. Program on HIV/AIDS and the      World Health Organization, 32.4 million adults and 1.2      million children will be living with HIV by the end of 1999.       Sub-Saharan Africa bears the brunt of the HIV/AIDS with      close to 70 percent of the global total of HIV positive      people. Most will die in the next 10 years, joining the 13.7      million Africans who have already died, and leaving behind      shattered families and crippled prospects for development.  Indeed, the hardest hit African companies face infection rates in excess of 22 percent--that is 22 million people--an overall rate of infection among adults in sub-Saharan Africa eight times the rate of infection worldwide. In some countries of southern Africa, 20 to 30 percent of the population of the country itself are infected.  You can see from this chart the spread of AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. You see the major countries affected that I am speaking about--Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia--leading with 16 to 32 percent of adults infected with HIV. The next tranche of 8 percent to 16 percent is in the orange and it drops down from there. In South Africa, you have almost 13 percent of the population infected; that is, 2.8 million people. In Zimbabwe, it is 25.8 percent; that is, 1.4 million people. In Uganda, it is 9.5 percent; that is, 870,000. In the Central African Republic, it is almost 11 percent; that is 170,000. In Zambia, it is 19 percent; that is 730,000. In Kenya, it is 11.6 percent or 1.6 million people.  The destruction caused by HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa, by far, surpasses the devastation caused by famine, war, and even genocide in Rwanda. According to the United Nations, over 10 times as many people were killed by AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa last year as by war. This chart shows the estimated adult and child deaths from HIV/AIDS during 1998--2 million people in sub-Saharan Africa, out of a global total of 2.5 million. You see why this is pandemic today, actually exceeding the bubonic plague in Europe centuries ago.  The devastation caused by AIDS has dramatically reduced life expectancy in sub-Saharan Africa from the highs witnessed in the early to mideighties, before the devastating effect of AIDS began to be felt. This chart shows that in Botswana, which is this line, life expectancy has fallen from the age of 61 to age 50. In Zimbabwe, it fell from 59 to 47. In Zambia, it fell from age 50 to 38 years. In Malawi, it fell from age 45 to 40 years. In Uganda, it fell from 48 to 38 years.  If the present trends continue, life expectancy--already shortened by a decade or more in many sub-Saharan African countries--is projected to fall more dramatically still. In Zimbabwe, for example, life expectancy is expected to decline by 26 years by 2010, from the age of 59 to the age of 33. That is more than half the life expectancy in little more than two decades. I never thought I would ever see that kind of devastation in one country.  AIDS is also affecting infant and child mortality rates, reversing the declines that have been occurring in many countries during the 1970s and 1980s. According to the U.N., AIDS, by 2010, the child mortality rates of children under 5 will increase by 200 percent in Botswana, by 100 percent in Kenya, Malawi and Tanzania, and Zambia by 100 percent, and by 300 percent in Zimbabwe.  This becomes critical, if you understand that four pills can prevent the transmission of HIV/AIDS from a mother to a child--four pills.  Look at these expected child mortality rates.  Over 30 percent of all children born to HIV-infected mothers in sub-Saharan Africa will themselves be HIV infected. More than 500,000--half a million--babies were infected this past year by their mothers, most of them in sub-Saharan Africa.  As these statistics in the U.N. AIDS Report that I cited attest, sub-Saharan Africa has been far more severely affected by AIDS than any other part of the world.  Mr. President, it is not just adults who are being killed by AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. Out of 510,000 children killed by AIDS throughout the entire world, 470,000 were African children. That is 92 percent of the world's total.  What does that say for the future? Almost a half million children are killed in one continent alone. For anyone who has ever been a mother or a father, a grandmother or a grandfather, this number is mind numbing.  Beyond the carnage of the deaths, this disease has the potential to destabilize already fragile political and economic systems in sub-Saharan Africa.  The United Nations reports that 23.3 million adults and children are infected with the virus, up from 22 million a couple of years ago. Africa has only 10 percent of the world's population, but it has 70 percent of the worldwide total of infected people.  That is what this chart shows. And it is shocking.  Worldwide, there were 5.6 million new AIDS infections in 1999--3.8 million of them in Africa. That is two-thirds of the new infections of AIDS taking place in Africa. Every day, 11,000 more people are infected with HIV--1 in every 8 seconds--and 10,000 of the 11,000 new HIV infections that take place around the world occur in this area.  Teachers, doctors, and nurses are today dying faster than they can be replaced. What does that say about the human development and the economic upward mobility of that country if the teachers, the doctors, and the nurses die faster than they can be replaced? In addition to the death toll striking down adults and children alike, as the ``Report on the Presidential Mission on Children Orphaned by AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa'' notes:       Tragically, the worst is yet to come. During the next      decade more than 40 million children will be orphaned by      AIDS--40 million children orphaned by AIDS, and this     ``slow-burn disaster'' is not expected to peak until 2030.      According to UNICEF, the HIV-AIDS pandemic in sub-Saharan      Africa is having and will continue to have more impact on      child survival and maternal mortality than all other      emergencies combined. Without a doubt, AIDS has placed an      entire generation of Africa's children in jeopardy.  Of the 13 million children orphaned by AIDS so far, 10 million of them are in sub-Saharan Africa.  In Zimbabwe, there are currently 600,000 AIDS orphans, and the projection is that there will be more than 1 million by 2005. That is a 40-percent increase in orphans in one country alone in the next 5 years. Think about it for a minute. It is staggering.  There are rumors that some of the leaders of these countries don't want to deal with the drugs that can prevent passage from the mother to the child because they don't want to deal with the number of orphans that are going to be present in that country. I find this also shocking. You have more than 1 million orphans in 5 years growing up in poverty, without parents and with little or no social structure.  What does this say about the success of an African Trade Act, if you think about it? No teachers, no doctors, no nurses, and millions of orphans without parents, what does that say about economic and human development of a country?  In South Africa, there are already close to 250,000 AIDS orphans. The number is expected to skyrocket to 2\1/2\ million by 2010. This is South Africa. This is from 1990 to 2010. Here we are at 2000, and this is what is anticipated to be the number of orphans by 2010. The number is 2.5 million in one country alone. How can this bill provide them with the resources to lead better lives in the future? What good will this bill do if this happens?  All told, over 34 million people in Africa have been infected by HIV since the pandemic began. That is the population of the State of California. And an estimated 13.7 million Africans have lost their lives to AIDS--more than the entire population of Los Angeles and New York City combined. By 2005, if policies do not change, the daily death toll will reach 13,000--double what it is today--with nearly 4 million AIDS deaths in sub-Saharan Africa alone.  A recent CNN Interactive story, ``AIDS in Africa: Dying by the Numbers,'' put the extent of the crisis in this way:       . . . The bubonic plague is reckoned to have killed about      30 million people in medieval Europe. The U.S. Census Bureau      projects that AIDS deaths and the loss of future populations      from the deaths of women of child-bearing age means that by      2010, sub-Saharan Africa will have 71 million fewer people      than it would otherwise.  In all of these countries in sub-Saharan Africa, there will be 71 million fewer people because of AIDS in the next 10 years. Just think about that for a minute.  I would also like to spend some time addressing the situation in several different countries in the region--some hard hit, some less so--so that my colleagues have a better sense of the chaos and disruption this disease is causing in individual countries and society.  The statistics that I cite below are drawn from UNA's World Health Organization epidemiological fact sheets on AIDS and includes data up to 1997. By all accounts, in almost every country in the region, the situation has grown much worse in the past 3 years. There could be little doubt about the pandemic.  Let's begin with Botswana. In Botswana, over 25 percent of the population between 15 and 49 is infected with HIV. That is 25 percent of the population. In Botswana's major urban areas, 40 percent of pregnant women are infected with HIV. From 1994 to 1997, the rate at which children have been orphaned in Botswana quadrupled. Almost 50 percent of Botswana's children under 15 are AIDS orphans. AIDS is responsible for over half of the deaths of all children under the age of five.  Let's look at Ethiopia. Ethiopia has a relatively low infection rate for sub-Saharan Africa, just 9.3 percent, with 5.6 million out of a population of 60 million infected. Over 35 percent of women in Ethiopia age 20 to 24 have HIV. That is a rate 3 times higher than men. In 1985, less than 1 percent of prostitutes in Addis Ababa were HIV positive. By 1990, that proportion had reached 54 percent. This is the point of spreading of the disease. Very little is being done about it.  Kenya currently has a relatively low rate of HIV infection. It is 11 percent. HIV prevalence is much higher in the major urban areas and is over 25 percent in Nairobi, where almost 90 percent of prostitutes are HIV positive. This is the wonderful city of Nairobi, where 90 percent of the prostitutes are spreading this disease heterosexually through the countryside. There are currently at least 350,000 AIDS orphans in Kenya, with the number expected to reach 1 million by 2005. By 2005, Kenya will have one million orphans, thanks to AIDS. That is a 200 percent increase. The cumulative number of deaths due to AIDS has risen from 16,000 in 1989 to 200,000 in 1995 and is expected to pass the one million mark this year. One million dead and one million orphans.  Kenya is a beautiful country. It is shocking what is happening. I hope some of the pharmaceutical companies that lobbied against this amendment are listening. Mr. President, 75 percent of AIDS cases in Kenya occur among adults age 20 to 45, the economically most productive time of the population. The prevalence of HIV in pregnant women in urban areas has risen from 2 percent in 1985 to 16 percent in 1997.  Let's go to Malawi. It is estimated around 1 in 7 of the population, age 15 to 49, is HIV positive. That is 15 percent of the population, or 670,000 people. More than 80,000 people died of AIDS in 1 year alone, 1997, and Malawi has an accumulative death toll of over 450,000 people. I hope the pharmaceutical companies are listening.  Over 25 percent of women attending prenatal clinics in the urban centers test positive for HIV. Girls 15 to 24 years in age are six times more likely to be positive than boys the same age. Other infectious diseases are also on the upswing. Tuberculosis has tripled since the late 1980s, largely due to AIDS. By the end of 1997, over 6 percent of Malawi's children under 15 were orphans.  Let's look at Nigeria, Africa's most populace country, with 118 million people. More than 2.2 million people, around 5 percent, are HIV positive. Although Nigeria appears to have a relatively low incidence at present, trend lines are not comforting. The prevalence in pregnant women in urban areas went from below 1 percent in 1991 to almost 7 percent in 1994. Likewise, the prevalence of HIV in prostitutes has more than doubled during this same period in urban areas, and increases from 3.9 percent to 23 percent in rural areas. Nearly 50 percent of the prostitutes in Lagos, the largest city, are HIV positive, spreading the disease. There were 350,000 AIDS orphans in Nigeria as of 1997.  Let's look at South Africa. About 3 million people in South Africa are infected with HIV, 13 percent of a population of 43 million. Estimates are by 2010, 25 percent of South Africa's population will be HIV positive. By 1997, 180,000 children were orphaned. That figure will skyrocket to 2 million by 2010. There will be two million orphans in South Africa because of AIDS by 2010. Mr. President, 20 percent of pregnant women are infected. There are close to 400,000 deaths due to AIDS in South Africa since the beginning of the epidemic.  Let's go to Zambia, with an infection rate close to 20 percent. It is one of the hardest hit countries in sub-Saharan Africa. As of 1997, over 770,000 adults and children in Zambia were AIDS affected. There are more than 630,000 estimated AIDS cases. There have been 600,000 cumulative deaths since the beginning of the epidemic. After Uganda, Zambia has the highest proportion of children orphaned by AIDS in the world. By the end of 1997, 360,000 children, almost 10 percent of the children under 15, were orphaned because of AIDS. Four simple pills could prevent the transmission of AIDS from a pregnant woman to a child. Mr. President, 28 percent of adults in the urban area and 15 percent in rural areas are infected with HIV.  To give a sense of how the crisis is eroding social stability in Zambia, last year alone, 1,300 teachers in Zambia died from AIDS. Only 700 new teachers were available to take their place. How do you teach children to be able to get a job in the new marketplace that this bill hopes to bring about if the teachersare dying of AIDS, if the children are orphaned? Zimbabwe has one of the worst AIDS epidemics in the world. Currently, 26 percent of all adults age 15 to 49 are infected with HIV, more than 1.5 million out of a total population of 5.5 million.  The United Nations Population Division has projected that over the next five years half of all child deaths in the country will be due to AIDS.  As in Zambia, by the end of 1997 there were over 360,000 AIDS orphans in Zimbabwe and, as I mentioned earlier, projections are for Zimbabwe to be faced with over 1 million AIDS orphans in the next five years.  The HIV/AIDS crisis is driving families in sub-Saharan Africa worn-down by widespread poverty to the brink of disaster, and eroding the ability of the regions governments to provide services while at the same time increasing the demand for them. This is especially true in health care, where AIDS-related illnesses sometimes account for almost half the hospital beds and in-patient days.  The transition to democracy in the region may also be imperiled, and economic growth may grind to a halt as a result of the AIDS crisis destabilizing social structures.  These numbers, and the impact this disease is having on individual counties in sub-Saharan Africa, is staggering, but it is difficult to capture the depth of the devastation and suffering in the region with statistics and charts. To try to give a better sense of the impact of HIV/AIDS, let me read the first few paragraphs from a story published in the Village Voice last year, part of a Pulitzer Prize winning series of articles by journalist Mark Schoofs.  Let me warn you: the following is not for the faint of heart or faint of stomach.       They didn't call Arthur Chinaka out of the classroom. The      principal and Arthur's uncle Simon waited until the day's      exams were done before breaking the news: Arthur's father,      his body wracked with pneumonia, had finally died of AIDS.      They were worried that Arthur would panic, but at 17 years      old, he didn't. He still had two days of tests, so while his      father lay in the morgue, Arthur finished his exams. That      happened in 1990. Then in 1992, Arthur's uncle Edward died of      AIDS. In 1994, his uncle Richard died of AIDS. In 1996, his      uncle Alex died of AIDS. All of them are buried on the      homestead where they grew up and where their parents and      Arthur still live, a collection of thatch-roofed huts in the      mountains near Mutare, by Zimbabwe's border with Mozambique.      But HIV hasn't finished with this family. In April, a fourth      uncle lay coughing in his hut, and the virus had blinded      Arthur's aunt Eunice, leaving her so thin and weak she      couldn't walk without help. By September both were dead.       The most horrifying part of this story is that it is not      unique. In Uganda, a business executive named Tonny, who      asked that his last name not be used, lost two brothers and a      sister to AIDS, while his wife lost her brother to the virus.      In the rural hills of South Africa's KwaZulu Natal province,      Bonisile Ngema lost her son and daughter-in-law, so she tries      to support her granddaughter and her own aged mother by      selling potatoes. Her dead son was the breadwinner for the      whole extended family, and now she feels like an orphan.       In the morgue of Zimbabwe's Parirenyatwa Hospital, head      mortician Paul Tabvemhiri opens the door to the large cold      room that holds cadavers. But it's impossible to walk in      because so many bodies lie on the floor, wrapped in blankets      from their deathbeds or dressed in the clothes they died in.      Along the walls, corpses are packed two to a shelf. In a      second cold-storage area, the shelves are narrower, so      Tabvemhiri faces a grisly choice: He can stack the bodies on      top of one another, which squishes the face and makes it hard      for relatives to identify the body, or he can leave the      cadavers out in the hall, unrefrigerated. He refuses to      deform bodies, and so a pair of corpses lie outside on      gurneys behind a curtain. The odor of decomposition is faint      but clear.       Have they always had to leave bodies in the hall? ``No, no,      no,'' says Tabvemhiri, who has worked in the morgue since      1976. ``Only in the last five or six years,'' which is when      AIDS deaths here took off. Morgue records show that the      number of cadavers has almost tripled since the start of      Zimbabwe's epidemic, and there's been a change in who is      dying: ``The young ones,'' says Tabvemhiri, ``are coming in      bulk.''       The wide crescent of East and Southern Africa that sweeps      down from Mount Kenya and around the Cape of Good Hope is the      hardest-hit AIDS region in the world. Here, the virus is      cutting down more and more of Africa's most energetic and      productive people, adults aged 15 to 49. The slave trade also      targeted people in their prime, killing or sending into      bondage perhaps 25 million people. But that happened over      four centuries. Only 17 years have passed since AIDS was      first found in Africa, on the shores of Lake Victoria, yet      according to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS      (UNAIDS), the virus has already killed more than 11 million      sub-Saharan Africans. More than 22 million others are      infected [and nobody cares].       Only 10 percent of the world's population lives south of      the Sahara, but the region is home to two-thirds of the      world's HIV-positive people, and it has suffered more than 80      percent of all AIDS deaths.       Last year, the combined wars in Africa killed 200,000      people. AIDS killed 10 times that number. Indeed, more people      succumbed to HIV last year than to any other cause of death      on this continent, including malaria. And the carnage has      only begun.  In addition to the devastating health impact, HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa is also threatening to undermine economic, social, and political stability in the region--the very issues which the African Growth and Opportunity Act is intended to address.  In Zimbabwe and Botswana, for example, where roughly one of every four people have AIDS, the disease has cut sharply into population growth with profound consequences. According to Karen Stanecki, chief of health studies for the U.S. Census Bureau:       The zero growth is coming because people are dying in their      young adult years, not after leading full lives and then      dying.  People are dying in the years when they're supposed to be most productive.  As World Bank President James Wolfensohn said at the United Nations this past January:       Many of us used to think of AIDS as a health issue. We were      wrong. AIDS can no longer be confined to the health or social      sector portfolios. AIDS is turning back the clock on      development.  As the HIV epidemic deepens in Africa, it is leaving an economically devastated continent in its wake.  At the most simple level, already impoverished families that must care for a member who is ill with HIV/AIDS find that what little they had to pay for a child's education or invest for the future is now gone.  The United Nations Joint Program on HIV/AIDS found that urban families in the Cote d'Ivoire, known as the Ivory Coast in this country, with a member sick from AIDS cut spending on their children's education in half and reduced food consumption by about 40 percent as they struggled to cover health care costs.  Moreover, as the epidemic has worsened, so have estimates of its effect on African economies, even without taking into account broader human welfare issues.  Indeed, because of the impact of HIV/AIDS, David Bloom, a professor of economics and demography at the Harvard School of Public Health, warns that ``The whole economy [in Africa] could unravel.''  In ``Confronting AIDS,'' the World Bank factored in labor supply issues and the amount to which health care would be financed out of savings to come up with a ``rough estimate'' of a 0.5 percent annual reduction in per capita GDP growth. I believe this estimate to be on the low side.  One-half of 1 percent may not seem like much. Indeed, for countries with relatively high growth rates such as Uganda, that kind of reduction will not seem to be immediately crippling, but a lower growth rate has a cumulative effect.  A country whose growth rate is 2 percent a year will increase its GNP per capita by 81 percent in one generation, or about 30 years. Each generation will live much better than the last.  However, if AIDS reduces growth to just 1.5 percent per year, the same country will increase its GNP per capita by only about 50 percent in the same period.  This chart shows the change in per capita GDP caused by AIDS in Kenya. The yellow is a no AIDS scenario, and one can see the enormous rise in GDP. The red is the AIDS scenario, even with the African Growth and Opportunity Act, and one can see how it is consequentially lower.  Thus, in Kenya, for example, UNAIDS estimates that while per capita GDP was estimated to increase from 5,600 Kenyan shillings in 1990 to over 6,000 Kenyan shillings by 2005 without AIDS, with the impact of AIDS per capita GDP will remain stagnant over the same period of time.  Likewise, in South Africa UNAIDS estimates that because of the impact of HIV/AIDS the Human DevelopmentIndex--which measures the level of human development through a formula based on life expectancy at birth, adult literacy, school enrollment, and real per capita GDP has dropped by over 15 percent from 1995 to the present. That is a 15-percent drop due to AIDS in 5 years. Without HIV/AIDS South Africa's HDI was projected to remain more or less the same.  Finally, the combined effects of HIV/AIDS on health, economic life, the social fabric, and political institutions, has created a genuine threat to future stability and security in sub-Saharan Africa.  That is why, at the initiative of Ambassador Holbrooke and Vice President Gore, the 15-member United Nations Security Council decided to address AIDS earlier this year.  As Secretary General Kofi Annan told the Security Council:       In already unstable societies, this cocktail of disasters      is a sure recipe for more conflict. And conflict, in turn,      provides fertile ground for further infections.  And, as Dr. Peter Piot, Executive Director of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, said:       Visibly, the epidemic is eroding the social fabric of many      communities. In its demographic, social and economic impact,      the epidemic has become more devastating than war, in a      continent where war and conflict appear to be endemic.  As U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Richard Holbrooke said, if we do not work with Africa now to address the problems associated with the HIV/AIDS crisis, ``we will have to deal with them later when they will get more dangerous and more expensive.''  It is in recognition of the destabilizing effects of HIV/AIDS in Africa that the Clinton-Gore administration has taken the step of designating AIDS a threat to U.S. national security interests, as reported the other week in the Washington Post. I believe the administration is to be congratulated for its recognition of the profound effects that this disease is having, and for this effort.  There are many explanations for why this pandemic is sweeping across sub-Saharan Africa: Certainly the region's poverty, which has deprived Africans of access to health information, health education, and health care. Conflict, which has led to increases in refugee flows, and increases in prostitution have also played a role. Cultural and behavior patterns, which has led to sub-Saharan Africa being the only region in which women are infected with HIV at a higher rate than men, may also play a role.  Clearly, in addressing the challenges presented by this disease there needs to be considerable emphasis addressing the health care infrastructure of sub-Saharan Africa and on additional resources for education. I intend to address both these points later.  I also believe that if the international community is to be successful in meeting this challenge, we must make every effort to get appropriate medicine into the hands of those in need.  In the United States and much of the industrialized world, even as sub-Saharan Africa has been ravaged by the impact of HIV/AIDS, we have succeeded, in large part, in turning HIV/AIDS into a chronic disease; not curing it--that must still remain a top priority--but managing it. We have done so, in large parts, by developing effective pharmaceuticals and getting them to those in need.  Indeed, for too many years there were no effective drugs.  I remember, as Mayor of San Francisco, I was the first mayor to implement a program to deal with AIDS in the United States, and remember trying to manage this disease in its early days, when cause, let alone treatment, was unclear; when drugs were simply not available; when HIV/AIDS was devastating our community, and many, many promising young people--many of them my friends--were struck down in the prime of their lives; and when we simply did not know how big the crisis would get, or if our health care system could handle it.  So in some small way, I think I understand what policymakers in many sub-Saharan African countries are now going through.  Now, thanks to recent medical research, we do have effective medicine. For example, some recent pilot projects have had success in reducing mother-to-child transmission by administering the anti-HIV drug AZT, or a less expensive medicine, Nevirapine, NVP, during birth and early childhood.  In fact, new studies indicate NVP can reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission by as much as 80 percent. Just think of the statistics on orphans and HIV-infected children that could be stopped with four of these pills. NVP is given just once to the mother during labor and once to the child within three days of birth. Three or four pills can mean that a child is prevented from being born with AIDS.  For just $4 a tablet--a little more than the cost of a large latte at Starbuck's, not a lot here but a great deal in Africa--this inexpensive drug regime has created an unprecedented opportunity for international cooperation in the fight against AIDS. Currently, however, less than 1 percent of HIV infected pregnant women have access to interventions to reduce mother-to-child transmission.  In addition to such drugs as NVP, drug ``cocktails" administered in a treatment regimen known as HAART--highly active antiretroviral therapy--antiretroviral drugs can allow people living with AIDS to lead a normal life. And use of the drugs can lead to long-term survival rather than early death. Such treatment has proven highly effective in developed countries, including our own.  Although some pharmaceutical companies may try to tell you otherwise, most antiretrovirals drugs are relatively inexpensive to produce. AIDS Treatment News recently reported that:       AZT in bulk can be purchased for 42 cents for 300 mg from      the worldwide suppliers; this price reflects profits not only      to the manufacturer but also to the middleman bulk buyer. The      same drug retails at my local pharmacy for $5.82 per pill.      This ridiculous price bears no real relation to the cost of      production.  Unfortunately--and inexplicably in my view--access for Africans to AIDS medications or ``antiretrovirals'' is perhaps the most contentious issue surrounding the response to the African epidemic.  According to an article, ``Poor Nations Ravaged by AIDS Need the Right Resources'' that appeared in the December 1, 1999 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association:       For as many years as antiretroviral therapies have been      available, AIDS activists have accused pharmaceutical      companies of price gouging and challenged them to reduce      prices and cut their profit margins on drugs for people with      HIV infection and AIDS. In a pilot drug access initiative      launched in 1997 in Uganda, Cote d'Ivoire, Chile, and      Vietnam, UNAIDS succeeded in negotiating discounts on drugs      manufactured by Abbott Laboratories, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co,      Glaxo Wellcome Inc, Merck & Co Inc, and Roche Laboratories.       In Uganda, the cost of dual antiretroviral drug therapy has      been cut from $600 to $250 per month; triple combination      therapy that used to cost $1000 per month is now between $500      and $600 (J Int Assoc Physicians AIDS Care. 1999;5:48-60).      Dorothy Ochola, MD, coordinator of the drug access initiative      in Uganda, said the US Centers for Disease Control and      Prevention has offered free laboratory monitoring of patients      for 2 years.       While the program has helped hundreds of HIV-infected      people in Uganda gain access to therapy, it is far from a      cure-all. Along with government subsidies for drugs, the      initiative offers less expensive drugs for palliative care      and opportunistic infections, but patients must pay out of      pocket for antiretroviral drugs. With a population of 21      million and the number of HIV-positive persons estimated at      930,000, Uganda's approximately 825 patients receiving      antiretroviral drugs through the program are a drop in the      bucket.  Unfortunately, it is true that even at reduced rates in all too many cases the cost of combination therapy is beyond the means of most people living with AIDS and governments in sub-Saharan Africa.  Combination therapy in South Africa was estimated at $334 per month or $4,000 per year, and UNAIDS reports that Brazil treated 75,000 people with antiretrovirals in 1999 at a cost of $300 million--or, again, $4,000 per person.  I strongly believe that we have a strong moral obligation to try to save lives when the medications for doing so exist, and it is critical that the United States play a leadership role in the international community to increase access to life-saving drugs.  For example, the United States should not oppose African governments and donor agencies from achieving reductions in the cost of antiretroviralsthrough negotiated agreements with drug manufacturers.  The British pharmaceutical firm Glaxo Wellcome, a major producer of antiretrovirals, has already stated that it is committed to ``differential pricing,'' which would lower the cost of AIDS drugs in Africa. And I say, hooray; one company. These efforts are to be commended, and it is my sincere hope that companies willing to adopt ``differential pricing'' will help African countries get the drugs they need at prices they can afford.  Now I will speak about compulsory licensing and parallel importing for a moment.  This is the issue raised by my amendment and now the President's Executive order. The United States must not oppose ``parallel importing'' and ``compulsory licensing'' by African governments to lower the price of patented medications so that HIV/AIDS drugs are more affordable, and more people in Africa will have access to them.  Through parallel importing, patented pharmaceuticals can be purchased from the cheapest source, rather than from the manufacturer. Under compulsory licensing an African government could order a local firm to produce a drug and pay a negotiated royalty to the patent holder.  Both parallel imports and compulsory licensing are permitted under the World Trade Organization agreement for countries facing health emergencies--and there can be little doubt that Africa is facing a health emergency of monumental proportions.  My amendment, cosponsored by my colleague from Wisconsin, would have simply codified current administration policy--as the administration has now opted to do itself via Executive order--which states that the U.S. Government will not oppose efforts by governments of the countries of sub-Saharan Africa to supply HIV/AIDS drugs to their citizens through compulsory licensing or parallel importing.  This amendment did not create new policy or a new approach on intellectual property rights under the World Trade Organization agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, know as TRIPS, nor does it require IP rights to be rolled back or weakened.  There are few in this body as committed to the notion of strict protection of U.S. intellectual property rights as I am.  Just a few years ago, for example, when the United States and China were involved in a dispute over IPR protection for movies, music, and computer software, I worked with the administration to convince China that it was important to respect the rights of the patent holder and live up to its commitments to respect intellectual property rights. And, I am pleased to note, China's record since that time on IP issues has improved.  The compulsory licensing process under my amendment was fully consistent with the WTO's approach to balancing the protection of intellectual property with a moral obligation to meet public health emergencies such as the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Africa.  According to an opinion I solicited from the Congressional Research Service on this question, the amendment I offered:       . . . would appear to be consistent with the TRIPS      agreement since on its face it only prohibits U.S. government      authorities, such as the U.S. Trade Representative (U.S.T.R.)      From seeking a revocation of law or policy which offers      adequate intellectual property rights protection consistent      with the TRIPS agreement. . . . The TRIPS agreement permits      compulsory licensing under certain conditions. . . .  In other words, despite what some pharmaceutical companies have been saying behind closed doors about this amendment over the past few weeks, this amendment did not weaken intellectual property rights protection one iota. It left the bar exactly where it is right now.  Let me be clear about this: My amendment--and now the President's Executive Order--does not create new policy or a new approach on IP rights under TRIPS, nor does it require IP rights to be rolled back or weakened. All it asked is that in approaching HIV/AIDS in Africa, U.S. policy on ``compulsory licensing'' and ``parallel importing'' remain consistent with what is accepted under international trade law.  By doing so, this approach will allow the countries of sub-Saharan Africa to determine the availability of HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals in their countries, and provide their people with affordable HIV/AIDS drugs.  It was, or so I thought, a simple, common-sense approach to dealing with one facet of one of the most pressing and important national security and international health issues that we face in the coming decades: The HIV/AIDS pandemic currently sweeping across sub-Saharan Africa.  Let me provide one example of why the approach adopted by my amendment, and now the President's Executive Order, is necessary.  On March 14 of this year, Doctor's Without Borders--the medical relief group that won the Nobel Prize last year--sent a letter to Pfizer calling on Pfizer to lower the price of fluconazole, a drug needed to treat cryptococcal meningitus, the most common systemic fungal infection in HIV-positive people, in developing countries.  As the Doctors Without Borders letter notes, in Thailand fluconazole is available for just $1.20 for a daily dose. Yet in Kenya and South Africa, the daily dose costs $17.84, almost 15 times higher. That is unconscionable and is greed in the ultimate.  What accounts for the difference in price?  In Thailand a generic version is available. In Kenya and South Africa the only supplier is Pfizer.  As Bernard Pecoul, director of the Doctors Without Borders Access to Essential Medicines Campaign has noted, ``People are dying because the price of the drug that can save them is too high.''  As the March 14 Doctors Without Borders letter notes, ``While we appreciate that patents can be an important motor of research and development funding, there must be a balance to ensure that people in developing countries have access to life-saving medicines.'' I could not agree more.  Under pressure from Doctors Without Borders, Pfizer has since agreed to provide free fluconazole to South Africa. This situation never should have existed to begin with.  Without ``compulsory licencing'' and ``parallel importing,'' which would allow access to cheaper generic drugs, more people in sub-Saharan Africa will suffer and die.  So why, given that it represented a common sense approach to a devastating problem fully consistent with international trade law did my amendment meet such stiff opposition in conference?  After long and hard consideration, I have concluded that there can be only one possible answer to that question: Profits and corporate greed.  Simply put, the pharmaceutical companies which manufacture HIV/AIDS drugs would prefer to be able to sell drugs for $18 a dose rather than $1 per dose, with the additional $17 going straight to fattening the bottom line.  If there was a legitimate policy debate to be had, why did the opponents of including this provision in the bill not wage their fight out in the open?  The answer is because they had no arguments which would stand up to the light of day--so they restricted their activities to attacking this amendment behind closed doors, out of the public view. And they succeeded, in conference, with literally no one in the room except for a few members, in getting this amendment killed.  The pharmaceutical companies who were opposed to this amendment--opposed because they want to squeeze every last drop of profit from the suffering of the millions of HIV/AIDS victims in sub-Saharan Africa--were successful, behind closed doors, in killing my amendment.  The revenue created from the sale of HIV/AIDS-related drugs is staggering.  Crixivan, used to treat HIV infections, produced $675 million in revenue for Merck, in 1998; Zithromax, used to prevent Mycobacterium avium complex in people with advanced HIV infections, produced over $1.04 billion in revenue for Pfizer, in 1998; Fluconazole, used to treat cryptococcal meningitis, produced $916 million in revenue for Pfizer, in 1998; Epivir, used in combination with AZT as a treatment option for HIV infection in adults and pediatric patients that are at least three months old, produced $595 million in revenue for Glaxo Wellcome, in 1998; Combivir, used as a treatment option for HIV infection in adults and adolescent patients that are at least twelveyears old, produced $442 million in revenue for Glaxo Wellcome, in 1998; AZT, used for the treatment of adults with AIDS, produced $248 million in revenue for Glaxo Wellcome, in 1998; Taxol, used to treat AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, produced over $1.2 billion in revenue for Bristol-Meyers Squibb, in 1998; Zerit, used for the treatment of adults with advanced HIV infections, produced $551 million in revenue for Bristol-Meyers Squibb, in 1998; Videx, used for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with advanced HIV that are intolerant to or deteriorating on AZT, produced $162 million in revenue for Bristol-Meyers Squibb, in 1998; Invirase, used for advanced HIV infections, produced $397 million in revenue for Hoffman-La Roche, in 1998; Hivid, used in combination with AZT for patients with advanced HIV, produced $65 million in revenue for Hoffman-La Roche, in 1998; Famvir, used for the treatment of recurrent mucocutaneous herpes simplex infections in HIV-infected patients, produced $172 million in revenue for SmithKline Beecham, in 1998; Gamimune N, used to prevent bacterial infections in HIV-infected pediatric patients, produced $235 million for Bayer, in 1998; Biaxin, used to treat disseminated mycobacterial infections due to Mycobacterium avium-intracellular complex (MAC), produced $1.25 billion in revenue for Abbott Laboratories, in 1998; Novir, used in combination with nucleoside analogues for the treatment of HIV-infections, produced $250 million for Abbott Laboratories, in 1998; Epogen, used to treat anemia related to AZT therapy, produced $1.38 billion in revenue for Amgen, in 1998; Sustiva, used to treat HIV-1 infections in combination with other antiretrovirals, produced $75 million in revenue for DuPont Pharmaceuticals in 1998.  Viramune, used to treat HIV-infected adults experiencing clinical or immunologic deterioration, produced $154 million in revenue for Boehringer Ingelheim, in 1998; Serostim, used for the treatment of AIDS-wasting and cachexia, produced $88 million in revenue for the Ares-Serono Group in 1998; Viracept, used to treat HIV infection when antiretroviral therapy is needed in adults and pediatric patients that are at least two years old, produced $530 million for Agouron Pharmaceuticals, in 1998; and Abelcet, used to treat aspergillosis, a fungal infection, produced $73 million for The Liposome Company, in 1998.  All of the above-mentioned drugs were among the 500 best selling drugs in the world, in 1998.  Driven in no small part by the profits on HIV/AIDS drugs, the pharmaceutical sector has proven to be one of the most profitable corporate sectors in the world. In 1999 pharmaceutical companies had a 18.6 percent return on revenues, which is 17 percent higher than the number two sector on the list, and a 16.5 percent return on assets, which is 7 percent higher than the number two sector on the list.  For shame, for opposing this amendment.  Merck, the producer of Crixivan, had an 18 percent return on revenues and a 17 percent return on assets.  Bristol-Meyers Squibb, the producer of Taxol, Zerit, and Videx, had a 21 percent return on revenues and a 24 percent return on assets.  Pfizer, the producer of Zithromax and Fluconazole, had a 20 percent return on revenues and a 15 percent return on assets.  Abbott Laboratories, the producer of Biaxin and Norvir, had a 19 percent return on revenues and a 17 percent return on assets.  Amgen, the producer of Epogen, had a 33 percent return on revenues and a 27 percent return on assets.  Ironically, the pharmaceutical companies would profit more from the approach embodied in my amendment than they do right now. Presently, most sub-Saharan African countries are not buying these drugs since they can not afford the price tag, so the pharmaceutical companies are not earning any money at all on these HIV/AIDS drugs in these countries. But if sub-Saharan African countries produced HIV/AIDS drugs through ``compulsory licensing,'' or purchased them by ``parallel importing,'' the pharmaceutical companies holding the patents on these drugs would receive royalties.  I have a very hard time understanding how lobbyists behind closed doors prevail on this body, in the middle of a world health crisis, to prevent the use of cheaper drugs when the figures I have documented are decimating these countries in a major public health emergency. I don't know how they sleep at night. I really do not. I don't know how they can look at a country with 1 million or 2 million AIDS-produced orphans and sleep at night. I really do not understand it.  Let me touch for a moment on what else is to be done.  By itself, the approach of the Feinstein-Feingold Amendment, and the President's Executive order, will not solve the problem of HIV/AIDS in Africa. It only addresses one area--an important area, but only one--of a large and complex problem.  As Dr. David Satcher, the Surgeon General of the United States, wrote in ``The Global HIV/AIDS Epidemic'' in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association, in April 1998:       More than a decade of experience has taught us how to      control HIV/AIDS--we know what works. Many developed      countries have successfully checked the spread of the      epidemic. While development of therapy and a vaccine      continue, prevention must be emphasized. The basic elements      of prevention include education, behavior change, voluntary      testing and counseling prevention of perinatal transmission,      and political commitment. Each country must find the mix of      methods appropriate to its particular conditions.       Education about HIV/AIDS is necessary but alone does not      change the behavior of populations. Promotion of voluntary      testing and counseling must complement education. Testing and      counseling break the deadly silence around HIV/AIDS and      empower individuals to make informed decisions and change      behaviors. Breaking the silence also will begin to diffuse      the stigma surrounding the disease. We have seen success with      behavioral change in Uganda and Thailand, the only two less-     developed countries with extensive capacity for voluntary      testing and counseling.       It is known that perinatal transmission of HIV can be      reduced by more than 50% by using antiretroviral therapy;      however problems with access to these drugs limit their use      in some countries. Transmission of HIV through breast-feeding      and poor survival of orphans make the avoidance of disease      via treatment for perinatal transmission more complex. We      continue to work with international organizations, other      governments, and pharmaceutical companies to lower costs and      expand access to antiretroviral drugs. Current treatment for      perinatal transmission, as well as use of antiretrovirals in      general, in less-developed countries is also limited by the      fact that very few people have been tested for HIV infection.       Treatment of other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) is      important to control the spread of HIV. One of the reasons      HIV has spread so rapidly in Africa is that so many STDs go      untreated. Untreated STDs break down natural barriers that      prevent transmission. Access to even basic treatment for STDs      remains a problem for many less-developed countries.       Perhaps most important in the global battle against HIV/     AIDS is political commitment. Leaders at the national,      provincial, and local levels of government must speak out      about HIV/AIDS and encourage businesses and nongovernmental      organizations to commit to work against the disease. I was      encouraged by U.S. Vice President Al Gore and Deputy      President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, who put the HIV/AIDS      threat at the top of the international agenda at the recent      meeting of the United States-South Africa Joint Commission.      They set an important example for leaders in developed and      less-developed countries.       American medicine and public health have an important role      to play in the global battle against HIV/AIDS by supporting      international organizations such as the Joint United Nations      Program on HIV/AIDS, the World Health Organization, and the      World Bank.       HIV/AIDS can be likened to the plague that decimated the      population of Europe in the 14th century. While the modern      epidemic affects people of all age groups, those of working      age are at highest risk, posing potentially dire economic,      social, and political consequences for the global community.      Unfortunately, the world continues to devote greater      attention and resources to traditional national security      issues such as wars, postponing notice of an epidemic that,      if left to spread unchecked, will kill more people than any      of the terrible conflagrations that have so marked this      century.  Because of the complexity of dealing with this issue, the Clinton-Gore Administration has asked Congress to commit $150 million toward vaccine research and AIDS treatment and prevention programs in Africa.  The Administration's initiative dedicates $100 million for the prevention and treatment of HIV and AIDS in Africa, Asia and other regions, doubling current U.S. funding of AIDS prevention efforts. An additional $50 million will go to the Vaccine Fund of theGlobal Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations for research, and the purchase and distribution of vaccines for other infectious diseases in developing nations.  The Administration's initiative, announced by the Vice President this past January, also includes plans for a public-private partnership with U.S. business leaders active in Africa, with a goal of developing workplace education programs designed to end the stigma and ``break down the barriers against discussing AIDS.''  The Vice President has also proposed specific funding for the U.S. military to work with armed forces in Africa to combat AIDS, an especially important initiative given the high rates of infection among soldiers.  I believe that it is crucial that we provide support for these efforts at least at the level the Administration has called for.  In fact, I am a cosponsor of a bill introduced by my colleague from California, Senator Boxer, which calls for USAID to make HIV/AIDS a priority in foreign assistance funding and authorizes $2 billion over five years, with at least 50 percent targeted at sub-Saharan Africa, for a comprehensive coordinated effort to combat HIV/AIDS, including testing, education, treatment, and the provision of medicines to prevent mother-to-child transmissions.  I should note here that I was also disappointed that the Conference choose not to include an Administration initiative to provide a tax credit for the President's Millennium Vaccine Initiative tax credit proposal. This proposal would create a tax credit to encourage the development of vaccines for malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, or any infectious disease that causes over 1 million deaths annually worldwide.  Such a tax credit would encourage the development of a vaccine for HIV/AIDS. As Dr. Seth Berkley, president of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative has put it: ``We need new prevention technologies, and the most critical one is a vaccine. . . . Ultimately, only a vaccine can stop the epidemic.''  These actions and policies must be part of a larger development effort if we are to help these sub-Saharan African countries control the HIV/AIDS pandemic.  Debt relief must also be part of a this larger development effort. It is unconscionable that many of these countries are spending more than a quarter of their precious export earnings on debt service payments to bilateral and multilateral creditors. The World Bank is correct when it declares that debt burdens at these levels are unsustainable.  The citizens of most of these countries are extremely poor, and they are burdened with unsustainable debts built up during the Cold War. These debts were accrued during the 1970s and 1980s by unaccountable governments.  Debt service diverts scarce resources away from spending on health care, health education, and poverty reduction initiatives in these countries. Debt servicing absorbs up to 40 percent of national revenue among a majority of countries in sub-Saharan Africa.  We must lead the international community in efforts to write-off unsustainable debts so these countries can spend more money health education, infrastructure and services, as well as other development needs.  Let me conclude and thank the Senate for its forbearance. I am sorry for my display of emotion. I have watched people die of AIDS. I know what it is like. I can't imagine what it must be like in Africa where citizens maybe don't have a home, where they have an enormous cultural taboo attached to it, where there is no food, there is no medicine, and to know that a few pills can prevent the transmission of AIDS to a child for a nominal sum of money, and to know, literally, that in the coming years this could save 5 to 10 million people.  Just to think of what went on behind closed doors by lobbyists for pharmaceutical companies is unconscionable. The TRIPS agreement, the World Trade Organization, at a time of national health emergency, permits compulsory licensing and parallel importing. For these pharmaceutical companies that have made the kind of money they have made--and I know they will say they spent millions and millions on research and development; I have a member of my family who was director of research for one of the companies that worked on an antiretroviral--the bottom line is every one of these annual reports shows a substantial increase in profit.  Yet in little-known countries in sub-Saharan Africa, people are literally dying by the millions. Today we are considering a trade initiative bill which aims at giving them a better way of life. What is the better way of life if you can't live? What is the better way of life if you are dying of AIDS? What is a better way of life if you were 1 of 5 million orphans born in sub-Saharan Africa? What is a better life if you were born one of these HIV-infected orphans?  I find the act of pharmaceutical companies in opposing this amendment unconscionable.  I thank the Chair for its forbearance, and I thank the Senate. I also thank the administration for doing a major act of conscience in the production of an Executive order which will allow the purchase of these drugs at the lowest possible rates.                               Exhibit 1                            Executive Order      access to hiv/aids pharmaceuticals and medical technologies       By the authority vested in me as President by the      Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,      including section 141 and chapter 1 of title III of the Trade      Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2171, 2411-2420), section      307 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 2421), and      section 104 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended      (22 U.S.C. 2151b), and in accordance with executive branch      policy on health-related intellectual property matters to      promote access to essential medicines, it is hereby ordered      as follows:       Section 1. Policy. (a) In administering sections 301-310 of      the Trade Act of 1974, the United States shall not seek,      through negotiation or otherwise, the revocation or revision      of any intellectual property law or policy of a beneficiary      sub-Saharan African country, as determined by the President,      that regulates HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals or medical      technologies if the law or policy of the country:       (1) promotes access to HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals or medical      technologies for affected populations in that country; and       (2) provides adequate and effective intellectual property      protection consistent with the Agreement on Trade-Related      Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement)      referred to in section 101(d)(15) of the Uruguay Round      Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3511(d)(15)).       (b) The United States shall encourage all beneficiary sub-     Saharan African countries to implement policies designed to      address the underlying causes of the HIV/AIDS crisis by,      among other things, making efforts to encourage practices      that will prevent further transmission and infection and to      stimulate development of the infrastructure necessary to      deliver adequate health services, and by encouraging policies      that provide an incentive for public and private research on,      and development of, vaccines and other medical innovations      that will combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa.       Sec. 2. Rationale: (a) This order finds that:       (1) since the onset of the worldwide HIV/AIDS epidemic,      approximately 34 million people living in sub-Saharan Africa      have been infected with the disease;       (2) of those infected, approximately 11.5 million have      died;       (3) the deaths represent 83 percent of the total HIV/AIDS      related deaths worldwide; and       (4) access to effective therapeutics for HIV/AIDS is      determined by issues of price, health system infrastructure      for delivery, and sustainable financing.       (b) In light of these findings, this order recognizes that:       (1) it is in the interest of the United States to take all      reasonable steps to prevent further spread of infectious      disease, particularly HIV/AIDS;       (2) there is critical need for effective incentives to      develop new pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and therapies to      combat the HIV/AIDS crisis, including effective global      intellectual property standards designed to foster      pharmaceutical and medical innovation;       (3) the overriding priority for responding to the crisis of      HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa should be to improve public      education and to encourage practices that will prevent      further transmission and infection, and to stimulate      development of the infrastructure necessary to deliver      adequate health care services;       (4) the United States should work with individual countries      in sub-Saharan Africa to assist them in development of      effective public education campaigns aimed at the prevention      of HIV/AIDS transmission and infection, and to improve their      health care infrastructure to promote improved access to      quality health care for their citizens in general, and      particularly with respect to the HIV/AIDS epidemic;       (5) an effective United States response to the crisis in      sub-Saharan Africa must focus in the short term on preventive      programs designed to reduce the frequency of new infections      and remove the stigma of the disease,     and should place a priority on basic health services that can      be used to treat opportunistic infections, sexually      transmitted infections, and complications associated with      HIV/AIDS so as to prolong the duration and improve the      quality of life of those with the disease;       (6) an effective United States response to the crisis must      also focus on the development of HIV/AIDS vaccines to prevent      the spread of the disease;       (7) the innovative capacity of the United States in the      commercial and public pharmaceutical research sectors is      unmatched in the world, and the participation of both these      sectors will be a critical element in any successful program      to respond to the HIV/AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa;       (8) the TRIPS Agreement recognizes the importance of      promoting effective and adequate protection of the      intellectual property rights and the right of countries to      adopt measures necessary to protect public health;       (9) individual countries should have the ability to take      measures to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic, provided that such      measures are consistent with their international obligations;      and       (10) successful initiatives will require effective      partnerships and cooperation among governments, international      organizations, nongovernmental organizations, and the private      sector, and greater consideration should be given to      financial, legal, and other incentives that will promote      improved prevention and treatment actions.       Sec. 3. Scope. (a) This order prohibits the United States      Government from taking action pursuant to section 301(b) of      the Trade Act of 1974 with respect to any law or policy in      beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries that promotes      access to HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals or medical technologies      and that provides adequate and effective intellectual      property protection consistent with the TRIPS Agreement.      However, this order does not prohibit United States      Government officials from evaluating, determining, or      expressing concern about whether such a law or policy      promotes access to HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals or medical      technologies or provides adequate and effective intellectual      property protection consistent with the TRIPS Agreement. In      addition, this order does not prohibit United States      Government officials from consulting with or otherwise      discussing with sub-Saharan African governments whether such      law or policy meets the conditions set forth in section 1(a)      of this order.
