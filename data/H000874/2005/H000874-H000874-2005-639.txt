 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  The gentleman's original question was when will we see a conference report for the budget come to the floor. I am hoping as soon as possible, obviously. I have no idea when the negotiations with the House and the Senate will start in earnest, when we will appoint the conference committee. There is very little difference, quite frankly, from the House bill and the Senate bill, and I would assume that the major issues will be taken care of in a matter of days, if not a couple of weeks.  So I would assume that we could have a conference report on a budget hopefully by the first of May. At least that is what we would like to see happen.
