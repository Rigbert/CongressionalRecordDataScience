President, I ask if the Senator from California will yield for a question. If the objection of the Senator from Nebraska holds and if the Republican side of the aisle does not change its position, it is my understanding that there will be a rescission of some $8 billion, which means cutting the highway funds going to Nebraska, the highway funds coming to Illinois, and the highway funds coming to California; is that what the outcome will be because of the objection from the other side?
