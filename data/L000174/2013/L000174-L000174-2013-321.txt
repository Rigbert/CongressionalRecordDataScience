President, if the Senator would yield on that point, I was privileged in my capacity as President pro tempore to speak to the graduating class of pages, the group of pages who graduated just ahead of the distinguished group we have here now. There had been discussion about immigration coming up. Then the distinguished Republican leader spoke and went on at great length to the pages about how these important issues must have 60 votes on everything, must have 60 votes on amendments and so forth. I am sure the distinguished Senator from Kentucky would confirm that is what he said. There were 100-and-some-odd people in the room who heard him say it. And here we have offered--the distinguished majority leader has offered to have three Republican votes and two votes by Democratic Senators, all under exactly the same rule, the rule Senator McConnell proposed.  We have talked and given great speeches that we have all given time and time again both in the committee and on the floor. I would like to have votes on something so we can finish this because, frankly, given my choice of spending the Fourth of July week in Washington--salubrious as the weather is--or being in Vermont for the Fourth of July, I would much rather be in Vermont.
