Chairman, I rise today to express my serious concern with the Veterans, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies for fiscal year 2000. I recognize the difficult balancing of priorities which the Chairman and the Ranking Member must do with the array of competing interests within this bill. But I find it ironic that the House in the space of one month can pass a tax bill that gives special breaks to select groups but cuts funding for the neediest of all--undermining our efforts to fuel the dream of home ownership for all Americans, reducing our efforts to create jobs, and revitalizing the forgotten corners of our towns and cities. America should do what is right.  The Subcommittee funded VA Health Care at $1.7 billion, but the veterans' organizations submitted to the Congress the Independent Budget which calls for an increase of $3 billion--a more realistic estimate of the need. This bill does not go far enough to provide for the growing health care needs of our veterans as we enter the 21st Century. America should do what is right.  I am seriously concerned about the adequacy of the Veteran Administration's response to the medical needs of 650,000 veterans with chronic mental illness. I am specifically concerned that as a result of (Veteran Health Administration) VHA's decision to rapidly downsize psychiatric hospitals, veterans with mental and substance abuse disorders are not receiving proper treatment and the services that they need and deserve.  In particular, dollars saved by eliminating beds from inpatient psychiatric facilities are not being redirected to serve veterans with mental illness in the community. Between FY 1995 and FY 1997 the number of seriously mentally ill veterans treated at inpatient facilities decreased by nearly 20%. Currently, there is no indication that the twenty-two (Veteran's Integrated Service Networks) VISNs are compensating for the lack of inpatient care with either adequate alternative care settings or community-based services for veterans with mental illness.  Frightening, over two-thirds of VHA outpatient facilities do not provide mental health care. Neither do they provide case management services for these veterans. Case management is essential for mentally ill veterans because of a pervasive lack of financial and family support. In addition, many members of this group need continued attention because they suffer from the dual diagnosis of mental illness and substances abuse.  I am deeply concerned that the structural changes within VHA and the lack of community-based services threaten many veterans with homelessness. Sadly, 40% of all homeless males are veterans.  I offered report language that emphasizes the need to reinvest resources in alternative community-based mental health services, including prescription drugs. The current situation of veterans who require treatment for mental illness should be a source of shame and embarrassment, and America should do what is right.  The sad reality is that not everyone is sharing in the economic prosperity of the booming '90's. Instead of being financially able to invest in a home, over 12 million people are paying over 50 percent of their salary on rent. This bill fails to help these families. In fact, the bill will cost northwest Ohio 448 housing units for cash-strapped families next year. This bill also takes major swipes at many of our neediest citizens and their communities, ranging from cutting funding that keeps children safe from lead paint poisoning to denying housing for people with AIDS and for seniors. America should do what is right.  The bill cuts Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) by $250 million, which would result in a loss of vital community development projects, and the 97,000 new jobs that would be created. Just in Toledo, our city would lose $3.8 million of current funding. The State of Ohio would forego over $7.3 million in community development assistance so vital to revitalizing all corners of our State. For the last 6 years, the Majority has been preaching community empowerment, CDBG is the essence of community empower. By giving communities the flexibility to create their priorities to invest CDBG funds, it empowers them to address their community's need as they see fit.  The bill denies the Administration's request for incremental housing vouchers resulting in 128,000 families being denied housing vouchers.  The bill would increase children's exposure to lead paint poisoning by cutting the Lead Hazard Control Grant program.  The bill would slow the fight against housing discrimination by cutting the Fair Housing Assistance and Fair Housing Initiatives Programs. In my community, these funds have given the opportunity for many minority applicants to achieve the American dream of owning a home.  The bill also fails to fund the rehabilitation of almost 28,000 units that would create quality housing for low- and moderate-income renter and owner families.  The bill would result in almost 16,000 homeless people and persons with AIDS being denied essential services because of the cuts in homeless and Housing Assistance for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA) programs.  I would like to thank the Chairman and the rest of the Subcommittee Members for their support of report language that I offered that would help the residents of public housing by offering, what most Americans take for granted, which is adequate amount financial services located near where they live. Unfortunately, in our country, financial services are less common and less likely to be located in poor to low-moderate income neighborhoods. HUD, in conjunction with the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) will study the feasibility of opening credit unions in public housing. With the introduction of credit union in public housing, we can cut down on welfare fraud and encourage financial independence.  The bill cuts NASA by $1 billion. This cut will harm future space exploration programs, force NASA to slash programs and personnel and cripple our nation's basic scientific development for decades. This bill will drastically hurt our ability to maintain the balance of trade advantage in the first ``A'' in NASA--Aeronautics. This budget inhibits our ability to advance future developments of technology that will allow America to compete in the aeronautics industry in the 21st Century. We must do what is right.  In conclusion, I am here today to urge my colleagues to do better for America, for the men and women veterans to whom our nationowes a great debt, for the families in desperate need for housing throughout this Nation, and protect basic research for the benefit of all Americans as we enter the 21st century.                          ____________________
