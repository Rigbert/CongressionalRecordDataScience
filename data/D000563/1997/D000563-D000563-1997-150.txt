President, I rise to speak to the legislation now pending before the Senate on three topics that are much different in nature, but I think reflect the diversity of the subject matter of this important legislation.                      NATO Enlargement Assistance  At the outset, let me join with my colleague, Senator Gorton of Washington, who has offered a sense-of-the-Senate amendment in his name and mine, asking that Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia be invited to become full NATO members at the earliest possible date. I have addressed this issue before on the State Department authorization, and it was adopted by the Senate in similar form.  The amendment states the sense of the Senate that Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia are to be commended for their progress toward political and economic reform and meeting the guidelines for prospective NATO members; that these three countries would make an outstanding contribution to furthering the goals of NATO and enhancing stability, freedom, and peace in Europe should they become NATO members; and they should be invited to become full NATOmembers at the earliest possible date. The recent NATO summit in Madrid resulted in the member nations inviting Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to join NATO. This was a dramatic breakthrough. I think it signaled the end of the cold war and a new era in the world, with those who had been our adversaries for literally decades now to become our allies. We are seeking, with this amendment, Senator Gorton and myself, to increase that number of new NATO members by at least three, by including the Baltic nations.  I can tell you from recent visits to Lithuania that they feel this is the single most important foreign policy challenge which they face. They want to make it clear that they look to the West; they share our values. They are interested in this type of NATO arrangement, which is not offensive in strategy but, rather, seeks peaceful resolutions, and they are hopeful that this will create a new era of opportunity for them.  This amendment is consistent with current laws and programs, and I believe that it is one the administration can embrace. It is clearly not only in our best interests in the United States, but certainly in the best interests of the Baltic States, which are still in a very precarious position.  I thank my colleague Senator Gorton for offering this sense-of-the-Senate resolution on our mutual behalf, and I am also grateful to the managers of the bill for having adopted it.                     International Family Planning  Mr. President, I might go on to say there is another aspect of this bill which is critically important for the future, not only of the United States, but of the world. I rise in support of the funding in this legislation for international family planning. I can't think of a single issue more threatening to the future and stability of our world than the present trends of population increase. The world's population increases by about a quarter of a million people every single day, and 95 percent of the world's population growth is in less developed countries. In 1950, the world's population was 2.5 billion; today it is 5.8 billion. In 1950, the average life expectancy worldwide was 46 years; today, it is 65 years.  By the year 2040, if current trends continue, the world's population will double. The danger of overpopulation, the problems that come with it--poverty, hunger and disease--will not go away if we simply ignore them. We can and we must address these problems by providing family planning assistance to the poorest people in the world.  And family planning works. Mr. President, 30 years ago the average couple in the world had six children. Today, the average couple in the world has four. International family planning is about giving people around the world, especially in the world's poorest countries, the ability to decide the size of their own families. International family planning is about eradicating poverty, hunger and disease. It is not about abortion. It is about preventing abortion. It is estimated that unwanted pregnancies lead to 50 million abortions every year--abortions that might have been prevented by family planning.  International family planning literally saves the lives of children and their mothers by increasing the time between births and helping women to avoid high-risk pregnancies. It is estimated that preventing closely spaced births and pregnancies to very young mothers can save the lives of 3 million babies a year. That would be a 25 percent reduction in worldwide child mortality.  International family planning makes it possible for poor nations to provide better nutrition, health care and education.  About 6 years ago, I joined my House colleague, the late Congressman Mike Synar of Oklahoma, on a trip to Bangladesh. It was an amazing educational experience. One of the poorest countries in the world, Bangladesh seems to be living under a dark cloud. If there is a natural disaster to occur, it is usually occurring in Bangladesh. And these poor people who eke out a living are often victimized by these disasters.  Congressman Synar and I went into the back country where the roads end and we had to get out of the 4-wheel-drive and start hiking to a little village where we literally met with 50 women and their children who were part of a project known as the Grameen Bank, a fascinating experiment in credit for poor people which has now caught on worldwide.  After this meeting, one of the women came up to me and, through an interpreter, spoke to me. She was holding a small baby in her arms, and she said to me that she wanted to tell me something. I asked what it was, through the interpreter. She wanted to tell me that, because of family planning and also because of the UNICEF and United Nations effort to save the lives of small children in developing countries, she and her husband had decided to have no more than three children. It was a dramatic admission on her part to a pale-skinned stranger from a country she had literally never heard of.  Those of us who think the money that is invested in this legislation doesn't do any good should take the time to visit those parts of the world where it literally means life or death. For her, it meant the baby in her arms would survive. In these countries, with their poor health conditions, many times unsanitary water would result in children with dysentery and other intestinal problems who literally died for lack of hydration. The rehydration therapy, as simple and cheap as it is, saves these lives and gives these mothers the hope that they don't need to have six children to have three survivors. And that, many times, is the driving force behind large families in poor countries.  So I hope those who are supporting this legislation, as I am, understand that its investment and commitment to international family planning and also the children's program is money well spent, not just for the humanitarian purposes which I have outlined but for very selfish reasons, for the future of the United States. If we start to stabilize world population, we can also help to stabilize political situations and hope as well that we will bring that kind of quality of life around the world that we enjoy in most parts of the United States today.                         School of the Americas  Mr. President, the final issue which I will address in this moment on the floor is in relation to an amendment which I am prepared to offer today but will not. It is an amendment which has been considered time and again in the House but has not been considered in the Senate. I had thought that it was time to call up this amendment, but after discussions with my colleagues we have decided to wait until next year's appropriations bill to address it.  What I am speaking to is a project known as the School of the Americas. The School of the Americas was established over 50 years ago to provide military education and training to military personnel of Central America, South America, and the Caribbean countries. Given the breakup of the Soviet Union, the training provided at this school is no longer appropriate to the long-term goals of the United States or Latin America. This school at Fort Benning, GA, has been a training ground for thousands of individuals who have been brought in from the militaries of Central and South America and the Caribbean and trained to become more proficient in their military ways.  We acknowledge the Army has tried to make changes at the School of the Americas by updating curricula and improving the selection process for students and the quality of teachers. Despite these efforts, it is my belief that the School of the Americas should be closed. It is an element in this bill which I do not support. It serves no strategic purpose.  In the post-cold-war era, we need to strengthen civilian institutions in Latin America, not the militaries. And the school cannot overcome its horrendous history and its past links to numerous military personnel who have committed human rights atrocities. These admissions are an embarrassment to the United States and to our reputation as a leader in promoting human rights throughout the world.  The training manuals at this school as late as 1991 contained instruction in torture and extortion. Imagine, U.S. taxpayers' dollars spent at this facility in Georgia, at a U.S. military base, to train foreign military leaders in torture and extortion. It is incomprehensible.  No one has been held accountable for the fact that the U.S. Army was teaching training techniques which clearlyviolated U.S. Army policy. The School of the Americas has trained leaders in tactics to violate human rights and has done so knowingly and deliberately. It is well documented that this school's graduates have planned and participated in severe cases of human rights abuses during the history of this institution.  Listen to this roster of graduates from the School of the Americas, funded by taxpayers' dollars: Panamanian dictator and drug dealer Manuel Noriega; 19 Salvadoran soldiers linked to the 1989 murder of 6 Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter; El Salvador death squad leader Roberto D'Aubuisson; Argentinian dictator Leopoldo Galtieri; 3 of the 5 officers involved in the 1980 rape and murder of 4 United States churchwomen in El Salvador; and 10 of the 12 officers responsible for the murder of 900 civilians in the El Salvadoran village, El Mozote.  Victims of these abuses often are the most vulnerable of the country, the poor and Roman Catholic religious who spoke out in defense of peace and social justice. Given that the training manuals used at the school advocated torture, blackmail and other forms of coercion, the atrocities committed by these graduates are predictable results. The United States needs, in this post-cold war era, to find a better way to moderate the abuses of Latin American militaries. Clearly, the School of the Americas is not the answer.  I think it is clear that this school needs to be closed. If an alternative needs to be opened, let us restructure it consistent with our own human rights values. I will not be offering the amendment today which would close this institution, but I want to make it clear to my colleagues in the Senate and those who are listening to this debate, that we will continue to monitor the School of the Americas, that we will continue to make certain that they know we are watching what they do and the graduates they send to lead the militaries of foreign nations. And we will insist, at every step of the way, that this School of the Americas pursue policies that are consistent with the best interests and policies of the United States.  Mr. President, at this point, I yield the remainder of my time.
