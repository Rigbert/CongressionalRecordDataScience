 President, when responsibility calls, it is usually not at a time of our choosing. The decision to answer is rarely easy or straightforward. Paul Ryan knows this. He spent his nights dreaming about tax policy, not the Speakership. But our country is fortunate that he stepped up to lead, and I know I am grateful that he did.  Speaker Ryan is thoughtful about the issues facing our Nation. He is sober-minded. He knows the job he is walking into is tough. He also understands the potential it holds in terms of conservative solutions for our country and in terms of more opportunity for the middle class.  When I called to congratulate Speaker Ryan, we discussed our many shared goals in Congress. We pledged a strong partnership. We aimed to continue advancing conservative reform. I look forward to working closely with him as we move forward.  Speaker Ryan knows what it means to work hard. He knows what it means to dream big dreams. He knows what it means to achieve them as well. Something we all admire about Speaker Ryan is his determination to ensure others are able to achieve big things in their lives too, to ensure others can lead fulfilling lives defined by meaning and punctuated with purpose.  There is no doubt he cares deeply. He cares about combating poverty effectively. He cares about lifting up the middle class successfully. And because he cares, he is willing to call out failed policies when they hurt those they are supposed to help, and he has suggested better ways forward as well.  In short, here is what we can say about Speaker Ryan: He has a big heart, he has an extraordinary intellect, and he knows how to lead with both. That quality is rare around here. So is having a reputation that so greatly precedes oneself in such a positive way. But that is Speaker Ryan.  Nothing is going to come easily in his new role, and he certainly knows that. Neither of us will be under any illusions about the positions we hold. We face a Democratic Party that continues to move left. We face a President who doesn't seem very interested in cooperation on the big things or the hard things, nor on making divided government work. These are the realities that face us, and we might as well acknowledge them, but it won't stop us from working together to advance conservative reform as well as to achieve solutions for the middle class whenever we can.  Today, though, let's celebrate Speaker Ryan's extraordinary achievement. He has already proven his stature as a leader in our party. From leading the Nation on responsible budgeting and pro-growth tax reform to serving as an extraordinary candidate for Vice President, he always rises to the challenge.  I would note for my House colleagues that their incoming leader campaigned vigorously to become President of the Senate, but he was drafted into the Speakership.  But, look, on a more serious note, Paul Ryan may not have asked for this job, but the moment called for him to lead, and I am grateful that he will because we know he is a leader who has repeatedly demonstrated the talent, the vision, and the experience to succeed.  I look forward to building a strong partnership on behalf of our country.                          ____________________
