 President, I rise today to introduce the Prevent Foreign Interference with Elections Act of 2019. This bill provides enhanced criminal penalties and additional safeguards to prevent foreign interference in our elections.  To be clear, there are already laws on the books to prosecute those who interfere in U.S. elections. Indeed, Special Counsel Mueller charged Russian intelligence officers who hacked into U.S. computers and stole documents, for the purpose of interfering in the 2016 presidential elections.  Special Counsel Mueller also charged the Russian Internet Research Agency and several of its employees for their role in the social media campaign that was designed to manipulate American voters.  This bill, however, makes election interference a separate criminal offense. It makes clear that those who conspire with foreign actors to interfere in U.S. elections will be punished appropriately for striking at the bedrock of our democracy,  This bill does five main things.  First, it explicitly makes it a crime to conspire with foreign nationals to interfere in U.S. elections.  Interference can be accomplished through breaking a federal criminal law, such as committing fraud, or by hacking into someone's computer, or by violating federal, state, or local election laws.  As I mentioned, this bill simply leaves no doubt that working with a foreign actor to commit these offenses with the goal of interfering in a U.S. election is a crime.  And it requires that those who break this law will be sentenced separately, and in addition to any other laws that were broken.  Second, it makes it so that people convicted of interfering in our elections would be inadmissible into the United States.  There is, however, an important exception. Those who cooperate with law enforcement to help catch those responsible for interference would be eligible for an S visa.  Third, it creates a civil action, allowing the Attorney General to immediately address foreign interference once U.S. law enforcement learns of it.  This is important because foreign interference can then be stopped as soon as it is discovered.  Fourth, it prohibits foreign-financed elections ads, including foreign-financed issue ads and foreign-financed digital ads.  These expansions will help protect the integrity of our electoral process.  Fifth and finally, it prohibits providing ``substantial assistance'' to foreign nationals trying to interfere in our elections.  It is important that we also hold ourselves accountable by not providing aid to those wishing to do us harm.  To be clear, there was foreign interference in the 2016 Presidential election.  The Intelligence Community unanimously concluded that the Russian government interfered by ``blend[ing] covert intelligence operations--such as cyber activity--with overt efforts by Russian government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries, and paid social media users or `trolls.' '' After a nearly two-year investigation, Special Counsel Mueller confirmed these core conclusions.  Along the way, his office indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers in connection with Russian hacking operations and three companies, including the Internet Research Agency and 13 of its employees for their role in the social media campaign to influence American voters.  Unless we do something, this interference will happen again. And to stop it, we need to not only make clear that interference will result in criminal punishment, we must also update our election laws so that they can combat these new cyber-attacks. This bill does both.  I am introducing this bill today with strong Democratic support, and I would particularly like to thank Senator Blumenthal for his leadership on this issue.  It is my sincere hope, however, that my Republican colleagues will join us in this important effort as well.  The issue I speak about today is one that goes to the core of our democracy. It is a bi-partisan issue that I hope both Democrats and Republicans can join in addressing.  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.                          ____________________
