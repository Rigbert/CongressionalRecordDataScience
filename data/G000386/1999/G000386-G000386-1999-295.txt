 President, I come before you today to submit a resolution which would designate the week of each November in which the holiday of Thanksgiving is observed as ``National Family Week.'' Each Congress since 1976 has passed legislation which established Family Week on a bi-annual basis, and I have been a frequent cosponsor of it. In fact, last Congress, I was the sponsor of the legislation, and am pleased to be able to further contribute to this longstanding tradition of recognizing the importance of family.  This Congress, however, I would like to pay special tribute to the hard work of the man who founded the idea of Family Week, Mr. Sam Wiley. Ever since 1971, Mr. Wiley worked hard to see that Family Week was recognized on every Thanksgiving in every state, and by every president. Unfortunately, however, Mr. Wiley passed away in December after a long battle with cancer. Remarkably, even during this fight with the painful and deadly disease, Mr. Wiley was more concerned with making sure Family Week continue, as it was his constant vigilance that kept the idea and spirit of Family Week alive year after year.  A friend, Mr. Noel Duerden, has said that Mr. Wiley's greatest desire was to make sure that after he died Family Week would still live on. As a tribute to Mr. Wiley, my legislation will guarantee that Family Week continues by making it permanent. The resolution I am submitting today will ensure that every year the President will issue a proclamation dedicating the week of the Thanksgiving holiday as Family Week.  As we all know, the family is the most basic element of our society, and the tie that binds us to one another. It is the strength of any free and orderly society and it is appropriate to honor this unit as being essential to the well-being of the United States.  Since Family Week will be observed during the weeks on which Thanksgiving falls, we will be paying homage to what we as a nation already know--the strength of the family provides the support through which we as individuals and a nation thrive. Therefore it is particularly suitable to pause during this special week in recognition of the celebrations and activities of the family which bring us closer together.  I hope my colleagues will join me in this effort and ask that an article from the Indianapolis Star about Mr. Wiley and Family Week be placed in the Record.  The article follows:            Founder Wants To Make Sure Family Week Continues                           (By John Strauss)       He founded National Family Week, but on a day when so many      families were together for the holiday, Sam Wiley found it      hard to say much.       ``I've seen better days,'' he said Friday from a bed at St.      Vincent Hospice.       Wiley, 72, is in the terminal stages of pancreatic and      liver cancer, but he is less concerned about his personal      situation than making sure the National Family Week movement      continues.       Ever since he started it in 1971, the week has been      recognized each Thanksgiving by every president and in every      state through proclamations, seminars and other activities      designed to recognize the importance of strong families.       Wiley's movement has a Web page, www.familyweek.org. The      former Whiteland High School administrator, teacher and      basketball coach, who retired in 1988, has worked tirelessly      to promote the week as a way to strengthen the regard and      support for families.       Along the way, he made 25 trips to Washington. His room at      the hospice has photos on the wall of Wiley with presidents      Ronald Reagan and George Bush, and with former Vice President      Dan Quayle as the proclamations for National Family Week were      signed over the years.       Wiley never married, but he came to believe in the      importance of families through his work with students, said      Rush Isenhour, a childhood friend from their days in Boone      County.       Isenhour was at Wiley's bedside on Friday, as her friend,      who is heavily medicated for pain, drifted in and out of      consciousness. Wiley's friends said he does not have long to      live.       ``He was a schoolteacher and he had so many children from      underprivileged families,'' Isenhour said. ``He heard them      talking about their family life, and that got him to thinking      about it, and it got him started.''       Noel Duerden, a friend who helped Wiley over the years,      said he and others are trying to find other groups to carry      on the organizational work. One of the biggest tasks is      writing and calling governors across the country to get them      to issue proclamations which are only good for a year.       ``Everybody's interested in National Family Week, but      nobody's taking the lead except Sam at this point,'' Duerden      said.       ``His greatest desire before he dies is to make sure this      continues,'' he said. ``Not just the proclamations, which are      a heavy amount of work, but to promote it with the      organizations and get right down to families.''       Duerden said he has been talking with the National Urban      League, the American Legion, Girl Scouts and other groups to      find support for continuing the annual observance.       Judy Lifferth is coordinator of National Family Week      activities in Columbus, where ``Families of the Year'' are      recognized for sticking together and supporting each other in      the face of difficulties.       This year's program also included training in Active      Parenting, a six-session video and discussion course that      focuses on communication and other parenting skills.       ``We live a fast-lane life, and National Family Week gives      people a chance in the     middle of their busy lives and realize how important their      families are,'' Lifferth said.       The Columbus mother of five has worked on National Family      Week activities for 10 years but didn't realize until      recently that the founder lived just up I-65 from her.       ``I wish there was a way I could meet him,'' she said.       ``I would like to tell him thank you from the bottom of my      heart.''                          ____________________
