 President, I wish to recognize yeoman CPO Mikel S. Cook, on the occasion of his retirement from the United States Navy.  In his 22-year career in the United States Navy, yeoman Chief Petty Officer Cook has served with great distinction and made countless sacrifices to our country. I commend him for his service and extraordinary dedication to duty and the United States of America.  Yeoman Chief Petty Officer Cook graduated from boot camp in 1994 from Recruit Training Command in Orlando, FL. Following graduation, he attended Yeoman ``A'' School in Meridian, MS. He reported to his first sea assignment with the Seabees assigned to Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 7. He later reported to the USS Rainier, AOE-7, participating in Operations Southern Watch and Enduring Freedom and earning his enlisted surface and air warfare pins. His final sea assignment was with Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron 2 out of Whidbey Island, WA.  Yeoman Chief Petty Officer Cook also served with distinction in a variety of assignments ashore: as executive assistant to the Deputy Chief of Staff--Operations and Intelligence, Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe in Mons, Belgium; and as a naval analyst with the special liaison detachment, North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Brussels, Belgium.  After completing his last sea tour, yeoman Chief Petty Officer Cook reported to his current assignment as congressional liaison in the Navy Appropriations Matters Office, where he helped the Department of the Navy achieve their financial and legislative goals. For 5 years, yeoman Chief Petty Officer Cook has demonstrated exceptional leadership and foresight, engaging Members of the Appropriations Committee and its staff to provide information essential to resourcing the Navy for its role as the world's dominant sea power. In an increasingly difficult budget environment, he provided essential support in shepherding four Navy budgets through the appropriations process, serving our Navy with insight and dedication.  I join my colleagues today in saying thank you to yeoman CPO Mikel S. Cook for his extraordinary dedication to duty and steadfast service to this country throughout his distinguished career in the U.S. Navy. We wish him; his wife, Robyn; and his daughter, Norah, ``Fair Winds and Following Seas'' in his well-deserved retirement.                          ____________________
