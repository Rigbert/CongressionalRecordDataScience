 In summarizing my remarks today, let me place on the Record, from the last century, no place in the world suffered more than the land of Ukraine, no place had more people forcibly starved, murdered, brutally beaten, buried alive, imprisoned, arrested into forced labor, including some of my ancestors.  I know, having traveled to Ukraine, how much the people of that great country want liberty. This is a moment that history will record in our new century the 21st. Joining with nations around the world, let us give Ukraine a bit of a lift to get her over this critical period she is facing.  I also wish to place into the Record information about what the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe has done in Ukraine to date. I will tell the body today that journalists are not being allowed to report from Crimea. They are being blocked and beaten by the government of Russia, from the reports we are getting on the ground. How is the world community to know the full truth of what is occurring?  Russia is moving the world backwards, not forwards. This bill is an important step in helping Ukraine to transition as we join with countries from throughout the world to condemn the violation of Ukraine's sovereign borders and to help give her the courage to stand up to those who would take her liberty away.  This will be the first time in modern history that that country has a chance to become the truly borderland great nation that she is meant to be, reaching west and north and east and south.  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, which is a loan guarantee to help lift that country over this most trying time and difficult crisis in its recent history.  I thank the gentlelady for yielding me this time. [From Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, Secretary                         General, March 6, 2014]        OSCE to Send Military and Civilian Personnel to Ukraine       Update at 12:00, 6 March: As of now, twenty-two OSCE      participating States are participating in the activity,      having sent up to two representatives each. Austria, Canada,      Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany,      Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway,      Poland, Slovenia, Slovakia, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom,      and the United States. One representative from the OSCE      Conflict Prevention Centre is also participating.       Vienna, 5 March 2014.--Eighteen OSCE participating States      decided to send 35 unarmed military personnel to Ukraine in      response to its request.       The matter was discussed at a joint meeting of the      Permanent Council and the Forum for Security Co-operation      (FSC) in Vienna on 4 March 2014.       The visit is taking place under Chapter III of the Vienna      Document 2011, which allows for voluntary hosting of visits      to dispel concerns about unusual military activities. Ukraine      has requested all OSCE participating States to send military      representatives from 5 to 12 March 2014, starting in Odessa.      This is the first time this mechanism has been activated.       As of now, eighteen OSCE participating States have      responded positively to the request sending up to two      representatives each. Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark,      Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia,      Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, Sweden, Turkey, United      Kingdom, and the United States. One representative from the      OSCE Conflict Prevention Centre will also be participating.      The military visit participants are on their way to Ukraine      now.       OSCE Secretary General Lamberto Zannier said: ``It Is my      hope that this military visit will help to de-escalate      tensions in Ukraine. By providing an objective assessment of      the facts on the ground, the OSCE will be better placed to      foster a political solution to the current crisis through      dialogue.''       ``Confidence-building and transparency are key elements of      the OSCE approach to security, which seeks to foster openness      and dialogue as the best way to resolve conflicts in our      region,'' he added.       The Vienna Document 2011 is one of the main confidence-     building measures developed by the OSCE. Under this document,      all participating States are required to share information on      their military forces, equipment and defence planning. The      Document also provides for inspections and evaluation visits      that can be conducted on the territory of any participating      State that has armed forces.       Note to editors: Chapter III of the Vienna Document 2011      (full text see at http://www.osce.org/fsc/86597)     VOLUNTARY HOSTING OF VISITS TO DISPEL CONCERNS ABOUT MILITARY                                ACTIVITIES       (18) In order to help to dispel concerns about military      activities in the zone of application for CSBMs,      participating States are encouraged to invite other      participating States to take part in visits to areas on the      territory of the host State in which there may be cause for      such concerns. Such invitations will be without prejudice to      any action taken under paragraphs (16) to (16.3).       (18.1) States invited to participate in such visits will      include those which are understood to have concerns. At the      time invitations are issued, the host State will communicate      to all other participating States its intention to conduct      the visit, indicating the reasons for the visit, the area to      be visited, the States invited and the general arrangements      to be adopted.       (18.2) Arrangements for such visits, including the number      of the representatives from other participating States to be      invited, will be at the discretion of the host State, which      will bear the in-country costs. However, the     host State should take appropriate account of the need to      ensure the effectiveness of the visit, the maximum amount of      openness and transparency and the safety and security of the      invited representatives. It should also take account, as far      as practicable, of the wishes of visiting representatives as      regards the itinerary of the visit. The host State and the      States which provide visiting personnel may circulate joint      or individual comments on the visit to all other      participating States.                                  ____                            The White House                     Office of the Press Secretary                 [For Immediate Release--March 6, 2014]       To the Congress of the United States: Pursuant to the      International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701      et seq.) (IEEPA), I hereby report that I have issued an      Executive Order (the ``order'') declaring a national      emergency with respect to the unusual and extraordinary      threat to the national security and foreign policy of the      United States posed by the situation in Ukraine.       The order does not target the country of Ukraine, but      rather is aimed at persons--including persons who have      asserted governmental authority in the Crimean region without      the authorization of the Government of Ukraine--who undermine      democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine; threaten      its peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial      integrity; and contribute to the misappropriation of its      assets. The order blocks the property and interests in      property and suspends entry into the United States of any      person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in      consultation with the Secretary of State:       to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have engaged      in, directly or indirectly, any of the following:       actions or policies that undermine democratic processes or      institutions in Ukraine;       actions or policies that threaten the peace, security,      stability, sovereignty, or territorial integrity of Ukraine;      or       misappropriation of state assets of Ukraine or of an      economically significant entity in Ukraine;       to have asserted governmental authority over any part or      region of Ukraine without the authorization of the Government      of Ukraine;       to be a leader of an entity that has, or whose members      have, engaged in any activity described above or of an entity      whose property and interest in property are blocked;       to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported      to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any      person whose property and interests in property are blocked      pursuant to the order.       I have delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury the      authority, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to      take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and      regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the      President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry out the      purposes of the order. All agencies of the United States      Government are directed to take all appropriate measures      within their authority to carry out the provisions of the      order.       I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.
