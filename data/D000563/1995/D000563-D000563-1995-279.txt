Most people may have missed it. There was a television special about folks who became so rich that in order to avoid paying Federal taxes, they renounced their citizenship, and by renouncing their citizenship and becoming citizens of some other country, they avoided their Federal tax liability, so they used our Nation, they used our resources, they used our people, they filled up their bank account, and then they skipped town, and what we have been trying to do, actually skipped the country, what we have been trying to do here is to change that and to say that is all over. If you owe the Federal Government of the United States taxes and you have made a profit in doing it simply by renouncing your citizenship, we are not letting you off the hook. I am sorry we could not get our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join us in this effort.
