 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a Kentucky businessman whose success allowed him to give something back to Kentucky. Jim Smith, who passed away May 31, was one of western Kentucky's most successful self-made businessmen.  Mr. Smith, the youngest of eight children, dropped out of school in the 10th grade. After being involved in several construction company partnerships, he struck out on his own and turned one bulldozer into a multi-million dollar construction business. Jim Smith Construction Co. built most of the major highways in western Kentucky. He also expanded into other areas, including coal, transportation, a hotel, and a restaurant.  A close friend and business partner, David Reed, was quoted in the Paducah Sun as saying, ``Those of us who know Jim well realize immediately the void his passing will mean, not only to us personally but to all of western Kentucky.'' Former Kentucky Gov. Julian Carroll said of Mr. Smith, ``I've known him as a friend, a businessman, a citizen of the community, a Christian * * * but of all the roles that Jim filled in his life, the one that he relished the most, and agonized over the most, was being the father of four sons.'' Even though he was wealthy, Mr. Smith required his sons to work and earn their living.  Mr. Smith is survived by his wife, Sandy; four sons, Mike, Rex, Chris, and Steve; two stepchildren, Joelle Smith and Joel Weaver; three brothers, Hiram, Hugh, and Bill Smith; and three sisters, Geneva Youngblood, Imogene Riggs, and Lucille Wade. I would ask that my colleagues join me in honoring this extraordinary Kentuckian.                          ____________________
