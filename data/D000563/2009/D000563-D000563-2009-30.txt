Under the usual business of the Senate, we agree that we will do something more thoughtful and humane and a vote at an earlier time. Senator Reid has approached Senator McConnell and said we have one of our Senators, Senator Byrd of West Virginia, with significant health problems, who was been brought to the floor now early in the morning, late at night, and in a wheelchair. He looks better than ever, I might add. He is being asked to show up at 1 in the morning because we could not reach what is usual comity and gentlemanly accord on scheduling a vote.  It is unfortunate because now we face this 1 a.m. vote and with no cooperation on the other side to even change the vote for a very humane reason.
