 President, as many taxpayers are struggling in the midst of the current tax filing season, the issue of taxpayer's rights takes on a special importance. Although most IRS employees provide valuable and responsible service, taxpayer abuse by the Government is an ongoing problem. With this in mind, I am very happy to be joining Senator Pryor and others in reintroducing the taxpayer bill of rights II. This is very necessary legislation that builds upon the original taxpayer bill of rights that we passed into law in 1988.  I was unable to be here earlier today when the bill was introduced because I was taking part in the President's signing ceremony of the Congressional Accountability Act, of which I am the lead Senate sponsor. But, I'm glad to be here now to offer my strong support to this ongoing effort.  Mr. President, for me, the long process of trying to ensure taxpayer protections began in the early 1980's, when I was a member and then chairman of the Finance Subcommittee on IRS Oversight. We made progress, but it was only the beginning.  Senator Pryor continued the cause when he succeeded me as chairman in 1987. At that time, he took the initiative and asked me to work with him in pushing for a taxpayer bill of rights by expanding legislation I and others had introduced. It took nearly 2 years, but we ultimately succeeded in achieving this goal.  We now have a 6-year record of implementation regarding the taxpayer bill of rights. Great strides toward taxpayer protection were achieved through this legislation. However, the taxpayer bill of rights of 1988 was never expected to be the final chapter of the book on taxpayer protection. It was a major step in the continuing process of stamping out taxpayer abuse. And that process continues today, as we look into ways to improve the current law.  In reviewing the record, it's clear that much more needs to be done. There's no question that breakdowns in implementing the law have occurred, and there are gaps in the law that need to be filled. For instance, we believe the current ombudsman position is too limited and too beholden to IRS insiders. Our legislation will turn the ombudsman into a more independent office of taxpayer advocate that will have expanded powers to help taxpayers.  We were successful in passing a very similar proposal through the Congress in 1992. However, the underlying legislation that the proposal was attached to was vetoed by President Bush. So, we're back again in this new Congress.  Since 1987, Senator Pryor and I have worked in a cooperative, bipartisan effort to further taxpayer rights. As our roles change somewhat in this new Republican-controlled Congress, I hope to continue our successful teamwork.  Beyond the introduction of this bill today, Senator Pryor and I will be working on further improvements and even more protaxpayer provisions that will be offered at a later date.  I urge my colleagues to join us in this effort to help make the IRS more responsible and more accountable to the taxpayers of this country.                                 ______      By Mr. McCAIN:  S. 260. A bill to provide for the protection of books and materials from the Library of Congress, and for other [[Page S1373]] purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.              the library of congress book protection act Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I introduce legislation to help protect the valuable resources of the Library of Congress. The Library of Congress Protection Act will help the Library of Congress stop abuses of its free book loan program by authorizing the Library to impose fines for books that are long overdue.  I am reintroducing this legislation to empower Library of Congress officials to crack down on individuals who seriously abuse their Library privileges, by keeping books too long or failing to return them. Library of Congress officials should not have to tolerate the fact that many individuals are apparently unconcerned about returning the books that taxpayers provide for them. Congress should not prevent the Library from instituting strengthened policies to hold severely delinquent borrowers responsible for their tardiness.  This legislation will enable the Library of Congress to implement a reasonable overdue book charge policy similar to those of most public libraries across America. By doing so, the many Members of Congress, congressional staffers, and executive branch employees who benefit from this magnificent institution will have an added incentive to comply with the generous loan policies of the Library of Congress.  This proposal is very basic, but it will afford Library officials the leverage and flexibility they need to address this problem. This bill will help Library of Congress officials keep better track of their resources, and will spur many delinquent borrowers to return the books that taxpayers provide for them completely free of charge.  The Library of Congress Book Protection Act would direct the Library to implement an overdue book charge policy for books improperly held over 70 days. These individuals or offices will have their privileges suspended until their fines are paid in full. Library of Congress officials will, however, be able to waive such penalties when appropriate. The Library would also be authorized to retain the funds received from late book fines, as well. Finally, the offices of severely delinquent borrowers and the fines they owe will be published in the annual report submitted by the Library to its oversight committees.  Figures published by the Library during the 103d Congress showed that out of the 20,000 books that were out on loan, over one-third were listed as overdue. One half of the 4,200 books on loan to congressional staff and the media were listed as overdue, and one in five books out on loan to Members, committees, and congressional support agencies had been overdue for more than 2 months. Library of Congress officials state that over 300,000 books are missing from their collections dating back to 1978, and the estimated cost of these thefts is $12 million.  I am concerned about the fact that it is all too easy for individuals to disregard their responsibility to return books to the Library of Congress in a timely manner. This negligence is not only unfair to the other users of the Library, but it also drains the Library's resources in chasing down overdue or missing books.  In addition to Members of Congress and congressional staff, the Library of Congress also makes loans to executive branch departments and agencies, the judiciary and diplomatic corps, the press, and other institutions. As I have mentioned, Mr. President, the Library of Congress is barred from charging late fees for overdue books in contrast to virtually every other publicly funded Library in America. Furthermore, the Library cannot retain any funds that might be collected due to the loss or damage of loaned books. It's clearly time to change these unwise restrictions and strengthen the Library's ability to protect its resources, and I hope Members of the Senate will support this legislation to do so.  Surely it's not asking too much of the individuals and offices fortunate enough to the use the Library of Congress to do so in a responsible manner. Even under the new borrowing guidelines that would be instituted by this legislation, there really is no reason for any well-intentioned borrower ever to have to pay late fines or have their privileges suspended. I'm optimistic that the mere specter of having to pay overdue book fines will coax delinquent borrowers into responsibility renewing their book loans or returning the books.  I hope that the Senate will adopt this legislation to implement prudent new guidelines in the book loan policies of the Library of Congress.                          ____________________
