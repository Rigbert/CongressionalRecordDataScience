Speaker, I rise today in honor of my dear friends of the WWII Memorial.  It is with deepest sympathy I am unable to attend the Celebration of Life Ceremony to honor Ambassador Hadyn Williams, a champion of liberty's legacy. With this regret, I send a few words to remember Ambassador Williams and all he did to create the centerpiece Memorial, which preserves rightful attention to the greatest generation.       Ambassador F. Hadyn Williams had a long and distinguished      career in international development, diplomacy and public      service, one that demonstrated a lifetime of integrity and a      duty to country, which left a lasting legacy for future      generations.       I had the honor to work closely with Ambassador Williams.      Together, we along with other great champions implemented the      idea of honoring the 16 million brave and dedicated men and      women who served in World War II--over 400,000 of whom never      came home to their loved ones--with a glorious memorial on      the National Mall--America's front yard--between the Lincoln      Memorial and the Washington Monument. The five million people      who visit the World War II Memorial every year owe a small      debt of gratitude for Ambassador Williams' role in this      tribute.       Ambassador Williams had a remarkable lifetime of      achievements--with service in World War II; in academia at      the University of California, Berkeley and Tufts University,      as a student and then as a professor and administrator; as a      public servant, serving as a deputy assistant secretary in      the Defense Department under both Presidents Eisenhower and      Kennedy; as a diplomat as the longest-serving President of      the Asia Foundation; and as Chairman of the American Battle      Monuments Commission's World War II Memorial Committee.       Ambassador Williams will be remembered for his service and      devotion to others, his vision, his commitment, and his      contribution to honor our World War II veterans and to      preserve this lasting memory.  Ambassador Williams' memory will live on through the fruits of his achievements.                          ____________________
