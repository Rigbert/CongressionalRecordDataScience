We overlook the numbers. The numbers are important. It is good to do something symbolic, but it doesn't solve the problem. We know the problem grows, as the Senator from Nevada has indicated, by 1 or 2 million a year--more people without health insurance coverage, more people who are vulnerable, and a Congress which has a tin ear when it comes to this issue.  We look at the Time magazine polls where it talks about the concern of the American people about health care. It doesn't get through to the leadership in Congress, and we will leave this year having done nothing to make it better.
