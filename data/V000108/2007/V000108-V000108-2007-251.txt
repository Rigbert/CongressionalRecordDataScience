To commemorate this special occasion, Peoples Bank will hold an anniversary celebration on Saturday, January 6, 2007, at the Center for Visual and Performing Arts in Munster, Indiana.  Peoples Bank was established in 1910 and was organized with a focus to meet the many needs of its consumers. Peoples Bank was originally known as the First Polish National Building and Loan Association. During that time, it was the main hub for church and social activities in East Chicago, Indiana. Over several decades, the association's name changed numerous times, and in 1989, it was renamed Peoples Bank.  Peoples Bank was the first savings and loan association to receive a federal charter in EastChicago after the Great Depression. In the 1950s, the bank played an integral role in assisting former servicemen to build or purchase homes through G.I. Loans. At this time, Peoples Bank expanded its access to the Northwest Indiana community by moving into a multi-office operation. The Woodmar section of Hammond was chosen as the second office location for Peoples Bank.  It was during the 1960s that Peoples Bank added another branch location in Merrillville. Due to the success of these initial offices, additional branches were eventually established in the area, including branches in Dyer, Munster, Schererville, and a second branch in Merrillville. In the year 2000, Peoples Bank opened its eighth branch location in Hobart.  With all of this expansion taking place, Peoples Bank introduced a new corporate headquarters in 2003. Located on two acres, this four-story building houses the many departments and offices necessary to operate such a professional organization, where the customers always come first.  Peoples Bank's Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Mr. David Bochnowski, has served as the leader of the organization since 1981, after serving on the board since 1977. With his guidance, along with all the hard work of the staff, Peoples Bank has continued to be an active force in providing superior customer service and assistance to all of Northwest Indiana.  Madam Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating Peoples Bank on their 97th Anniversary. Their dedication to the people of Northwest Indiana and their constant efforts throughout the years are worthy of the highest commendation.                          ____________________
