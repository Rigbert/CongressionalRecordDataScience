Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment. This amendment has been triggered by a recent IG report of the Department of Homeland Security that not all applicants for immigration benefits undertake an IBIS check. The excuse that was given is that not all U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service employees have a high enough security clearance to conduct the proper checks, and some of the problems stem from simple lax management. Neither of these excuses is valid.  I am amazed that this has not always been a requirement of the law. We should conduct a thorough background check of anybody who seeks immigration benefits. The necessity of these checks was demonstrated by the fact that at least six of the 9/11 hijackers, murderers, ended up slipping through the cracks. I think this amendment plugs an important loophole in the current law, and I urge my colleagues to support it.
