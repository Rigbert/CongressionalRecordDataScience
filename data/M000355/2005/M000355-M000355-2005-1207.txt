 She swore she would uphold the law. You are absolutely right. When she put on the robes, she was no longer sort of musing and making provocative thoughts; she was making law. In fact, I think the record reflects that one year on the D.C. Circuit, before she was elevated to the Supreme Court, then-Judge Ginsburg on the D.C. Circuit voted with then-Judge Scalia 95 percent of the time and voted with Judge Bork, believe it or not, 100 percent of the time--100 percent of the time. That, in spite of the fact that she had made some rather provocative--I think we would all agree--observations on a variety of different issues that I expect the Senator from Alabama, and I, and the Senator from Georgia in the chair, and I bet virtually everybody on the other side of the aisle would consider way outside of the mainstream to the left.
