President, if I could have the attention of the Chamber for 60 seconds.  The last amendment by Senator Chambliss received 99 votes. We all joined in supporting it. It was a good amendment. This amendment, which I am offering, I think is better. Here is why.  Under the amendment offered by Senator Chambliss, you could reduce the age at which you are eligible as a reservist to start receiving your retirement based on the time you spent mobilized, activated. This amendment says you could reduce it by the time served in the Reserve.  Right now, no matter when you start, how long you serve, you cannot draw the first dollar in retirement until you are 60 years old. Under my amendment, if you have served 25 years in the Reserve, you could start drawing it at age 55, which is the common retirement age for civil servants, for Federal employees.  My amendment is endorsed by the National Guard Association, the Military Officers Association, and the Reserve Officers Association.       Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senators      Corzine and Landrieu as cosponsors.
