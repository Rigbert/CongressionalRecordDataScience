Speaker, I rise today to recognize Michael Tucker, one of my constituents, who was recently honored for his leadership and community work in crime prevention. The National Crime Prevention Council and Ameritech selected Special Agent Turner to receive the Ameritech Awards of Excellence in Crime Prevention. Special Agent Turner is one of 8 winners selected from 140 nominations.  Special Agent Turner, the demand reduction coordinator for the DEA's Washington Field Division, is a pioneer in the coordination of law enforcement officials with local citizens to combat crime in their communities. He has had numerous successes in South Boston, Virginia, and Halifax County where he helped these communities fight drugs and crime. Most recently, Special Agent Turner has worked with the DEA in Washington, DC, to provide leadership in reducing homicides and violent crimes in the East Capitol Dwellings and Greenway communities. Additionally, he has worked with the 6th District Police Department Community Services section to create youth programs and neighborhood watch groups. He, along with the D.C. Police Department, helped to organize the orange hat patrol groups.  Special Agent Turner's work to help foster community involvement in law enforcement has led to a sharp decline in the homicide rate in DC's 6th Police District and the creation of many new prevention programs in community organizations. Organizations such as the Boys and Girls Clubs and Drug Abuse Resistance Education Plus have become involved with these new prevention programs.  I would like to thank the National Crime Prevention Council and Ameritech for honoring Michael Turner with the Ameritech Awards in Excellence in Crime Prevention. I applaud NCPC's dedication to helping fight crime and building community support and, I appreciate Ameritech's commitment to supporting crime prevention initiatives.  It is evident from Special Agent Turner's work that he is not afraid to identify a troubled community which is plagued with crime, to roll up his sleeves and to take personal action to solve a problem. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Special Agent Turner for this well deserved honor.                          ____________________
