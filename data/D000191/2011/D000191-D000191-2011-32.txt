 What am I talking about? Well, last Friday the authorization for the Federal Aviation Administration expired. So the government is not collecting $200 million a week in security fees and other fees that pay for the aviation system. It is partially funded by the users of that system with ticket taxes and such. That is $200 million a week.  Now, what's happened since? Well, three airlines, three honest airlines--Frontier Airlines, Alaska, and Virgin America--lowered ticket prices because the government isn't collecting the taxes. But the other airlines, not so much. They actually raised their ticket prices to match the taxes, and they're collecting the windfall.  At the same time, their association, the Air Transport Association, is complaining about ticket taxes: But a big chunk of your ticket is going to Washington. Well, you can now X out Washington, and you can put in United Airlines, Continental Airlines, U.S Airways, Southwest Airlines, and Jet Blue, because they're taking the money.  And guess what? In addition to the consumers getting ripped off here, $200 million a week, we have another problem, the second one, tax cuts create jobs. Well, we've cut taxes, $200 million a week. That's a lot. And guess what? So far, 4,000 government jobs.  Now, Republicans don't care about government jobs even if they're doing some pretty critical stuff. But also, tens of thousands of private sector jobs are down the tube because not collecting the taxes means all of the airport improvement projects across America funded by these fees are grinding to a halt. Critical projects, projects that will save lives from runway incursions, control towers, security improvements in our airports to defeat terrorist attacks.  And in the case of my little regional airport on the coast in Oregon, their project to install a runway lighting system for instrument landing before winter has stopped. We just got jet service in there. The airlines say, Look, if we're going to come in here in the wintertime, you've got some bad weather. We need that system. Well, if this impasse continues, we will not have that system by next winter.  Now, who is that helping? Who are you guys helping over there with these stupid stunts you're pulling here? $200 million a week that the government isn't collecting that would pay for these critical projects, put tens of thousands of people to work, and now it's a windfall to a bunch of airlines.  But don't worry, the Air Transport Association says, these short-term increases, that is by the airlines increasing their ticket prices to make up for the taxes going away, these short-term increases benefit all stakeholders because it enables the airlines to invest in their product and service. Huh? What?  Let's see. The money used to go for safety and security and other essentials; now it's going to the airlines, and they're going to use it to improve their product and service. Maybe they'll start serving peanuts and soda again on some of these flights. I don't know.  But this is outrageous. So much for the Republican mantra. You know, corporations do pay taxes. And, in this case, now they are getting a windfall because the taxes went away. And no, tax cuts don't create jobs. Wrong twice.                          ____________________
