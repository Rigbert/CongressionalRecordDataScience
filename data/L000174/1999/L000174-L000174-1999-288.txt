President, we are coming to the close of a vital debate, and I do not use that word casually. The issues we are voting on in some cases have life and death consequences for the people we were elected to represent.  The individual rights spelled out in our Patients' Bill of Rights are clear, and they are specific. They are strong, and they would work. They have been painstakingly drafted and redrafted and then further refined for more than a year.  They have the support of hundreds of medical and consumer organizations whose millions of members work directly in this field. They would achieve for patients the very rights that our constituents have repeatedly signaled that they want and need and deserve in this age of managed health care.  We have offered the Patients' Bill of Rights, point by point, reform by reform. In response, senators on the Republican side of the aisle have cobbled together weak or illusory copies of these reforms, offered them in place of the real thing, and hoped that nobody outside this Chamber would notice the differences.  We have seen this happen with access to emergency case, with a woman's access to an OB/GYN and with a patient's access to specialists.  This flurry of amendments, mixing genuine rights for patients and the phantom versions from the other side, has obscurred some of these issues in a cloud of political dust. Tonight, with the final votes of this debate, that cloud will be lifted. Senators will decide whether they will stand with patients and their doctors, or with the insurance companies.  Senators will decide whether 161 million Americans can enjoy the protections of the Patients' Bill of Rights, or whether 113 million Americans will be left in the waiting room.  There are many key differences between the Patients' Bill of Rights and the fall-back plan that Republican leaders have come up with. But the most important differences are that our bill would cover everyone, our bill lets doctors make the medical decisions, and our plan holds plans accountable to take away incentives to minimize critical health care decisions that can hurt or kill people.  Just this morning, we have heard the Republicans attempt to justify why it is okay to protect HMO's from accountability for their decisions that lead to injury or death. Polls show that the public overwhelmingly supports the key elements of our Patients' Bill of Rights. Americans--the people that Democrats and Republicans alike say we are trying to protect--want the protections the Democratic plan offers.  I have heard from many Vermonters on their experiences with managed care. Each of these moving stories makes you ask: What if it was me, or someone I knew?  When I was home in Vermont last week, I picked up the Burlington Free Press and, beside a guest column he had written, was met with the friendly face of an old friend, Dr. Charles Houston. He and I go way back to my days as a prosecutor in Burlington when he was a prominent physician doing remarkable things in the Vermont medical community. He has been a beacon of good advice to me throughout my time in the Senate. He is an indispensable Vermonter.  Dr. Houston's commentary depicted the devastating and tragic experiencehe and his wife had with their managed care company that ultimately led to his wife's death.  My wife is a registered nurse, so I get a dose of the practical reality of these problems across the breakfast table, as well as from the accounts I get from Vermonters. It is these personal accounts, like this one from Charlie, that bring home the need for a Patients' Bill of Rights.  Mr. President, I will ask unanimous consent that Dr. Charles Houston's article be entered into the Record.  Mr. President, the question today is this: Will the Senate pass a bill that protects everyone--161 million Americans who get their health care through a managed care program--or just a fraction of those families, the 48 million who are in employer self-funded plans? Will we continue to hear and read stories from the people in our states who have no protections? Will we continue to hear accounts like the tragic one of Charlie Houston's wife? I hope not.  The President has indicated that he would veto a so-called Patients' Bill of Rights if all we send him is one containing the weak Republican provisions.  Maybe then we can rescue those millions of Americans the Senate today has stranded in the waiting room without a real patients' Bill of Rights.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the article to which I referred.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Burlington Free Press, July 2, 1999]                 Managed Care Needs Immediate Overhaul                      (By Dr. Charles S. Houston)       Can anything worthwhile be added to the billions of words      written and spoken about health care? Why is our medical care      today both better and worse than in the past? What happened?       Here's one story.       An 84-year-old nurse led an active life despite mild      chronic lung disease, but after a long plane trip developed      pneumonia. Finally admitted to the hospital, she was treated      aggressively by an ever-changing group of specialists and      nurses and went home after two weeks--but with diarrhea      either from antibiotics or a hospital infection.       She was weak and undernourished but her doctors could not      visit her at home, insisting she return to the hospital. When      she refused, they tried to direct her care by phone. She      drafted downhill and died two weeks later, a victim of      efforts to reshape medicine by managed care in recent years.       First, traditional care was scrapped and most doctors      forced to join systems and to abandon fee-for-service      medicine. We are told this was done because: 1. care was      getting too expensive; 2. too many people could not get care;      and 3. technology had become so complex.       Managed care, we were told, would decrease the cost,      eliminate waste, open the system to the needy, and provide      highly technical care through specialists. In the capitalist      mode, competition would cure all.       The goal became to provide the best possible care to      everyone. Who could quarrel with this? Yet a moment's thought      shows this was and will always be impossible: There aren't      enough providers and other resources. But you don't need a      Cadillac to go shopping; any car will do. Instead our goal      should be to make appropriate care easily available to all      who need and seek it. The treatment should match the problem,      the cost must be affordable.       So what has managed care done? 1. The costs of care have      skyrocketed even faster; and 2. specialization has led to      fragmentation and medical care by committee. What little      fraud had existed was replaced by the waste-filled octopus to      non-medical insurance administrators who can--and do--     overrule caregivers in major medical decisions. Doctors must      climb walls of paperwork, distancing them from patients. It      has become harder to reach or talk to your physician.      Administrators and stockholders in the managed care      organizations fatten on profits. Now many HMOs are failing or      increasing rates prohibitively.       Two other dominating forces must be mentioned. Medical      knowledge has expanded far more rapidly than has      understanding of how to use it appropriately. More and more      specialists with exotic devices do miracles, So, in part to      protect the patient, in part for self-protection, physicians      often feel compelled to consult experts, and some are      reluctant to take leadership in care of an individual.      Fragmentation became a worse danger than concentration of      responsibility.       There's no virtue in crying wolf, and screaming catastrophe      without offering a way of escape. Having been a practitioner      for many years, alone and in groups, and a teacher in our      medical school, I have watched and studied the destruction of      traditional care with dismay. I'm confident that many      patients and doctors feel as I do. Something must be done,      and soon. Managed care as we know it must go. Though over-     simplified, the following would be a strong start:       End or modify commercialization of health care. By      regulation make hospitals, medical groups and insurers non-     profit and monitor compliance.       Continue the lead role of a primary care provider as first      call and facilitate appropriate consultation and resources.       Require insurers to open enrollment for all, allowing them      a fair return on investment.       Since each state has different needs, develop statewide      insurance plans to provide appropriate health care to all its      citizens. Several years ago the Governor's Health Commission      prepared such a plan but it failed. Why? Lobbyists? Economic      fears? This plan deserves careful look.       Finally, a sad personal note. The patient described above      was my wife of 58 years. She was truly a victim of the new      medicine.
