President, I rise today to draw the Senate's attention to National Assisted Living Week. The National Center for Assisted Living is sponsoring National Assisted Living Week this week to highlight the significance and the hope that this type of service can provide seniors.  Assisted living is a long term care alternative for seniors who need more assistance than is available in retirement communities, but do not require the heavy medical and nursing care provided by nursing facilities. Approximately one million of our nation's seniors have chosen the option of assisted living in this country. This demonstrates a tremendous desire by seniors and their families to have the kind of assistance that they need in bathing, taking medications or other activities of daily living in a setting that truly becomes their home.  This year's theme of National Assisted Living Week is ``A Community of Families'' and I think that is appropriate because assisted living encourages the involvement of families in the lives of the residents of assisted living facilities, and because this option can mean so much for seniors and their families.  Oregon has led our nation in pioneering the concept of assisted living and the state spends more state health dollars to provide assisted living services than any other state in our nation. Assisted living has taken different directions in different states and I believe providing these choices for consumers is important to provide security, dignity and independence for seniors.  Assisted living will become even more important as an option of seniors and their families as our nation experiences the tsunami of aging baby boomers. It is important for us to continue to support options that allow seniors and their families a choice of settings in order to assure that they get the level of care that they need.                          ____________________
