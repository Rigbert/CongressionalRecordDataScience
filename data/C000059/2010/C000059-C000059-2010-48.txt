San Clemente has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Joe Anderson is one such individual. On February 25, 2010, Joe will be honored at the San Clemente Chamber of Commerce Annual Meeting and Award Ceremony where he will receive the 2009 Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award.  Joe was raised in Southern California and graduated from Arizona State University with a B.S. Degree in Economics. He is a Chartered Life Underwriter, a professional designation conferred by the American College, BrynMawr, Pennsylvania. Following graduation, Joe was employed by Mobil Oil Corporation for eleven years. During his employment with Mobil he held a number of management positions in various locations in the United States, including Los Angeles, Seattle, New York City and Sacramento.  In 1976, Joe and his family relocated to South Orange County where he opened a successful State Farm Insurance Agency in San Clemente. After operating his agency for ten years, Joe accepted a management position with the company. During the last decade of his career, Joe held an executive level assignment with responsibility for all agency operations in South Orange County. He retired in 2005 after 29 loyal years with the firm.

He served on the San Clemente Growth Management, Economic Development and General Plan Review Committees. He chaired the Casa Romantica Feasibility Study, and co-chaired the Downtown Visioning Committee. Due to his many years of service, Joe was named the 1993 San Clemente Citizen of the Year.  Joe was first elected to the San Clemente City Council in 1990, where he served two terms and then stepped down in 1998. In 2002, at the urging of members of the community, Joe ran and was elected to a third term. He was re-elected in November 2006 for a fourth term. Joe served as Mayor in 1992, 2005 and 2008.

The Anderson's have five beautiful grandchildren.  Joe Anderson's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of San Clemente, California.
