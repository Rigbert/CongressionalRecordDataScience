That is exactly what this amendment does. And if you are really serious about doing something about the deficit, this is your chance to do it.  This morning we passed the Agriculture appropriations conference report which had a very small increase, but last week we passed the Labor-HHS appropriations bill with $107 billion more than the previous year. This has to stop, and that is why this is a very significant vote.  Mr. President, I say to my conservative friends, this is going to be scored very heavily by conservative organizations, such as the National Taxpayers Union. I urge a positive vote.
