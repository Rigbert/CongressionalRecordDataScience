Chairman, the massive crippling in this bill of the National Labor Relations Board is a punitive effort to restrict the agency responsible for ensuring the rights of workers to organize and bargain collectively.  This agency was created in 1935 to bring order and reduce violence in labor organization disputes. The agency has served our Nation for over 60 years, guarding against unfair labor practices by both employers and employees.  Mr. colleagues who want to gut the NLRB should consider whether or not they really want disputes to be settled back in the streets, because that is where we are heading. In fact, with these massive cuts, it is going to take over 1,000 days before decisions are rendered by the NLRB. By disabling this agency, this bill strikes a hard blow against working Americans.  Mr. Chairman, let us stand up for working families. Let us vote ``no'' on this bill.
