 President, today I am once again honored to introduce a bill which focuses on an important issue facing American families today--paying for the education of their children. I have long believed that we need to make college education more affordable, and my legislation, the Setting Aside for a Valuable Education, or SAVE, Act, will do that by making savings in qualified tuition savings plans entirely tax-free. I am pleased to be joined in this endeavor by the bill's original co-sponsors, Senators Graham, Bunning, DeWine, Warner, and Lugar.  I have worked for the past six years to make saving for college easier for American families by providing ways to help them keep pace with the rising cost of a college education through tax incentives. In 1994, I introduced the first bill to make education savings in state tuition plans exempt from taxation. Since that time, Congress has made significant progress toward achieving this important goal.  In 1996, I was able to include a provision in the Small Business Job Protection Act that clarified the tax treatment of state-sponsored savings plans and the participants' investment. This measure established that account earnings on the savings plans are to be included in gross income when distributions to attend school are made. This was an important change because it removed the tax uncertainty that was hindering the plans' effectiveness and helped families who are trying to save for their children's future education needs. Before this clarification, it appeared that account earnings may be taxed annually, which would have deterred saving for education expenses. Also, my language shifted the tax burden upon distribution of the funds from the parent to the student, who is generally taxed at a lower rate.  The following year, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 included several important legislative initiatives that maximized flexibility to families with investments in long-term education savings plans. Through this vehicle, I was pleased to be able to expand the definition of ``eligible education expenses'' to include room and board costs so that these expenses--often as much as one-half the entire cost of college--also received the deferred tax treatment. Secondly, I was able to include a provision which expanded the definition of ``eligible institutions'' to include all schools, including certain proprietary schools, which are eligible under the Department of Education's student aid program. Finally, I was pleased that the Taxpayer Relief Act included a more detailed definition of the term ``member of family'' to allow tax-free transfers of credits or account balances in a qualified tuition program to additional family members in the event that the named beneficiary does not attend college.  However, while I am proud of these initial success stories, I will continue to press to make education savings entirely tax free. While the end is insight, we cannot claim victory until we achieve this goal. In fact, the need for education savings tax relief is more acute then ever as recent studies demonstrate that we must continue to encourage parents to adopt a long-term savings approach for their children's future education.  According to the College Board, during the 2000-2001 academic school year, the average tuition at four-year public colleges rose between 4.4 and 5.2 percent. It is important to note that this increase was higher than the 1999 tuition increase of 3.4 percent. In addition, the College Board estimates that room and board charges will increase between 4 and 5 percent for next year. What is most frustrating is that despite the recent economic boom, the cost of a college education continues to rise at a rate faster than many families can afford. According to the College Board, since 1980 the price of a college education has been rising between two and three times the Consumer Price Index. In fact, tuition and fees for a four year college education has risen 115 percent over inflation since the 1980-81 school year, while median household income has risen only 20 percent. Over the past decade, tuition has increased between 32 and 49 percent, while family income over the same period has increased just 4 percent.  As a result, more and more families are forced to rely on financial aid to meet tuition costs. In fact, a majority of all college students utilize some amount of financial assistance. The amount of financial aid available to students and their families for the 1999-2000 school year topped $68 billion, more than 4% above than the previous year. However, there has been a marked trend from grant-based assistance programs to loan-based assistance programs, and today many students are forced to borrow in order to attend college. This shift toward loans increases the financial burden of attending college because students and families must then assume interest costs that can add thousands to the total cost of tuition.  We must not forget that compounded interest cuts both ways. For those students who must borrow, compounded interest is a burden, for those students and families who save, it is a blessing. By saving, participants can keep pace, or even ahead of, tuition increases. By borrowing, students bear additional interest costs that add thousands to the total cost of tuition. Savings have a positive impact by reducing the need for students to borrow tens of thousands of dollars in student loans. This will help make need-based grants, which target low-income families, better meet the demands of those who are in most need.  Mr. President, the need for rewarding long-term saving for college is clear. My legislation will recognize and award savings while allowing students and families that are participating in these state-sponsored plans to be exempt from federal income tax when the funds are used for qualified educational purposes. This bill will finish what I started in 1994.  Mr. President, as a result of our actions over the last several years, a majority of the states have implemented tuition savings plans for their residents. In the mid-1980s, states first began to recognize the difficulty that families faced in keeping pace with the rising cost of education. States like Kentucky, Florida, Ohio, and Michigan were among the first to start programs aimed at helping families save for their children's college education. Other states have since followed suit, and currently 48 states have some form of tuition savings plans.  Today, there are nearly one million savers who have contributed over $2 billion in education savings. In the Commonwealth of Kentucky alone, 3,250 beneficiaries have active accounts and have accumulated $13 million in savings. With average monthly contributions as low as $110, and nearly 60% of the participating families earning a household income of under $60,000 annually, state-sponsored tuition plans clearly benefit middle-class families--the exact Americans who deserve and need such relief.  In addition to accomplishing my long-sought goal of making savings in tuition savings plans entirely tax-free, the SAVE Act, includes several other new provisions. It allows private institutions to establish their own qualified prepaid tuition programs, and at the same time includes important consumer protections to ensure that these new plans operate in a fiscally responsible manner. The SAVE Act also modifies the cap on room and board expenses to more accurately reflect the cost of attending an institution of higher learning. The final important change made in the SAVE Act is a provision allowing for one annual rollover between Section 529 plans to meet the needs of our increasingly mobile society.  I have worked closely with state plan administrators over the years seeking both their advice and support. When I introduce the SAVE Act this afternoon, I will be honored once again to have the endorsement of the National Association of State Treasurers and the College Savings Plans Network (CSPN). I ask unanimous consent that CSPN's letter of support be included in the record. They have worked tirelessly in support of this legislation because they know it is in the best interests of plan participants--families who care about their children's education. In addition, state-sponsored tuition savings plans have recently been touted as one of the best ways to save for a college education by such influential magazines as Money, Fortune, and Business Week.  This overwhelming support for these programs underscores my belief that we have a real opportunity to go even further toward making college affordable for American families. It is in our national interest to maintain a quality and affordable education system for all families--not merely those fortunate to have the resources. My legislation rewards parents who are serious about their children's future and who are committed over the long-term to the education of their children by providing a significant tax break for all savers nationwide. This will reduce the cost of education and will not unnecessarily burden future generations with thousands of dollars in loans.  College is a lifelong investment. We must take steps to ensure that higher education is within the reach of every child so that they are prepared to meet the challenges they will face in our increasingly competitive world. We must make it easier for families to save for college, and we can do so this year by providing total tax freedom for education savings. My bill will make these tuition savings plans entirely tax-free when the money is drawn out to pay for college, and I believe that my legislation is the best approach to ensuring that our children can obtain a higher education without mortgaging their futures.  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to the Senate on this legislation and I look forward to working with the bill's co-sponsors and the Bush Administration to enact it into law.  I ask unanimous consent that the bill and a letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 335       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Re College Savings Plans Network's Support of the SAVE Act     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: Thank you for your continued      support of legislation to encourage college savings through      state-sponsored college savings programs. Your leadership in      helping families plan for their children's college education      is truly commendable; your foresight and knowledge have      enhanced the ability of all families to save. Section 529      programs now represent over 1.4 million families who have      invested more than $8 billion for their children's future      higher education. The College Savings Plans Network      represents all 50 states that are currently operating or      developing Sec. 529 college savings programs.       In our continuing efforts to make a college education more      accessible and affordable for American families, we are very      appreciative of your sponsorship of the ``Setting Aside for a      Valuable Education (SAVE) Act,'' which would provide an      exclusion from gross income for earnings on Sec. 529      accounts, as well as several technical amendments that would      make these college savings programs more user-friendly.       The college Savings Plans Network strongly supports an      exclusion from gross income for earnings on Sec. 529      accounts. This tax treatment would be less burdensome to      administer than current tax provisions, and would result in      better compliance and less cost to college savings programs      and their participants. More importantly, an exclusion from      gross income would provide a powerful additional incentive      for families to save early for college expenses. Section 529      of the Internal Revenue Code already contains restrictions      and penalties to prevent any potential abuse of these      programs.       Please do not hesitate to contact me should you need any      additional information or have any questions. Thank you again      for your continued interest in and support of Sec. 529      programs and the hundreds of thousands of children for whom      college is now an affordable reality.           Sincerely,                                                    George Thomas,         Chair, College Savings Plans Network and New Hampshire            State Treasurer.
