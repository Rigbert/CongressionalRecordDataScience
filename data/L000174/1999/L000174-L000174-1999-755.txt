President, I am pleased to join Senator Grassley and Senator Torricelli in introducing legislation to protect patient privacy when a hospital, nursing home, HMO or other institution holding medical records is involved in a bankruptcy proceeding that leads to liquidation.  Of course, in the best case scenario any institution holding patient health care records would continue to follow applicable state or federal law requiring proper storage and safeguards. The fact is, however, under current law during a business liquidation an individual would have to wait until there has been a serious breach of their privacy rights before anyone stepped in to ensure that patient privacy is protected. Under current law it is questionable what protection these most sensitive personal records would have during a liquidation.  The reality of this situation and the practical questions of what recourse an individual would have if their personal medical records were not properly safeguarded against a business that is going out of business makes this provision essential. Our legislation wouldset in law the procedure that an institution holding medical records would have to follow during a liquidation proceeding.  The bottom line is that we do not want to have to wait until there has been a breach of privacy before steps are taken to protect patient privacy. Once privacy is breached--there is nothing one can really do to give that back to an individual.  I have been working on the overall issue of medical privacy for many years. I look forward to working with Senator Grassley and Senator Torricelli on this issue to make sure that patient privacy rights are protected in bankruptcy.                                 ______                                       By
