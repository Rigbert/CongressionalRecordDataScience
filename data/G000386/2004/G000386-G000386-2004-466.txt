 President, I rise today to pay tribute to SPEC Joshua L. Knowles of Sheffield, IA who courageously gave his life for his country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He is the 10th Iowan to be killed since the start of hostilities in Iraq. My deepest sympathy goes out to his parents, Sandy and Les, and his two sisters, Breanna and Michelle, as they deal with their loss. SPEC Joshua Knowles graduated from Sheffield-Chapin/Meservey-Thornton High School in 1999 where he played football. He enlisted in the Iowa National Guard 1133rd Transportation Company out of Mason City, IA, on February 18, 1999 and served as a motor transport operator. Specialist Knowles was killed on Thursday, February 5, 2004, when the cab of the military cargo truck he was riding in was hit by mortar fire as the convoy passed through Checkpoint 6 at the Baghdad International Airport. He was in the cab with fellow Iowan, SPEC Peter Bieber of Nora Springs, who was also injured in the attack. Specialist Knowles will be honored posthumously for his patriotic service to his country with the Purple Heart as well as the Bronze Star, which is awarded for members of the military who distinguish themselves ``by heroic or meritorious achievement or service while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States''. In a press statement, Specialist Knowles' family recalled a shirt that he had sent them from Iraq. The shirt says, ``U.S. Soldiers Never Die, They Just Take Cover Until the Next Mission'' which they said exemplified his attitude toward military service. We can all be proud of this exceptional Iowan and I know he will be greatly missed by all those who knew him. In giving the ultimate sacrifice for his country, Specialist Knowles showed himself to be a true hero and patriot. I again want to express my sympathy for his family and my gratitude for his courageous service.                          ____________________
