Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, I do not think a 19.4 percent increase is justified at a time when the United Nations has instructed its people to withhold information from the Volcker Commission.  I do not think it is justified; and I would say to the chairman, if there was unanimous consent from him and the ranking member, and if there is no objection and it would be appropriate, I would be delighted to amend this amendment to say that this $20 million would be withheld on condition of full cooperation by other countries and by the United Nations.
