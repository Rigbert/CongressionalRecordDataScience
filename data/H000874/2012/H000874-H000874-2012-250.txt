We, of course, want to make in order an amendment which will guarantee that Medicare will be available to our seniors and that we will not decimate Medicaid, which we think is appropriate for our seniors. We also want to make sure that we have revenues that can sustain health care for seniors, education for kids, help for our communities.  Will the gentleman be able to tell me whether or not, in fact, alternatives will be made in order by the Rules Committee that would be offered either by the minority ranking member of the committee and/or others as historically has been the case?
