President, if the Senator will yield further for a question, the Senator has stated he realizes Mr. Griffith practiced law illegally, first in one jurisdiction for 3 or 4 years, then in a second jurisdiction for 3 or 4 years, but that he is the President's choice for going on the DC Circuit.  I am sure the Senator is aware that during the last administration, several nominees for that same seat were blocked by pocket filibusters by the Republicans--one was Elana Kagan, who is now the dean of the Harvard Law School. Another was Allen Snyder, a former Supreme Court law clerk to Chief Justice Rehnquist.  I voted against Mr. Griffith because I felt on the second highest court of the land it is not a good example to have a person, whatever his other qualifications might be, who was so cavalier as to practice law illegally in two different jurisdictions.  I ask the Senator, is the Senator aware I did work with the distinguished Chairman of the committee, Senator Specter, to allow the hearing to go forward with Mr. Griffith and to allow a vote to go forward without delay in the committee? While I voted against Mr. Griffith because of the practice of law, primarily, and while, I felt concern that Chief Justice Rehnquist's former law clerk and Dean Kagan were blocked by the Republican pocket filibuster, I ask the leader if he understands that I will certainly have no objection nor do I know of any Democrat who would object to moving forward and having a real debate and the up-or-down vote that was denied to a Democratic President's nominees? Does the Senator understand that not withstanding the fact that I would vote against that nominee, I would support him bringing this nomination forward? I suspect he would get a majority of the votes in the Senate.
