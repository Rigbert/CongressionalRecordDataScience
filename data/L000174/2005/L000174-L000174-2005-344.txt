President, the devastation wrought by the Hurricane Katrina to New Orleans and the gulf coast is not yet fully known. As the fate of thousands of our fellow Americans remains uncertain and the lives of many have been uprooted and the livelihood of many others affected, we must do all we can to assist those still suffering.  During this time of crisis, one thing we can do is ensure that the Federal courts in these afflicted regions continue to function. I worked with Senators Landrieu, Vitter, and Chairman Specter, Chairman Sensenbrenner and Congressman Conyers to respond to a request from the Judicial Conference for additional authority to conduct court business outside the traditional territorial jurisdiction of a court. I thank them for including in this bill important reporting and accountability requirements.  In implementing this legislation, I want to be sure that we work with the court, the Judicial Conference, and the Justice Department--but also with the local bar and others who will be most directly affected by the invocation of the authority this legislation would grant.
