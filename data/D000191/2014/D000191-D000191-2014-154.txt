Speaker, this year, we celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Senior Companion Program. This important program pairs senior volunteers with frail seniors or disabled adults who are homebound. By providing companionship, taking care of routine chores and providing transportation to medical appointments or the grocery store, Senior Companions are often the only reason that frail seniors or disabled citizens are able to remain in their homes. The program helps over 60,000 Americans continue living on their own, which not only benefits the individuals but saves the federal government millions of dollars. Other Senior Companions provide assistance and friendship to seniors who would otherwise be isolated.   I was responsible for bringing the first Senior Companion program to my home state of Oregon back in 1977. After being elected to Congress in 1986, I kept up my commitment to Senior Companion and other Senior Corps programs like RSVP and the Foster Grandparent Program. These programs have improved the quality of life for the citizens of my district and across the country. By mobilizing seniors to volunteer their skills and experience, vital community needs are met at a lower cost and senior volunteers reap the mental and physical benefits of remaining active in their communities.   After 40 years of success, we need to maintain our commitment to our nation's seniors. I have built a bipartisan coalition and led the fight against misguided proposals to defund Senior Corps and dismantle the current structure of the program in this year's budget debates. We must continue to utilize the talents of seniors and work to improve and protect vital Senior Corps programs like the Senior Companion Program.                          ____________________
