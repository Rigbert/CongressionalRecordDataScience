 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9 a.m. on Wednesday, June 7; I further ask that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved, and the Senate resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S.J. Res. 1 and the time until 9:40 be equally divided between the two leaders or their designees; provided further that the time from 9:40 to 9:50 be allocated to the Democratic leader or his designee, and the final 10 minutes be allocated to the majority leader or his designee; further, that the vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed occur at 10 o'clock in the morning. I further ask that following the vote, the Senate stand in recess until 12 noon to accommodate the joint meeting I was referring to earlier.
