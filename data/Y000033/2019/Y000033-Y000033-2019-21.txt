Chair, I insert in the Record a letter from the president of Voice of the Arctic Inupiat, which is in strong opposition to this legislation.                                   Voice of the Arctic Inupiat                                   Point Hope, AK, March 20, 2019.     Congressman Jared Huffman,     Washington, DC.       Representative Huffman, Voice of the Arctic Inupiat (VOICE)      strongly opposes H.R. 1146 amending Public Law 115-97 to      repeal the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) oil and gas      leasing program. Beyond the fact that your bill would repeal      an opportunity that the Inupiat people have fought for      decades to achieve, we are struck by the lack of knowledge      displayed in this legislation, which completely ignores the      existence of the Inupiat people, and especially the people of      Kaktovik. The Native Village of Kaktovik is a federally      recognized tribe and the Kaktovikmiut have occupied the      Coastal Plain for at least 11,000 years.       The Coastal Plain is home to more than just caribou and      none of the Coastal Plain is wilderness. It is not a place      without people; it never has been--it has been continuously      occupied by the Inupiat people and our ancestors for      millennia, and we find it insulting that you fail to      acknowledge this history Currently, the Coastal Plain is the      home of a community of over 200 people. People who live,      hunt, fish, raise their families, and hope for a secure      economic future for their children. People who walk in the      footsteps of their ancestors all over the land that Congress,      without our permission, designated as the 1002 Area of the      Arctic National Wildlife Refuge People that you have      completely disregarded because they generally do not agree      with you. In light of this, Congressman, your concern about      human rights seems a bit pale.       When we, Indigenous peoples, use terms like self-     determination, sovereignty, economic equality, cultural      survival, and traditional lands, they are more than just      buzzwords. These are objectives that have long been denied us      and for which we have had to fight for generations. It is not      for you to ignore those ideas, nor the people fighting for      them, in favor of those who are more aligned with your      political agenda. To us, this issue goes beyond politics to      the very sustainability of our communities, culture, and      economy.       The Arctic Cultural and Coastal Plain Protection Act      undermines the wishes of those of us living closest to ANWR      and negates years of work by local stakeholders toward      ensuring a sustainable economy for the people and communities      of our region. We hope this letter might help you better      understand the realities of life in the Arctic. H.R. 1146      preaches a ``moral responsibility to protect this wilderness      heritage as an enduring resource to bequeath undisturbed to      future generations of Americans'', but fails to acknowledge      the basic needs of future generations of Arctic Inupiat. Our      regional government, the North Slope Borough (NSB), is      responsible for more territory than any other local      government in the nation. The NSB receives over 96% of its      revenue from property taxes levied on industry infrastructure      on the North Slope, which enables them to provide services      that were never accessible before in the Arctic. The Borough      School District provides vocational and academic education      for people of all ages; NSB health clinics provide modern      medical services to residents in even the smallest and most      remote of villages. The Municipal Services Department      operates water, sewage, and electric utilities, plows roads      and runways, and maintains landfills Other NSB departments      provide housing, police and fire protection, search and      rescue, and other critical services to our communities.      Altogether, the NSB is the single largest local employer on      the North Slope, employing over 63% of the workforce. These      benefits of modern American civilization, common in the rest      of the nation, have been built on the foundation of the North      Slope oil industry.       It is hypocritical of you, Congressman, to stifle the      efforts of Kaktovik to secure jobs, a local economy, and      income for their community while your state makes billions of      dollars off the development of its own oil and gas resources.      If you are concerned about the impacts of resource      development, we suggest that you focus on your own state of      California, which despite its green image, produces the      dirtiest crude in America and has some of the largest      refineries on the West Coast, which in addition to refining      much cleaner Alaska North Slope Crude, also imports and      refines oil from foreign countries like Saudi Arabia and      Angola. The message this bill sends is that you prioritize      the leisure whims of your California constituents above the      needs of the Native people of Kaktovik.       H.R. 1146 cites climate change as one of the main drivers      of the bill. In reality, climate change--and the world's      response to it--add additional layers to existing burdens      that we, the Arctic's Indigenous people, are facing. We agree      that climate change has deeply affected our traditional      Inupiat ways of life. We do not agree that the solution to      that problem is to create more wilderness that hinders our      ability to provide for our people and respond to the impacts      that we are facing. It is unfair for you to ask that we, as      Indigenous peoples, carry the burden of climate change and      the burden of mitigation so that you can fly back and forth      to your home district with an easy conscience.       Even with the services our local government provides, many      of the people in the Arctic live in conditions that fall      below acceptable standards of living, despite being citizens      of one of the richest countries in the world. We are      concerned and puzzled, then, by your focus on protecting eco-     tourism and this idea of pristine, unspoiled wilderness--at      the expense of an economy to sustain our children--that rich      elites across America ``cherish.'' While we are certainly      used to this harmful narrative by now, it does not seem in      line with your democratic values. For our part, we do not see      any contradiction between developing our resources and at the      same time protecting our environment and wildlife. These are      not diverging priorities but an integral piece to balance in      the Arctic.       The bill as introduced further ignores the historical and      cultural trauma that is a part of this land and the      Kaktovikmiut who inhabit it. The people of Kaktovik, in      recent memory, have suffered through three forced relocations      at the hands of the American military. Then, in 1980, the      federal government took 23 million acres of land--without      consent, consultation, nor a treaty between parties--and gave      the people of Kaktovik back 92,000 acres of land immediately      surrounding their village. A mere fraction of their      traditional and ancestral lands. The ``deal'' was that this      land was locked up, the Kaktovikmiut were unable to access      Native allotments, cultural sites, and subsistence areas in      the newly expanded Refuge in the summer months. No, they now      live with extreme restrictions on how they can use their own      lands as a result of the changes made by the federal      government in how the land is designated, lands that the      Inupiat people have been stewards over for thousands of      years. Do you consider these human rights violations,      Representative Huffman? We hope, at the very least, that this      does not diminish ``the integrity of the National Wildlife      Refuge System,'' which in itself operates on the mistaken      Western idea that Indigenous peoples are incompetent at      managing their own lands.       The views of the Inupiat who call ANWR home are frequently      ignored, and your bill reinforces the perception that the      wishes of people who live in and around the Coastal Plain are      less important than those who live hundreds and thousands of      miles away. Mr. Huffman, you do not have to tell the Inupiat      people, who have lived on this land for generations, the      importance of our homelands--we see it, we know it, we depend      on it, we are a part of it. We have something very important      in common, that often gets lost in this debate--this false      dichotomy of ``for'' vs. ``against'', republican vs.      democrat, economy vs. environment--we all share a commitment      to protecting this land and we would welcome the opportunity      to work collaboratively with you and the Gwich'in people, to      whom we have extended many invitations for discussion, to      protect this balance between responsible development and      environmental protections that is integral to our way of life      and the long-term sustainability of our culture.       The Inupiat people have existed, and even flourished, in      one of the most severe climates in the world for generations.      We understand the balance needed to sustain our way of life      and our communities; this priority is currently dependent on      successful and safe oil and gas developments. We are      confident that the health of the Porcupine Caribou Herd can      be maintained given our success in maintaining the health of      three other caribou herds that migrate within our region. We      respectfully request that you remove your bill from      consideration and come visit our communities to better      understand the needs of our people and our communities. We      would welcome the opportunity.           Taikuu,     Sayers Tuzroyluk,       President, Voice of the Arctic Inupiat.     Rex A. Rock Sr.,       Chairman.     John Hopson Jr.,       Vice Chairman.
