President, today I am pleased to introduce the Fort Clatsop National Memorial Expansion Act of 2001 with my friends and colleagues, Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon and Senator Patty Murray from Washington.  The Fort Clatsop Memorial marks the spot where Meriwether Lewis, William Clark, and the Corps of Discoveryspent 106 days during the winter of 1805. The bicentennial of their historic journey is fast approaching. It is estimated that over a quarter-million people will visit the memorial during the bicentennial years of 2003 though 2006. Despite this anticipated influx of visitors, the memorial is legally limited to be no larger than 130 acres. This legislation would authorize a boundary expansion of the memorial up to 1500 acres and will therefore help accommodate the increasing number of visitors expected during the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial. The bill also authorizes a study of the national significance of Station Camp, another Lewis and Clark stopping point in 1805, located in Washington State.  Since the 1980s, the United States Park Service in Astoria, OR has been negotiating with Willamette Industries to acquire approximately 928 acres for the expansion of the Ft. Clatsop National Memorial. These acres are integral to the interpretation and enjoyment of the memorial's historic site. The Park Service and Willamette Industries have reached an agreement that will enable the Park Service to acquire this property. However, this legislation is necessary to authorize the expansion of the memorial's boundary before any additional lands can be acquired.  The Park Service has targeted the expansion of the Fort Clatsop Memorial as one of its highest priorities. The Clatsop County Commission supports this legislation, as do the local landowners in and around the memorial. In addition, I have heard from the National Parks and Conservation Association NPCA, the Trust for Public Lands, and the Conservation Fund, all of whom support this effort to expand the Ft. Clatsop Memorial.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this legislation because the protection of this important American historic area will enable us to illustrate the story of Oregon and America's western expansion for all who visit this special place. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 423       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Fort Clatsop National      Memorial Expansion Act of 2001''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds the following:       (1) In 1805, the members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition      built Fort Clatsop at the mouth of the Columbia River near      Astoria, Oregon, where they spent 106 days waiting for the      end of winter and preparing for their journey home. The Fort      Clatsop National Memorial was created by Congress in 1958 for      the purpose of commemorating the culmination, and the winter      encampment, of the Lewis and Clark Expedition following its      successful crossing of the North American continent, and is      the only National Park Service site solely dedicated to the      Lewis and Clark expedition.       (2) The 1995 General Management Plan for the Fort Clatsop      National Memorial, prepared with input from the local      community, calls for the addition of lands to the memorial to      include the trail used by expedition members to travel from      the fort to the Pacific Ocean and to include the shore and      forest lands surrounding the fort and trail to protect their      natural settings.       (3) The area near present day McGowan, Washington where      Lewis and Clark and the Corps of Discovery camped after      reaching the Pacific Ocean, performed detailed surveying, and      conducted the historic ``vote'' to determine where to spend      the winter, is of undisputed national significance.       (4) The National Park Service and State of Washington      should identify the best alternative for adequately and cost      effectively protecting and interpreting the ``Station Camp''      site.       (5) Expansion of the Fort Clatsop National Memorial would      require Federal legislation because the size of the memorial      is currently limited by statute to 130 acres.       (6) Congressional action to allow for the expansion of Fort      Clatsop for both the trail to the Pacific and, possibly, the      Station Camp site would be both timely and appropriate before      the start of the national bicentennial celebration of the      Lewis and Clark Expedition planned to take place during the      years 2004 through 2006.     SEC. 3. ACQUISITION OF LANDS FOR FORT CLATSOP NATIONAL                    MEMORIAL.       The act entitled ``An Act to provide for the establishment      of Fort Clatsop National Memorial in the State of Oregon, and      for other purposes'', approved May 29, 1958 (Chapter 158; 72      Stat. 153), is amended--       (a) by inserting in section 2 ``(a)'' before ``The      Secretary''.       (b) by inserting in section 2 a period, ``.'', following      ``coast'' and by striking the remainder of the section.       (c) by inserting in section 2 the following new      subsections:       ``(b) The Memorial shall also include the lands depicted on      the map entitled `Fort Clatsop Boundary Map', numbered and      dated `405-80016-CCO-June-1996'. The area designated in the      map as a `buffer zone' shall not be developed but shall be      managed as a visual buffer between a commemorative trail that      will run through the property, and contiguous private land      holdings.       ``(c) The total area designated as the Memorial shall      contain no more than 1,500 acres.''       (d) by inserting at the end of section 3 the following:       ``(b) Such lands included within the newly expanded      boundary may be acquired from willing sellers only, with the      exception of corporately owned timberlands.''     SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF STUDY OF STATION CAMP.       The Secretary of the Interior shall conduct a study of the      area known as ``Station Camp'' near McGowan, Washington, to      determine its suitability, feasibility, and national      significance, for inclusion into the National Park System.      The study shall be conducted in accordance with Section 8 of      Public Law 91-383 (16 U.S.C. 1a-5).                                 ______                                       By
