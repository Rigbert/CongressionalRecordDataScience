President, over the last few days, three Republican Senators have publicly stated that theywill vote against the healthcare repeal bill that may come to the Senate this week.  In announcing his opposition, one Republican Senator, John McCain of Arizona, issued the following statement: ``As I have repeatedly stressed, healthcare reform legislation ought to be the product of regular order in the Senate.''  Last night, Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine stated: ``This is simply not the way that we should be approaching an important and complex issue.''  She went on to say: ``The fact that a new version of this bill was released the very week we are supposed to vote compounds the problem.''  This should be the end of the Graham-Cassidy repeal debate. Republican leadership should finally scrap this one-sided effort to literally change the healthcare system for America.  There was a hearing yesterday--the only hearing on the bill we are about to vote on. It was a lengthy hearing, but it, frankly, did not entertain all of the witnesses or any amendment process so that Members could really have input into the bill we are going to face.  The Congressional Budget Office is supposed to tell us what this critical legislation will do for America. It issued a preliminary finding yesterday that millions of Americans would lose their health insurance and that those with preexisting conditions, as well as their families, if they could buy insurance, would find it very, very expensive.  At the end of this week, funding for our Nation's community healthcare centers will run out, as will funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program. Shouldn't we be focused on reauthorizing those programs appropriately in a timely way? Let's allow the HELP Committee, which is the committee of jurisdiction when it comes to healthcare, to do its work. I have faith in two Senators--one Republican and one Democrat--to do the right thing on this. Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a Republican, and Senator Patty Murray of Washington, a Democrat, have proven before that they can take complex issues such as Federal funding for education and find a bipartisan compromise.  What would America say if we announced at the end of next week or even this week that we have a bipartisan compromise to make healthcare stronger in the United States, that it is going to pass the Senate, that we are going to send to it the House, and that we are going to get something done this year in the Senate?  First, most Americans would be amazed and skeptical, as they should be, but if we can prove that we are going to do it, they would applaud us for finally reaching a point at which we do something on a bipartisan basis.  That was the process that was underway until last week. Senator Alexander was given orders by the leadership: Step back. Let's vote on Graham-Cassidy. Don't do anything more on a bipartisan basis.  Well, this is the week for that vote, and I hope it is the week in which that vote ends in the basic defeat of the approach and a return to bipartisan compromise and bipartisan negotiation.  I don't know what it will take for the Republicans in the Senate and the House to end this never-ending crusade against so-called ObamaCare. They have voted 50, 60, 70 times. We know how they feel about it, but the American people have said to them: It is not enough to oppose ObamaCare; give us a better alternative. And that is where they have stumbled each time.  Over the weekend, rather than making improvements to fix what is wrong with their bill, many Republicans doubled down in secret meetings, negotiations, and with incentives that were built into the newest version of the bill.  The latest Graham-Cassidy repeal measure would slash funding to the States, decimate the Medicaid Program, eliminate protections for people with preexisting conditions, and basically throw our entire healthcare system into chaos. A few special changes were made for special States, but the changes that have come to Graham-Cassidy in the closing days have not really changed the fundamental problem with the bill in that it diminishes Medicaid coverage.  Medicaid is the health insurance program about which most people say: Well, that is for the poor people of America. To some extent, that is true, but it has reached far beyond that. Two out of three senior citizens in nursing homes and other institutional settings rely on Medicaid for basic healthcare. If the cutbacks in Medicaid take place that Graham-Cassidy calls for, what will these seniors do? What will you do for Mom, for your grandmother, or for your grandfather when it reaches a point at which they cannot any longer count on Medicaid to help them pay their medical bills? Will American families have to step up with their own savings? Will they have to look for alternative settings to those in which their parents and grandparents are today? That is the stark choice Graham-Cassidy will create for many families across America.  No one has had time to properly review this latest proposal, in large part because it was drafted behind closed doors--no input from experts, no support from the medical community. You would think, after saying it over and over again, that the Republicans would challenge the following statement: There is no medical advocacy group in the United States of America who supports the Graham-Cassidy bill. That is the case in my State. The Illinois Hospital Association, doctors, nurses, surgeons, pediatricians, and community health are all opposed to this bill, every single one of them, as they were to the previous versions. It says something when the bill to change America's healthcare system is opposed by the people who provide healthcare to America. All of them oppose it. It is that bad.  Republican leaders want to force a vote this week. If that is what it takes, then we have to move to that vote, but I wish they would save some time. I wish they would move to this bipartisan negotiation I referred to earlier.  The Congressional Budget Office is a nonpartisan agency that is supposed to measure the impact of legislation so that, before we vote on it, we know if it is good or bad for the Nation and for the people we represent. Here is what it told us last night in a preliminary review, but it has not had time to review this bill in detail.  In a preliminary review, the CBO told us: ``The number of people with comprehensive health insurance . . . would be reduced by millions each year.''  How in the world can we as Senators make a proposal for the United States of America which we know will take health insurance coverage away from millions of Americans--exactly the opposite of what our goal should be?  The CBO went on to write: ``Federal spending on Medicaid would be reduced by about $1 trillion.''  There are some Republicans, fiscal conservatives who say that we have to stop the growth of this program, but none of them--not one of them--can address the fundamental issue: Who will then take care in paying for the delivery of babies to low-income families? Half of the children who are born in my State of Illinois are paid for by Medicaid. Their moms are taken care of by Medicaid until the moment of birth. What will you replace that with if you eliminate Medicaid funding?  What about the disabled who count on Medicaid as their health insurance? If you are blind or face a serious disability, Medicaid is the answer for basic health insurance for you. If you are going to cut $1 trillion out of Medicaid, what will you say to those disabled Americans who want the same peace of mind that we all want in having health insurance?  School districts all over Illinois and all over the Nation receive Medicaid funds to care for special ed students--counselors, transportation, even feeding tubes. If you take the money out of Medicaid, what will we do for those school districts that are trying their best to give kids a fighting chance, even those with serious disabilities? That is the reality.  The CBO went on to write: ``Coverage for people with preexisting conditions would be much more expensive . . . and could become unavailable for many more people.''  This Republican proposal takes us back to that moment in history when health insurance was so expensive and so hard to find--almost impossible for those with preexisting conditions. Why would we ever want to go back to that? There is hardly a family in Americawho does not have someone they love, who is part of the family, who has a preexisting condition.  Let me remind those who do not have that circumstance that you are one accident or one diagnosis away from being part of this class of Americans who wants health insurance even though the health of those Americans has not been perfect.  In sum, this bill does not do what its authors say it will. They like to tell the American public that States will magically be able to cover the same number of people and provide the same level of benefits with billions of dollars less in funding. The Governors--Democrats and Republicans--have stepped up and said: This is ridiculous. We cannot be asked to accept the burden of health insurance for generations to come, while the Federal Government continues to cut the money that is necessary to provide that protection.  The CBO rejected the claims that are the basis for this Republican bill. Since the Republicans refuse to wait for the CBO to complete its full analysis, we have asked outside health experts what they think the impact would be of this legislation which is before us this week.  Here is what they say: Within a few years, this bill would likely rip health insurance away from more than 20 million Americans, including 1 million people in the State of Illinois. In a State of 12\1/2\ million people, which I represent, 1 million people would lose health insurance because of this Republican proposal that is before us this week.  The average 60-year-old person in Illinois would see his health insurance premiums increase by $11,700 a year. Almost by $1,000 a month his health insurance would go up. Why? Because they change a basic formula. In the Affordable Care Act, we see that the disparity in premiums charged between the highest and lowest will be no more than 3 to 1. They change the ratio in their Republican bill to 5 to 1. It means that those over the age of 50 and under 65 are going to see premium increases estimated to be almost $1,000 a month.  By 2026, Illinois would see its healthcare funding slashed by $8 billion. By 2036, this number would soar to $153 billion.  Medicaid, which covers half of all children in Illinois and two out of three seniors in nursing homes, would be decimated. Also, the Medicaid expansion in Illinois, which helps us to combat the opioid epidemic, provide coverage for 650,000 Illinoisans, and bring stability to our hospitals all across the State, would be shut down.  Here is what the Illinois Hospital Association said about this bill:       Illinois cannot absorb additional financial burdens and      would be forced to reduce eligibility, covered services, and      payments to providers. The magnitude of these cuts and      changes to Medicaid is staggering.  Let's also review what this does to people with preexisting conditions. The Republicans say that this is all about giving flexibility to States. We hear that over and over again. It sure sounds nice until you realize that it is a code word for there being massive funding cuts and the elimination of basic health protection.  In the name of ``State flexibility,'' this bill would allow insurers to charge those with preexisting conditions sky-high premiums the moment they get sick.  Under this bill, ``State flexibility'' means reimposing annual and lifetime limits on patients, including infants who are born with serious medical problems.  Under TrumpCare, ``State flexibility'' means charging Americans over the age of 50 up to five times more than younger people. That is exactly why the American Association of Retired Persons, the AARP, has steadfastly opposed these Republican changes.  To my Republican friends, ``State flexibility'' means tossing out essential health benefits, which is the guarantee that your insurance will cover the basic services your family may need--prescription drugs, maternity care, mental health and addiction treatment.  I spoke to one of my Republican colleagues the other day and asked: What are you driving at here? Are you saying that we can reduce the cost of health insurance if we give people the option of saying that they will not buy coverage for mental illness and substance abuse treatment?  He said: Yes, that is one thing they can do.  I said: Then what happens next month when you discover that your daughter, a sophomore in high school, is now taking opioids and may move to heroin next? You want to intervene. You want to do it, but now you have to pay out of pocket because you didn't buy the essential coverage of mental illness and substance abuse treatment.  It is a shortsighted game to reduce premiums and give up basic essential benefits, but that is what Republicans propose. That is why this measure is opposed by every major medical provider and patient organization nationwide: AARP, the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, nurses, disability groups, the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association, the American Diabetes Association, and the Alzheimer's Association--the list goes on and on. But guess who also came out in opposition to this bill? Insurance commissioners and Medicaid directors. These are the officials who would actually have to implement these cuts. They agree with the Congressional Budget Office that you can't slash the healthcare budget by 20 to 30 percent and expect that States will have ``flexibility'' to make up the difference. The bipartisan association representing every Medicaid director in the country--every one of them--stated that Medicaid cuts would ``constitute the largest transfer of financial risk from the federal government to the states in our country's history.''  Show me a State that can cover as many people with the same benefits if one-third of the money is taken away. That is what the Republican bill does.  Here is what Governor Sandoval, a Republican Governor in Nevada, said:       Flexibility with reduced funding is a false choice. . . . I      will not pit seniors, children, families, the mentally ill,      hospitals, care providers, or any other Nevadan against each      other because of cuts to Nevada's health system proposed by      Graham-Cassidy.  This is a Governor speaking in the same clear terms as Governors of both political parties about the impossible dilemma that would be created by this bill.  Enough is enough. The law that we passed, the Affordable Care Act, helped 20 million people get health coverage. People with preexisting conditions were finally protected. Women are no longer discriminated against when it comes to health insurance. Americans get free preventive healthcare, such as cancer screenings. Is it a perfect law? Not by any means, but at 3 percent of the individual market, we need to do better, and we can. We need to improve that market.  First, the Trump administration must do its best to help us, not hurt healthcare in America. If they are setting out to sabotage this healthcare system, they can do it, but I hope they will not. The President will not suffer if they do, but a lot of innocent American families will. It will make it harder for people to enroll in insurance groups. It will slash funding for outreach. It will actively discourage insurers to offer health plans to individuals.  Mr. President, I am going to yield the floor to the Democratic leader.  In closing, I ask unanimous consent that the September 22, 2017, article in the New Yorker by Dr. Atul Gawande be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the New Yorker, Sept. 22, 2017]If the U.S. Adopts the G.O.P.'s Health-Care Bill, It Would Be an Act of                               Mass Suicide                           (By Atul Gawande)       The fundamental thing to understand about Senate      Republicans' latest attempt to repeal Obamacare is that the      bill under consideration would not just undo the Affordable      Care Act--it would also end Medicaid as we know it and our      federal government's half-century commitment to closing the      country's yawning gaps in health coverage. And it would do so      without putting in place any credible resources or policies      to replace the system it is overturning. If our country      enacts this bill, it would be an act of mass suicide.       In my surgery practice in Boston, I see primarily cancer      patients. When I started out, in 2003, at least one in ten of      my patients was uninsured. Others, who had insurance, would      discover in the course of their treatment that their policies      had annual or lifetime caps that wouldn't cover their costs,      or that     they would face unaffordable premiums going forward because      they now had a pre-existing condition. When he was governor      of Massachusetts, it was Mitt Romney, a conservative, who      brought Republicans and Democrats together to make a viable      state system of near-universal coverage. That system then      served as a model for the A.C.A. The results have been clear:      increases in coverage have markedly improved people's access      to care and their health. For the last four years, health-     care costs in Massachusetts have risen more slowly than the      national average--while the national numbers themselves have      been at historic lows. I have not seen a single uninsured      patient--zero--in a decade. And now comes an utterly reckless      piece of legislation that would destroy these gains.       To review how we got to this point: last spring, the House      passed a health-care-reform bill that proposed to hollow out      the A.C.A.'s funding, insurance mandates, and protections for      people with pre-existing conditions. It was immensely      unpopular with the public. The problem was not just that      twenty-three million Americans would lose their health      insurance if the bill becomes law but also the Republicans'      vision of a health system where insurance with deductibles of      five thousand dollars and more, and little or no primary-care      coverage, would become the norm.       This summer, Senate Republicans failed to secure enough      votes to pass a modified version of the House bill. Later, in      a dramatic late-night session, the Senate also rejected, by a      single vote, a ``skinny'' repeal bill. That bill would have      repealed only the parts of the A.C.A. that required large      businesses to insure their workers and all Americans to carry      coverage. It would have resulted in a mere sixteen million      more uninsured people, according to estimates.       The Republican bill currently being rushed to a vote was      put forward by a group of senators led by Lindsey Graham, of      South Carolina, and Bill Cassidy, of Louisiana. As has become      the apparent rule for Republican health-care bills, there      have been no hearings or committee reviews of the Graham-     Cassidy bill. And, this time, lawmakers and the public do not      even have a Congressional Budget Office analysis of the      effects the bill would have on the budget, insurance costs,      or the uninsured rate.       This is unprecedented: senators are moving ahead with a      vote on a bill that would alter the health care of every      American family and the condition of a sixth of our entire      economy, without waiting to hear any official, independent      estimates of the consequences. The irresponsibility is as      blithe as it is breathtaking. Before becoming a senator,      Cassidy spent twenty-five years working as a physician in      hospitals devoted to the uninsured. I find it baffling that a      person with his experience would not recognize the danger of      this bill. But here we are.       The Graham-Cassidy bill goes even further than the bill      passed by the House. It would bring to a virtually immediate      end not only the individual and employer mandates but also      the whole edifice of the Medicaid expansion, insurance      exchanges, and income-based coverage subsidies set up under      the A.C.A. Graham-Cassidy expects all fifty states to then      pass, and implement, alternative health systems for tens of      millions of people within two years--with drastically less      money, in most states, than the current law provides. This is      not just impossible. It is delusional.       Like the House bill, Graham-Cassidy would cut Medicaid      payments for traditional enrollees--the elderly in nursing      homes, pregnant women in poverty, disabled children, etc.--by      a third by 2026. A portion of the money saved would go into a      short-term fund for states to use for health-care costs. The      rationale is that this would give states ``flexibility'' to      design coverage for their residents as they see fit. But the      amount of funding provided is, by multiple estimates,      hundreds of billions of dollars below what the A.C.A.      provides.       The bill also nakedly shifts funds from Democratic-leaning      states that expanded Medicaid under the A.C.A. to Republican-     leaning states that didn't. Analyses indicate that states      like California, Massachusetts, and New York will receive      block-grant funding anywhere from thirty-five to almost sixty      per cent below the health-care funding their residents would      receive under current law. Much of those missing funds would      be transferred to states like Texas, Mississippi, and      Wisconsin. And special deals to make further shifts from blue      states to red states such as Alaska are being negotiated to      win votes.       As for what states can do with the funds they do receive,      they would not be allowed to use them to enroll people in      Medicaid, or able to establish a single-payer system. And      states would not be receiving enough to continue Obamacare on      their own. The only options for spending are for commercial      coverage. States will be permitted to let insurers bring back      higher costs for people with pre-existing conditions and to      reinstate annual and lifetime limits on coverage. And then,      starting in 2026, the funding turns out to only be temporary.      Under the bill's provisions, unless further action is taken      then, four trillion dollars will be removed from health-care      systems over twenty years.       With these massive sums being flung around, it is easy to      forget that this is about our health as human beings. The      evidence is that health-care programs like the A.C.A. save      lives. The way they do so is by increasing the number of      people who have affordable access to a regular source of care      and needed medications. Such coverage has been shown to      produce a substantial and increasing reduction in mortality--     especially among those with chronic illnesses, such as heart      disease, cancer, or H.I.V.--in as little as five years.       Virtually all of us, as we age, will develop serious health      conditions. A critical test of any health reform, therefore,      is whether it improves or reduces our prospects of having the      continuous care and medicines we need when we come to have a      chronic illness. The Graham-Cassidy bill fails this test. It      will terminate Medicaid coverage and insurance subsidies for      some twenty million people. The entire individual-insurance      market will be thrown into a tailspin. Federal protections      for insurance coverage will be gone.       Every major group representing patients, health-care      professionals, health-care institutions, and insurers has      come out vociferously against this plan. Governors from      Alaska to Ohio to Virginia have opposed the bill. In a highly      unusual, bipartisan statement, the national association      representing the Medicaid directors of all fifty states has      also opposed the bill. The top health official in Louisiana,      Cassidy's home state, has opposed the new plan. There is not      a single metric of health or health care that the Graham-     Cassidy plan makes better. This bill is a national calamity.      It should not even come to a vote.
