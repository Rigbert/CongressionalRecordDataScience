 My reaction is this: I am concerned about two things. I am concerned that the American people have given up on us. I believe they have come to the conclusion that for political reasons we cannot do the obvious; we cannot pass the laws to keep guns out of the hands of kids. I think they are wrong. I hope we can prove them wrong.  Certainly the record of the last few decades suggests that we have been blind to this carnage in our streets, people living in fear of walking down the street in Los Angeles or Chicago, kids living in fear of walking on the playground. There is a school on the west side of Chicago called the Austin Career Academy. When that high school is about to adjourn for the day, let the children go home, the police come and close the streets around the schools so that the gang bangers cannot drive by and shoot the children as they come out of the schools.  That is daily life in too many places in America. We can argue about what we can do and why the people should give up on this Congress. I hope they do not. But we cannot give up on our children, because if we do, we have failed our most fundamental responsibility.  I know this is tough, because some of our colleagues, even on the Democratic side and on the Republican side, have great concerns about the gun lobby and what they might do if they vote for any legislation. It is a tough vote, a hard vote, but I hope they will step back for a second and say we cannot allow this violence and killing to continue in American schools.
