In making these remarks, I wish to emphasize that I am not trying to be presumptuous or disrespectful in any way to the Office of the Presidency or to the President personally. I wish to make that very clear. It is just that I am trying to think of an allegory to try to get my point across, and itseemed to me this might be the way to do it.  We have our national unemployment rate at its highest level all year. We have the debt ceiling rapidly approaching the crisis everybody is talking about, and one would think we could do everything we could to support those industries very critical for job creation and economic development.
