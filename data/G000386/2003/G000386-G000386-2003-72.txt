 That is a very positive political situation.  Last year, we were beginning to develop a bill in the Senate Finance Committee that would have had bipartisan support to get it out of the committee. Bipartisan support in the committee is a way to have a chance of success in the Senate where there can always be an extraordinary minority who can keep a bill from being passed because we protect minority interests in this body as no place else in our political system. So we must be bipartisan.  About the time that was going to happen, the majority leader--the Senator from South Dakota, last year--decided we needed to talk about this in the Senate. But the bill never came out of committee. It was brought right to the floor. When bills are brought to the floor, there is no chance of developing bipartisanship. We discussed it for 2 or 3 weeks and no one could get the bipartisan majority it takes to get pieces of legislation passed.  At that time, I surmised, and I think the outcome of the debate last year proves it, that the other side wanted more of an issue for the election rather than a product.
