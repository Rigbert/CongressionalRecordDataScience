 President, I rise today to celebrate the recent recognition of the redesigned Chevrolet Corvette as Motor Trend magazine's 1998 Car of the Year. By recognizing the 1998 Corvette with one of the automobile industry's most prestigious awards, the editors of Motor Trend bestow a great honor, not only on the car, but more importantly on those men and women who design and build the Corvette in Bowling Green, Kentucky.  Motor Trend--in celebrating the radically-redesigned 1998 Corvette--points to the new, cleaner 5.7 liter/345 horsepower V-8 engine, a lighter, more refined chassis, and an impressive 24.9 cubic feet of cargo space, noting that ``the new Corvette will be remembered as one of the greatest cars in American automotive history.''  The selection of the Corvette further signals the resurgence of great American cars. I am proud that the Corvette has been at the forefront of this revival.  This award is a testament to the tireless efforts of those in Bowling Green who have designed and assembled the Corvette since 1981, when the shiny new plant was born from an old Chrysler Air Temps facility. Since Corvette production moved from St. Louis 18 years ago, the people of Bowling Green have been proud to carry on the tradition of America's original roadster.  Mr. President, by honoring the Corvette, the editors of Motor Trend honor all the hard-working men and womenin my home state of Kentucky who have played a role in all stages of the production of the new, 5th generation Corvette. I offer my congratulations to all those who work for Chevrolet in Bowling Green, whose innovative thinking and diligence has resulted in the Corvette winning this prestigious award.                          ____________________
