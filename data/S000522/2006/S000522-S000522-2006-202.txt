Mr. Speaker, today I am pleased o pay tribute to John Finerty for his 25 years of faithful service to the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Helsinki Commission. John began his work as a member of the professional staff on November 8, 1981, just 6 years after the signing of the Helsinki Final Act, a period marked by ruthless Soviet repression and widespread violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms.  Driven by a passion for upholding the dignity of the downtrodden, John devoted himself to documenting the cases of political prisoners and prisoners of conscience cast into the Soviet gulag or banished because of their beliefs. His career at the Commission began in the aftermath of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, a situation he followed closely. He also focused on the plight of Soviet Jewry, abuse of psychiatry and use of slave labor in the USSR, the persecution of human rights defenders, and repression of religious believers. His determined efforts were undertaken for well-known dissidents and the unknown alike without distinction. The resolution of hundreds of Soviet human rights cases were brought about in no small measure as a result of John's diligence.  The end of the Cold War brought new challenges and opportunities and once again John's talents proved invaluable to me and my fellow Commissioners as freedom began to take root in the former Soviet Union and the subjugation of the Baltic States came to an end. Throughout the turbulent transition, John remained focused on promoting peaceful democratic change while continuing his vigilant defense of human rights. He was part of the first teams to monitor elections in the former USSR. While the conflict in Chechnya has faded from the focus of many, John has not been willing to forget its victims. Similarly, he has helped draw attention to those who have fallen victim to terrorists in places like Beslan.  Mr. Speaker, in this year when we observe the 13th anniversary of the Helsinki Commission, as a long-serving Commissioner and Co-Chairman, I am pleased to recognize and commend John Finerty for his faithful service and tireless defense of human rights and dignity.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E2046]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]  RECOGNIZING JOHN FINERTY'S 25 YEARS OF SERVICE ON THE COMMISSION ON                    SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE                                 ______                                                        HON.
