  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, remember the Social Security lockbox? Republican leadership had us vote on protecting Social Security with a lockbox eight times over 5 years. But now, of course, the lockbox has been ripped opened and plundered, and over the next 10 years it will finance tax cuts for the wealthiest of Americans.  Now there is a new gimmick. Hey, certificates. Certificates suitable for framing on the wall and hanging next to the Enron stock certificate. They will be just as valuable. That is their new gimmick.  Mr. Speaker, why all of the gimmicks? Because they are proposing a privatization plan that will undermine the foundations of Social Security, cut benefits, increase the retirement age; or, phenomenally, increase the debt. They have yet to say how they are going to pay for their risky privatization plans, taking 2 percent, doubling the problem that Social Security has. Instead of Social Security running out of money in 2038 and only being able to pay 73 percent of benefits after that time, they have a plan that will run Social Security out of money in 2024. That is not a great plan.                          ____________________
