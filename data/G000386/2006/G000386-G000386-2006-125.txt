 President, I agree with Senator Allard on his understanding and our intent that the Secretary should make a final determination very quickly after a currently existing Type III supporting organization seeks exemption from the excess business holdings rules. The determination should be made by the Secretary within 6 months after the exemption is sought. The joint committee will have a description of several factors that the Secretary should consider in making decisions to waive. The considered views of the State Attorney General should be a part of that decision. In addition, if the shares of the entity and related persons is not controlling or the individual and related persons are bound to ultimately contribute all but a de minimus share to the charity and have no direct or indirect control of that charity and its investments those are additional factors the Secretary can consider.
