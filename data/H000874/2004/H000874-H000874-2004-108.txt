Speaker, I rise today to honor Sandra Feldman, who has retired as president of the American Federation of teachers.  A union activist for nearly 40 years, Sandy started her career as a teacher, and was elected AFT president in 1997 after serving as president of the United Federation of Teachers in New York City for more than a decade.  Under her tenure, the AFT continued its strong advocacy for educational reforms, but also expanded its efforts into educational research. The AFT released major studies on the teaching of reading, and on how to improve teacher training.  She also personally advocated for more aggressive early childhood efforts, including ``Kindergarten-Plus'' which would allow disadvantages children to start kindergarten in the summer, and keep them in school during the summer before first grade.  In addition to her work on strengthening and reforming public education, Sandy has been a tremendous advocate for the right to collectively bargain, and has worked to strengthen health care and retirement benefits for her members.  Her dedication to her members and their families is legendary. She has left an enduring imprint on the lives of generation of union workers. Her tireless efforts to secure a better quality of life for working people is a testament to her tremendous energy and commitment to others. Her experience, determination and vision will be greatly missed.
