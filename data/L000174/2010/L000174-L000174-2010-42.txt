President, November and December bring with them a contagious holiday spirit. During a time when many Vermonters are struggling to feed their families and heat their homes, community members across Vermont are stepping forward to provide a helping hand to their neighbors. I am proud that Vermont takes to heart our country's great tradition of offering a helping hand to those in need.  While many of us were at home with our families this Thanksgiving, thestaff and volunteers at the Vermont Boys & Girls Clubs of America were busy organizing food donations and cooking meals for the holiday to provide hot meals to those who might not otherwise have had a Thanksgiving dinner at all. In Rutland alone, the Boys & Girls Club cooked enough food to feed 100 people, with many of the ingredients donated by local farms. In Montpelier, the Washington County Youth Service Bureau and Boys & Girls Clubs staff and volunteers prepared turkey dinners to feed homeless Vermonters and financially secure residents alike, producing a real community dinner.  In these tough economic times, community resources are vital to the well-being of all Vermonters. As these resources become scarcer, donations and volunteers become indispensible. Rutland and Montpelier are just a few examples of where Vermonters are volunteering in their communities this holiday season. I am proud to call Vermont home and to count these volunteers among my friends and neighbors. I commend them and all those who donated food for Thanksgiving meals, and I applaud all those who voluntarily step forward throughout the year to take the time to attend to the support and safety of Vermont's children and families.  I ask unanimous consent that press articles detailing the work of the Vermont Boys & Girls Clubs and volunteers be printed in the Record. These articles include ``Boys and Girls Club serves local Thanksgiving dinner'' published by the Rutland Herald on November 24, 2010, and ``Thanksgiving Volunteers deliver--with community spirit--in Montpelier,'' published by the Times Argus on November 26, 2010.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Rutland Herald, Nov. 24, 2010]          Boys and Girls Club Serves Local Thanksgiving Dinner                           (By Lucia Suarez)       The Boys and Girls Club of Rutland County hosted the annual      Thanksgiving dinner as part of its food program, serving      traditional Thanksgiving foods using local ingredients on      Tuesday. Chef Ian Vair, food coordinator for the Boys and      Girls Club, used mostly local ingredients donated through the      Rutland Area Farm and Food Link as part of this year's      Localvore Challenge.       Radical Roots Farm, Boardman Hill Farm in West Rutland, and      Clark Farm in Wells donated all the food, he said.       Vair served roasted turkey, garlic mashed potatoes,      stuffing, kale au gratin (in bechamel cream sauce), butternut      squash casserole and Dutch apple pie to more than 50 hungry      kids and their families. ``We made enough for leftovers,      enough food to feed about 100 people.'' Vair said. ``It's two      days of work.''       Using the local ingredients for the dinner is part of the      club's Localvore Challenge in collaboration with Sustainable      Rutland. The challenge for Thanksgiving is to see how much of      people's holiday dinner is from local ingredients, said Jim      Sabataso, coordinator for Sustainable Rutland. Local is      defined as a 100-mile radius. ``Thanksgiving is so much about      the harvest,'' Sabataso said.       Thirty families have signed up for the Localvore Challenge      in Rutland, Sabataso said. Using local foods is key for Vair,      who tries to incorporate healthy carbohydrates and fresh      vegetables to the meals he prepares at the club every day, he      said. ``I try to have fresh veggies in every meal,'' Vair      said. ``A lot of these kids are used to canned crap and they      try fresh stuff and like it more.''       Vair said the casserole is traditionally made with sweet      potatoes but he used the butternut squash because it was      available locally. Twelve-year-old Chyna Cast thought the      food was great, her favorite being the garlic mashed      potatoes, she said. ``I think it's really good,'' Chyna said.      ``Actually, I think it's amazing.''       The mashed potatoes seemed to be the biggest hit of the      night. ``I can have a mountain of potatoes on my plate for      Thanksgiving,'' said Brooke Nuckles, director of the Center,      an outreach program for 16-to-21-year-old members.       Through the food, Vair teaches the club's youths,      especially those from the ages of 16 to 21, skills about      cooking and the importance of healthy eating, he said. For      the Thanksgiving dinner, kids from the 6-to-15-year-old group      helped chef Vair make the pies and slice the bread for the      stuffing. ``It's great to see the kids, with their aprons on      five nights a week in the kitchen,'' Nuckles said. ``We are      so thankful to the farmers of Vermont and lucky to have      access to all the food.''                                  ____                 [From the Times Argus, Nov. 26, 2010] Thanksgiving Volunteers Deliver--with Community Spirit--in Montpelier                         (By Peter Hirschfeld)       Montpelier--For 364 days a year, the Washington County      Youth Service Bureau/Boys and Girls Club operates programs      that bring stability to the lives of local children and      teenagers. But every Thanksgiving, the organization's 40-     member staff transforms into a full-service catering crew.       Since 1972, the Youth Service Bureau has cooked up one of      the best-attended free dinners in the state on a holiday      devoted to food. On Thursday, in the festively decorated      basement of the Bethany Church in Montpelier, diners enjoyed      a meal made possible by hundreds of hours of volunteer labor.       ``Look at this place--it's absolutely full,'' said      Montpelier City Councilor Jim Sheridan. ``Especially in these      times, there's a need for something where the disabled, the      disadvantaged, the needy, can come together, socialize and      enjoy a good meal. It's just a wonderful thing.''       Karena LaPan, a receptionist at the Youth Service Bureau,      was the organizing force behind this year's meal. More than      200 people ate turkey and all the traditional fixings at      Bethany Thursday afternoon. The Youth Service Bureau      delivered another 290 prepared dinners to residents across      the city. ``It's unbelievable how many people are willing to      donate time, money or food to making this possible,'' LaPan      said ``We all get a lot of enjoyment out of it.''  Volunteers roasted about 35 turkeys this week to get ready for the event. On Wednesday, Youth Service Bureau staff spent the day in the Bethany kitchen over steaming kettles of potatoes, squash and other Thanksgiving standbys. Kreig Pinkham, executive director of the Youth Service Bureau, said the all-inclusive meal draws financially secure residents eager to break bread with neighbors, as well as more vulnerable people who wouldn't be able to afford it otherwise.       ``It's a wonderful mix we get here,'' Pinkham said. ``We      get the homeless population coming in as well as families who      don't want to make a full meal at home. It creates a really      rich environment that's satisfying to be a part of.''       Washington County Senator Bill Doyle had a full turkey leg      with lots of gravy on his plate shortly after noon Thursday.      It was his 12th consecutive Thanksgiving dinner at Bethany      and he said that difficult economic times have made efforts      like these even more important. ``You can see the difficult      times reflected in the number of people here today and the      enthusiasm they have for a meal like this,'' Doyle said. ``It      says something about the community, this church and the      Washington County Youth Service Bureau that this is available      for whoever wants to come enjoy it.''       Sheridan said events like the one Thursday are part of what      make him proud to live in the Capital City.                          ____________________
