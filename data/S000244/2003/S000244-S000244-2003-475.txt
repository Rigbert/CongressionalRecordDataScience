Chairman, I yield myself 90 seconds.  Mr. Chairman, what we just heard seems to indicate that the material we are talking about is ``just an egg.'' I would like to quote from Dr. John Gerhart, who is on the other side of this issue, he comes from Johns Hopkins University, at a press conference that was held yesterday by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Greenwood) and the supporters of his amendment.  Dr. Gerhart said, ``I contend it is an embryo. I don't think anybody is saying that it is just an egg.''  This follows along with what President Clinton's National Bioethics Advisory Commission stated in June of 1997. The executive summary says, ``The Commission begins its discussions fully recognizing that any effort in humans to transfer a somatic cell nucleus into an enucleated egg involves the creation of an embryo, with the apparent potential to be implanted in utero and developed to term.''  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart).
