 President, the bill imposes an excise tax, equal to 100 percent of the acquisition costs, on the taxable acquisition of any interest in an applicable insurance contract. An applicable insurance contract is any life insurance, annuity or endowment contract in which both an applicable exempt organization and any person that is not an applicable exempt organization have, directly or indirectly, held an interest in the contract (whether or not the interests are held at the same time).  An applicable exempt organization generally includes an organization that is exempt from Federal income tax by reason of being described in section 501(c)(3) (including one organized outside the United States), a government or political subdivision of a government, and an Indian tribal government.  The bill provides that an interest in an applicable insurance contract includes any right with respect to the contract, whether as an owner, beneficiary, or otherwise. An indirect interest in a contract includes an interest in an entity that, directly or indirectly, holds an interest in the contract.  Exceptions apply under the bill. An exception is provided if each person (other than the exempt organization) with an interest in the contract has an insurable interest in the insured person independent of any interest of the exempt organization. Another exception is provided if each person, other than an exempt organization, has an interest solely as a named beneficiary. An exception is also provided for a person, other than the exempt organization, with an interest as a trust beneficiary, if the beneficiary designation is purely gratuitous, or with an interest as a trustee who holds in a fiduciary capacity for an applicable exempt organization or another permitted beneficiary.  The bill provides reporting rules requiring an applicable exempt organization or other person that makes a taxable acquisition of an applicable insurance contract to file a return showing required information. A statement is required to be furnished to each person whose taxpayer identification information is required to be reported on the return. Penalties apply for failure to file the return or furnish the statement, including, in the case of intentional disregard of the return filing requirement, a penalty equal to the amount of the excise tax that has not been paid with respect to the items required to be included on the return.  The bill is effective for contracts issued after May 3, 2005. The bill requires reporting of existing life insurance, endowment and annuity contracts issued on or before that date, in which an applicable exempt organization holds an interest and which would be treated as an applicable insurance contract under the bill. This reporting is required within one year after the date of enactment.                                 ______                                       By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. McCain, Mr.         Leahy, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Obama, Ms. Murkowski, and Mr.         Alexander):  S.J. Res. 18. A joint resolution approving the renewal of import restrictions contained in the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003; to the Committee on Finance.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, along with my colleagues from California, Arizona, Vermont, Kansas and Illinois, I come to the floor to introduce legislation to renew sanctions against the illegitimate and repressive State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) in Burma.  I do not intend today to recount the litany of abuses committed by the military junta in Rangoon against the Burmese people and their neighbors given the extensive documentation of these violations by credible sources, including the U.S. Department of State, the United Nations and numerous nongovernmental organizations, my colleagues are undoubtedly familiar with many of the SPDC's heinous crimes--from the production and trafficking of illicit drugs, to the use of rape as a weapon of war against ethnic minority women and girls and the forced conscription of children into military service.  Instead, I urge my colleagues to act quickly--as we have in the past--in considering and passing the renewal of sanctions, which include an import ban on Burmese goods and visa restrictions on officials from the SPDC and affiliated organizations.  We must act quickly as the SPDC poses an immediate danger to the entire region, whether through the trafficking of illicit drugs, the unchecked spread of HIV/AIDS, or the forced movement of people who seek refuge and safety in neighboring countries.  There is no more definitive expression of support for democracy and human rights--for solidarity with those struggling for freedom--than an import ban. As Archbishop Desmond Tutu has eloquently pointed out on several occasions, sanctions worked in South Africa, and they can work in Burma, too.  We must act resolutely as the junta continues to imprison those who nonviolently struggle for freedom and justice, including Nobel laureate and Burmese democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. Burma has a rising prisoner of conscience population, with over 1,300 political prisoners. I renew my call that Suu Kyi and other prisoners of conscience be immediately and unconditionally released.  Just last month, the European Union renewed sanctions against the SPDC that restrict members of the junta and their families from entering the EU, and bans EU companies from doing business in Burma. While I applaud this action, I call upon the EU and other multilateral organizations, including the United Nations, to do more in support of freedom in Burma.  Specifically, the EU, along with the United States, should not participatein any Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) related meetings should the SPDC assume chairmanship of that Association next year. It is worth noting that some ASEAN member states are now publicly discussing the junta's possible leadership with growing concern. This increased attention--and a growing chorus for political reform in Burma in the region by likeminded lawmakers--is also appreciated.  Finally, while I welcome UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan's personal comments in support of freedom in Burma, the time for talk is over. The UN must act on Burma--in New York. It is past time for the UN to discuss and debate the myriad threats Burma poses to the region. What are they waiting for?  The people of Burma must know that they have no better friends in this body than Senators Feinstein, McCain, Leahy, Brownback and Obama. There is an unofficial Burma Caucus in the Senate, and I am proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with my dedicated colleagues on this issue.  To them--and to Suu Kyi and all who nonviolently struggle for freedom in Burma--I say ``we will prevail.''  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint resolution be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                              S.J. Res. 18       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the      United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress      approves the renewal of the import restrictions contained in      section 3(a)(1) of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of      2003.
