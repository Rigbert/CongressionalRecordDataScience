Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his kind words. We will miss you. I even tried to get you to run again.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1674, the Tsunami Warning and Education Act. I want to commend Chairman Boehlert, and even Mr. Inslee from Washington, Mr. Wu, for working on this legislation in an effort to make America's coastal communities safer.  Alaska, my State, is no stranger to the horrible forces of tsunamis. During the past century, four large tsunamis have devastated our coastline. The worst occurred in 1964, when the State was struck by a magnitude 9.4 earthquake. Many of the communities along Prince William Sound and Kodiak Island were completely wiped out. Tsunami waves killed more than 100 people and caused almost $400 million worth of damage, and that is not in today's dollars, but 1964 dollars, to Alaska alone.  The inability to properly warn Alaskans of these deadly tsunamis prompted the creation of a tsunami warningsystem for Alaska and the rest of the Pacific. H.R. 1674 enhances and modernizes this existing tsunami warning system. It also expands the detection and warning system to include other vulnerable areas of the United States.  It is not enough to have warning systems in place, people need to know where to go when a tsunami is going to hit. The mitigation program in this bill helps develop evacuation plans and improves awareness in vulnerable communities.  This bill will help protect Alaskans and other Americans from the same kind of devastation we suffered in 1964. I support this legislation with all my heart.
