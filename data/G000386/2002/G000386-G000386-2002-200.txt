 President, I am pleased to join my colleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin, in introducing legislation to provide grants for the training of realtime reporters and captioners. Many Senators may not be aware of a looming problem related to a shortage of what are called ``realtime writers.'' Realtime writers are essentially trained court reporters, much like the official reporters of debates here in the Senate, who use a combination of additional specialized training and technology to transform words into text as they are spoken. This can allow deaf and hard of hearing individuals to understand live television as well as follow proceedings at a civic function or in a classroom.  In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress mandated that most television programming be fully captioned by 2006 in order to allow the 28 million Americans who are deaf or hard of hearing to have access to the same news and information that many of us take for granted. I know that most of us were glued to the television on and after September 11 in order to absorb every scrap of information we could about the events that took place. In order for those who are deaf and hard of hearing to receive the same information as it is broadcast on live television, groups of captioners must work around the clock transcribing words as they are spoken.  As of this year, 2002, the required number of hours of captioned programming that must be provided by video-programming distributors increased from 450 to 900. In 2004, this will increase to 1350 hours. By 2006, 100 percent of new nonexempt programming must be provided with captions. At the same time, student enrollment in programs that provide essential training in captioning has decreased significantly, with programs closing on many campuses. In order to meet the growing demand for realtime writers caused by this mandate, we must do everything we can to increase the number of individuals receiving this very specialized training.  The legislation that Senator Harkin and I are introducing, along with a number of other senators, will help address the shortage of individuals trained as realtime writers by providing grants to up to 20 court reporting programs to promote the training and placement of individuals as realtime writers. Specifically, court reporting programs could use these grants for items like recruitment of students for realtime writing programs, need-based scholarships, distance learning, education and training, job placement assistance, the encouragement of individuals with disabilities to pursue a career as a realtime writer, and personnel costs.  The expansion of distance learning opportunities in particular will have an enormous impact by making training accessible to individuals who want to become realtime writers but do not live in metropolitan areas. Also, need based scholarships offered using these grant funds would be subject to an agreement with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration to provide realtime writing services for a period of time.  Unless we act now, the shortage of individuals trained as realtime writers will only grow more severe. This would leave the 28 million deaf or hard of hearing Americans without the ability to fully participate in many of the professional, educational, and civic activities that other Americans enjoy. I would therefore urge my fellow Senators to support the swift passage of this legislation.                          ____________________
