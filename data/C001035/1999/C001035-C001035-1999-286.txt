President, I rise today in strong support of S. 1653, which would reauthorize the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. As an original cosponsor of this important legislation, I would like to applaud the excellent work of Senator Chafee and the Foundation to conserve the fish, wildlife, and plant resources of the United States.  The Foundation was created by Congress in 1984 to promote improved conservation and sustainable use of our country's natural resources. Since then, it has awarded over 2,400 grants, using $101 million in federal funds, which it matched with $189 million in nonfederal funds, putting a total of over $290 million on the ground to promote environmental education, protect habitats, prevent species from becoming endangered, restore wetlands, improve riparian areas, and conserve native plants. The hallmark of this outstanding organization is forgoing partnerships between the public and private sectors--involving the government, private citizens, and corporations--to address the root causes of environmental problems. This reauthorization will allow the Foundation to continue its valuable work throughout the country.  Besides being an important link between groups with differing interests in natural resources, the Foundation is an extremely effective tool for stretching scarce federal dollars. The Foundation was created by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Establishment Act, which stipulates that the Foundation must match any federal money appropriated to it on a one-to-one basis. The Foundation does the Act one better. It has an internal policy of matching federal funds at least two-to-one with money from individuals, corporations, state and local governments,foundations, and nongovernmental organizations. Furthermore, all of the federal money appropriated to the Foundation supports on-the-ground conservation--its operating funds come strictly from private donations. The Foundation does not use federal funds for lobbying; nor does it support projects that entail political advocacy or litigation.  In my home state of Maine, the Foundation has invested over $3.4 million in federal funds in 109 projects, generating an additional $6.9 million in matching funds from private, corporate, and other state sources. Most notably, the Foundation has funded projects in Maine to help fishermen cope with the collapse of traditional groundfish fisheries, build a program to preserve Maine's native Atlantic salmon, and protect habitat for breeding Neotropical migratory birds.  Mr. President, I strongly support this bill to reauthorize the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. Year after year, the Foundation consistently performs valuable conservation work, not only in my state, but throughout the country. Its ability to triple the power of federal funding for conservation is unique, making it one of the most effective means we have for preserving our natural resources. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting expeditious passage of this important measure.                          ____________________
