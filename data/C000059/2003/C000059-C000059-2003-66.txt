Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Riverside, California are exceptional. Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Peggy Fouke Wortz is one of these individuals. On Wednesday, May 21, 2003 Peggy will be awarded the ATHENA of the Inland Valleys at a lunch in her honor.  Peggy learned from a very early age the value of community service and volunteerism. She was born in Michigan and is the granddaughter of Mr. R.E. Olds, the inventor and founder of Oldsmobile cars. Throughout her childhood, her grandparents and parents demonstrated the same openhearted generosity that she would embrace in her adult life.  In 1940, Peggy married Mr. Philip B. Fouke and six years later they moved to Riverside, California where they raised three children. After the death of Mr. Fouke, Peggy married Mr. James M. Wortz in 1975 and dedicated herself to her family and community. Her involvement in the community includes service on various boards and committees as well as personal financial donations.  A few of the organizations that Peggy has been active in include: Charter Member, California Baptist University; Board of Governors, California Community Foundation; Past President, The Junior League; Founder/President The Living Desert Reserve; Board of Directors, The Mission Inn Foundation; President, Riverside Community Film; Board of Directors, Riverside Community Hospital Foundation; Founder and Board of Trustees, UCR Foundation; Founder, The Volunteer Center; Board Member, Riverside YMCA; and Founder, The Frank Millen Club.  Peggy's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Riverside, California. Peggy has been the heart and soul of many community organizations and events and I am proud to call her a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for her service and salute her as she receives the ATHENA of the Inland Valleys Award.                          ____________________
