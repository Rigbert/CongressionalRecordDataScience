Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.  Mr. McDERMOTT. So this is one of those issues where you put it on cheap, but you are going to pay for it in the long term.  Now, some of you over there, clearly, don't care. As for the guy in Michigan who made the decision that they use that dirty river water and inflict that on the children of Flint and the lead poisoning and the lead effects on their heads, that is the kind of mentality we are dealing with with the people who run this bill every 2 years from the companies that make this stuff. It came in 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015. Here it is again this year. It will be back. This bill isn't done. They are going to keep trying to convince the American people that you can just spread chemicals everywhere, and it doesn't have effects on people, but it does. That is what environmental health is all about.  That is why this bill is a step backward to about 1950, when we didn't really know what pesticides did to people. Now we do. We are absolutely right in voting against this bill, and the President ought to veto it if it gets through. The Senate, as bad as they are, won't even let this bill through.
