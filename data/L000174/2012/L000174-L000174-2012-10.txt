President, this is a matter I care a great deal about. I am concerned that we are rushing to rubberstamp a House bill that is going to extend the surveillance authorities of the FISA Amendments Act for another 5 years. My amendment would allow the authorities to continue, but it would give a lot better and more timely oversight.  We passed this--and it was not on a last-minute thing--out of the Senate Judiciary Committee in July. We acted quickly so that we would not be acting in this last-minute manner.  This has no operational impact on the intelligence community, but it does ensure the strongest of oversight. I hope Senators will support it.  I yield the floor.
