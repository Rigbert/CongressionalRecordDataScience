                          Amendment No. 1231  This immigration bill is long overdue. Our immigration laws in America have failed us. Since 1986, when President Reagan issued amnesty, we thought for a long time we had laws on the books that would stop the inflow of workers from overseas. We were wrong. Up to 800,000 come into our country each year. Three-fourths of them stay. When you do the math over a 20-year period of time, you realize how we ended up with 12 million undocumented workers in America.  Our immigration system has failed. Let me salute Senators Kennedy, Specter, and all those who worked on trying to rewrite these laws.  You can turn on the television any afternoon or evening and hear the screamers on the cable channels telling you how terrible it is that we are considering this law. Think for a moment. Those people screaming about this effort are endorsing what we currently have--a broken down, failed system that is unfair to the workers of America, unfair to our Nation, and unfair to those who were here working as part of our economy.  What Senators Kennedy and Specter are trying to do is fashion a way through this madness to a law that will work. Are we sure it is going to succeed? Of course not. We cannot be sure. This is just the best of a human effort. But what they have tried to do is build into this concept basic principles. One of those principles that I think should be the bedrock of our discussion is this: Under this bill, we will have hundreds of thousands of new people coming into the United States each year to work. The arguments are made that we need them to pick crops that Americans don't want to pick. I think that is a fact. Also, we need them to fill jobs that many Americans don't want to take. Go to any packinghouse, whether it is a meat or poultry house in America--I know a little bit about that; that is the way I worked my way through college. Those are tough, dirty, hot jobs--and you will find many undocumented workers there because, frankly, people don't absolutely want to work in these places. We need to bring in these workers to fill jobs that Americans are not going to take.  Then there is another level of workers, those who have skills that we need in this country. When Bill Gates of Microsoft says: I need the opportunity to bring in software engineers so Microsoft can expand its production operations in America, and if you don't give me that chance to bring in foreign engineers, I am going to have to put a production facility overseas where I can find the same engineering talents, well, I want those jobs in America. I want those production facilities in America. I am willing to listen to his request for H-1B visas.  Whether we are talking about AgJOBS, jobs in these packing houses or jobs in Silicon Valley, we should have one guiding principle, and the guiding principle is this: Hire Americans first. Hire Americans first.  Under this bill we are considering, the guest workers who come in are subject to that requirement. Someone cannot ask for a guest worker to take a job if there is an American that will take that job first. But there is a glaring loophole. The loophole says: If the Secretary of the Department of Labor announces there is a labor shortage in an area, then they waive the requirement to look for American workers first. But we, in this bill, fail to define what a labor shortage is. What does it mean? It means a lot of employers will be off the hook. They will be able to bring in guest workers and never ask an American to take the job. I don't think that is right.  Senator Grassley and I have introduced this amendment. It eliminates this loophole, eliminates this labor shortage exception, and makes it the hard-and-fast rule when it comes to guest workers that we must hire Americans first. I hope my colleagues will take a look at this and consider it.  Let me say a few words about the H-1B visa. Senator Grassley and I took a look at these H-1B visas. These are special visas with specialty talents to come in because there are not enough Americans with those talents. We took a look at those H-1B visas and, unfortunately, there are some companies that are gaming the system. There have been exposes across America where these so-called H-1B brokerage houses have been created. These are not high-tech companies looking for people with H-1B visas. These are companies, by and large in India, that try to bring in Indian engineers to fill jobs in the United States.  The H-1B visa job lasts for 3 years and can be renewed for 3 years. What happens to those workers after that? Well, they could stay. It is possible. But these new companies out of India have a much better idea for making money. They send the engineers from India to America to fill spots--and get money to do it--and then after the 3 to 6 years, they bring them back to India to work for the companies that are competing with American companies. They call it their outsourcing visa. They are sending their talented engineers to learn how Americans do business and then bring them back and compete with those American companies. Is that what we have in mind here? Is that our goal, to create more opportunities for people to create businesses around the world to compete with us? I think not.  Senator Grassley and I are trying to tighten up the H-1B visa. We wish to make sure that only those who are absolutely necessary are brought in, and, first and foremost, that we fill job vacancies with Americans who are out of work and Americans who are graduating from schools and developing the skills that are needed. Our first responsibility, whether it is in guest workers or H-1B visas, is to hire Americans first.  The amendment the Senate will consider in a short period of time, No. 1231, which Senator Grassley and I have offered, applies to the guest worker program. But it comes down to this basic concept, and I hope my colleagues will support me: Shouldn't this new guest worker program include the same protections for American workers? I think they should. Otherwise, in the future, we are going to see companies advertising that no Americans need apply for these jobs. We don't want that to occur. We wish to make it perfectly clear that companies doing business in the United States must first give priority to American workers; that they are bound by law to do that.  Plain and simple, that is what the Durbin-Grassley amendment will do. This amendment is supported by the labor community, including the AFL-CIO, the Laborers' Union, the Teamsters, and the Building Trades.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the AFL-CIO supporting the amendment be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial            Organizations,                                     Washington, DC, May 24, 2007.     Sen. Richard J. Durbin,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Durbin: On behalf of the AFL-CIO, I write to      offer strong support for your ``Recruit Americans First''      amendment to the Secure Borders, Economic Opportunity, and      Immigration Reform Act (S. 1348). Your amendment would      prevent employers from avoiding compliance with the bill's      domestic worker recruitment requirement.       S. 1348 would require employers to recruit workers from the      domestic workforce before hiring guest workers under the new      Y guest worker program. However, this recruitment requirement      would be waived if the Secretary of Labor determined that      there is a labor shortage in the occupation and geographic      area in which the employer seeks guest workers. The bill does      not specify any standards to be employed in making this      determination, which would be left solely to the discretion      of the Secretary. The Durbin amendment would strike this      waiver so that all employers petitioning for Y guest workers      would be required to recruit workers from the domestic      workforce before hiring Y guest workers.       Thank you for your continued efforts to improve the pending      immigration reform bill.           Sincerely,                                               William Samuel,                                                         Director,                                        Department of Legislation.
