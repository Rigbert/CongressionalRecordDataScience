Speaker, there has been some good news recently for the airline industry. After nearly $13 billion in losses since 1990, the loss of nearly 120,000 jobs and millions of dollars in wage and benefit concessions, the airline industry is expected to earn a profit of more than $1 billion this year.  Much of this improvement is due to the economic recovery under the Clinton administration. However, further congressional action is necessary to sustain this growth and to protect the jobs of airline employees. Growth in air travel has slowed in recent months. U.S. airlines face stiff competition from foreign carriers. In addition, U.S. airlines must spend an estimated $75 billion over the next several years for new equipment--mostly new aircraft and engines--both to comply with Federal noise requirements and to increase their competitiveness.  At the same time, the airline industry faces an additional $500 million in costs due to the expiration of the aviation jet fuel tax exemption. The costs of this tax will undermine the economic recovery of U.S. airlines and jeopardize thousands of jobs in the aviation industry.  As a cosponsor of legislation to make this exemption permanent, I believe this exemption is an investment in the economic vitality of the aviation industry and the jobs of thousands of airline employees and aircraft manufacturers.                          ____________________
