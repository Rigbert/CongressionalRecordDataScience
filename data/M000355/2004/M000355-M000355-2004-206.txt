 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a special and valued educator in my hometown of Louisville, KY, Dr. Beverly Keepers. Dr. Keepers has devoted her time and energy for the past 34 years to the educational growth of the Commonwealth's youth.  Dr. Keepers is a native of Shively, KY where she attended McFerren Elementary and graduated from Western High school. Following high school, she entered Western Kentucky University and earned a Bachelor of Arts Degree in English with minors in theatre arts and education. With her degree in hand, she started her career at Butler High School teaching English, theater, journalism, and photography.  Dr. Keepers' many talents in the classroom were recognized and in 1988 she accepted the assistant principal position at Southern High School. One year later she became the principal at the Youth Performing Arts School, YPAS, in Louisville. While this position was challenging in and of itself, Dr. Keepers was offered a second principalship at Louisville's duPont Manual High School. She accepted the offer and became the first woman in higher administration in Manual's history. In the fall of 1991, she began her dual roles as principal at two different schools, and hit the ground running.  During her years at Manual and YPAS, Dr. Keepers has earned the respect of students and teachers alike. She has made the campuses safer, kept the schools up to date with the latest technologies, strove to make student's voices heard, and worked hard to continue the long standing tradition of excellence at Manual High School and YPAS.  If all this work were not enough, Dr. Keepers was recently a student herself. She went back to school in 2000 and completed her doctorate in educational leadership and organizational development at my alma mater, the University of Louisville, where she was named to the dean's list and was recognized with an Outstanding Student award.  Dr. Keepers' hectic schedule does not end when the school bell rings either. While she has shown tireless dedication by working 70-hour weeks, she remains devoted to her family: husband Jerry, and their two daughters, Tiffany and Lauren.  While most would say her contributions to the Louisville community are more than enough, she is quite active outside of school. She serves as a board member of the Kentucky Derby Festival and Kosair Children's Hospital and has participated in Leadership Louisville and the Bingham Fellows.  Today I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring and recognizing Dr. Beverly Keepers as a truly remarkable member of the Louisville community.                          ____________________
