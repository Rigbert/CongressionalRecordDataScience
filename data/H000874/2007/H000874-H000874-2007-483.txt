I was not pleased myself that we did not give more notice to Members. As you pointed out, we had votes very late in the day.  I take full responsibility because I think we may have been able to get, certainly early Tuesday at the latest, information to Members. We probably should have done that.  As you know, the issue was the veto, when it was going to go down there and when it was going to come back. That was not decided until late.  But I think the gentleman's criticism is a constructive criticism, and I take responsibility. We should have done that, in my opinion. I was not pleased, frankly, with myself or with the notice our office gave because we do want to give Members as accurate information as we possibly can. And, frankly, we want to give them as timely information as we can so they can accomplish what you have said, make their schedules comport with what we are actually doing. To the extent that did not happen this time, I will try to prevent it from happening a second time.
