 Tomorrow (November 2), William Donald Schaefer, the former Governor and Comptroller of the State of Maryland, former Mayor of Baltimore, and distinguished public servant will celebrate his 86th birthday. I urge all of my colleagues to join with me in saluting Governor Schaefer on this momentous occasion.  Throughout his 86 years--nearly 50 of which were spent in public office--William Donald Schaefer has been driven by a burning desire to improve the lives of his fellow citizens. I am confident that this was instilled in him at a young age by his parents, William and Tululu.  Following his service in the U.S. Army during World War II, Schaefer returned to his beloved Baltimore and embarked on what was to become one of the most successful political careers Maryland has ever witnessed.  In 1955, Governor Schaefer first entered public office when he was elected to the Baltimore City Council from the city's 5th District. He served on the council for 16 years, including four years as its president. During his term as President of the City Council, Schaefer was a steadying force during turbulent times, helping direct the National Guard in quelling the riots following the assassination of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  In 1971, Schaefer was elected as Mayor of the City of Baltimore, succeeding Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro III, brother of the current Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi. Schaefer was subsequently re-elected three times, never receiving less than 85 percent of the vote.  Schaefer's dedication to his hometown was unmatched then, as it is now. He served as something of a ``Motivator in Chief,'' reigniting a sense of pride in the city's residents. His philosophy was simple--``Do It Now''--cut through the red tape and provide citizens with the basic services they expect: clean neighborhoods, filled potholes, and plowed streets.  His accomplishments as mayor are many and have had a long and lasting impact on the city. He led the redevelopment of Baltimore's Inner Harbor, including the building of the National Aquarium, helping to transform the Harbor into a city center and establishing Baltimore as a significant tourist destination. He oversaw the construction of the Baltimore City Convention Center and the establishment of a subway system in the city. It is not hard to understand why he was repeatedly named the ``Best Mayor in America.''  In 1986, Schaefer demonstrated a commitment to the entire state when he decided to run to become the 58th Governor of Maryland. He was elected by a landslide and was reelected by a wide margin four years later.  As governor, he worked to improve Maryland's public education system, established the Maryland Department of the Environment, made headway in the efforts to restore the Chesapeake Bay, improve transportation infrastructure, including the establishment of the MTA's Light Rail Line. He also led the push to establish Oriole Park at Camden Yards and laid the groundwork for what became M Bank Stadium, home of the Baltimore Ravens.  When forced by term-limits to retire as governor, newspapers and citizens alike heralded the end of the so-called Schaefer era. But, much to our good fortune, it was not to be. The desire to serve was too strong.  Energetic and as enthusiastic as ever about helping the people of his state, William Donald Schaefer came out of a well deserved retirement in 1998, to be elected as the 32nd Comptroller of the State of Maryland, a position to which he was overwhelmingly reelected in 2002.  Governor Schaefer has now embarked on his second retirement, but we all know that such a man can never truly retire. He cares too much for his fellow Marylanders and continues to serve as an inspiration to all of us for his continued commitment to service.  I think the Baltimore Sun captured it best at the conclusion of his second term as governor. The final paragraph of the paper's editorial reads:  ``Mr. Schaefer is no shrinking violet. His larger-than-life personality can be alternately endearing and enraging. But he cares deeply about people. That's the bottom line for him. Helping people. You couldn't ask for more from a public servant.''  No you couldn't.                          ____________________
