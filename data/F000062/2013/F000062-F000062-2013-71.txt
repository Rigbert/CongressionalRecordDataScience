 President, I have watched these votes and I must say I view them with substantial dismay at the lack of courage in this Chamber--courage to stand and say: We have had enough of these killings. We have had enough of the development of highly militarized weapons--easy to shoot, big clips, 100-plus bullets in each, large velocity guns--falling into the hands of grievous killers, juveniles, people who are mentally disturbed. There will be no background checks, apparently, and we have a proliferation of these weapons.  I have a hard time understanding it. We are here on 6-year terms for a reason: to take votes on difficult issues. Everything needs 60 votes today. This is supposed to be a majority body. We have crafted an assault weapons bill to truly represent the people of America. Every single poll has shown support for this.
