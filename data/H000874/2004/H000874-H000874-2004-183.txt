Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Committee on Rules for his observation. As the gentleman knows, we were disappointed we did not get a substitute to the tax bill that was considered yesterday. With a substitute, we can offer alternatives in a way that we cannot necessarily via amendments.                              {time}  1645  We would appreciate and think it in the best interest of deliberations, whether one agrees or disagrees with the substance, that that process be followed; and we thank the gentleman for his consideration of that.  Mr. Leader, you have not listed, but I believe we do need to act, the transportation bill. You did not list it in your report, but would I be correct in anticipating that we would extend by some additional period of time the authorization or the existing transportation program? I yield to my friend.  Mr. DeLAY. We have a number of extensions that have to be done next week, many we are working on with the other side; and on those, the welfare extension along with the highway extension, the child nutrition act extension, and maybe a couple of others that are really important to do next week. And we hope that in working with the minority that we can come to some sort of agreement on these extensions and put them on the suspension calendar on suspension days.
