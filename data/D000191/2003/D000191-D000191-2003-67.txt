Wolfowitz, to Mr. Cheney, to President Bush, and all the others who formulated this policy, Ms. Rice who has been promoted to Pro-Consul now, that intelligence information which said that, in fact, the Iraqi oil infrastructure was in miserable shape, not capable of producing large amounts of oil, not capable of paying for its own reconstruction, was either not read by all of these esteemed people in this administration, or ignored, or deliberately distorted. Because they told us, the American people, do not worry; they are going to pay for it themselves.  But now they are handed a very big bill, not just to this generation. I talked to a bunch of high school kids in my district yesterday. I said, ``We are giving you the bill.'' There is a joke going around, why do politicians smile at babies? It is because they are being given the bill to rebuild Iraq. They are the next generation.
