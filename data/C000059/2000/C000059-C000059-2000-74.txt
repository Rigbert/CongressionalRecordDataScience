Speaker, I do not have to tell Members of this body that health care inflation is out of control. Our constituents are telling us that every day.  They are feeling the effects of medical costs that increased over 10 percent in 1999 alone. The latest projections are that health care inflation will outpace overall inflation for many years to come. This poses a significant threat to American families, government programs, and employers who are shouldering a growing burden of the U.S. health care costs.  One solution to this problem is to increase the availability of generic drugs. Generic drugs deliver the same health results as brand drugs, but generics cost 70 percent less on average than the brands they replace. The savings are significant.  A new report released by Sanford University in Alabama shows that for every 1 percent increase in generic drug utilization, consumers, taxpayers and employers save over $1 billion in prescription drug costs. It is clear that the greater use of generic drugs must be a part of the plan to cure the Nation's ailing health care system.                          ____________________
