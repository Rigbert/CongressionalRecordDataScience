President, I am very honored to be serving as the chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee.  Today at 11 o'clock we will begin again the discussion on the passage of the defense authorization bill.  As chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee, I have jurisdiction over the readiness of our forces to defend America: Such things as military construction, such things as military pay, such things as training, and the like.  In carrying out my responsibilities, I have visited many, many bases throughout the world and here in the United States. I have had occasion to be recently in Camp Lejeune Marine Corps Base; Fort Hood, TX; Corpus Christi Naval Base; and the Dyess Air Force Base.  My concern is that with all the people we have talked about and talked to in the committee meetings that we have had in the Readiness Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee, we keep getting assurances from the administration that we are in a state of readiness that would meet the minimum expectations of the American people, and yet the information that we get as we go around certainly contradicts that. We have statements made by a number of people who are in the field. When you get past the top brass here in Washington, we find that we have very, very serious problems.  Mr. President, I plan to make several statements concerning this as the development of and discussion on this bill takes place after 11 o'clock, but I would just suggest that we have not found ourselves and put ourselves in a state of readiness that meets the minimum expectations of the American people. The administration has said many times we are in a position to defend America on two regional fronts, and I can assure you that is not the case. In fact, as we watched the Persian Gulf war, I regret to say that we are not in a state of readiness today to be able to defend America against that type of aggression.  With that, I will yield the floor.
