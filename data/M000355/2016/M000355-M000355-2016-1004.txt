 President, I was glad to see Senators in both parties vote to advance the FAA Reauthorization Act yesterday. We will now continue our work to pass this bipartisan legislation that will support American jobs. It will also enhance safety and security measures to help protect travelers in our airports and in the skies. It will look out for consumers' interests by providing more information on things such as seat availability and baggage fees. It will maintain rural access and promote American manufacturing as well. That is what the FAA bill before us will do. Here is what it won't do: It won't raise taxes or fees on airline passengers or enact heavyhanded regulations that could diminish choices or services for travelers.  I appreciate the diligent work of Chairman Thune and Senator Ayotte, the chair of the committee's aviation panel, as well as that of their Democratic counterparts, Senators Nelson and Cantwell.  The FAA Reauthorization Act has been a bipartisan effort from the very start. Let's keep working together in the same spirit today. I urge colleagues to work with the bill managers to process amendments, if they have them.                          ____________________
