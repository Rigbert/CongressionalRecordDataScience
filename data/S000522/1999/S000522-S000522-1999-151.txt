Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 20 seconds.  I respect the previous speaker very much, and when he says every Member deplores what is going on in China, I believe that. The problem is the UNFPA does not deplore it. They have been fronting and whitewashing crimes against women for 20 years and they continue to do so. It speaks volumes of an organization when it says there is no coercion, when every human rights group and every Member of Congress says that there is.
