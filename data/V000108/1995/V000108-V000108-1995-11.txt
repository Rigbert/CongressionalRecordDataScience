Chairman I rise in strong support of the Wilson-Durbin amendment. The EPA should have a clear mandate from Congress in cases where human health is at stake.  Mr. Chairman, I was especially concerned about the refinery air toxins rider that was included in the underlying legislation. I recognize this rider has been stripped out of the bill, but I think it is important for the House to take a clear stand on the issue.  Mr. Chairman, I remain concerned about carcinogens from the petroleum refinery industry. Petroleum refineries are one of the largest sources of cancer-causing emissions, primarily benzene, which causes leukemia.  It may not mean much to some Members, but the people of the 1st District of Indiana must continue to live under a cloud of over 1 million pounds of toxic refinery emissions per year.  In the 1980's the people of northwest Indiana watched as the Clean Air Act took effect; our skies lost the steady red glow of the old steel mills. We continue to make progress, but we have a long way to go. However, my constituents appreciate the progress made under the Clean Air Act, and their lives are better because of it.  Mr. Chairman, we still have a long way to go to make sure that the air is truly safe for our citizens, and I ask my colleagues not to turn the clock back.  Do not leave any doubt about EPA's mandate to protect the people of Indiana's 1st District or the people of this Nation from cancer-causing pollutants. Please support the Wilson-Durbin amendment.
