Chair, I supported the amendment before it was revised. I support the amendment as revised.  This amendment directs the Secretary of Energy to submit to the House and Senate Energy Committees a report on methods to increase electric grid resilience with respect to all threats, including cyber attacks, vandalism, terrorism, and severe weather. Actually, as amended, it requires it submit to the Congress versus the specific committees.  I think it is a fine amendment, and I support it.  I yield back the balance of my time.
