 President, I rise today in recognition of the centenary celebration of Ralph Bunche's birth  Ralph Bunche was an extraordinary man whose success was a definitive accomplishment in the history of America.  His grandmother was born into slavery.  His father was a barber in a shop for whites only.  His mother was a musician.  When his mother and father died his grandmother took him to California where her influence and the perspective she gave him on life and liberty shaped his future and, to some extent, the history of the Nation.  He was a brilliant man, a musician, debater, athlete, a summa cum laude student and valedictorian. A loving husband to Ruth and father of Joan, Jane and Ralph Jr.  He went to Harvard, taught at Howard University and earned his doctorate comparing French rule in Togoland and Dahomey.  And when the civil rights movement came he spoke out loudly and his message was clear: ``Segregation and democracy are incompatible,'' he said. ``Racial prejudice is an unreasoned phenomenon without scientific basis in biology or anthropology.''  But Ralph Bunche did not want to be remembered for his race. He wanted to be remembered for his accomplishments and his competence, for his dedication to service and his commitment to the recognition of the fundamental rights of men and women to live in harmony and peace.  He came from a generation of Americans who believed that it was wrong to recognize a man for the color of his skin, that we should, instead, recognize men and women for the power of their ideas and the contribution they make to the community.  Ralph Bunche did not want to be remembered as the first African American who was the first to graduate from University of California at Los Angeles as valedictorian or the first to graduate from Harvard with a Ph.D. in government and international relations, or the first to become Chief U.N. Mediator.  Least of all, the first to win the Nobel Peace Prize. He wished to be remembered simply as an American who answered his country's call of duty.  That is not a shortcoming . . . It is not a slight to any man or woman of color in our society . . . it is, however, a statement of hope, the hope I grew up with, that we can one day be a society that judges us not for our differences but for our accomplishments and the fact that we, as human beings, made a difference.  Ralph Bunche was one of those human beings who made a difference and left an extraordinary legacy.  By tailoring the language in the 11th and 12th Chapters of the U.N. Charter, Bunche made it possible for the United Nations to recognize the peaceful self-determination of those being exploited by colonialism, and through sheer force of will he recovered from an assassination attempt which killed 4 of his colleagues to negotiate an armistice agreement ending the first Arab-Israeli war.  With an eye for the future he presided over the conference which finalized the statues for the International Atomic Energy Agency.  And in response to an international crisis he established the foundations for the first international peacekeeping operation in Egypt.  This legacy is manifest in his dedication to the United Nations, and to the cause of peace for which we will always remember him.  His words were perhaps prophetic when he said: ``If today we speak of peace, we also speak of the United Nations, for in this era peace and the United Nations, have become inseparable. If the United Nations cannot ensure peace there will be none.  ``If war should come it will be only because the United Nations has failed.  ``But the United Nations need not fail.  ``Surely every man of reason must work and pray to the end that it will not fail.''  Those are not popular words today but they are truthful words, a heartfelt notion from a man whose life and work centered on a way to bring people--all people--together to solve problems.  In concluding his Nobel Lecture, he said: ``There will be no security in our world, no release from agonizing tension, no genuine progress, no enduring peace, until, in Shelley's fine words, reasons voice, loud as the voice of nature, shall have waked the nations.' ''  Today we honor this visionary man of peace as an accomplished scholar, a distinguished diplomat, a tireless campaigner for the civil rights of all people in every nation, and as one of the 20th centuries foremost figures and a role model for every young man and woman, black or white, Christian, Muslim, or Jew.  I ask all my colleagues to join with me in recognizing the life and work of Ralph Bunche by passing this resolution.                          ____________________
