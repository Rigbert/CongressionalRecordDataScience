Chairman, I also believe that this is a very constructive amendment, and I commend the gentleman from Puerto Rico for offering it; and I hope that it is adopted.  Let me say that one of the first things I did when I came to Congress was I helped pass the Missing Children's Act which was in response to the abduction and gruesome murder of Adam Walsh, whose father, John Walsh, has obtained quite a bit of fame in being an advocate for missing and exploited children.  The Code Adam proposal has been very successful when privately implemented in Wal-Mart stores around the country, and I think that having a Code Adam alert system in place nationwide for all public buildings will significantly improve the chance of recovering children who might be abducted in a shopping mall or some other public building. I think the gentleman from Puerto Rico has done the children of this country a great service by offering this amendment, and I hope that it is adopted.
