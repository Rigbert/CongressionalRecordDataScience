 President, paragraph 2 of Senate Rule XXVI requires that not later than March 1 of the first year of each Congress, the rules of each committee be published in the Record.

Such views shall then be included in the Committee      report and printed in the same volume, as a part thereof, and      their inclusion shall be noted on the cover of the report.       4.4. Routine, non-legislative actions required of the      Committee may be taken in accordance with procedures that      have been approved by the Committee pursuant to these      Committee Rules.                          rule 5. nominations       5.1.

Authorized investigations may be conducted      by members of the Committee and/or designated Committee staff      members.                           rule 7. subpoenas       Subpoenas authorized by the Committee for the attendance of      witnesses or the production of memoranda, documents, records      or any other material may be issued by the Chairman, the Vice      Chairman, or any member of the Committee designated by the      Chairman, and may be served by any person designated by the      Chairman, Vice Chairman, or member issuing the subpoenas.      Each subpoena shall have attached thereto a copy of S. Res.      400, 94th Congress, 2d Session and a copy of these rules.         rule 8. procedures related to the taking of testimony       8.1.

Interrogation.--Committee interrogation shall be      conducted by members of the Committee and such Committee      staff as are authorized by the Chairman, Vice Chairman, or      the presiding member.       8.4. Counsel for the Witness.--(a) Any witness may be      accompanied by counsel. A witness who is unable to obtain      counsel may inform the Committee of such fact. If the witness      informs the Committee of this fact at least 24 hours prior to      his or her appearance before the Committee, the Committee      shall then endeavor to obtain voluntary counsel for the      witness. Failure to obtain such counsel will not excuse the      witness from appearing and testifying.       (b) Counsel shall conduct themselves in an ethical and      professional manner. Failure to do so shall, upon a finding      to that effect by a majority of the members present, subject      such counsel to disciplinary action which may include      warning, censure, removal, or a recommendation of contempt      proceedings.       (c) There shall be no direct or cross-examination by      counsel. However, counsel may submit in writing any question      he wishes propounded to his client or to any other witness      and may, at the conclusion of his client's testimony, suggest      the presentation of other evidence or the calling of other      witnesses. The Committee may use such questions and      dispose of such suggestions as it deems appropriate.       8.5 Statements by Witnesses.--A witness may make a      statement, which shall be brief and relevant, at the      beginning and conclusion of his or her testimony. Such      statements shall not exceed a reasonable period of time as      determined by the Chairman, or other presiding members. Any      witness desiring to make a prepared or written statement for      the record of the proceedings shall file a copy with the      Clerk of the Committee, and insofar as practicable and      consistent with the notice given, shall do so at least 72      hours in advance of his or her appearance before the      Committee.       8.6 Objections and Rulings.--Any objection raised by a      witness or counsel shall be ruled upon by the Chairman or      other presiding member, and such ruling shall be the ruling      of the Committee unless a majority of     the Committee present overrules the ruling of the chair.       8.7 Inspection and Correction.--All witnesses testifying      before the Committee shall be given a reasonable opportunity      to inspect, in the office of the Committee, the transcript of      their testimony to determine whether such testimony was      correctly transcribed. The witness may be accompanied by      counsel. Any corrections the witness desires to make in the      transcript shall be submitted in writing to the Committee      within five days from the date when the transcript was made      available to the witness. Corrections shall be limited to      grammar and minor editing, and may not be made to change the      substance of the testimony. Any questions arising with      respect to such corrections shall be decided by the Chairman.      Upon request, those parts of testimony given by a witness in      executive session which are subsequently quoted or made part      of a public record shall be made available to that witness at      his or her expense.       8.8 Requests to Testify.--The Committee will consider      requests to testify on any matter or measure pending before      the Committee. A person who believes that testimony or other      evidence presented at a public hearing, or any comment made      by a Committee member or a member of the Committee staff may      tend to affect adversely his or her reputation, may request      to appear personally before the Committee to testify on his      or her own behalf, or may file a sworn statement of facts      relevant to the testimony, evidence, or comment, or may      submit to the Chairman proposed questions in writing for the      cross-examination of other witnesses. The Committee shall      take such action as it deems appropriate.       8.9 Contempt Procedures.--No recommendation that a person      be cited for contempt of Congress shall be forwarded to the      Senate unless and until the Committee has, upon notice to all      its members, met and considered the alleged contempt,      afforded the person an opportunity to state in writing or in      person why he or she should not be held in contempt, and      agreed by majority vote of the Committee, to forward such      recommendation to the Senate.       8.10. Release of Name of Witness.--Unless authorized by the      Chairman, the name of any witness scheduled to be heard by      the Committee shall not be released prior to, or after, his      or her appearance before the Committee.    rule 9. procedures for handling classified or sensitive material       9.1.

Before entering      the office all persons shall identify themselves.       9.2. Sensitive or classified documents and material shall      be segregated in a secure storage area. They may be examined      only at secure reading facilities. Copying, duplicating, or      removal from the Committee offices of such documents and      other materials is prohibited except as is necessary for use      in, or preparation for, interviews or Committee meetings,      including the taking of testimony, and in conformity with      Section 10.3 hereof. All documents or materials removed from      the Committee offices for such authorized purposes must be      returned to the Committee's secure storage area for overnight      storage.       9.3. Each member of the Committee shall at all times have      access to all papers and other material received from any      source. The Staff Director shall be responsible for the      maintenance, under appropriate security procedures, of a      registry which will number and identify all classified papers      and other classified materials in the possession of the      Committee, and such registry shall be available to any member      of the Committee.       9.4. Whenever the Select Committee on Intelligence makes      classified material available to any other Committee of the      Senate or to any member of the Senate not a member of the      Committee, such material shall be accompanied by a verbal or      written notice to the recipients advising of their      responsibility to protect such material pursuant to section 8      of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress. The Clerk of the      Committee shall ensure that such notice is provided and shall      maintain a written record identifying the particular      information transmitted and the Committee or members of the      Senate receiving such information.       9.5. Access to classified information supplied to the      Committee shall be limited to those Committee staff members      with appropriate security clearance and a need-to-know, as      determined by the Committee, and, under the Committee's      direction, the Staff Director and Minority Staff Director.       9.6. No member of the Committee or of the Committee staff      shall disclose, in whole or in part or by way of summary, to      any person not a member of the Committee or the Committee      staff for any purpose or in connection with any proceeding,      judicial or otherwise, any testimony given before the      committee in executive session including the name of any      witness who appeared or was called to appear before the      Committee in executive session, or the contents of any papers      or materials or other information received by the Committee      except as authorized herein, or otherwise as authorized by      the Committee in accordance with Section 8 of S. Res. 400 of      the 94th Congress and the provisions of these rules, or in      the event of the termination of the Committee, in such a      manner as may be determined by the Senate. For purposes of      this paragraph, members and staff of the Committee may      disclose classified information in the possession of the      Committee only to persons with appropriate security      clearances who have a need to know such information for an      official governmental purpose related to the work of the      Committee. Information discussed in executive sessions of      the Committee and information contained in papers and      materials which are not classified but which are      controlled by the Committee may be disclosed only to      persons outside the Committee who have a need to know such      information for an official governmental purpose related      to the work of the Committee and only if such disclosure      has been authorized by the Chairman and Vice Chairman of      the Committee, or by the Staff Director and Minority Staff      Director, acting on their behalf. Failure to abide by this      provision shall constitute grounds for referral to the      Select Committee on Ethics pursuant to Section 8 of S.      Res. 400.       9.7. Before the Committee makes any decision regarding the      disposition of any testimony, papers, or other materials      presented to it, the Committee members shall have a      reasonable opportunity to examine all pertinent testimony,      papers, and other materials that have been obtained by the      members of the Committee or the Committee staff.       9.8. Attendance of persons outside the Committee at closed      meetings of the Committee shall be kept at a minimum and      shall be limited to persons with appropriate security      clearance and a need-to-know the information under      consideration for the execution of their official duties.      Notes taken at such meetings by any person in attendance      shall be returned to the secure storage area in the      Committee's offices at the conclusion of such meetings, and      may be made available to the department, agency, office,      committee or entity concerned only in accordance with the      security procedures of the Committee.                             Rule 10. Staff       10.1. For purposes of these rules, Committee staff includes      employees of the Committee, consultants to the Committee, or      any other person engaged by contract or otherwise to perform      services for or at the request of the Committee. To the      maximum extent practicable, the Committee shall rely on its      full-time employees to perform all staff functions. No      individual may be retained as staff of the Committee or to      perform services for the Committee unless that individual      holds appropriate security clearances.       10.2. The appointment of Committee staff shall be confirmed      by a majority vote of the Committee. After confirmation, the      Chairman shall certify Committee staff appointments to the      Financial Clerk of the Senate in writing. No Committee staff      shall be given access to any classified information or      regular access to the Committee offices, until such Committee      staff has received an appropriate security clearance as      described in Section 6 of Senate Resolution 400 of the 94th      Congress.       10.3. The Committee staff works for the Committee as a      whole, under the supervision of the Chairman and Vice      Chairman of the Committee. The duties of the Committee staff      shall be performed, and Committee staff personnel affairs and      day-to-day operations, including security and control of      classified documents and material, and shall be administered      under the direct supervision and control of the Staff      Director. The Minority Staff Director and the Minority      Counsel shall be kept fully informed regarding all matters      and shall have access to all material in the files of the      Committee.       10.4. The Committee staff shall assist the minority as      fully as the majority in the expression of minority views,      including assistance in the preparation and filing of      additional, separate and minority views, to the end that all      points of view may be fully considered by the Committee and      the Senate.       10.5. The members of the Committee staff shall not discuss      either the substance or procedure of the work of the      Committee with any person not a member of the Committee or      the Committee staff for any purpose or in connection with any      proceeding, judicial or otherwise, either during their tenure      as a member of the Committee staff at any time thereafter      except as directed by the Committee in accordance with      Section 8 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress and the      provisions of these rules, or in the event of the termination      of the Committee, in such a manner as may be determined by      the Senate.       10.6. No member of the Committee staff shall be employed by      the Committee unless and until such a member of the Committee      staff agrees in writing, as a condition of employment to      abide by the conditions of the nondisclosure agreement      promulgated by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence,      pursuant to Section 6 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress, 2d      Session, and to abide by the Committee's code of conduct.       10.7. No member of the Committee staff shall be employed by      the Committee unless and until such a member of the Committee      staff agrees in writing, as a condition of employment, to      notify the Committee or in the event of the Committee's      termination the Senate of any request for his or her      testimony, either during his tenure as a member of the      Committee staff or at any time thereafter with respect to      information which came into his or her possession by virtue      of his or her position as a member of the Committee staff.      Such information shall not be disclosed in response to such      requests except as directed by the Committee in accordance     with Section 8 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress and the      provisions of these rules, or in the event of the termination      of the Committee, in such manner as may be determined by the      Senate.       10.8. The Committee shall immediately consider action to be      taken in the case of any member of the Committee staff who      fails to conform to any of these Rules. Such disciplinary      action may include, but shall not be limited to, immediate      dismissal from the Committee staff.       10.9.

Further, any illegal use of      controlled substances by a member of the Committee staff,      within the workplace or otherwise, shall result in      reconsideration of the security clearance of any such      staff member and may constitute grounds for termination of      employment with the Committee.       10.11. In accordance with title III of the Civil Rights Act      of 1991 (P.L. 102-166), all personnel actions affecting the      staff of the Committee shall be made free from any      discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national      origin, age, handicap or disability.

Res.      4, 95-1, Feb. 4, 1977.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Sec. 7. The select committee shall formulate and carry out      such rules and procedures as it deems necessary to prevent      the disclosure, without the consent of the person or persons      concerned, of information in the possession of such committee      which unduly infringes upon the privacy or which violates the      constitutional rights of such person or persons. Nothing      herein shall be construed to prevent such committee from      publicly disclosing any such information in any case in      which such committee determines the national interest in      the disclosure of such information clearly outweighs any      infringement on the privacy of any person or persons.       Sec. 8. (a) The select committee may, subject to the      provisions of this section, disclose publicly any information      in the possession of such committee after a determination by      such committee that the public interest would be served by      such disclosure. Whenever committee action is required to      disclose any information under this section, the committee      shall meet to vote on the matter within five days after any      member of the committee requests such a vote. No member of      the select committee shall disclose any information, the      disclosure of which requires a committee vote, prior to a      vote by the committee on the question of the disclosure of      such information or after such vote except in accordance with      this section.       (b)(1) In any case in which the select committee votes to      disclose publicly any information which has been classified      under established security procedures, which has been      submitted to it by the executive branch, and which the      executive branch requests be kept secret, such committee      shall notify the President of such vote.       (2) The select committee may disclose publicly such      information after the expiration of a five-day period      following the day on which notice of such vote is transmitted      to the President, unless, prior to the expiration of such      five-day period, the President, personally in writing,      notifies the committee that he objects to the disclosure of      such information, provides his reasons therefor, and      certifies that the threat to national interest of the United      States posed by such disclosure is of such gravity that it      outweighs any public interest in the disclosure.       (3) If the President, personally in writing, notifies the      select committee of his objections to the disclosure of such      information as provided in paragraph (2), such committee may,      by majority vote, refer the question of the disclosure of      such information to the Senate for consideration. The      committee shall not publicly disclose such information      without leave of the Senate.       (4) Whenever the select committee votes to refer the      question of disclosure of any information to the Senate under      paragraph (3), the chairman shall not later than the first      day on which the Senate is in session following the day on      which the vote occurs, report the matter to the Senate for      its consideration.       (5) One hour after the Senate convenes on the fourth day on      which the Senate is in session following the day on which any      such matter is reported to the Senate, or at such earlier      time as the majority leader and the minority leader of the      Senate jointly agree upon in accordance with paragraph 5 of      rule XVII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the Senate      shall go into closed session and the matter shall be the      pending business. In considering the matter in closed session      the Senate may--       (A) approve the public disclosure of all or any portion of      the information in question, in which case the committee      shall not publicly disclose the information ordered to be      disclosed,       (B) disapprove the public disclosure of all or any portion      of the information in question, in which case the committee      shall not publicly disclose the information ordered not to be      disclosed, or       (C) refer all or any portion of the matter back to the      committee, in which case the committee shall make the final      determination with respect to the public disclosure of the      information in question.     Upon conclusion of the information of such matter in closed      session, which may not extend beyond the close of the ninth      day on which the Senate is in session following the day on      which such matter was reported to the Senate, or the close of      the fifth day following the day agreed upon jointly by the      majority and minority leaders in accordance with paragraph 5      of rule XVII of the Standing Rules of the Senate (whichever      the case may be), the Senate shall immediately vote on the      disposition of such matter in open session, without debate,      and without divulging the information with respect to which      the vote is being taken. The Senate shall vote to dispose of      such matter by one or more of the means specified in clauses      (A),     (B), and (C) of the second sentence of this paragraph. Any      vote of the Senate to disclose any information pursuant to      this paragraph shall be subject to the right of a Member of      the Senate to move for reconsideration of the vote within the      time and pursuant to the procedures specified in rule XIII of      the Standing Rules of the Senate, and the disclosure of such      information shall be made consistent with that right.       (c)(1) No information in the possession of the select      committee relating to the lawful intelligence activities of      any department or agency of the United States which has been      classified under established security procedures and which      the select committee, pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of      this section, has determined should not be disclosed shall be      made available to any person by a Member, officer, or      employee of the Senate except in a closed session of the      Senate or as provided in paragraph (2).       (2) The select committee may, under such regulations as the      committee shall prescribe to protect the confidentiality of      such information, make any information described in paragraph      (1) available to any other committee or any other Member of      the Senate. Whenever the select committee makes such      information available, the committee shall keep a written      record showing, in the case of any particular information,      which the committee or which Members of the Senate received      such information under this subsection, shall disclose such      information except in a closed session of the Senate.       (d) It shall be the duty of the Select Committee on      Standards and Conduct \1\ to investigate any unauthorized      disclosure of intelligence information by a Member, officer      or employee of the Senate in violation of subsection (c) and      to report to the Senate concerning any allegation which it      finds to be substantiated.       (e) Upon the request of any person who is subject to any      such investigation, the Select Committee on Standards and      Conduct \1\ shall release to such individual at the      conclusion of its investigation a summary of its      investigation together with its findings. If, at the      conclusion of its investigation, the Select Committee on      Standards and Conduct \1\ determines that there has been a      significant breach of confidentiality or unauthorized      disclosure by a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate,      it shall report its findings to the Senate and recommend      appropriate action such as censure, removal from committee      membership, or expulsion from the Senate, in the case of a      Member, or removal from office or employment or punishment      for contempt, in the case of an officer or employee.       Sec. 9. The select committee is authorized to permit any      personal representative of the President, designated by the      President to serve as a liaison to such committee, to attend      any closed meeting of such committee.       Sec. 10.

Sec. 11. (a) It is the sense of the Senate that the head of      each department and agency of the United States should keep      the select committee fully and currently informed with      respect to intelligence activities, including any significant      anticipated activities, which are the responsibility of or      engaged in by such department or agency: Provided, That this      does not constitute a condition precedent to the      implementation of any such anticipated intelligence activity.       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that the head of any      department or agency of the United States involved in any      intelligence activities should furnish any information or      document in the possession, custody, or control of the      department or agency, or person paid by such department or      agency, whenever requested by the select committee with      respect to any matter within such committee's jurisdiction.       (c) It is the sense of the Senate that each department and      agency of the United States should report immediately upon      discovery to the select committee any and all intelligence      activities which constitute violations of the constitutional      rights of any person, violations of law, or violations of      Executive orders, presidential directives, or departmental or      agency rules or regulations; each department and agency      should further report to such committee what actions have      been taken or are expected to be taken by the departments or      agencies with respect to such violations.       Sec. 12. Subject to the Standing Rules of the Senate, no      funds shall be appropriated for any fiscal year beginning      after September 30, 1976, with the exception of a continuing      bill or resolution, or amendment thereto, or conference      report thereon, to, or for use of, any department or agency      ofthe United States to carry out any of the following      activities, unless such funds shall have been previously      authorized by a bill or joint resolution passed by the Senate      during the same or preceding fiscal year to carry out such      activity for such fiscal year.
