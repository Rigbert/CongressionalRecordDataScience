Speaker, I wonder if the American taxpayers know that they are now the insurance company for Wall Street and for Wall Street's high-risk investors.  I am very pleased to begin this evening joined by our dear and respected colleague from the great City of Cleveland, Congressman Dennis Kucinich, and would yield the first portion of the hour and such time as he may consume on the very important subject of the mortgage foreclosure crisis and the financial crisis facing our Nation.
