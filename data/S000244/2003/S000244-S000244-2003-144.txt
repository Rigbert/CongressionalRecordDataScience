Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, this bill adds the National Korean War Veterans ArmisticeDay to the list of days upon which the American flag should especially be displayed. Currently, title 4 of the U.S. Code provides that the flag should be displayed on all days, but specifically mentions 10 permanent Federal holidays on which the flag should be displayed. This bill would amend title 4 to include July 27, the National Korean War Armistice Day.  Nearly 1.8 million American soldiers fought bravely in harsh weather and foreign terrain over the course of 3 years to defend democratic South Korea from an offensive invasion launched by communist North Korea when its armed forces crossed the 38th parallel. On July 27, 1953, an armistice was signed and North Korea withdrew to its side allowing South Korea to remain an independent democratic nation. At the war's conclusion, over 103,000 American soldiers had been wounded, and 36,577 were killed.  The 10 permanent Federal holidays that are currently listed in law serve to recognize the people and events that have shaped the character of our Nation. By adding this day to this list, the bill will ensure that those who fought and died so bravely in the Korean War are recognized for their contribution to our Nation. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
