President, on Tuesday, November 11, Americans across the country will gather to honor those who have fought for our freedom and thank them for a debt we can never fully repay.  This year marks the 97th anniversary of the end of World War I. Our victory in that ``war to end all wars'' showed us that we could not ignore the rest of the world. And as President Clinton said, ``while that war proved our strength, it did not prove our wisdom. . . . We turned our backs on the rest of the world. We ignored the signs of danger. Soon we had a Great Depression, and soon that depression led to aggression and then to another world war--one that would claim a half million American lives.''  Whenever freedom is threatened, our brave men and women have answered the call to serve. Today, I would like to highlight our debt to the heroes and survivors of World War II. Earlier this year, we commemorated International Holocaust Remembrance Day and paid tribute to the nearly 6 million Jews murdered by the Nazi regime. This year marks the 70th anniversary that Allied Forces entered concentration camps--like Auschwitz-Birkenau--and liberated thousands of prisoners.  On the eve of this Veterans Day, nine American heroes and Holocaust survivors are being honored in my home State of Illinois. Today, I want to share their remarkable stories. As the memory of the Holocaust passes from those who were there to the generations that weren't we can't forget the importance of remembrance.  GEN Dwight D. Eisenhower, the supreme commander of Allied Forces in Europe, understood this and documented what he saw. After visiting a liberated Nazi camp, he urged Washington to send congressional delegations to witness Nazi crimes firsthand so that in the future there could be no attempt to dismiss these allegations as ``propaganda.''  With the remaining eyewitnesses in their twilight years, the responsibility to ensure that future generations never forget these atrocities falls to us. I want to commend these men and women for their brave actions and quiet courage. Today, we honor their sacrifice by remembering the horrors they witnessed and proclaiming in one unified voice: ``Never again.'' I am privileged to honor them and remember their stories. They are true heroes.  I would like to acknowledge Dr. George Brent, Edith Stern, Margie Oppenheimer, Hannah Messinger, Walter Reed, Joseph Dobryman, Lewis Pazoles, Harry Nichols, and Anthony Gargano. But behind every name is a story. I ask unanimous consent to have their stories printed in the Record.  Our hearts break for these men and women who mourn their families. But while their stories agonize, they also inspire. Their lives are not just stories of survival; they are stories of triumph and grace in the face of unspeakable evil. I want to thank each of them for the courage to share their stories.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                            Dr. George Brent       When George was 14 years old, he and his entire family were      transported by cattle car to Auschwitz-Birkenau with      thousands of other Hungarian Jews. When they arrived at the      camp, those who were still alive were dragged off the cars      and forced into one of two lines. An SS soldier decided      whether they would go left or right. George and his father      were sent one direction--to live; his mother and ten year-old      brother were sent the other direction--to die.       As the Allied Forces advanced, George was sent on a death      march from Auschwitz and then on a coal train to Mauthausen-     Ebensee Concentration Camp in Austria. On May 6, 1945,      General Patton's 3rd Army Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron      liberated the camp. Here's how one of General Patton's tank      commanders described what he saw: ``thousands of skeleton-     like figures who were skin and bones. The living laying side      by side, often times indistinguishable, from the dead.''      George was one of the prisoners that survived. He was moved      to a displaced persons camp and learned how to be a dental      technician. In 1949, George came to America. He learned a new      language and started a new life.       In 1950, he joined the United States Air Force and served      as a dental assistant during the Korean War. Following his      service, he attended dental school at the University of      Illinois--and has practiced dentistry until 2011--when he      retired at the age of 81. Dr. Brent not only survived these      horrors, he thrived. George Brent may not have been born in      America, but he is an American hero.                              Edith Stern       In February 1942, when Edith, 21 years old, and her parents      were deported to the Theresienstadt Ghetto. She met and      married her husband, Otto Rebenwurzel, at Theresienstadt. In      1944, not long after the wedding, Edith and her mother were      sent to Auschwitz where a sign mockingly read, ``Work makes      you free.'' At Auschwitz, Josef Mengele stood before them to      decide their fate. Left meant survival, for a few weeks at      least. Right meant death in the gas chamber. Edith's mother      was sent to her right. She was 55 years old when she died.      Edith was sent to a forced labor camp.       In 1944, while Edith was in the Theresienstadt Ghetto with      her husband, she became pregnant. By early 1945, her      pregnancy began to show and she was transferred to the      Grossschoenau labor camp. Edith was liberated from      Grossschoenau when she was nine months pregnant. Still      dressed in her striped blue prison uniform, she immediately      went into labor. Three days after giving birth, the baby she      named Peter, died.       Edith moved to the United States in 1964 and became an      administrator at the Self Help Home on the South Side of      Chicago. After living through the horrors of war, Edith's      belief in the goodness of mankind was unshakable. She devoted      her life to helping others rebuild their lives. What an      inspiration.                           Margie Oppenheimer       Seventy-seven years ago, Margie awoke to a Nazi soldier      pointing a rifle at her face--she was 14 years old. It was      November 9, 1938, Kristallnacht--the night of broken glass--     when Nazi soldiers coordinated attacks all over Jewish      communities in Germany and Austria. Windows were smashed.      Synagogues burned. Homes and Jewish-owned stores ransacked      and looted. Margie's family apartment and small department      store were destroyed. This night began seven years of terror      for Margie and her family. She was sent to five concentration      camps: Sloka, Riga-Kaiserwald, Bruss-Sophienwalde, Stutthof      and Goddentow. As a prisoner of these camps, she hauled      backbreaking cement bags, was beaten with clubs, broke      concrete, laid bricks, fought hunger . . . fear . . . and     typhus. Through it all, she repeated the words: ``I WILL be      strong. I want to live.''       One day at the Stutthof concentration camp, Margie was      emaciated and unable to work. She was placed into new      barracks and had the Roman numeral II scrawled on her      forearm--it was a death sentence. That night, two of her      friends did the unimaginable. Without saying a word, they      pulled a helpless Margie under an electric fence to another      side of the camp and they scrubbed off the number on her arm.      She was no longer marked for death.       On March 10, 1945, Margie was liberated. She was 21 years      old. In 1953, Margie and her husband came to the United      States. She became a nurse. And just as her friends helped      her at the Stuffhof camp on that fateful night, she devoted      her life to helping those who couldn't help themselves.                            Hannah Messinger       In 1938, Hannah and her family were forced to abandon their      home and business. A few months before her twentieth      birthday, Hannah married Karl Kohorn. In 1941, Carl was      deported to the Theresienstadt Ghetto. Two weeks later, so      was Hannah. Hannah worked as a hairdresser--an occupation in      high demand--because the Germans wouldn't allow women to have      long hair. In 1942, Hannah's parents and sister arrived at      Theresienstadt, but stayed only three days before being      deported to Auschwitz.       Hannah is one of the last living witnesses to the      International Red Cross visit to Theresienstadt on June 23,      1944. The Nazis created an elaborate hoax to show how well      Jews were being treated under the ``benevolent'' Third Reich.      It was lie. More than 33,000 inmates died as a result of      malnutrition, disease, or the sadistic treatment by the Nazis      at Theresienstadt.       On May 8, 1945, Allied Forces liberated the Merzdorf labor      camp--where Hannah was moved to. But when she returned to      Prague she learned that all her family members were murdered.       After the war, Hannah began corresponding with an Aunt in      Budapest--her last surviving relative in Europe. In the      letters, Hannah poured her heart out sharing Holocaust      experiences and losses and recounting the suffering she and      her loved ones endured. When her aunt read the letters out      loud, a friend of the family, Imre, was listening and fell in      love with her writings. Imre began to correspond with Hannah      directly. Through those letters, they fell in love. Hannah      moved to the United States in 1946. Eventually, Imre joined      her. They married the following year and moved to Chicago.      Hannah has created pencil drawings based on her experiences      as a prisoner in several concentration and labor camps from      1941-1945. A number of her pieces can be seen at the United      States Holocaust Museum in 2010 and in the Smithsonian.      Hannah's work allows future generations to better understand      her experience and see it through her own eyes.                              Walter Reed       On Kristallnacht, Walter was jailed by Nazi soldiers for 3      days--he was 14 years old. In 1939, his parents put him on a      Kindertransport (children's transport) to Belgium. This      decision saved his life. Walter lived in a boys home near      Brussels until the Germans invaded in 1940. Walter and more      than 90 other children escaped to southern France, where they      lived in a barn and later in an abandoned chateau--they      became known as the ``Children of La Hille.''       In 1941, Walter was able to leave France for New York. He      became a U.S. citizen in 1943 and returned to Europe in 1944      as a soldier in the United States Army. Walter served in the      95th Infantry Division under General George Patton. His team      was charged with interrogating German prisoners and civilians      near the front lines. Walter first arrived in the United      States as a survivor of the war and he returned as an      American hero.                            Joseph Dobryman       In 1941, Joseph was 18 years old and forced into the      Bialystock Ghetto with his parents and two brothers. The      Ghetto was liquidated in 1943 and everyone was sent to camps.      Jospeph and his brother Henry were separated from the rest of      their family. In 1943, they sent to the Lomza Ghetto and then      to the Danzig, Auschwitz-Birkenau and Bergen Belsen      concentration camps for the rest of the war. Joseph and Henry      were liberated from Bergen Belsen by Allied Forces in 1945.      They were the only members of their family that survived.       In 1949, Joseph married Nettie Goldberg and they made their      way to the United States. They had no family waiting for      them, but Joseph found work as a plumber and went to school      at night to learn English. Joseph and Nettie settled and      raised their family in Skokie, Illinois, where he still lives      today.                             Lewis Pazoles       Lewis was born in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, the son of Greek      immigrants. Immediately after graduating high school, Lewis      was drafted into the U.S. Army. On April 6, 1944, Lewis      joined a medical battalion attached to the 83rd infantry and      shipped out in a convoy to England to prepare for the      Normandy invasion. Corporal Lewis Pazoles and his unit,      followed General Patton's Army to Omaha Beach on June 11,      1944--five days after D-day. His unit proceeded to fight in      the Battle of the Bulge--and moved through the Ardennes,      Rhineland and Central Europe toward Germany.       On April 11, 2045, the 83rd liberated Langenstein--a sub      camp of Buchenwald--where they found about 1,100 malnourished      and emaciated prisoners. The prisoners were forced to work 16      hour days in nearby mines and were shot if they were too weak      to work. Corporal Pazoles' unit reported that the death rate      at the camp was about 500 a month. The 83rd Infantry also      recovered Nazi documents later used by war crime      investigators.       In 1946, Corporal Pazoles was honorably discharged--he was      20 years old. He returned to the United States and became a      partner in his family's grocery store business in Chicago.      Today, Lewis and his wife reside in Palos Hills, Illinois.       Here are some of the honors that Corporal Pazoles received      during his service: The Victory Medal, The European African      Middle Eastern Theater Ribbon with 1 Silver Battle Star, 3      Overseas Service Bars, the Good Conduct Medal, the Purple      Heart, and a Bronze Star. Lewis Pazoles is an American hero.                             Harry Nichols       Harry was born in Alliance, Ohio, and was drafted in the      U.S. Army in 1942. On June 6, 1944, Harry was in the third      wave of U.S. forces who stormed Omaha Beach in Normandy,      France. Known as Operation Neptune, it was the largest      amphibious operation ever attempted. More than 160,000 Allied      troops landed along the 50-mile stretch of heavily fortified      French coastline to fight the Nazis. Afterward, Harry fought      in the battle of St.-Lo and the Battle of the Bulge. He      helped liberate the French cities of Laval, LeMans, Orleans      and Nance. Harry also fought through Luxemburg and Holland,      crossed the Rhine River into Germany and up the Elbe River      before May 7, 1945--V-E Day.       In 1945, while training with his unit to fight in the      invasion of Japan--the Japanese surrendered. Harry returned      home to Ohio and began working in a bakery. In the late      1940s, he made his way to Chicago where he worked as a      waiter, a grocer and florist. Harry Nichols is an American      hero.                            Anthony Gargano       On December 7, 1941, Tony's 22nd birthday, the Japanese      attacked Pearl Harbor. Less than six weeks later, Tony      enlisted in the U.S. Navy and was assigned to one of three      ships masquerading as merchant vessels. In 1942, he and his      shipmates were captured by the Japanese and taken to Hakodate      prison camp on an island just north of mainland Japan. Tony      remained a POW for three years and was set free the day the      Japanese surrendered and abandoned the camp. He returned to      America, married the love of his life--Julia--and worked six      days a week as a maitre'd at Elliot's Pine Log Restaurant.       For nearly 70 years, Tony has kept the details of war and      the horrors of his imprisonment to himself, but has recently      began to share his story. Tony will tell you, he is not a      hero, his brothers lost in battle are the heroes. What an      inspiration.                          ____________________
