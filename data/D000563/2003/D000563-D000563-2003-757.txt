I just want to say, when you turn to the conservatives in Congress and say: Can't we improve the efficiency of our vehicles? No, that's the heavy hand of Government.  Let me tell you, drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the heavy hand of Government in a part of our world we should be protecting. It is saying to oil companies, make a profit so we don't have to ask American families and automobile manufacturers to do the right thing for our future.  I reserve the remainder of my time.
