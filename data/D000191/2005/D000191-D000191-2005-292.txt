Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.  The gentleman would preempt States' rights which is, I do not believe, a position that Congress should be taking, but he said, don't worry, those States require some sort of minimum of insurance and people would be covered. If people would be covered, then why is the potential liability or the actual liability as according to the previous speaker so large to those companies? It must mean that the levels of insurance are pretty inadequate. If they had adequate insurance or if they were required to carry adequate insurance, then this might be a supportable position, but to defer to the States who might have inadequate insurance and then leave potential injured persons hanging out there and preempt the States, I think, is unconscionable for this Congress.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers), the ranking member on the Committee on the Judiciary.
