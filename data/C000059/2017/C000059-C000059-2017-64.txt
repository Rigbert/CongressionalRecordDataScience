Chairman, I was happy to accept the amendment in the last year and will be happy to support it again this year.  With that, I urge its passage.  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, once again, I really think that we need to better utilize, in this Congress, in this institution, our policy committees. They should be the first call for help if there are questions, if there are concerns, if there are adjustments that need to be made, not the appropriations committee, where there has been no hearing on this.  Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
