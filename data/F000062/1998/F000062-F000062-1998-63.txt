 President, my heart goes out to the families of the two officers slain in Friday's brutal shooting. These two men will be forever known for their bravery, courage and heroism in laying down their lives to protect all of us who pass through the halls of the United States Capitol.  The Capitol police officers, Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson, made the ultimate sacrifice that any person can give in laying down their lives so that others would be spared. Their actions demonstrated the highest form of bravery, selflessness, and professionalism.  We must all remember that the price of democracy is indeed, a high one. At times, the openness of our government is sometimes challenged by events like those that took place this past Friday. But even though our democracy sometimes seems fragile when challenged by senseless violence, we must all do our part to ensure that this type of violence never happens again. I am confident we will take those steps as a nation.  I had just landed in Colorado when I learned what had happened in the Capitol building. When my plane arrived, I received an emergency call from my office informing me of the tragic events. In an instant, my mind fell back to November 28th, 1978 when in City Hall in San Francisco the double assassination of Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk took place. I knew the terrible anguish--even anger--that accompanies events like this one.  This event also shows the depth to which America's infatuation with weapons can lead to tragedy. Not only do we now see youngsters shooting other youngsters, but also the unthinkable slayings in what should be one of the safest places in our nation, the United States Capitol. In this very difficult time, I am proud to say that Officers Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson will always be remembered as American heroes.   recognition of sacrifices of jacob j. chestnut and john m. gibson
