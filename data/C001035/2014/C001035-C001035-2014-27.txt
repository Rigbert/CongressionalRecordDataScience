President, I wish to commend Turner Elementary School of Turner, ME, on being named a 2014 National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence. This year, Turner Elementary was one of only 337 schools across the country and the only school from Maine to receive this prestigious recognition of high accomplishment by the U.S. Department of Education.  Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon Schools Award honors schools that are either academically superior in their States or that demonstrate significant gains in student achievement. The schools singled out for this national recognition are models of high educational standards and accountability.  This award recognizes the remarkable progress that Turner Elementary has made over the past several years in closing student achievement gaps. These outstanding improvements can be attributed to the school's emphasis on professional development opportunities for its teachers and to its commitment to educating the whole child. Turner Elementary has strengthened its curriculum initiatives in math, reading, and writing and has also benefited greatly from its talented and dedicated leadership team, which helps students, parents, and educators set and reach their goals.  I am pleased that the U.S. Department of Education has selected Turner Elementary School for this well-deserved honor and congratulate not only the students but also the administrators, teachers, staff, and parents on this outstanding achievement. Together, they are making a difference in the lives of hundreds of students by helping them become energetic learners and engaged citizens.                          ____________________
