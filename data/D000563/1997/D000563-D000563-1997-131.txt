President, this amendment eliminates the Federal subsidy for tobacco. How many times have we faced that question?  Senators, the Federal Government says that tobacco is dangerous. Why do the taxpayers continue to subsidize it? We subsidize it in the form of crop insurance.  Senator Gregg and I are offering this amendment to eliminate once and for all crop insurance for tobacco. Some Senators have said that is unfair. Every crop gets insured. Right? Wrong. Sixty-seven crops are presently ensured. Sixteen hundred are not.  The list goes on and on and on. I am about to drop them.  What is this about? It is about a crop that is perfectly legal and perfectly lethal. Tobacco is the No. 1 preventable cause of death in America today.  Let's get our public health policy and our subsidies straight.  So, to vote against the crop insurance for tobacco, the appropriate vote is ``no'' on the motion to table and ``no'' on more subsidies.
