I know he has a statement to make.  I ask if this is his experience. My experience from Vermont, a State with maybe two-thirds of the people considering themselves Republican, my experience has been in letters I receive constantly, in things that people say to me when I am home on weekends, over and over again, people of all walks of life in my State have said, ``Enough is enough. Don't you people have something important to do in Washington? Why are you spending this time and money?''  I ask my friend from Maryland if that has not been his experience in the State of Maryland?
