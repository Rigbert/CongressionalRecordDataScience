 Mr. Chairman, this amendment requires the Department of Energy to submit a report to Congress on the potential effects that the commercial utilization of carbon capture and sequestration could have on the economy, energy infrastructure, and greenhouse gas emission goals.  I support the amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Veasey).  The amendment was agreed to.                Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. McKinley  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 printed in House Report 114-359.  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:       In subtitle A of title I, add at the end the following new      section:     SEC. 1111. ETHANE STORAGE STUDY.       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Energy and the Secretary      of Commerce, in consultation with other relevant agencies and      stakeholders, shall conduct a study on the feasibility of      establishing an ethane storage and distribution hub in the      United States.       (b) Contents.--The study conducted under subsection (a)      shall include--       (1) an examination of--       (A) potential locations;       (B) economic feasibility;       (C) economic benefits;       (D) geological storage capacity capabilities;       (E) above ground storage capabilities;       (F) infrastructure needs; and       (G) other markets and trading hubs, particularly related to      ethane; and       (2) identification of potential additional benefits to      energy security.       (c) Publication of Results.--Not later than 2 years after      the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretaries of Energy      and Commerce shall publish the results of the study conducted      under subsection (a) on the websites of the Departments of      Energy and Commerce, respectively, and shall submit such      results to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House      of Representatives and the Committees on Energy and Natural      Resources and Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the      Senate.  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 542, the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. McKinley) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West Virginia.  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, I applaud the work of Chairman Upton and his staff in their bringing this crucial energy bill to the floor, and I want to thank them for that.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment, which directs the Department of Energy and the Department of Commerce to conduct a study on the feasibility of establishing one or more ethane storage and distribution hubs in the United States. This study will also examine the potential benefits that an ethane storage hub would have on our Nation's energy security.  The extraction of natural gas from shale gas formations has increased dramatically over the last 15 years, and ethane is the largest component of that shale gas. Most of the ethane production is used in the petrochemical sector in order to make ethylene, a major component used in the feedstock for manufacturing.  Yet, while the ethane supply continues to grow, the lack of infrastructure and storage inhibits its potential for America's manufacturing economy. Establishing ethane storage and distribution hubs could bring about new markets for these stranded liquids and allow America's shale formations to achieve their full potential as critical national energy assets.  A revamped storage and distribution infrastructure will make our economy less vulnerable to potential unanticipated disruptions and will reduce transportation costs.  Furthermore, the results of this study and decentralization of ethane activity could encourage investment in manufacturing and the expansion of the petrochemical industry all across America.  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment for a study.
