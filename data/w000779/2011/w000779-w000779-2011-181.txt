President, last year, I was disappointed to hear that some members of the Oregon National Guard who were demobilizing at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, JBLM, were not given access to all of the medical treatment to which they were entitled. Further, a document surfaced that showed that medical staff at the facility were being taught to believe that National Guard soldiers were not equal to active-duty soldiers and were to not receive the same standard of care.  Several investigations into the incident were conducted by the Army. However each of the reports was classified as a medical quality assurance document, preventing anyone, including myself, from seeing them.  I have been working with Secretary of the Army John McHugh to try to resolve this issue. I also hope to meet with Ms. Jo Ann Rooney--who, has been nominated to be Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, and if confirmed, would be involved in shaping policy regarding the demobilization of National Guard troops--so that we can discuss this issue.  However, until I am satisfied that the Army has conducted a proper investigation of the incidents at JBLM, is working to resolve any problems that exist, and that Ms. Rooney will work to ensure that all servicemembers receive the care and benefits they have earned, I cannot allow Ms. Rooney's nomination to proceed.  Therefore, I will object to any unanimous consent agreement to consider Ms. Rooney's nomination. Thank you for your assistance in this important matter.                          ____________________
