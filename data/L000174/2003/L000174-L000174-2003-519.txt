 Mr. President, it is unfortunate, I believe--and I say this as one who has been here with six different Presidential administrations of both parties--that rather than work with the Senate and Senators from both parties to identify consensus nominees who would get the overwhelming bipartisan support of the Senate for prompt confirmation, the administration seems to insist only on partisanship and strong-arm tactics.  Rather than ideological court packing and political intimidation on which the other side is insistent, I continue to urge the administration to work with us to take the appointment of Federal judges out of politics. If we do that, we can ensure the independence and fairness of the Federal judiciary.  Everybody, whether they are Republican or Democrat, has a stake in having an independent Federal judiciary. None of us want this country--which is rightly praised for having the most independent Federal judiciary in the world--none of us want to see it become a partisan judiciary.  Now, today we are going to be asked to vote on two cloture motions--one on the Estrada nomination and one on the Owen nomination. I think the last time the Senate was called upon to vote on two cloture motions for nominations on the same day was when Republicans were filibustering the nominations of Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon in the year 2000. Three years ago, numerous Republicans voted against cloture on those nominees, even though Judge Paez had been pending for more than 4 years.  I worry that the Republicans spend all this time talking about how we are blocking judges. As a matter of fact, we are not. Out of 125 judicial nominees the Senate has considered, we have confirmed 123 of them. We have held up two. Two out of 125 is not bad. In fact, President Clinton would have loved to have had that kind of a record when he was President, but the Republicans stopped more than 50 of his judges--not merely two as we are asking to be reconsidered. They blocked 50.  Under Republican control, there were not a whole lot of votes on the floor. Basically, they had a routine that if one Republican Senator objected, then the nominee never got a hearing and never got a vote. The Republicans never faced having to debate the nominees on the floor. The nominees were just never given a hearing in committee. They were never given a vote on the floor.  We had several Senators, many serving now, who just refused to return their blue slips. In fact, we had a definite rule by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee at the time that said that if you had a Senator, for example, from the home State who objected, that person would not go forward.  We had this once where the Senator from North Carolina objected to a circuit court judge, so, of course, we never had a hearing or a vote on that nominee. The Senator from Texas objected to several courts of appeals nominees. Distinguished Hispanic nominees were never given a hearing and never given a vote, because, as the chairman said, if both Senators from the State objected, of course, you could not go forward.  I know the Republicans now intend to go forward with at least one judge where both Senators from that State object--apparently it makes a difference who is President. When they blocked 50 or 60, some by a one-person objection, that was considered following the constitutional responsibility of advice and consent. When we ask to hold up two of the most controversial, divisive nominees--2 out of 125 nominations--we are suddenly obstructionists. But 50 or 60 on the other side is ``good government.''  Now, a lot of us have worked hard to repair the damage done during that time, from 1995 through the early part of 2001. But again, I find, unlike the other administrations I have served with here--President Ford, President Carter, President Reagan, former President Bush, President Clinton; all Presidents who would work with Senators of both parties to try to get a consensus on their nominees--this White House shows no interest in that.  There has been little acknowledgment of our efforts. The current administration continues down the strident path of confrontation and court packing rather than working with Senators. Well, court packing and politicizing ofthe Federal judiciary should never be allowed under any President.  One of my heroes is Franklin Roosevelt. When Franklin Roosevelt tried to pack the courts, tried to politicize the appellate courts, the Senate stopped him. And the Senate should always do that--no matter who the President is.  I am not concerned that the President nominates conservative Republicans--and I voted for hundreds of them over the years--but I am not going to vote for somebody who seems to be nominated solely for the purpose of politicizing the Federal bench.  When I was chairman of the committee, we worked hard to hold hearings and confirm nominees, in order to lower the number of vacancies--which had increased because of the refusal of Republicans to allow many nominations to go forward during the Clinton years. We had a very high number of vacancies. After I became chairman, we cut that number of vacancies virtually in half. Now the vacancy rate is down to about 5\1/2\ percent.  Now, people seem to talk about two judges not going forward, two judges for well-paid lifetime jobs. I wish, having gotten the judiciary vacancy rate down to 5\1/2\ percent, we would look at the fact that the Nation's unemployment rate is 6 percent. The number of private-sector jobs lost since the beginning of the Bush administration is 2.7 million. Almost 9 million Americans are now out of work. Unemployment has risen by more than 45 percent.  The Democrats in the Senate have moved forward to confirm 123 of this President's judicial nominees. But the Republican-led Senate seems obsessed with trying to force through the most divisive of this President's controversial, ideologically chosen nominees.  During the Clinton administration, President Clinton's administration added a million people--a million new jobs--every year. We are losing well over a million jobs a year since this administration came in.  I would suggest that if they really want to find some way to fix the unemployment, don't talk about two people getting extremely high-paying lifetime jobs, talk about the 9 million or so out of work.  What bothers me in the Estrada matter, is that the administration and the Republican leadership have shown no willingness to be reasonable to accommodate the Democratic Senators' request for additional information as shared with the Senate by past administrations. We have endured numerous cloture votes as an indication of Republican intransigence in this matter. It is nothing more.  What bothers me, again, is that there has been no effort--no effort made, as there always has been in past administrations--to work through these matters. It just does not happen.  I mention this more in sadness than anything else. But it is almost as though this administration plays by different rules than any other.  I suggest to the administration, they were not given a mandate to politicize our Federal judiciary.  They were not given a mandate for court packing. They were not given a mandate to take the independent Federal judiciary and turn it into a very narrow branch of the narrowest part of the Republican Party. Nobody is given such a mandate. Just as Franklin Roosevelt found when he wanted to pack the courts from the liberal side and the Senate said no, by the same token, President Bush has to be told no now that he wants to pack the courts on the other side. We do not want a political bench. Anyone ought to be able to come into a court and say, it makes no difference whether I am Republican, Democrat, rich, poor, White, Black, Independent, no matter what my background, I will be treated fairly by that judge.  This is the standard I have always held for the judiciary and for each judge--fairness. I voted for hundreds of Republicans. I voted for them in every single State of the Nation. But I am not going to vote for people who seem to be sent there simply to politicize and polarize the Federal courts.  When I was chairman, I moved faster on nominations of President Bush than the Republican Party ever did on nominations of President Clinton. I stopped the anonymous holds. Dozens upon dozens of President Clinton's nominations were held up by a single Republican putting an anonymous hold. I did away with that when I was chairman. We brought people up, we had hearings, and we voted. As I said before, it is, of course, a fact that we have confirmed 123 of the President's nominees.  We hear all of a sudden that this is so unprecedented. Yes, it is unprecedented. We have held up two. They held up 60. Maybe it is unprecedented that we did not do the same thing.  I believe filibusters should be rare. I said on the floor that I was opposed to them but that statement has now been taken out of context by some on the other side of the aisle. If you read the whole quote, you will see that I was referring to a filibuster by anonymous hold, something I did stop when I became chairman. But the administration holds the key to the Estrada nomination. If they want to make it go forward, we could.  Today the Republican leadership is insisting on two more cloture votes on the Estrada and Owen nominations. These will be the sixth vote on a cloture petition on the Estrada nomination and the second on the Owen nomination. The last time the Senate was called upon to vote on two clotures for nominations that I can recall is when Republicans were filibustering the nominations of Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon in 2000. Three years ago today, on March 8, 2000, numerous Republicans voted against cloture on those nominees, respectively, even though Judge Paez' nomination had been pending for more than four years at that point. Those Republican Senators included nine who are still serving today, including majority leader Bill Frist and Senators Allard, Brownback, Bunning, Craig, DeWine, Enzi, Inhofe, and Shelby, as well as Senators Gramm, Helms, Hutchinson, Murkowski, and Smith, who led the filibuster of these two nominees. In fact, after Republicans failed to keep cloture from being invoked, Senator Sessions moved to indefinitely postpone the Paez nominations, and 31 Republicans voted in favor of that motion to stop a vote on Paez's nomination to the Ninth Circuit. Those Republican Senators included 22 who still serve in the Senate, including majority leader Frist as well as Senators Allard, Bond, Brownback, Burns, Cochran, Craig, Crapo, DeWine, Fitzgerald, Grassley, Gregg, Inhofe, Kyl, Lott, McConnell, Nickles, Santorum, Sessions, Shelby, Thomas, and Warner.  Since July 2001, a number of us have worked very hard to repair the damage done during the years 1995 through the early part of 2001. We have made significant progress. Unfortunately our efforts have received little acknowledgment and the current administration continues down the strident path of confrontation and court packing rather than working with Senators of both parties to identify and nominate consensus, mainstream nominees.  While the Nation's unemployment rate rose last month to 6 percent. The vacancy rate on the Federal judiciary has been lowered to 5.45 percent. While the number of private sector jobs lost since the beginning of the Bush administration is 2.7 million, almost 9 million Americans are now out of work, and unemployment has risen by more than 45 percent, Democrats in the Senate have moved forward to confirm 123 of this President's judicial nominees, reduced judicial vacancies to the lowest level in two decades, by almost 60 percent. Yet the Republican-led Senate remains obsessed with seeking to force through the most divisive of this President's controversial, ideologically-chosen nominees.  The President promised to be a uniter not a divider, but he has continued to send us judicial nominees that divide our Nation and, in the case of Miguel Estrada, he has even managed to divide Hispanics across the country. The nomination and confirmation process begins with the President, and I urge him to work with us to find a way forward to unite, instead of divide, the nation on these issues.  Republican talking points will likely focus on the impasse on two of the most extreme of the President's nominations rather than the 123 confirmations and the lowest judicial vacancy rate in 13 years. They will ignore their own recent filibusters against President Clinton's executive and judicial nominees in so doing.  What is unprecedented about the Estrada matter is that the administration and Republican leadership haveshown no willingness to be reasonable and accommodate Democratic Senators' request for information traditionally shared with the Senate by past administrations. That we have endured numerous cloture votes is an indictment of Republican intransigence on this matter, nothing more. What is unprecedented is that there has been no effort on the Republican side to work this matter out, as these matters have always been worked out in the past. What is unprecedented is the Republican insistence to schedule cloture vote after cloture vote without first resolving the underlying problem caused by the administration's inflexibility.  What is unprecedented about the Owen nomination is that it was made at all. Judge Owen had a fair hearing and was given fair and extensive consideration before the Judiciary Committee last year. We proceeded is spite of the fact that the Republican majority had refused to proceed with any of President Clinton's Fifth Circuit nominees during his last four-year term. Never before in our history has a President renominated for the same vacancy someone voted down by the Judiciary Committee, but that is what this President proceeded to do with this divisive and controversial nominee.  Senator Hatch used to say, when President Clinton was nominating moderates to more than 100 vacancies on our Federal courts, that there was no vacancy crisis. He used to say that he considered 67 vacancies to be ``full employment'' on the Federal judiciary. Today we are well short of 100 vacancies and well beyond what he used to term ``full employment'' with 47 vacancies. The committee continues to report nominations to fill additional vacancies, as well.  From 1995 through the summer of 2001, the Republican majority averaged only 38 confirmations a year with only seven to the Courts of Appeals. That explains why Federal judicial vacancies rose from 63 to 110 on the Republican watch and circuit vacancies more than doubled from 16 to 33. Of course, during those years there were no Republican-led hearings calling for prompt action or fair consideration of President Clinton's moderate judicial nominees. To the contrary, Senator Ashcroft held hearings designed to justify the slowdown. Senator Ashcroft and others perfected the practice of using anonymous holds both in committee and on the floor so that judicial nominees were stalled for months and years without consideration. Scores of nominees never received hearings, at least 10 who received hearings never received committee consideration and those who were ultimately considered often were delayed months and years through holds and filibusters.  Beginning in July 2001, Democrats started bringing accountability and openness to the process. In the 17 months of the Democratic Senate majority we held more hearings on more judicial nominees, more committee votes and more Senate votes than before. We were able virtually to double the pace and productivity of the process. We did away with the secrecy of the ``blue slip'' and the anonymous hold. We considered President Bush's nominees fairly, responsibly and in those 17 months confirmed 100 of this President's nominees. We reversed the destructive trends with respect to the numbers of vacancies and length of time that nominees had to wait to be considered. While we could not consider all nominations simultaneously, we considered more, more quickly than in the preceding years. The Democratic majority inherited 110 judicial vacancies including a record 33 to the circuit courts. By December 2002, we were able, through hard work to outpace the 40 additional vacancies that had arisen and reduce the remaining vacancies to 60, including 25 to the circuit courts. We have continued to cooperate and today the remaining vacancies number 47, including 20 on the circuit courts. This is the lowest vacancy number and lowest vacancy rate in 13 years.  This is not to say that our work is done. Last week, with the help and hard work of the Senate leadership we were able to make additional progress. Last Wednesday, majority leader Frist used the word ``progress'' to describe how we have been able to resolve complications caused by the manner in which nominations were forced through the Judiciary Committee early this year. Last Thursday, I thanked the majority leader and the Democratic leader and others for their efforts in this regard and for working with us to bring the nomination of Judge Edward Prado to a vote without further, unnecessary delay.  This Tuesday the Senate debated and voted on the nomination of Deborah Cook to the Sixth Circuit. She is the fourth nominee of President Bush to be confirmed to the Sixth Circuit in less than two years. During the entire second term of President Clinton, the Republican majority would not hold hearings or consider a single one of President Clinton's nominees to the Sixth Circuit--not Judge Helene White, not Kathleen McCree Lewis, not Professor Kent Markus. Nonetheless, while I was chair of the Judiciary Committee we proceeded to consider and confirm two conservative nominees of President Bush to the Sixth Circuit and this year the Senate has proceeded to confirm two more.  The work of the Senate would be more productive if this administration were more interested in filling vacancies with qualified, consensus nominees rather than packing the Federal courts with activist judges. The nominations and confirmation process begins with the President. Far from being someone who has sought consensus and unity on judicial nominees, this President has used judicial nominees as a partisan weapon and sought sharply to tilt the courts ideologically. That is unfortunate. Some of us have urged another course, a course of cooperation and conciliation, but that is not the path this administration has chosen. Yet, in spite of the historically low level of cooperation from the White House, the Senate has already confirmed 123 of President Bush's judicial nominees, including some of the most divisive and controversial sent by any President.  Last week the Senate proceeded to a vote on the nomination of Jeffrey Sutton to the Sixth Circuit. He received the fewest number of favorable votes of any nominee in almost 20 years with 52. He is the third controversial judicial nominee of this President against whom more than 40 negative votes were cast, yet those three nominees were not stalled and not subjected to a filibuster.  In just the last 2 years, 123 of the President's judicial nominees have been confirmed. One hundred of those confirmations came during the 17 months of Democratic leadership of the Senate. No fair-minded observer could term that obstructionism. By contrast, during the 6\1/2\ years during which Republicans controlled the Senate and President Clinton's nominations were being considered, they averaged only 38 confirmations a year. During the last 2 years of the Clinton administration, the Senate confirmed only 73 Federal judges. Combining the 1996 and 1997 sessions, Republicans in the Senate allowed only 53 judges to be confirmed in 2 years, including only 7 new judges to the circuit courts. One entire congressional session, the Republican-led Senate confirmed only 17 judges all year and none at all to the circuit courts. The Senate confirmed 72 judges nominated by President Bush last year alone under Democratic leadership.  By Republican standards, the 123 judges confirmed so far is more than they averaged for President Clinton over 3 years. If the Senate shut down today and did not consider another judicial nominee we would have already exceeded the total needed to best Republican efforts over an entire 3-year period. At the present rate, President Bush would not just exceed the number of judges appointed by prior presidents, he would shatter all appointment records.  This year, in spite of the lack of cooperation by the administration and the overbearing exercise of power by the majority, we have cooperated with committee action on 26 judicial nominees during the first 3 months of this year. We have proceeded in the Senate to vote on the confirmations of 23 judicial nominees this year, including four extremely controversial nominees to the circuit courts, which makes 123 of this President's judges confirmed overall. That compares most favorably to how Republicans treated President Clinton's nominees. In the 1996 session, for example, the Senate did not confirm a single circuit judge all year and confirmed only 17 judges that entire year. In 1999, the third year of thatPresidential term, and in 1997, the Senate did not reach the level we have already attained until October. We are well ahead of the pace in every year in which Republicans were obstructing consideration of President Clinton's nominees.  A good way to see how much faster this chairman is processing nominations for a Republican President is to compare this year's pace to a comparable year in the last Democratic administration. In 1997, when Bill Clinton was President, the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee was just holding its second judicial nominations hearing of the year--compared to the ninth hearing that we held this week and was considering its first two circuit court nominees of the year--rather than its tenth. This chairman has moved five times more quickly for President Bush's circuit court nominees than for President Clinton's, and vacancies in the courts are nearly half of what they were in 1997. Even more noteworthy, by this point in 1999, the third year of the last presidential term, the committee had not held or scheduled a single judicial nominations hearing. In fact, no hearing for a judicial nominee was held until June of that year.  The fact is that when Democrats became the Senate majority in the summer of 2001, we inherited 110 judicial vacancies. Over the next 17 months, despite constant criticism from the administration, the Senate proceeded to confirm 100 of President Bush's nominees, including several who were divisive and controversial, several who had mixed peer review ratings from the ABA and at least one who had been rated not qualified. Despite the additional 40 vacancies that arose, we reduced judicial vacancies to 60, a level below that termed ``full employment'' on the Federal judiciary by Senator Hatch.  During the 17 months I chaired the Judiciary Committee, I worked hard to ensure that women and minorities were considered for the federal bench, and I am proud of that record. Many Hispanics and women nominated by President Clinton were blocked or delayed by the Republican majority, and I did not want to see that repeated.  Fine nominees such as Christine Arguello, Jorge Rangel, Enrique Moreno and Ricardo Morado and dozens of other Clinton nominees were never allowed hearings by Republicans, and others, such as Bonnie Campbell and Anabelle Rodriguez, received hearings but no votes in Committee. Others, including Judge Richard Paez, Judge Hilda Tagle, Judge Sonia Sotomayor, and Judge Rosemary Barkett, and dozens of other Clinton nominees were stalled for no good reason. Many of Clinton's nominees were not confirmed the first Congress they were nominated, including Judge Paez, who waited 1,520 days to be confirmed, as well as Judge Tagle, who waited 943 days to be confirmed. Cloture was also sought to bring the nominations of Judge Paez and Judge Barkett and others to vote, although scores of others were never allowed hearings due to secret Republican holds.  I am proud that did not happen on my watch. I am glad to say that we quickly considered and confirmed nominees such as Christina Armijo to the District Court in New Mexico, Philip Martinez and Randy Crane to the District Courts in Texas, Jose Martinez to the District Court in Florida, Alia Ludlum to the District Court in Texas, and Jose Linares to the District Court in New Jersey. In addition, this year we have pressed for expedited consideration of Judge Prado of Texas to the Fifth Circuit, as well as Judge Otero of California and Judge Altonaga of Florida to the Federal district courts. This week the Committee included Judge Consuelo Callahan of California in a hearing and I expect her nomination to the Ninth Circuit to be confirmed promptly with strong Democratic support, as well.  The Senate has this week reduced the number of Federal judicial vacancies to the lowest level it has been in 13 years. The 110 vacancies I inherited in the summer of 2001, vacancies that rose by 65 percent under Senate Republican control, have been more than cut in half. In the 17 months I chaired the Judiciary Committee we not only kept up with extraordinary attrition in the form of an additional 40 vacancies, but reduced all those vacancies from the 160 there would have been had we done nothing, down to 60 by last December. Senator Hatch used to argue when President Clinton was in office that 67 vacancies on the Federal courts amounted to ``full employment''. We reached Senator Hatch's standard for a full Federal bench during the 17 months in which the Democrats led the Senate.  We have continued our efforts this year and this week we reached the lowest level of judicial vacancies in 13 years--the lowest level since judgeships were significantly expanded in 1990. We now are working to reduce the remaining 47 vacancies even further.  Since the beginning of this year, in spite of the fixation of the Republican majority on the President's most controversial nominations, we have worked hard to reduce judicial vacancies even further. As of today, the number of judicial vacancies is at 47. That is the lowest it has been in two decades. That is lower than it ever was allowed to go at any time during the entire eight years of the Clinton administration. We have reduced the vacancy rate from 12.8 percent to 5.45 percent, the lowest it has been since 1990. With some cooperation from the administration think of the additional progress we could be making.  Our Senate leadership, both Republican and Democratic, have worked to correct some of the problems that arose from some of the earlier hearings and actions of the Judiciary Committee this year. Last week we were able to hold a hearing on the nomination of John Roberts to the District of Columbia Circuit. We are all working hard to complete Committee consideration of that nomination at the earliest opportunity. Thus, a number of additional, controversial nominations are in the process of being considered and will be considered by the Senate in due course.  My point is to underscore that we have made and are making real progress from the thoroughgoing obstruction from 1996 until 2001. While ``the glass is not full,'' it is more full than empty and more has been achieved than some want to acknowledge. One hundred and twenty-three lifetime confirmations in less than two years is better than any 2-year period from 1995 through 2000. We have reduced judicial vacancies to 47, which is the lowest number and lowest vacancy percentage in 13 years. During the entire 8-year term of President Clinton it was never allowed by Republicans to get that low. We have made tremendous progress. These achievements have not been easy.  The administration has chosen confrontation with the Congress, with the Senate and with this committee. We are now proceeding at three to four times the pace Republicans maintained in reviewing President Clinton's judicial nominees. We have reached the point where the Judiciary Committee and the Senate are often moving too fast on some nominations and we risk becoming a racing conveyor belt that rubber stamps rather than examines these lifetime appointments. Democrats have worked hard to repair the damage to the confirmation process and achieved significant results. Republicans seem merely results oriented and interested in ideological domination of the Federal courts.  As Republicans turn their sights on the propriety of the filibuster in connection with judicial nominations and speculate about changing the rules and suing the Senate, I trust the Republican majority will not overlook the precedent on this question. Republicans not only joined in the filibuster of Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, they organized the filibuster of Stephen Breyer to the 1st Circuit, Judge Rosemary Barkett to the 11th Circuit, Judge H. Lee Sarokin to the 3rd Circuit, and Judge Richard Paez and Judge Marsha Berzon to the 9th Circuit. The truth is that filibusters on nominations and legislative matters and extended debate on judicial nominations, including circuit court nominations, have become more and more common on the initiative of Republicans working against Democratic nominees. Now that a Republican President, intent on packing the courts with ideologues, has seen two nominees delayed by filibusters, and even though the other 123 judges he nominated have been confirmed, partisans want to change the rules to make it easier for this President to get his way.  Of course, when they are in the majority Republicans have more successfully defeated nominees of a Democratic President by refusing to proceed on them and have not publicly explained their actions, preferring to act in secret under the cloak of anonymity. From 1995 through 2001, when Republicans previously controlled the Senate majority, Republican efforts to defeat President Clinton's judicial nominees most often took place through inaction and anonymous holds for which no Republican Senator could be held accountable. Republicans held up almost 80 judicial nominees who were not acted upon during the Congress in which President Clinton first nominated them and eventually defeated more than 50 judicial nominees without a recorded Senate vote of any kind, just by refusing to proceed with hearings and Committee votes. These are just the sorts of stealth tactics Democrats have rejected.  Beyond judicial nominees, Republicans also filibustered the nomination of executive branch nominees. They successfully filibustered the nomination of Dr. Henry Foster to become Surgeon General of the United States in spite of two cloture votes in 1995. Dr. David Satcher's subsequent nomination to be Surgeon General also required cloture but he was successfully confirmed.  Other executive branch nominees who were filibustered by Republicans included Walter Dellinger's nomination to be Assistant Attorney General. Two cloture petitions were required to be filed on that nomination and both were rejected by Republicans. We were able finally to obtain a confirmation vote for Professor Walter Dellinger after significant efforts and he was confirmed to be Assistant Attorney General with 34 votes against him. He was never confirmed to his position as Solicitor General because Republicans had made clear their opposition to him. In addition, in 1993, Republicans objected to a number of State Department nominations and even the nomination of Janet Napolitano to serve as the U.S. Attorney for Arizona, resulting in more cloture petitions. In 1994, Republicans successfully filibustered the nomination of Sam Brown to be an Ambassador. After three cloture petitions were filed, his nomination was returned to President Clinton without Senate action. Also in 1994, two cloture petitions were required to get a vote on the nomination of Derek Shearer to be an Ambassador. And it likewise took two cloture petitions to get a vote on the nomination of Ricki Tigert to chair the FDIC. So when Republican Senators now talk about the Senate Executive Calendar and presidential nominees, they must be reminded that they recently filibustered many, many qualified nominees.  Filibusters should be and are rare. That there are two this year is a direct result of the strategy of confrontation sought by the White House and Senate Republicans. The administration holds the key to ending the Estrada impasse, as it has for the last year. It should cooperate with the Senate and provide access to his work papers, following the example set by all previous Republican and Democratic administrations.  The renomination of Judge Owen was most ill-advised and unprecedented. Her nomination had already been rejected after fair hearings and thorough debate and a committee vote last year. Some apparently want to rewrite the rules so that this President can have every nominee confirmed, no matter how divisive and controversial, by the Republican Senate majority.  Recently, I heard a respected Republican and senior advisor to the majority leader describe cloture as ``the fulcrum on which you balance the rights of the individual and the rights of the institution.'' He explained how important the rights of the minority party are in the Senate and how Senate rules are deliberately constructed to reflect that and protect the minority. That Republicans are now intent on rewriting longstanding Senate rules shows just how partisan and ends-oriented they have become.  The President promised to be a uniter not a divider, but he has continued to send us judicial nominees that divide our nation. He has even managed to divide Hispanics across the country with the nomination of Mr. Estrada. He has managed to outrage disabled individuals by his nomination of Jeffrey Sutton. The nomination and confirmation process begins with the President. I, again, urge him to work with us to identify and nominate qualified, consensus, mainstream nominees who all Americans can be confident will be fair and impartial and to abandon his ideological court packing scheme.  Just yesterday an editorial appeared in the Rutland Herald noting: ``[P]acking the court with right-wing ideologues is a program that Democrats may legitimately question. The Senate is required to consent to the president's judicial nominees because of the checks and balances created by the Constitution to restrain presidential power. The right wing now chafes under that restraint, but [Senators] have every reason to stand firm in order to bring balance to the judiciary.'' I ask unanimous consent that the full editorial be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Rutland Herald, May 7, 2003]       A Senate Judiciary subcommittee held a hearing Tuesday to      highlight what Republicans claim is an abuse of the Senate      rules by Democrats seeking to hold up President Bush's      judicial nominees.       The subcommittee hearing was described by one Democratic      aide as a ``dog and pony show.'' It is part of the      ideological warfare unleashed by the right wing to intimidate      and destroy its opposition. The Republicans' complaint abouut      Democratic obstructionism with regard to judicial nominees      makes a villain out of Sen. Patrick Leahy, but their case is      bogus and based on a foundation of hypocrisy.       The Democrats have kindled Republican wrath because the      Democrats have had the temerity to block two nominees. Two.      In the meantime, the Senate has confirmed 123 Bush nominees.      The vacancy rate in the judiciary is at a 13-year low. When      the Democrats took control of the Senate in 2001, the      Republicans had left open 111 judicial vacancies. Now there      are 43.       Members of the judiciary have remarked on how the Bush      administration has staffed the Justice Department with      fiercely uncompromising ideologues intent, not just on      dealing with the opposition, but on destroying it. How else      can one account for the war declared by Republicans over two      judicial nominees who failed to pass muster?       The subcommittee hearing is ostensibly meant to examine the      question of whether the Democrats' use of the filibuster to      block judicial nominees is constitutional. The filibuster is      a delaying tactic in which one side refuses to end debate on      a particular question. According to Senate rules, the Senate      can end a filibuster with 60 out of 100 votes. Certainly, the      filibuster is anti-majoritarian, but over the years it has      been used effectively by both Republicans and Democrats.       Now that the Democrats have shown they are adept at using      the filibuster, the Republicans have begun to froth that it      is unconstitutional. They are even claiming there is some      kind of exception to the filibuster rule for judicial      nominees, though it is a claim without any basis in law that      the Republicans would quickly abandon as soon as they found      themselves in the minority.       It is hard to defend the filibuster as a democratic method.      But for the Republicans suddenly to wax indignant about the      filibuster now that it has been turned against them is      hyppcrisy enough to shock and awe. From 1995 to 2000      Republicans blocked one-third of President Clinton's judicial      nominees by a variety of methods that were as anti-     majoritarian as the filibuster, including the failure of the      Judiciary Committee even to schedule hearings and including      the secret hold, by which a senator can block a nominee      merely on his or her say-so.       If anger and self-righteousness signify the rightness of      one's cause, the Republicans are making a good show of it.      But packing the court with right-wing ideologues is a program      that Democrats may legitimately question. The Senate is      required to consent to the president's judicial nominees      because of the checks and balances created by the      Constitution to restrain presidential power. The right wing      now chafes under that restraint, but Leahy and his allies      have every reason to stand firm in order to bring balance to      the judiciary.
