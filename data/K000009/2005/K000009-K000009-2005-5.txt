And one of those is the management of our Federal accounts.  The news today reports in USA Today, Oil imports help push the trade gap to record highs. Every time I see the fact that we are importing more oil than finding ways to become more energy independent here at home, I say to myself, there is something that America really can do but is not doing.  The New York Times reported, and I include this in the Record, today that the U.S. trade deficit indeed has hit record highs, threatening U.S. growth. We are going deeper and deeper into debt every day with imports climbing much faster than exports. The American people know this. One can hardly find anything made in this country anymore. In fact, the trade deficit is so huge, it is now three-quarters of $1 trillion and rising and, with it, our foreign indebtedness. This widening gap is likely to reduce our overall growth as a country.  Now, our thirst for imported petroleum as a part of this increase rose 13 percent. And the Secretary of Treasury is living in another world when he says the reason that we are going into hock is because other nations are not growing fast enough, when, in fact, other nations are the very countries that are lending us money to make up this gap.  The New York Times says a growing number of economists worry that the United States has become locked intobecoming the world's consumer of last resort, a role that is leading to ever higher levels of foreign indebtedness financed in large part by central banks of China, Japan and other Asian countries.  And not just Asian. As this chart illustrates, the amount of debt being held by foreigners is going up. Japan, over $100 billion over last year to a level of $681 billion. They are literally owning us, owning our debt.  Europe, $471.8 billion. And a lot of that, I think, comes through the London markets, particularly the oil markets. So this masks some of the buying that actually is occurring through the Middle East.  China, Hong Kong, at a level now of over $295 billion. And those kinds of ownership of our assets and debt means we owe them interest. And that level of interest is what I want to discuss tonight.  The proportion of our foreign-held debt is now nearly half of what we owe as a country. Nearly half. It has grown exponentially, and the interest we pay on that debt is one of the largest components of the Federal budget. In fact, in this coming fiscal year, the interest alone that Americans will pay to foreigners for their borrowings to us will be nearly $100 billion. Take the amount that we have to pay Hong Kong and China for what they have lent to us. We will pay them over $13 billion. How much is $13 billion? $13 billion is nearly equal to all of the money we spend as a Federal Government financing student loans in the Pell grant program to make post-secondary study a reality for thousands of students.                              {time}  2345  How about the $30 billion in interest that we will owe Japan, when you think that that amount is $6 billion more than we devote to funding the No Child Left Behind Act. And it is twice as much as we spend on funding employment training and unemployment services combined.  In Ohio, for example, this past week only one school in the northeastern part of Ohio got funds in order to do additional job training, though President Bush campaigned very hard on that issue in Ohio. Ohio did not get 15 grants or 20 grants, we got one.  Our money is going to pay interest to foreigners who are lending us money. We are cutting money for Head Start by more than $11 billion, and yet we are paying over $100 billion to foreign interests who are lending us money. We cannot afford to pay TRICARE for the needs of those in the Guard and Reserve, many of whom are returning home and finding their benefits are cut, and we have a shortfall in the veterans affairs budget. All of those accounts put together are a pittance compared to the interest that we are paying on our foreign-owned debt.  I have introduced, along with several of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, H.R. 4405, The Trade Balancing Act of 2005, which will require that in cases in which the annual trade deficit, that is the trade gap, the difference between imports and exports, between the United States and another country is $10 billion a year for three consecutive years, the President must take the necessary steps to create a more balanced trading relationship with that country.  I am asking my colleagues to help communicate this message to the President, to our colleagues, before a foreclosure sign is posted on our Treasury building. There could be nothing more important that this Congress could do than to turn a sound economy over to the future.  Madam Speaker, I will place these additional articles in the Record. Let us put America back on an even keel.           Trade Deficit Hits Record, Threatening U.S. Growth                         (By Edmund L. Andrews)       Washington, Dec. 14.--The United States' trade deficit      ballooned to a record in October, the government said      Wednesday, with imports climbing much faster than exports      even though prices for imported oil declined.       The trade deficit widened by $3 billion, to $68.9 billion,      confounding forecasts on Wall Street that the gap would      narrow and signaling that the nation's huge trade imbalance      has not begun to stabilize.       The nation's deficit is on track to top $700 billion this      year, up from last year's record of $618 billion, and its      foreign indebtedness is rising at least as rapidly.       Because imports are about 50 percent higher than exports,      the United States would need to increase exports twice as      fast as imports simply to keep its imbalances from growing      even more.       The widening gap is likely to reduce the nation's overall      growth in the final quarter of this year. Morgan Stanley      reduced its forecast for growth this quarter to 3 percent,      from 3.4 percent on Wednesday, and Merrill Lynch shaved its      already pessimistic forecast to just 2.3 percent.       News of the deficit also ignited a fresh round of political      accusations in Washington over trade and globalization, with      Democrats accusing President Bush of being soft on countries      like China.       The United States stepped up its purchases from every part      of the world and in most categories of goods, even as global      demand softened, the Commerce Department reported.       The trade deficit with China through October hit $166.8      billion, exceeding the $162 billion deficit with China for      all of last year.       Over all, the Commerce Department estimated that American      exports grew by 1.7 percent in October, while imports climbed      2.7 percent.       But exports were weaker than the headline numbers implied,      because virtually all of the increase stemmed from a big      increase in aircraft sales after the end of a strike at      Boeing.       Excluding aircraft, exports of capital goods and industrial      goods were essentially flat. Exports of consumer goods      declined 5.6 percent, to $9.37 billion.       Many analysts had expected the trade deficit to narrow      slightly, partly because of the increase in airplane exports      and partly because oil prices declined slightly during the      month.       But American thirst for imported petroleum shot up 13      percent, largely to make up for the loss of production in the      Gulf of Mexico cause by Hurricane Katrina.       The United States' trade deficit with the Organization of      the Petroleum Exporting Countries totaled $77 billion for the      first 10 months of this year, up from $59.1 billion for the      same period last year. The higher deficit is the result of      both higher oil prices over the last year and higher volumes      of imports. But that was only part of the reason that the      trade balance deteriorated. The trade balance for      nonpetroleum products for the first 10 months of this year      has widened to $447 billion, up from $400 billion last year.       Representative Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, a top      Democrat point man on trade issues, accused the Bush      administration of failing to create an effective strategy for      dealing with unfair trade practices.       Representative Marcy Kaptur, an Ohio Democrat, stepped up      her call for legislation to force the administration to take      action against countries that consistently run trade      surpluses with the United States of more than $10 billion a      year.       Even some Republicans expressed dismay at the size of the      deficit.       ``Small business owners in Maine and across the nation are      fighting to remain competitive with countries such as China      that flagrantly disregard fair trade practices,'' said      Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine.       The Treasury secretary, John W. Snow, said the      administration was pushing countries like China, but added      the trade deficit was largely a result of slow growth in      other countries.       ``If our major industrialized trading partners were growing      faster, the U.S. wouldn't have such a large trade gap,'' Mr.      Snow said at a briefing on the economy with Commerce      Secretary Carlos M. Gutierrez and Labor Secretary Elaine L.      Chao.       The American economy grew at an annual rate of 3.8 percent      in the first three quarters of this year, far faster than      either the European Union or Japan.       A growing number of economists worry that the United States      has become locked into being the world's consumer of last      resort, a role that is leading to ever higher levels of      foreign indebtedness financed in a large part by central      banks of China, Japan and other Asian countries.       Robert Sinche, a currency strategist at Bank of America,      predicted on Wednesday that foreigners would own about $4      trillion in American assets, about 30 percent of its gross      domestic product, by the end of 2006.                          ____________________
