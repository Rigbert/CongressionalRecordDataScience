President, today I am introducing the Digital Consumer Right To Know Act. The thrust of this bill is quite simple. Digital media companies are racing to develop technologies to combat piracy. Some of these anti-piracy measures could have the effect of restricting lawful, legitimate consumer uses as well as unlawful copying. My bill says that if digital content is released in a form that prevents or limits reasonable consumers uses, consumers have a right to be told in advance.  The shift from analog to digital technologies carries many potential benefits for all concerned--for technology companies, for producers of music, video, and other content, and above all, for consumers. Digital technologies, together with the rise of the Internet, promise to expand exponentially the possibilities for circulating, marketing, manipulating, and using creative works. There is so much more you can do, and so many fertile fields for innovation.  The shift to digital, however, also carries twin risks. The first, and the one on which Congress has focused most of its attention to date, is the risk of piracy. Digital technologies can greatly facilitate unlawful copying and distribution. This is a real problem, because people and companies that create copyrighted works must be fairly compensated. America's information-based economy depends on it.  The second, closely related risk is that, in combating piracy, the baby will get thrown out with the bathwater. In the name of anti-piracyprotections, legitimate consumer uses could be stifled. Encryption or other ``digital rights management'', DRM, schemes could be employed that restrict consumers' ability to take full advantage of the potential of the new digital technologies. In the end, it's not inconceivable that digital media could be more restricted and less flexible than other copyrighted items--an ironic result for a technology that was supposed to represent a great step forward for consumers.  The bill I am introducing today focuses on this second risk. Significantly, it would not in any way dictate to content companies what types of copy protection or DRM schemes may or may not be used. Instead, it would ensure that consumers are fully informed of any impact on their ability to use and manipulate the content they buy.  Advance notice of technology-based use limitations is a matter of basic fairness. Consumers have developed a number of legitimate expectations concerning how they may use and manipulate content, and are likely to develop new expectations as technology develops. For example, consumers increasingly expect to be able to shift legally purchased content between different devices--to access it on their computers, or in their cars, or using portable devices like MP3 players. They should be told in advance if these expectations won't be met, so that they can factor this information into their purchasing decisions. Consumers should know what they are getting or not getting.  In addition, I believe that imposing this kind of notice requirement will help promote the development of solutions that strike an appropriate and acceptable balance between protecting against piracy and preserving utility and flexibility for consumers. Overly restrictive approaches would require disclosures that content providers could find embarrassing, and consumers could be alienated by measures that don't seem to respect the importance of user flexibility. In short, full disclosure would strengthen the market-based incentive to avoid technologies that are too restrictive of consumer flexibility.  My bill would also make a clear statement that Congress expects that there will be competition in the retail distribution of copyrighted digital content. This shouldn't be controversial: today, compact discs, books, and movie videos are distributed via many competing retail stores. They also often face competition with stores selling used content, and with rentals and libraries. But what if new DRM technologies permit copyright holders to limit or prevent the ability of unaffiliated entities to sell or distribute content on a secondhand basis? Could the copyright holder sharply reduce competition at the distribution level, and thus increase its market power? My legislation addresses this risk by expressing the sense of the Congress that it is important to retain competition among distribution channels for digital information and entertainment content.  As the debate over digital copyright issues continues, I intend to listen to all sides. This country needs balanced approaches that respect the interests of copyright holders and consumers alike. But the bill I introduce today is a significant step that Congress could take now that would protect consumers of digital content and promote market-based solutions, all without rewriting any copyright laws. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 692       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Digital Consumer Right to      Know Act''.     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:       (1) Consumers have developed a number of legitimate      expectations concerning how they may use and manipulate      legally acquired information or entertainment content for      reasonable, personal, and noncommercial purposes. In      addition, as digital technology creates new ways to use and      manipulate content, consumers are likely to develop new      expectations that reflect the new technological      possibilities.       (2) Digital technologies also can facilitate unlawful      reproduction and distribution of information or entertainment      content subject to copyright protection. To combat this      problem, technology and content companies are developing and      deploying technologies to prevent or deter such unlawful      behavior.       (3) Such technologies could help promote a competitive      digital marketplace in which consumers have a broad range of      choices and media businesses can pursue a variety of business      models. However, there are also significant risks.       (4) There is a risk that technologies developed to prevent      unlawful reproduction and distribution of digital information      and entertainment content could have the side effect of      restricting consumers' flexibility to use and manipulate such      content for reasonable, personal, and noncommercial purposes.       (5) There is a risk that such technologies could unfairly      surprise consumers by frustrating their expectations      concerning how they may use and manipulate digital content      they have legally acquired.       (6) There is a risk that such technologies could result in      greater market power for the holders of exclusive rights and      reduce competition, by limiting the ability of unaffiliated      entities to engage in the lawful secondhand sale or      distribution of such content.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to ensure that consumers of digital information and      entertainment content are informed in advance of      technological features that may restrict the uses and      manipulation of such content, so that--       (A) consumers may factor this information into their      purchasing decisions; and       (B) there will be a strong, market-based incentive for the      development of technologies that address the problem of      unlawful reproduction and distribution of content in ways      that still preserve the maximum possible flexibility for      consumers to use and manipulate such content for lawful and      reasonable purposes; and       (2) to express the sense of Congress concerning the      importance of retaining competition among distribution      channels for digital information and entertainment content.     SEC. 3. FAIR DISCLOSURE OF TECHNOLOGICAL USE RESTRICTIONS.       (a) FTC Rulemaking.--Not later than 1 year after the date      of enactment of this Act, the Federal Trade Commission shall      issue rules to implement the disclosure requirements      described in subsection (b).       (b) Disclosure Requirements.--       (1) In general.--If a producer or distributor of      copyrighted digital content sells such content or access to      such content subject to technological features that limit the      practical ability of the purchaser to play, copy, transmit,      or transfer such content on, to, or between devices or      classes of devices that consumers commonly use with respect      to that type of content, the producer or distributor shall      disclose the nature of such limitations to the purchaser in a      clear and conspicuous manner prior to such sale.       (2) Manner of disclosure.--The Federal Trade Commission      shall prescribe the manner of disclosure required under this      subsection, which may include labels on packaging or such      other means as the Commission determines appropriate to      achieve the purposes of this section. The Commission may      prescribe different manners of disclosure for different types      of content and different distribution channels.       (c) Disclosure of Certain Limitations on Reasonable      Consumer Activities.--The following are examples of      limitations which shall trigger the disclosure requirements      of subsection (b):       (1) Limitations on the recording for later viewing or      listening (popularly referred to as ``time shifting'') of      audio or video programming delivered--       (A) via free over-the-air broadcasting; or       (B) as part of a multichannel video or audio system in      which the consumer obtains the programming as part of a      subscription package, with no per view charges and no ability      to select the specific time at which individual programs will      be delivered.       (2) Limitations on the reasonable and noncommercial use of      legally acquired audio or video content--       (A) in different physical locations of the consumer's      choice (popularly referred to as ``space shifting''); or       (B) on the electronic platform or device of the consumer's      choice, including platforms or devices requiring that the      content be translated into a comparable format before such      use.       (3) Limitations on making backup copies of legally acquired      content distributed in a form or medium that is subject to      accidental erasure, damage, or destruction in the ordinary      course of use, including through computer failure or computer      viruses, to be used only in the event that the original      copies are lost or damaged.       (4) Limitations on using limited excerpts of legally      acquired content for purposes such as criticism, comment,      news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research.       (5) Limitations on engaging in the secondhand transfer or      sale of legally acquired content to another consumer,      provided that the transferor does not retain the content or      any copy thereof and that the transferee obtains only such      rights to the use and enjoyment of     the content as the transferor possessed at the time of      transfer.       (d) Exception to Disclosure Requirement.--The Federal Trade      Commission shall not require disclosure under subsection (b)      with respect to any limitation that applies only to uses--       (1) that are sufficiently unusual or uncommon that the      burdens of prior disclosure would outweigh the utility to      consumers; or       (2) that have no significant application for lawful      purposes.       (e) Annual FTC Review.--On an annual basis, the Federal      Trade Commission shall review the effectiveness of its rules      implementing this section to determine whether revisions are      warranted to serve the purposes of this section. In      conducting this review, the Commission shall consider whether      changes in technology or in consumer practices have led to      new, legitimate consumer expectations concerning specific      uses of digital information or entertainment content that      would result in consumers suffering unfair surprise if a      technology were to limit those uses without prior notice.     SEC. 4. EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS.       (a) No Limiting Effect on Fair Use.--Nothing in this Act      shall be interpreted to suggest that a consumer activity not      referred to in section 3(c) or in the Federal Trade      Commission's rules implementing this Act may not constitute a      fair use within the meaning of section 107 of title 17,      United States Code.       (b) Unlawful Reproduction or Distribution.--Nothing in this      Act shall be interpreted to permit the otherwise unlawful      reproduction or distribution of copyrighted content or to      shield a person engaging in such activity from any type of      legal action or judgment.     SEC. 5. COMPETITION IN DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.       It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) competition among distribution outlets and methods      generally benefits consumers; and       (2) just as copyright holders have sold content embodied in      tangible products such as audio cassettes, videotapes, and      compact discs to multiple competing retail distributors,      copyright holders selling digital content in electronic form      for distribution over the Internet should offer to license      such content to multiple unaffiliated distributors, to enable      competition among different distribution models and      technologies.                                 ______                                       By
