President, I rise today to pay tribute to Marlene Carls, a very special person who worked in my Springfield office for nearly 20 years. Marlene passed away on October 24.  My wife Loretta first introduced me to Marlene almost 20 years ago when I was running for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. Loretta told me Marlene was an excellent worker and she hoped that she would join my campaign. So I sat down with Marlene and offered her a deal she could not refuse. I offered her a beat-up old desk, a run-down office, and not much pay, if she was willing to work for a candidate who had lost three straight elections. In a moment of weakness, she accepted. Marlene was part of our family from that day forward.  Marlene was born to be a caseworker and she was the best. She had a heart of gold. She cared so much for the people she was helping. She would take on immigration cases, foreign adoptions, and so many difficult and complicated matters. She would help constituents get the answers they needed. It wasn't just professional assistance to people in time of need; it was much more. Marlene Carls treated people asking for help as members of the family. She did her job so well that I used to get fan mail from constituents who could not thank me enough for the wonderful work that Marlene did.  With the immigration cases, we would continue to see the fruit of her work for many years. Marlene and I would go to naturalization ceremonies in Springfield twice a year. And as they would call out the name of a new citizen she would nudge me and say, ``Boss''--she always called me ``Boss''--``Boss, that's one of ours.'' It was the same kind of pride a mother has when her son or daughter crosses the stage at a graduation ceremony. She knew the people she had helped; she cared about them; she rejoiced in their success and happiness.  She showed the same caring for our military cases: mothers and fathers desperate to reach their sons and daughters in uniform--to bring them home for an emergency--to get them out of a scrape--or just to learn if they were alive in a crisis.  Marlene learned the military lingo and reached the point where she could charm the stripes off a sergeant or the stars off a general. Many families in Illinois found peace of mind because of Marlene Carls' hard work.  And she took such delight in knowing that someone's life had been made a little better off because of her efforts.  Marlene, or ``Mo'' as we came to call her, was proud of her family. Her son Kelly Carls, her daughter Cathleen Stock, and her two grandchildren, Kayla Lynn and Julia Anne Stock, were the apples of her eye. I was pleased to watch their progress through her eyes.  Marlene also had so many friends. At her memorial service last Friday in Springfield, the chapel was packed with family, fellow staffers, and friends from other governmental offices. The group from the National Park Service where we have our senatorial office came out in uniform to be there for Marlene--clergy from many different religions and many ordinary people who had the good luck of asking Marlene for a helping hand.  Mo was active as a volunteer for the Alzheimer's Association and the American Cancer Society. In everything she did, people and a concern for people took first place. In our office, her care for others and wise advice led people to call her ``Mama Mo.''  A lesser known fact is that Marlene was an amazing writer. I remember she had written a piece in a contest and won a free trip to Hollywood. She was just so proud of that.  She had a long-time dream to visit Ireland. Over her desk was a picture of herself and ``Tip'' O'Neill. She really valued that photograph as a reminder of her Irish heritage. She and Kathy Anderson of my staff had the trip to Ireland planned. But they weren't able to make the journey because of Marlene's illness. At her wake, I closed with an Irish blessing from all of us to a wonderful person and great public servant.     May the road rise up to meet you.     May the wind be always at your back.     May the sun shine warm upon your face,     The rain fall soft upon your fields.     And until we meet again,     May God hold you in the hollow of His hand.  We will dearly miss Marlene Carls.  (The remarks of Mr. Durbin pertaining to the introduction of S.J.
