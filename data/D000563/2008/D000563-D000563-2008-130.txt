I know when he spoke in response to the State of the Union a little over a year ago, he raised the issue of executive compensation. If I am not mistaken, he made the point that the average worker, in the course of a year's work, made what the average executive makes in a day. Maybe it was even more of a contrast. But it is a clear indication of how things have gotten completely out of line. I ask the Senator from Virginia if he could recount what that comparison was between pay for CEOs and the pay for workers?
