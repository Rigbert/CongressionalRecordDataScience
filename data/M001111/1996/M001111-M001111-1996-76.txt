 President, I will be very brief because I know there are a number of Senators who want to offer amendments.  I heard two arguments, one that there is no offset. It is my understanding that when this Senate struck the Medicaid provisions in this bill, that had a $70 billion impact, without worrying about where the offsets were. So in this provision, it only affects $24 million. I say because it is the right policy that we care for our children and make sure they have nutritious foods, it seems legitimate and like-minded to do what we have done with the Medicaid provision in this bill.  Second, the other argument was that the price for these meals is higher than what is offered during the school year. That is, of course, true, because during the school year the volume, the number of children that are served is quite large, is much larger. In the summer, we are serving fewer students, and, therefore, the cost of meals goes up.  Second, during the school year, the facility is provided. During the summer, programs have to pay for the sites, and the cost goes up prohibitively because of that. That is why the summer program costs more than the school-year program.  It is a very legitimate concern. I will again say that the bill reduces the amount of the program by 23 cents on each lunch. That will have a dramatic impact. We will lose sites, especially in rural areas, and see as much as a 35-percent drop in the number of programs that are able to offer this.  Again, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment tomorrow morning. I ask for the yeas and nays.
