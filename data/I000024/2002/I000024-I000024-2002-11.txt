President, it is my intent today to make a few comments about someone I hold in such high esteem, perhaps in higher esteem than anyone else I can think of at this moment. Before doing that, I am compelled, however, to respond to some of the statements that have been made concerning the economy.  I think we all recognize our economy started turning south about 3 years ago. We did see this coming. I really do not like people saying--because I am always afraid someone is going to believe it--that somehow when we reduce tax burdens on individuals that is going to automatically reduce the revenues that would have otherwise come from those taxes.  History tells us just the opposite. In fact, yes, we are going to have a deficit. We understand that. We are currently in a war, and we understand even though the amount of additional money, some $48 billion, that went into the war effort is totally inadequate, it is going to have to be more, and we are going to see deficits.  The other factor causing deficits is a downturn in the economy. We all know for every 1 percent drop in economic activity, that translates into $24 billion of lost revenue. Turning that around, for every 1 percent increase in economic activity, revenue will increase by $24 billion. It has been proven over and over throughout the history of this country that every time we have had the opportunity and the courage to reduce taxes, not raise taxes, it has resulted in increased revenues.  The best evidence of this is 1980. My colleague from Florida talked about the decade of the eighties, but let's look at what happened in the decade of the eighties.  In the 1980s, the total amount of money that was raised from marginal rates was $244 billion. In 1990, that same figure was $406 billion. We can see in a 10-year period revenue almost doubled, and that was the 10-year period when we had more reductions in marginal rates and in capital gains taxes and other taxes than any other 10-year period in this Nation's history.  Is this a Republican idea? No, it is a conservative idea. Liberals do not like to think we can return money to the people. They do not understand this adds to our economy. I hate to think of where we would be today if we had not had the tax cuts because they have, in fact, had a positive effect on the economy.  This is not a Republican idea. I remember a great President of the United States in the sixties. It was President Kennedy. President Kennedy felt Government needed to do more for the Great Society. He said we are going to have to have more revenues. He said: The best way to increase revenues is to decrease taxes. So President Kennedy decreased taxes and revenues increased.  Mr. President, I say to my liberal friends, I know they do not believe the private sector and individuals left with freedom in the their hands can operate as well as Government can. They are wrong.                          ____________________
