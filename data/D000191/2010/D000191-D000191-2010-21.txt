Strip the $200 million from an unauthorized program. Remember, this is an appropriations bill. You're not supposed to create new programs or authorize things. All we say is, it's subject to authorization. That is why I'm happy to look at the $200 million or even more for an office of livability in an authorizing bill.  Let's have a meaningful discussion. Let's get it done. Don't let the administration cherry-pick and end-run us.
