President, Vermonters are fiercely proud of those who serve in our National Guard. For decades--and never more so than in the last decade--when the Nation sounded the call to service, the Vermont National Guard has answered. Today, I would like to pay tribute to Ed and Karen Matayka, two Vermont National Guard soldiers whose perseverance in the face of huge odds is an inspiration to all.  The Army brought Ed and Karen together--they met at combat medic training in Texas--and they have been an Army family ever since. The Mataykas deployed twice together, once to Kuwait immediately following their wedding, and a second time to Afghanistan with Vermont's 86th Infantry Brigade Combat Team in 2010. It was during that second deployment when tragedy struck.  While running a convoy mission in Afghanistan, Ed's vehicle was hit by an improvised explosive device, leaving him with multiple injuries, including the amputation of his legs. Some doctors questioned whether Ed would survive.  Yet he never gave up. With Karen's support and the assistance of skilled Army doctors, Ed is well on the road to recovery. Not only is Ed making great strides in his personal health, with newly authorized assistance for invitro fertilization for service members, Ed and Karen recently welcomed the arrival of twins: Ryan David and Alana Marie. They are the first Army family to have used the technique after Congress passed a law authorizing TRICARE coverage of reproductive therapies for military families dealing with the consequences of catastrophic injury.  As a Vermonter, I am proud of Ed and Karen. Ryan and Alana are surely lucky to have them as parents.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the recent U.S. Army article entitled ``Double amputee gets another chance of starting family'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the United States Army, April 24, 2013]         Double Amputee Gets Another Chance of Starting Family            (By Maria Gallegos, Brooke Army Medical Center)       San Antonio.--The only thing he remembered was waking up      five weeks later in Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in      Germany--from a tragedy that nearly cost him his life and the      chance of starting a family.                             THE BEGINNING       Thirteen years ago, Ed and Karen Matayka, both combat      medics with the Vermont National Guard, met and fell in love      during their advanced training course at what is now Joint      Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston, Texas.       Soon after, they married in 2004 and deployed together six      months later to Kuwait in 2005.       ``We honeymooned in Kuwait,'' said Karen.       They returned to Vermont a year later and were activated      again in 2010 to go to Afghanistan, but this time they      promised each other they would start a family after their      deployment. Just after four months in theater, those plans      looked to be lost.       In July 2010, Ed was on a convoy mission in Afghanistan      when his vehicle was struck by an improvised explosive device      that caused multiple injuries to his body, including the loss      of his legs, fractures to his spinal cord, a traumatic brain      injury, and two strokes that caused nerve damage to his left      side of the body. The blast also killed his driver, Spc. Ryan      Grady, and wounded four other Vermont Soldiers.       ``The doctors told me he probably won't survive,'' Karen      recalled.       Because of the severity of his multiple injuries, he was      treated and transferred to several military medical centers      across the country before he was transferred to Brooke Army      Medical Center, or BAMC. At BAMC, he receives inpatient care      at the San Antonio Military Medical Center, or SAMMC and      specialty rehabilitation care at the Center for the Intrepid.       ``BAMC is the best place for amputee rehab, (so) we needed      to get Ed here,'' Karen said.       Ed has been rehabilitating at the CFI, BAMC's outpatient      rehab center, since August 2011. He is now learning to walk      again.                         IN VITRO FERTILIZATION       Even though their plans of starting a family were      temporarily on hold, their desire to start a family was never      in question.       ``We really wanted to have a family long before this      happened, and we are not going to let his injuries change our      plans,'' said Karen.       ``We had decided together that we wanted kids--we just      wanted to share some love, help guide the next generation,''      Ed added.       They turned to in vitro fertilization in hopes of making      their dreams of a family a reality. The IVF process is a      procedure in which eggs are removed and joined with a sperm      outside of the body to fertilize and the resulting embryo is      then placed back into the uterus.       They first started the IVF process, at the Boston's veteran      hospital where Ed was receiving his spinal cord rehab--but      because of the complexity of the injuries, the procedure was      not successful.       After eight months of rehab at BAMC, and with Ed gaining      more strength and independence, they decided to try again.       ``We were initially told we had to pay for it ourselves,      which we were fine with, and we didn't care. We wanted to do      it, and then we were told that TRICARE was working on a      policy that would change its IVF coverage for service members      with severe injuries,'' Karen said.       A week before their IVF transfer, a bill was passed to      cover reproductive services to active service members who      have suffered from catastrophic injuries resulting in      infertility. Since 2003, more than 1,800 U.S. military      members have suffered injuries in Iraq or Afghanistan that      impact their reproductive tract.       ``TRICARE rules changed and we were 100 percent covered,''      said Karen.       After their first attempt of the IVF transfer process,      Karen became pregnant.       Their twins, Ryan David and Alana Marie, were born March      21, at 28 weeks.       ``The babies were born ahead of time but are doing very      well here (SAMMC neonatal intensive care unit),'' Karen said.       Ed is the first wounded warrior, nationwide, who has      successfully had the IVF transfer procedure since the new      TRICARE policy was implemented.       ``It was an honor to help the Mataykas achieve their dream      of having a family. They are true American heroes and having      the opportunity to directly help our wounded warriors      represents the most rewarding aspect of our profession,''      said Maj. (Dr.) Jeremy King, director of IVF, who performed      their transfer.       Although their desire of starting a family was finally      complete, they will never forget the tragedy that happened      almost two years ago.       ``We named our boy after Ryan, the driver who passed away      from the blast and David who saved Ed's life by applying      tourniquets to his legs,'' Karen said. ``They are our true      heroes.''       Both praised the care they received throughout the      procedure.       ``The care here is great. The reproductive and      endocrinology staff is phenomenal,'' Karen added, as Ed also      agreed. ``The entire staff is extremely caring and we all      bonded throughout the whole process. We greatly appreciate      everyone's care.''       ``We have already referred two other warriors of the      services here at SAMMC,'' Ed said.       ``The Mataykas were a pleasure to work with,'' said King.      ``IVF process is physically and emotionally challenging, but      their attitude was always upbeat, positive and optimistic.      That, I believe, helped them get through the obstacles and      also lifted up our spirits whenever we saw them.''                              THE SERVICE       The In Vitro Fertilization and Reproductive Endocrinology      services had been offered at Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical      Center since 1996. The program relocated to SAMMC in June      2011 due to the Base Realignment and Closure law.       SAMMC's IVF program offers the full gamut of diagnostic      testing and infertility therapy treatments in the same      location.       ``We have over 1,000 babies as a result of our IVF program      and it is the only onsite full service IVF center staffed      solely by active duty physicians in Department of Defense,''      said Col. (Dr.) Matthew Retzloff, Reproductive Endocrinology      chief. ``We offer this service to active duty members and      their dependents, on site at SAMMC, from start to finish.''       Reproductive endocrinologists provide full evaluation and      treatment of all forms of infertility, polycystic ovarian      disease, premature ovarian failure, hirsutism, recurrent      pregnancy loss, reproductive tract anatomic abnormalities,      endometriosis, premenstrual syndrome and complicated      menopausal problems.                          ____________________
