I know the Senator has more to add. Is there anything you heard about what the President is going to suggest that will lower the cost of health insurance for families and businesses across America, an exploding item in terms of their expenses which is pushing more and more people into the situation of being uninsured, underinsured, or putting more and more of their paycheck, every week, into the cost of their health insurance? Has the President suggested anything that will address that?
