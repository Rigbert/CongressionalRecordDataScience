 President, we find ourselves again in the situation of extending key provisions of the PATRIOT Act. These three provisions are roving wiretaps, section 215 business record orders, and the lone wolf provisions. These are all very important tools used to investigate and prevent terrorist attacks. They have been reauthorized a number of times, but it seems that in recent years we have been discussing only very short term extensions of these critical tools.  That is why I will support the cloture motion on moving to S. 1038 today. This legislation provides a 4-year extension of the three expiring provisions without any substantive changes to the existing authorities, and I believe there do not need to be changes to existing authorities.  Regardless of my support for today's cloture vote, and support for the 4-year extension, I wish my colleagues to know that I support a permanent extension of the three expiring provisions. Having this debate year after year offers little certainty to agents utilizing these provisions to combat terrorism. It also leads to operational uncertainty, jeopardizes collection of critical intelligence, and could lead to compliance and reporting problems if the reauthorization occurs too close to the expiration of the law, and we are getting very close to that.  If we believe these tools are necessary--and I clearly stated I believe they are necessary--we need to provide some certainty as opposed to simply revisiting the law year after year. Given the indefinite threat we face from acts of terrorism, it is my view that we should permanently reauthorize these three expiring provisions.  This position is supported by agents on the ground using these tools every day. I have letters of support from the Federal Bureau of Investigation Agents Association supporting a permanent reauthorization of the three expiring provisions. The Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association also supports a permanent extension of the provisions. In fact, a very important passage of that letter states:       Crimes and terrorism will not sunset and are still      targeting our nation and American citizens. Just like      handcuffs, the PATRIOT Act should be a permanent part of the      law enforcement arsenal.  Then we have another letter from the Society of Former Special Agents of the FBI, and that letter says:       We urge Congress to reauthorize the expiring provisions of      the PATRIOT Act permanently and without restrictions as the      three expiring provisions are essential to the security of      our country.  I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                   Federal Bureau of Investigation                                           Agents Association,                                     Arlington, VA, April 4, 2011.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senators: On behalf of the FBI Agents Association      (``FBIAA''), I write to submit our views on the importance of      permanently reauthorizing three provisions of the USA PATRIOT      Act (``PATRIOT Act'') that are set to expire on May 28, 2011.      The FBIAA is comprised of over 12,000 active duty and retired      Agents nationwide and is the only professional association      dedicated to advancing goals of FBI Agents. On their behalf,      we urge the Senate to act now to permanently reauthorize      these critical criminal investigation and counterterrorism      tools without new restrictions.       We also respectfully request that the Senate limit its      debate and consideration to the     expiring PATRIOT Act provisions. Introducing new issues at      this time could unnecessarily impede progress toward      reauthorizing these important national security provisions,      potentially leading to their expiration. Given that there      appears to be bipartisan and bicameral consensus for      reauthorization of the provisions in their current form for      some time, expiration is easily avoidable.    The Three Expiring PATRIOT Act Provisions Should Be Permanently                  Reauthorized Without New Restrictions       Since 9-11, federal law enforcement officers have      effectively and properly used three tools provided for in the      PATRIOT Act and related laws: the ``business records''      provision: the ``roving wiretap'' provision: and the ``lone      wolf'' surveillance provision. These provisions were      developed and adopted in response to the 9-11 terrorist      attacks. Placing new restrictions and requirements on them      now, after ten years of using and relying on these tools, is      antithetical to our primary post-9-11 national security      goal--giving federal law enforcement officers greater tools      and more authority to detect and thwart terrorist attacks.                            Business Records       The ``business records'' provision, Sec. 215 of the PATRIOT      Act, allows criminal investigators to apply to the U.S.      Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Court (``FISA Court'')      for an order requiring the production of business records      related to foreign intelligence operations or an      investigation of international terrorism. However, no such      order can be issued if it concerns an investigation of a U.S.      person based solely on that person's exercise of his or her      First Amendment rights.       This provision is used in specific and rare circumstances.      As described by the Congressional Research Service, the      business records tool has bee used ``sparingly and never to      acquire library, bookstores, medical or gun sale records.''      Despite infrequent use, the ability to access important bank      and telephone records early in investigations is critical for      criminal investigators, and leaders in the Department of      Justice and FBI have called the business records provision a      ``vital tool in the war on terror.''       Given that the provision has been used carefully and      effectively in investigations of terrorist threats, the FBIAA      recommends that Congress reauthorize the provision on a      permanent basis without new limitations on its use.                            Roving Wiretaps       The ``roving wiretap'' provision, Sec. 206 of the PATRIOT      Act, allows the FISA Court to issue wiretap orders that are      not linked to specific phones or computers if the target of      the surveillance has demonstrated an intent to evade      surveillance.       The ability to obtain orders for roving wiretaps is      absolutely essential to contemporary criminal and      counterterrorism investigations because criminal networks      have become technologically advanced and will often purchase      and use many different mobile phones and computers in order      to evade wiretap efforts. Law enforcement experts have      described the roving wiretap provision as a ``very critical      measure'' that has likely helped detect and prevent numerous      terrorist plots, including the plots to bomb multiple      synagogues in New York City.       The FBIAA urges Congress to permanently reauthorize the      roving wiretap authority and not subjected it to further      restrictions. The roving wiretap provision is already      constrained by the requirements that the FISA Court find      probable cause that the target intends to evade surveillance      to issue a wiretap and that minimization procedures are      followed regarding the collection, retention, and      dissemination of information about U.S. persons. A failure to      reauthorize the roving wiretap provision, or encumbering the      provision with unnecessary restrictions, would jeopardize the      utility of an important investigative tool and could, as      Director Mueller has warned, open up a ``gap in the law that      . . . sophisticated terrorists or spies could easily      exploit.''                         Lone Wolf Surveillance       The ``lone wolf'' provision, found in Section 6001 of the      Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004,      allows the FISA Court to issue surveillance orders targeted      at non-U.S. persons who engage in international terrorism or      activities in preparation of terrorism. Prior to enactment of      the lone wolf provision, the FISA Court could only issue      surveillance orders if specific evidence linked the targeted      person to a foreign power or entity. This meant that non-U.S.      individuals acting alone could not be effectively      investigated, even if evidence indicated that they were      preparing to engage in international terrorism.       The FBIAA recommends that Congress permanently reauthorize      the lone wolf provision because it is a necessary part of      combating contemporary terrorist threats. Communication      between individual terrorists and foreign governments and/or      entities is often very scarce, precisely because these groups      are seeking to evade detection by law enforcement. The lone      wolf provision gives law enforcement an important tool to      obtain the information necessary to ensure that threats are      thwarted before terrorists can act on their plans. Congress      should not allow this provision to expire, or place      additional restrictions on the provision, as such actions      could make it more difficult to investigate and prevent      dangerous terrorist threats. Recent developments in the      evolution of the threat of ``homegrown terrorism'' have only      served to underscore the necessity of maintaining this      provision under current law.Efforts To Add New Requirements to the Expiring Provisions and National                Security Letters (NSLs) Should Be Rejected       The FBIAA is concerned that the much-needed reauthorization      of the expiring PATRIOT Act provisions may fall prey to a      larger debate over NSLs and new limitations on the ways that      these investigative tools can be used. We are aware that      concerns about NSLs and PATRIOT Act provisions have been used      by some to fuel skepticism about privacy protection. To be      clear, Agents undergo extensive training regarding the use of      these tools, and we are confident that Special Agents use      them to help protect the public from terrorist and criminal      threats.       Regardless of one's position on new restrictions, it is      clear that including them in the reauthorization debate could      make it almost impossible for Congress to act before May 28,      2011. Allowing these provisions to expire should not be an      option. Terrorists will not wait patiently for Congress to      re-adopt provisions like these before advancing their efforts      to harm our country. Investigators should not have their      hands tied when Congress could easily meet the      reauthorization deadline in a bipartisan and bicameral      fashion.       Moreover, Congress should not rush to codify limitations      and new procedural requirements without carefully considering      the implications of specific legislative language on national      security matters and ongoing investigations. Simply including      these changes in the reauthorization effort is inconsistent      with a robust consideration process.       The FBIAA appreciates your leadership on these issues and      consideration of these comments. We urge Congress to      reauthorize the expiring provisions of the PATRIOT Act      permanently and without new restrictions. FBI Agents work      diligently to detect, investigate, and apprehend individuals      and groups that are engaged in a constant and evolving effort      to craft and execute plots against the United States and its      citizens. The three expiring provisions are essential in our      fight against terrorism.           Sincerely,                                                    Konrad Motyka,     President.                                  ____                                           Federal Law Enforcement                                         Officers Association,                                                    March 2, 2011.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: As you      know, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association      (FLEOA) is the largest non-partisan, non-profit law      enforcement association and represents 26,000 federal law      enforcement officers from 65 federal agencies. In light of      tomorrow's scheduled Executive Business Meeting, we are      writing to provide you with our views regarding      reauthorization of the USA PATRIOT Act.       To date, many recently thwarted terrorist and criminal      plots can be directly attributed to provisions within the USA      PATRIOT ACT. The ACT offers federal law enforcement officers      the tools to stay ahead of violent criminals and better      protect the American citizenry from threats.       FLEOA sees this ACT as a crucial tool for law enforcement,      and not something that should periodically expire. The work      of federal law enforcement officers has only been enhanced by      the USA PATRIOT ACT.       Provisions dealing with:       1) Online Surveillance       2) Roving Wiretaps and Pen Resisters       3) Issuance of John Doe Warrants       4) Accessing financial records and documents       5) Records related to books and magazine purchases       6) Issuance of National Security Letters       In light of today's threats, the provisions listed above      are tools that help thwart terrorists and criminals that use      identity theft, the internet, cellular and satellite phones,      phishing schemes, social networking and wire transfers to      effect their crimes.       FLEOA has the distinct honor of representing the interests      of law enforcement officers from the Department of Justice,      Department of Homeland Security, Department of State,      Department of Defense, Department of Treasury, and a host of      other agencies. These officers are the front-line guardians      that protect our nation from terrorist and criminal threats.       They are the ones that have used the provisions in the USA      PATRIOT ACT to keep Americans safe under the microscope of      strict agency and judicial oversight that has yet to be cited      as ``excessive'' by any investigation or Inspector General's      office.       We would caution the Congress to be careful when trying to      re-work any provisions that have already been in effect and      have been effective.       Additionally, the short-term authorization is at odds with      a Congress that in the aftermath of the September 11th, 2001      attacks asked ``Why didn't we know and connect the dots?''       The USA PATRIOT ACT removed some of the barriers in place      that prevented us from ``connecting the dots'' and any      retraction of     those provisions is in effect, ``re-building the wall.''       Crime and terrorism will not ``sunset'' and are still      targeting our nation and American citizens. Just like      handcuffs, this tool should be a permanent part of the law      enforcement arsenal and arguments to the contrary are flawed      and do not recognize the reality that the ACT has worked.       In this nation, law enforcement is guided by an ethos to      act ``beyond reproach'' and Office of Inspector General's      offices ensure that is the case.       FLEOA greatly appreciates Congress' willingness to continue      this important national security tool and would caution you      not to put it ``back behind the wall'' and is willing to work      with Congress as any proposed legislation moves through it.           Respectfully yours,                                                         J. Adler,     National President.                                  ____         Society of Former Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of            Investigation, Inc.,                                     Dumfries, VA, April 14, 2011.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of the 8000 members of      the Society of Former Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of      Investigation, Inc. (Society), I am writing to inform you of      our views on the importance of permanently reauthorizing the      three provisions of the USA Patriot Act that are going to      expire on May 28, 2011.       The Society was established in 1937 as a fraternal,      educational, and community-minded organization to preserve      the FBI heritage in a spirit of friendship, loyalty, and      goodwill. As former and current Special Agents of the FBI,      our members are experienced in conducting sensitive criminal      and terrorism investigations and are concerned that any      changes to the Patriot Act that would make it more difficult      for the FBI to fulfill its vital mission of protecting our      great country.       In addition, the Society is concerned with the introduction      of new issues that could impede progress in reauthorizing      these important national security provisions. In view of the      bipartisan consensus for the reauthorization of these      provisions, we hope that their expiration can be avoided.       Since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, Federal law      enforcement agencies have effectively utilized three sections      of the Patriot Act, namely: the business records provision,      the roving wiretap provision and the lone wolf surveillance      provision. These sections of the Patriot Act were adopted in      direct response to the September 11th attacks and to place      new restrictions and requirements on these sections of the      Act would be detrimental to Federal law enforcement efforts      to detect and prevent future terrorist attacks.       The business records provision, Section 215 of the Patriot      Act, allows investigators to apply to the U.S. Foreign      Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA Court) for an order      requiring the production of business records related to      foreign intelligence operations or investigations of      international terrorism. This provision is utilized in      specific and rare circumstances. However, despite the      infrequent use of the provision, the ability to access      important records early in an investigation is critical. The      Society strongly encourages Congress to reauthorize this      provision on a permanent basis without limitations.       The roving wiretap provision, Section 206 of the Patriot      Act, allows the FISA Court to issue wiretap authorizations      that are not linked to specific telephones or computers if      the subject of the surveillance demonstrates an intent to      evade the surveillance. It is absolutely essential to provide      this ability to investigators due to the advanced technology      employed by criminal and terrorism networks and conspirators.      The failure to reauthorize this provision of the Patriot Act      or encumber the provision with restrictions would jeopardize      the importance of this valuable investigative tool.       The lone wolf provision, Section 6001 of the Intelligence      Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, provides the      FISA Court with the authority to approve surveillance of non-     U.S. persons acting alone or not linked to a foreign entity      who are engaged in international terrorism or activities in      preparation of terrorist acts. The lone wolf provision      provides law enforcement with an important tool to obtain      necessary information to prevent dangerous terrorist acts      from occurring. The Society strongly encourages Congress not      to allow this provision to expire or place restrictions on      the provision that would weaken this vital investigative      tool.       The Society respects and appreciates your leadership on      these important issues. As former and current Special Agents      of the FBI, our members are very concerned with any changes      to the Patriot Act that would make it more difficult for the      FBI and other Federal law enforcement agencies to investigate      terrorists and their threats to our nation. We urge Congress      to reauthorize the expiring provisions of the Patriot Act      permanently and without restrictions as the three expiring      provisions are essential to the security of our country.           Sincerely,                                                  Lester A. Davis,                                                        President.
