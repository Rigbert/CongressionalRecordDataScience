 What would happen if we added a new section to the second-degree amendment that is pending at the desk, stating something like this:  ``The President may retain or impose sanctions covered by this bill, sections (B) and (C), if he determines that retaining or imposing such sanctions would further U.S. national security interests.''  I had thought about listing some of the concerns that the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator from Florida have indicated, but I thought better of that, and put a blanket situation here--U.S. national security interests. Obviously, the export of terrorism would be included. Obviously, I think, some of the concerns that have been raised by the Senator from Florida would be included.  Would the Senator be amenable to considering something like that?
