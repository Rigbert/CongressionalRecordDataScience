 Once we are past those amendments, we have a number of other important issues to be debated and hopefully scheduled for votes. Senator Hutchison, for example, has one on health care lawsuits, Senator Portman on unfunded mandates, Senator Brown on withholding payments, Senator DeMint has an amendment on the death tax and the renewable fuels standards. In addition, our ranking member and manager, Senator Inhofe, has a couple of amendments as well.  I will be talking to the majority leader during the next votes to see how we can begin to schedule votes on these and other amendments that may need to be considered before we move to final passage.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
