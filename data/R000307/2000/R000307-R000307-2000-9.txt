President, I commend his remarks to all Senators and more especially all staff in both the House and Senate. It captures that special relationship--the analogy might be--my boss, right or wrong--my boss. In the case of Herb Bateman and Dave Scandling the rightness of their work was 100 percent--there was no wrong.  In closing, I would like to quote Helen Steiner Rice to Laura Bateman, to the family, to the staff, and to the friends and constituents of Herb Bateman, my friend.     When I must leave you for a little while,     Please go on bravely with a gallant smile     And for my sake and in my name,     Live on and do all things the same--     Spend not your life in empty days,     But fill each waking hour in useful ways--     Reach out your hand in comfort and in cheer,     And I in turn will comfort you and hold you near.  I would be happy to yield to the distinguished Senator from Virginia.
