Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Fire Chief Dave Carlson for his dedicated service to our country and our community. Mr. Carlson recently retired as the Fire Chief of the city of Riverside, California. He has protected our citizens as a warrior and fireman over a 39-year career in public service.  Dave grew up in Sacramento and graduated from Luther Burbank High School in 1966. Two weeks later he enlisted in the Navy to pursue his childhood dream of becoming a ``frogman.'' Dave graduated from Underwater Demolition/SEAL training and went on to serve two tours of duty in Vietnam. In 1972 he became a firefighter in Santa Barbara County, California. Dave worked his way through the ranks and became a Battalion Chief in 1981. Constantly striving for self improvement, Dave attended college on his days off. He earned a Bachelor's Degree in Public Service Management and a Master's Degree in Public Administration from the University of La Verne. In 1991, Dave became the Fire Chief in the City of Norco, California. In 1994, he became the Deputy Fire Chief of the City of Riverside and in 1996 he was appointed Fire Chief.  Dave Carlson is always looking for innovative ways to provide better public safety service to the community. In 1999 he implemented a paramedic program through a joint partnership with American Medical Response and the Riverside County Medical Services Agency. This partnership resulted in a higher level of emergency care and faster emergency response at no cost to the City of Riverside's general fund.  Throughout his career, Dave has served in professional and public organizations. He has always been active in the California Fire Chiefs' Organization, serving a two-year term as President from 2000 to 2002. He is also the Chair of the Department of Corrections Citizens' Advisory Committee for the California Rehabilitation Center. In 2004, Dave's accomplishments were justly recognized when he received the Distinguished Public Service Career Award from the City of Riverside and was named the ``Fire Chief of the Year'' by the California Fire Chiefs' Association.  Fire Chiefs such as Dave Carlson provide a remarkable level of protection to our communities. They work just as hard at preventing fires and accidents as they do in responding to them. Dave has had an exceptional career keeping our community safe. He has earned my many thanks and I wish him great success in all his future endeavors.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E1155]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]TRIBUTE TO DAVE CARLSON ON THE OCCASION OF HIS RETIREMENT FROM THE CITY                       OF RIVERSIDE FIRE DEPARTMENT                                 ______                                                             HON.
