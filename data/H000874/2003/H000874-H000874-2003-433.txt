 The energy bill, Mr. Leader, do you have a pretty good estimate as to which day of the week that bill might come to the floor?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman would yield, as the gentleman knows, this is a very complicated piece of legislation that has had at least four committees consider. All four committees have reported, and we have to get together with the minority to pull this bill together and bring it to the floor, and we hope to schedule that bill for some time on Wednesday; if not Wednesday, on Thursday of next week.
