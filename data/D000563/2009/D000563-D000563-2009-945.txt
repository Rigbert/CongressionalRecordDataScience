President, I want to make my comments about the minority leader's statement on the floor while he is still here. If he is willing to stay, we can engage in a dialog on this issue. I think it is time we do come to the floor together, along with the Republican whip, and at least make it clear what our positions are on some of these issues related to Guantanamo because it has been a matter of concern and a lot of comment on the floor of the Senate over the last several weeks.  I was going to ask the Senator from Kentucky, the minority leader, whether I understood him correctly when he said he believed that this individual, Ahmed Ghailani, if found not guilty in a court in the United States, would be released in the United States to stay here in a legal status. I wish to ask the Senator, if that is what he said, what is the basis for that statement?
