President, I rise today to commend Tom and Sally Fegley, owners and operators of the award-winning Tom and Sally's Handmade Chocolates. For over a decade, Tom and Sally have been making world-class chocolates at their Brattleboro, VT, facility.  Leaving corporate positions in New York, the Fegleys started anew in Vermont with the dream of making high quality chocolate. Starting in 1989, with little knowledge of the chocolate business, the Fegleys volunteered their time as apprentices with a Jersey City chocolatier. After learning the trade, the Fegleys remodeled a vacant warehouse in downtown Brattleboro to house their new business. Through trial and error over the years, the Fegleys have developed and perfected their superb technique for making fine chocolates. Their diligence, passion, and entrepreneurial spirit have been richly rewarded.  Tom and Sally's Handmade Chocolates is a true Vermont company. While building their business, the Fegleys have remained involved in their community, allowing school groups and tourists alike to visit their facility and learn about the chocolate-making business. Moreover, their efforts are incredibly innovative, incorporating traditional techniques for making fine chocolates with novelty packaging and light-hearted humor. No doubt, their success can be attributed as much to their creativity as to their business savvy. And with their long commitment to producing the best chocolate possible, they've brought their chocolates to the world through the Internet at www.tomandsallys.com.  Thirteen national awards and 1.5 million chocolate cow pies later, the Fegleys continue to make their amazing hand-crafted chocolate in Brattleboro. I am proud that my home State of Vermont has attracted and produced such outstanding entrepreneurs as the Fegleys.  I ask that a December article from the Rutland Herald be printed in the Record.  The article follows:                [From the Rutland Herald, Dec. 23, 2001]                         Chocolates and Laughs    at tom and sally's handmade, the sweets are sprinkled with humor                            (By Ellen Ogden)       Most people will eat sweets any time of the year; but in      the high spirit of the holidays, it would be tempting, if      only it were big enough, to dive into a box of chocolates.      Especially the handmade kind: hand-dipped and decorated with      crystallized violets or fancy fillings, packaged as if each      bite were a piece of gold. A joy to the eyes as well as the      taste buds.       Chocolate is such a treat, you would think anyone who makes      it for a living would have fun. ``Truth is,'' says Sally      Fegley, co-owner with her husband Tom of Tom and Sally's      Handmade Chocolates, ``many fancy chocolatiers take      themselves way too seriously.'' Making world class chocolate      involves more than just a devotion to the art. It requires      expensive packaging and a marketing plan to match. But the      Fegleys have learned how to play up the pleasurable side of      making chocolate.       Tom and Sally's Handmade Chocolates are the best in their      class--they've won 13 national awards--but many of their      products are packaged in silly ways. For example, their best      selling item is a chocolate cow pie, a loosely formed plop of      rich Belgian chocolate mixed with a handful of nuts. The idea      came to Tom one morning while shaving and they've sold over      1.5 million of these pies, expanding on the line to include a      range of over 50 other animals. There are moose pies with      almonds, sheep pies with hazelnuts and elephant pies with      peanuts.       The irony is that Tom and Sally's Handmade Chocolates set      out in 1989 to make serious chocolate. ``We left high paying      corporate jobs to move to Vermont and make chocolate,''      explains Sally. Dressed in a floppy white chef hat, blonde      hair curling out from around the sides and large gold hoop      earrings, Sally Fegley laughs easily. Her buoyancy seems      consistent with the delightful chocolate aroma that fills the      air of their 11,000-square-foot warehouse. She and Tom are      wearing matching outfits, white chef top with a chocolate      brown apron, each with their names spelled out in big      letters.       At age 42, they were too young for retirement, but they      knew they wanted to live in Vermont. It is a classic story of      a couple seeking a career change. They knew they would make a      good team. They also shared a love of good chocolate. ``We      were convinced that there was no one in the U.S. who was      making first-rate chocolate and we were determined to be      the first,'' says Sally. While still holding their      corporate jobs, they devoted a year to market research.      They read, consumed and visited every chocolate venue      around New York City.       And since they trained in corporate America, they are      highly organized and goal oriented. ``From the time we left      our jobs and moved to Vermont, we gave ourselves three months      to find a building, build the inventory and open the store      doors,'' says Sally. Reading and eating chocolate is one      thing, but actually making it was something else. They needed      hands-on experience before the big move. They offered      themselves as volunteers to several chocolate makers around      New York to obtain some form of basic training. But they were      rejected until they looked beyond the city, and found a      three-generation family-run chocolatier in Jersey City who      agreed to let them in on some secrets. The both began an      apprenticeship to learn about chocolate.       Everything was moving along like clockwork. They left Wall      Street where she worked at Bank of America and he was at      Metropolitan Life. They found a vacant building at 6 Harmony      Place in Brattleboro, formerly a bar and electricians'      warehouse. ``Right up until the opening day, every batch of      chocolate we made failed,'' confesses Sally. It is clear she      has told this story many times. Now that they have been in      business for over a decade and have won those awards, it is      easier to admit to early problems. ``It was still perfectly      edible and delicious, but no matter what we did, the      chocolate kept coming out gray and streaky.''       Before a chocolatier can mold the chocolate, the chocolate      must be melted or tempered. This breaks the crystals and the      butterfat; but it must be done at an exact temperature that      matches the original chocolate. What the Fegleys had learned      to make in Jersey City was based on a domestic chocolate,      while what they selected for their Brattleboro operation was      a premier Belgian brand, Callebaut. This brand has a more      finicky tempering habit and wasn't responding to their      learned methods.       ``To me, having your own business means trying on all the      knowledge and all the skills you've learned in your entire      life,'' relates Sally, who called upon an eighth grade      science class when the couple had to set up an experiment      involving an empirical method and deduction. They set up the      marble tables with candy-making trays and thermometers and      filled each while keeping close tabs on the temperature and      the procedure. They finally determined that the thermometers      they were using had different calibrations. ``Each batch was      off by as little as two degrees, but this made all the      difference.''       They are now so confident of their method that they offer      educational tours of the process to the public every day.      Located five miles north of Brattleboro on Rt. 30, Tom and      Sally's is a favorite site for school children who arrive by      the busload. It is a pristine facility, with an open floor      plan and     overhead signs explaining every step of the production. Large      picture windows allow natural light, while a dozen employees      are busy at the production and packing stations.       A typical tour begins in the back of the room, at the nine      vats of melting milk, dark and white chocolate. Each vat      holds between 125 pounds and 200 pounds of what many consider      to be the finest chocolate in the world. Tom, the master of      the production , is stationed at one marble table cutting      slabs of caramel and marshmallow that will be combined into a      layered candy and then hand dipped in dark chocolate. This,      his favorite concoction, is dubbed Miss American Pie.       Sally explains that there are basically three methods of      making Tom and Sally's Handmade Chocolates. They begin with      shell molds, trays of high-grade plastic with decorative      depressions. The molds are filled with liquid chocolate. Each      chocolate piece is hand filled and hand painted, then cooled      before another step in the process. It is an exceedingly      skilled and time-consuming process. ``The molds are imported      from Europe,'' says Sally. ``And they cost $22 apiece. We      have hundreds of them.'' The molds, as are all of their      equipment and inventory items, clearly labeled and neatly      stacked according to the design motif. The high-end      confections that result from this molding process sell for      $34 per pound, about a dollar each.       A more mechanized method is done on what Sally loves to      call the ``I LOVE LUCY'' machine. It is otherwise known as an      enrober, a conveyor belt with a series of ``waterfalls''      allowing a cascade of chocolate during which each piece of      fruit, creme or chocolate filling is given a chocolate      coating. ``Remember the `I Love Lucy' segment?'' says Sally      with a wide smile. ``Where Lucy and Ethel reverse roles with      Ricky and Fred? They take a job at a chocolate factory,'' she      explains in vivid detail. Unfortunately, the conveyor belt      starts running too fast and they have to determine what to do      with all the chocolate. ``There is little choice but to fill      their mouths, stuff their pockets and hide chocolate in their      shirts in a vain attempt to keep up with the output of the      enrobing machine,'' says Sally. This skit encapsulates      Sally's fondness for the machine--a comedy routine that      reflects her own fun with chocolate.       Finally there is the funneling method, and this is where      the cow pies fit into the story. Using a large metal funnel      filled with warm, tempered chocolate and equipped with a      wooden stopper, two-ounce globs of chocolate are ``plopped''      onto a marble table. It is cooled and hardened into a solid      mound of chocolate, and then packaged in a clear plastic bag      with a catchy novelty tag that describes the contents in a      whimsical way. The cow pies began outselling the truffles.       Each year Tom and Sally do something new to make chocolate      lovers laugh. In fact they are so good at the marketing that      they've had to trademark everything to prevent other      companies from using their ideas. ``We just spent many      thousands of dollars protecting our trademark on Chocolate      Body Paint,'' says Tom, of a product that originated as a gag      present for the president of the local Rotary Club. Packaged      with a paint brush, the label on the treat reads ``heat to      98.6 and apply liberally.'' It is essentially a delicious      chocolate fudge sauce for ice cream, but the name was catchy      and it sells the product.       While making the best chocolate in the world is still their      goal, Sally admits that their typical customer is more      interested in the funny packaging. Most of their novelty      chocolates are sold wholesale to over 8,000 stores across the      United States. ``Our niche in the world of chocolate is that      we are creative,'' says Sally. ``The best thing about having      our own business is that we have the freedom to be      creative,'' she adds. ``Can you imagine trying to get      approval to make something like chocolate cow pies in a      corporate world?''                          ____________________
