 President, the most important issue brought to the front page in the last 2 days is the state of the new ObamaCare law.  Two and a half years ago, President Obama teamed up with Democrats right here in Congress to pass a health care bill they knew most Americans didn't want. Americans have been very clear about what they thought of this bill. So Democrats settled on a deeply dishonest sales pitch aimed at convincing them otherwise.  Nearly every day since then, the promises that formed the very heart of that sales pitch have been exposed for the false promises they were.  Americans were promised lower health care costs. But, of course, they are going up. Americans were promised lower premiums, and they are going up. Seniors were promised Medicare would be protected; it was raided to pay for a new entitlement instead. We were promised it would create jobs; CBO predicts it will lead to 800,000 fewer jobs because of ObamaCare. People were promised they could keep the plans they liked; millions have now learned they cannot.  For 2 years, the list of broken promises has grown longer and longer and longer.  But yesterday morning, we got powerful confirmation of what may have been the biggest deception of all. For years, the President and his Democratic allies in Congress have sworn up and down--sworn up and down--that failing to comply with the individual mandate did not result in a tax on individuals or families. ``It is not a tax,'' they said.
