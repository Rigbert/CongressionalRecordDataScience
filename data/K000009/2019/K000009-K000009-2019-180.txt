Speaker, I rise to praise this House for its swift passage of H.J. Res 46, a bipartisan bill to terminate President Trump's declaration of a Fake National Emergency.  The President's declaration is not only an unconstitutional attempt to circumvent Congress and the will of the people. It also shows an unprecedented disregard for precedent, as well as the values and institutions enshrined in our Constitution.  To pay for his wall, President Trump will not get the funds from Mexico as he promised but from our troops, robbing $3.5 billion from the Department of Defense, funds which were passed to improve military family housing, training facilities, security of overseas bases, and much more.  Just in Ohio, over $90 million in military construction investment is being placed at risk, including $61,000,000 for Wright-Patterson Air Force Base's Intelligence Production Complex and $7,400,000 for Camp Ravenna's Automated Multipurpose Machine Gun Range.  Mr. Speaker, this declaration was not founded in the security of our nation, but in delivering on an ill-advised campaign promise. We cannot allow the President to ask those who have sacrificed already to sacrifice even more--especially for an expensive border wall few think will even work. Now, it's on the Senate to take up and pass this resolution without delay.                          ____________________
