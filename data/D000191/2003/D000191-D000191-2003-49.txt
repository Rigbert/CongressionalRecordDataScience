  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, today the House will vote to borrow $87 billion to continue the conflict in Iraq and build and revitalize the Iraqi economy. They say it is necessary to support the troops. It is not for dearth of funds that our troops lack ceramic body armor or armored Humvees and other essentials. There are ample, unspent funds, billions from the $79 billion we borrowed for this war last April, but it is bureaucratic incompetence, indifference and intransigence at the Pentagon. Secretary Rumsfeld and his advisors did not order armor because they did not think that we would need it, and they could never admit they were wrong. It did not fit their scenario.  They say it is necessary for the security of the American people that we are going to borrow $20 billion in the name of working Americans to invest and stimulate the Iraqi economy, to build their infrastructure, roads, bridges, highways, state of the art telecommunications, sewer and electric.  Well, it is not going to boost our economy here at home, and that is the security that my constituents and most Members' constituents are worried about. If we invest in the economy as the Democrats have advised, it would provide 1 million jobs for Americans.                          ____________________
