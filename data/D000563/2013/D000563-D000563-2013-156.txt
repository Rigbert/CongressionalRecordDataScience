President, through the Chair, since the Senator from Louisiana has raised on the floor many times the issue of the health insurance of Members of Congress, I would volunteer that I am under the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program, some 8 million Federal employees, including Members of Congress and their staff, are currently under the same health insurance program across the Nation.  I have the same health insurance policy as the park ranger at the Lincoln home in Springfield, IL. I would ask the Senator from Louisiana: What is your health insurance policy?
