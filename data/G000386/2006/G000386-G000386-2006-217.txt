 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a brave American who has made the ultimate sacrifice in service to our country. LCpl William Leusink died on May 22 when he struck an improvised explosive device while on a dismounted patrol in the Al Anbar Province in Iraq. Lance Corporal Leusink was a marine who was assigned to the Marine Corps Base in Kaneohe Bay, HI. He was 21 years old.  I would ask that all Americans join me today, and add to the more than 1,100 Iowans who attended his funeral, in remembering and honoring Lance Corporal Leusink. The loss of this courageous and patriotic American is felt throughout Iowa and in particular the town of Maurice where he grew up and graduated from Sioux Center High School. My thoughts and prayers are with Lance Corporal Leusink's wife, Miranda, his parents, Bill and Elaine, his brother and two sisters as well as all those other family and friends who are grieving the loss of this young man.  Lance Corporal Leusink, who I understand was known as ``B. Jay'' among family and friends, will be remembered for his faith, athleticism, and patriotism. His faith was especially important to him. Just as he often took with him to the football field his favorite verse, Phillipians 4:13, written on tape, it was this faith that led him to enlist to serve his country.  Pastor Wayne Sneller of the First Reformed Church of Maurice said, ``B. Jay always wanted to be a Marine and to serve his country. He believed in what he was doing and knew that the Lord was going to be with him.''  In an e-mail to the pastor, Lance Corporal Leusink had written, ``I know where I am going. I enlisted for a reason, and that was to make a difference.''  We owe a huge debt of gratitude to Lance Corporal Leusink for his sacrifice. I am greatly saddened by his passing but deeply proud and grateful for what he gave for America. His loss remains tragic but he died a true patriot.                          ____________________[Pages S5424-S5425]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES                   Lance Corporal William Jay Leusink
