Some argue that this language was not necessary, that the McCain amendment, which passed 90 to 9, made it clear that whether you are in uniform or not torture is not the policy of the United States. Others argue that the Geneva Conventions had already made that clear for decades before it was brought into question by this administration.  I ask the Senator from North Dakota if he struggles with the same thought that I do. At some point after World War II, we prosecuted Japanese soldiers who tortured American prisoners of war using waterboarding and charged them with war crimes; and we are now at a point in our history, some 60 years later, where General Hayden testifies under oath before Congress that our Nation engaged in the same conduct, at least three times previously, when it came to waterboarding. I wonder if the Senator from North Dakota struggles with the same concept of justice as was applied after World War II and as it appears to be applied by this administration?
