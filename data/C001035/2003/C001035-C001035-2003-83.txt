President, the people of Maine have always been faithful stewards of their forest lands because we understand and appreciate its tremendous value to our economy and to our way of life.  From the vast tracts of undeveloped land in the north, to the small woodlots in the south, forest land has helped to shape the character and the heritage of my State.  While our commitment to stewardship has preserved the forests for generations, there is a new and troubling thereat to Maine's forest lands that requires a fresh approach. This threat is suburban sprawl. It has already consumed tens of thousands of acres of forest land in the southern part of my State. Sprawl occurs because the economic value of forests or crop land cannot compete with the value of developed land.  This problem is particularly acute in southern Maine where there has been more than a 100-percent increase in urbanized sprawl over the past two decades. This has resulted in the labeling of the greater Portland area as the ``sprawl capital of the Northeast.''  I am alarmed by the amount of working forest land and open space in southern and coastal Maine that has given way to strip malls and cul-de-sacs. Our State is working to respond to this challenge because once that land is paved over, it is gone forever. Those forest lands and those small woodlots are lost forever once that land is developed.  The people of Maine in response to this concern have approved a $50 million bond issue to preserve land through the Land for Maine's Future Board. They have also worked hard supporting local efforts to preserve open space. And they have contributed their time, their energy, and their money to the work done by our State's 88 land trusts.  The people of my State are dedicated to preserving our working forests and protecting our communities from sprawl. It is now time for the FederalGovernment to lend a helping hand in support of those efforts.  Today, I am introducing the Suburban Community Forestry and Open Space Act. This legislation, which was drafted with the advice of landowners, conservation groups, and the Maine State Forester, establishes a $50 million grant program within the U.S. Forest Service to support locally driven projects that will preserve our working forests. Local governments and nonprofit organizations would compete for funds to purchase land outright or to buy conservation easements to keep the forest land threatened by development in their traditional use.  Projects funded under this legislation must be targeted at lands located in parts of the country that are threatened by sprawl. The legislation requires that Federal funds be matched dollar for dollar by State, local, or private resources so that it is a true partnership to preserve this open space and working forests.  This grant program would help to promote sustainable forestry as well as public access to our forest lands. My legislation protects the rights of property owners with the inclusion of a ``willing seller'' provision, which requires the consent of a landowner if a parcel of land is eligible to participate in the program.  The grant program would also allow nonprofits and municipalities, but not the Federal Government, to hold title to the land or the easements purchased under this program. The $50 million is a modest amount but it would help to achieve a number of stewardship objectives.  First, my legislation would help prevent forest fragmentation and preserve our working forests, helping to maintain the supply of timber that fuels Maine most significant industry.  Second, the resources made available by my legislation would be a valuable tool for communities that are struggling to manage growth and prevent sprawl. Currently, if a community trying to cope with the effects of sprawl turns to the Federal Government for help, they would find that no assistance is available.  The Forest Legacy Program, which has been critical in preserving undeveloped forest land in my State and many others, is really not suitable for the kinds of projects my bill envisions. My bill would change that by making the Federal Government an active partner in preserving forest lands and managing sprawl, while leaving the decisionmaking at the State and local level where it belongs.  Last year, this legislation was included in the forestry title of the Senate-approved version of the farm bill which passed this Senate by a vote of 58-40. Unfortunately, the forestry title was stripped out of the farm bill conference report, despite bipartisan support for provisions such as my legislation.  There is a great deal that needs to be done to protect our working forests for the next generation. I believe the legislation I am reintroducing today will help advance that goal. I am grateful for the support of many of the people and organizations that are leading the effort to support this legislation. By enacting the Suburban and Community Forestry and Open Space Act, Congress can provide a real boost to local conservation initiatives, help prevent sprawl, and help sustain the vitality of natural resource-based industries.  Mr. President, I would like to submit for the Record several letters of support for my legislation. They are from the National Association of State Foresters, the New England Forestry Foundation, The Trust for Public Land, and the Pacific Forest Trust. I ask unanimous consent that those letters of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              National Association                                           of State Foresters,                                     Washington, DC, June 5, 2003.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the National Association      of State Foresters, I would like to thank you for your      efforts to reduce the impacts of urban and suburban sprawl on      private and tribal forestlands in the U.S. Your bill to      protect Suburban and Community Forestry and Open Space      demonstrates your commitment to minimizing conversion of      suburban forestlands to nonforest uses. Maintaining working      forests in suburban environments is consistent with the goals      of NASF, and we appreciate your efforts to develop a program      that can be implemented by the States.       As the USDA Forest Service's Southern Forest Resource      Assessment clearly demonstrates, one of the major threats to      forestland is urban sprawl. The provisions in Section 1 of      your bill will enable private landowners to keep their land      in trees and sustain the public benefits that their forests      provide. Your bill provides another tool to address this      critical concern.       Thank you for your commitment to sustainable forest      management and to reducing suburban sprawl. We look forward      to continuing our work with you on the details of the entire      bill.           Sincerely,                                          James L. Sledge, Jr,     President.                                  ____                                                       New England                                          Forestry Foundation,                                                     June 3, 2003.     Senator Susan M. Collins,     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: The New England Forestry Foundation      applauds Senator Collins' leadership and initiative in      sponsoring the Suburban and Community Forestry and Open Space      Program, designed to help towns and communities across      America's suburban landscape combat sprawl, and preserve open      space. This legislative package is exactly what is needed to      provide an incentive for local governments and land trusts      across the country to unite and partner to address an issue      of national importance.       Congratulations!           Sincerely,                                                         Amos Eno,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                    The Trust for Public Land,                                         Boston, MA, June 4, 2003.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the Trust for Public      Land, I am pleased to express our support for the Suburban      and Community Forestry and Open Space Act. This legislation      will provide a much-needed focus on working forests that      provide important resources in and around Maine's towns and      cities that are facing significant development pressures. We      applaud your foresight in addressing this issue.       As the Trust for Public Land pursues its mission of      protecting land for people in Maine, we are acutely aware of      the difficult choices many landowners face as land values      rise and development pressures intensify. The forest lands      that lie in the path of development are incredibly important      to local residents for a variety of resources, including      recreation, wildlife habitat, water quality and open space.      The Suburban and Community Forestry and Open Space Act will      allow these critical lands to remain intact as community      assets by focusing federal assistance to landowners in areas      affected by suburban sprawl. This is a much-needed addition      to the resource conservation efforts that states, localities      and non-governmental partners are already undertaking and      will provide the extra funding leverage needed to      successfully meet the challenges of the future.       Our work with willing sellers across the state leads us to      believe that your legislation will provide new resource      protection opportunities for many Maine communities that will      leave them in good shape for future generations. Maine's      forest resources are absolutely critical to ensuring a decent      quality of life for residents and visitors alike, and      proposals like yours will ensure that we address the      conservation of those resources wisely.       Thank you for your leadership on this and many other issues      affecting Maine. We look forward to working with you on this      legislation and for the long-term protection of Maine's      outstanding natural resources.           Sincerely,                                                    Whitney Hatch,     Regional Director.                                  ____                                                     June 3, 2003.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: The Pacific Forrest Trust (PFT)      strongly supports your proposed legislation, which will      encourage and facilitate the preservation of our nation's      privately owned forestlands. Your amendment to the Forest      Legacy Program will increase the flexibility of states in the      administration of the Program, which will, in turn, lead to      greater preservation of private forestland.       For over ten years, PFT, a non-profit organization, has      worked to preserve, restore and enhance the privately owned      productive forestlands in the United States. We currently      hold roughly 35,000 acres under easement and have been      instrumental in ensuring the preservation of private land      valued at over $115,000,000. We have provided oral and      written testimony to Congress regarding proposed policies to      protect and enhance our private forestlands and have written      extensively on this issue.       The legislation is critical to the preservation of private      forestlands throughout the     United States. Between 1982 and 1997, the United States lost      over 20 million acres of private forestlands to other uses.      States as diverse as California and Georgia have lost over      60,000 acres annually to development alone. Similar      statistics are reflected among privately owned forestland in      other areas of the United States, especially in the most      productive timber areas.       The amendment to the Forest Legacy Program will provide      states with the option to permit qualified non-profit      organizations, such as land trusts, to hold easements that      are purchased, in part or in whole, with Forest Legacy funds.      Currently, land trusts may only hold easements through Forest      Legacy if such easements are donated. Thus, this amendment      will give states the opportunity and flexibility to expand      their pool of landowners participating in the Program and as      a result, protect more private forestlands.       While many landowners acknowledge the need to preserve      their forestlands, they are not comfortable having a      governmental agency own a partial interest in their property,      which is the current requirement of the Program where the      easements are purchased. This amendment enables landowners to      work with a private, voluntary qualified land trust      organization at the option of the state. At the same time,      states retain full decision-making control over the selection      of Forest Legacy projects.       Furthermore, this legislation will provide essential      flexibility for states to work with partner organizations      that can often leverage additional funding into Forest Legacy      projects. It will open the door so that many more landowners      can participate in the Program nationwide and therefore, will      expand the opportunity to reverse the trend of forestland      loss.       Thank you for your continued leadership in private      forestland conservation. This is necessary and timely      legislation.           Sincerely,                                                Laurie A. Wayburn,                              President, The Pacific Forest Trust.                                 ______                                       By
