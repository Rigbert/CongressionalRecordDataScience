 Bennett, and Mr. Dorgan):  S. 1335. A bill to provide for the protection of the flag of the United States and free speech, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.            the flag protection and free speech act of 1995 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senator Bennett and Senator Dorgan, I am introducing a bill to outlaw the desecration of the American flag.  Flag burning is a despicable act. And we should have zero tolerance for those who deface our flag. Make no mistake about it--I am disgusted by those who desecrate our symbol of freedom, under which so many men and women, including my father, have gone into battle in order to preserve our way of life.  Many patriotic Americans believe that we need a Constitutional amendment to ban flag burning. The Supreme Court has rejected laws which have attempted to ban flag burning, finding such laws to be in conflict with the first amendment's protection of free speech. So, the supporters of the Constitutional amendment argue that the only way to get it done right is to change the Constitution.  Flag burners must be punished for their vile behavior. But the precedent of amending the Bill of Rights is a dangerous one. I fear that if we amend the first amendment this year, soon the fifth amendment's protection of private property rights or the second amendment's protection of the right to bear arms, will be under assault.  So, I have been searching for an alternative which will result in the swift and certain punishment for those who commit the contemptible act of defacing the flag, but leave the first amendment untouched.  This bill achieves those purposes. The deviants who burn the flag do so to provoked or incite patriotic Americans. And, it is well established that fighting words or speech which incites lawlessness is not protected by the first amendment. My bill provides for imprisoning and fining those who damage a flag intending to incite a breach of the peace. It also punishes anyone who steals a flag belonging to the Federal Government or a flag displayed on Federal property.  This bill will get the job done without tampering with the first amendment. There have been well-respected conservative voices who have cautioned against amending the first amendment to ban flag burning, including George Will, Charles Krauthammer, Cal Thomas, Bruce Fein. But perhaps the most compelling words have come from Jim Warner, a patriot and hero who fought in Vietnam and survived more than 5 years of torture and brutality as a prisoner or war:       We don't need to amend the Constitution in order to punish      those who burn our flag. They burn the flag because they hate      America and they are afraid of freedom. What better way to      hurt them than with the subversive idea of freedom? Spread      freedom. [When a] flag in Dallas was burned to protest the      nomination of Ronald Reagan, . . . he told us how to spread      the idea of freedom when he said that we should turn America      into a ``city shining on a hill, a light to all nations.''      Don't be afraid of freedom, it is the best weapon wee have.  I hope my colleagues will study this bill and consider it, as we approach the significant debate on a Constitutional amendment to ban flag desecration.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1335       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Flag Protection and Free      Speech Act of 1995''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--       (1) the Flag of the United States is a unique symbol of      national unity and represents the values of liberty, justice,      and equality that make this Nation an example of freedom      unmatched throughout the world;       (2) the Bill of Rights is a guarantee of those freedoms and      should not be amended in a manner that could be interpreted      to restrict freedom, a course that is regularly resorted to      by authoritarian governments which fear freedom and not by      free and democratic nations;       (3) abuse of the flag of the United States causes more than      pain and distress to the overwhelming majority of the      American people and may amount to fighting words or a direct      threat to the physical and emotional well-being of      individuals at whom the threat is targeted; and       (4) destruction of the flag of the United States can be      intended to incite a violent response rather than make a      political statement and such conduct is outside the      protections afforded by the first amendment to the Unites      States Constitution.       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to provide the      maximum protection against the use of the flag of the United      States to promote violence while respecting the liberties      that it symbolizes.
