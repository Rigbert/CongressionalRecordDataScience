President, I followed the Senator's statement. I am glad she made this a part of the Record. I hope she believes, as I do, that the chair of this important Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Murray, has included very valuable language in this legislation which will establish some standards once and for all in terms of Mexican trucks coming across the border into the United States.  I would like to ask the Senator from California the following question. Recently, the Ambassador of Mexico came to my office and we talked about the truck issue. I said to him: Will your country, Mexico, agree that whatever trucks you send across the borders and whatever truckdrivers you send across the borders, they will meet the same standards of safety and competence as American trucks and American drivers? He said: Yes, we will agree to that standard.  I ask the Senator from California, based on the experience in California, whether that has happened, whether or not she has found in the inspection that the drivers and the trucks meet the standard of competency and safety that we require of American trucks and American truckdrivers.
