Those who want to take the side of the financial industry in opposition to this amendment should be held accountable forthe fact that they are turning their backs on consumers. I do not question the motive of any Senator and his vote, but the Senator knows as well as I do how this is lined up: Consumers on one side, banks on the other side.  Let me state what is at stake here are credit practices that no one in the Senate should condone; frankly, no reputable bank or financial institution should condone. If you are a bank or an institution following the law of this Nation, making certain your people issue loans that are reasonable and in compliance with the law, you have nothing to fear from this amendment. But if you are a fly-by-night storefront operation exploiting poor people and the elderly in this country, you bet this amendment makes you nervous, and it should. Because it means that ultimately the bankruptcy court will not be there as your court of last resort.
