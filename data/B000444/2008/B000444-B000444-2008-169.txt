 President, I rise today to offer a few words of appreciation and to say ``Farewell'' to one of the Senate's finest public servants, Marty Paone.  For our visitors in the gallery, and for our viewers on C-SPAN, it may look like Senators are running this place. Mr. President, we know better. We trust dedicated, professional staff like Marty Paone to make sure things get done.  As all of my colleagues know, Marty is the secretary for the majority, and when we were fewer Democrats around here, he was our secretary for the minority. He has held this position for the past 13 years. Before that, he served as the assistant secretary, worked as floor staff and in the cloakroom, going back nearly three decades. In short, Marty has spent close to his entire adult life here on the Senate floor, getting Senators where they need to be, when they are supposed to be there.  To do his job, Marty has to be a combination of traffic cop, diplomat, and parliamentarian--and he has to have the trust of the Senators who follow his direction. Marty has that trust, because he has earned that trust, and because he has all those other skills, too.  I have been here 35 years; it is hard for me to remember a time when Marty wasn't here. And I don't just mean year in and year out. I mean any hour of the day and night. Whenever this place is open for business, Marty has been here, helping to maintain order and to get things done. We are indebted to his many personal sacrifices, when he was here instead of home with his family.  Indeed, it has been hard to get much done around here without relying on Marty's expertise on Senate process. I don't know how he has managed to juggle all the demands on him. He is the ``go to guy'' for help on moving amendments, overcoming objections, getting a place in line for debate, complying with Senate rules, strategizing passing or defeating a measure. If you want to know what is happening ``behind the scenes,'' Marty is the person to look to. There isn't a vote that happens, there isn't a negotiation that takes place, there isn't a unanimous consent agreement--which is what makes this place function--that Marty hasn't helped to piece together or made sure it's done correctly.  And Marty works for each of us. While, technically, he works for the Democrats, I know that many of my Republican colleagues have turned to Marty for guidance. He is known for always being candid and straightforward. He has served us all with his honest counsel--you could always count on him for a straight answer. And, remarkably, he has never lost patience with any of us--no matter what we ask or how often we call.  It is hard to describe to those who haven't spent much time in the Senate how very important Marty Paone has been to the Senate, day-to-day life and historic moments. Mr. President, this is the end of an era. We all hope it will be the beginning of a new one for Marty, away from the heavy responsibilities he has met so well for so long. We wish him well. He will be missed very much.                          ____________________
