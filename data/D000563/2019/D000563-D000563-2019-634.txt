President, there is an issue coming up before the Senate this week which really goes to the heart of this institution and why it exists. The Constitution spells out responsibilities for Congress and specific responsibilities when it comes to this Chamber. The 100 men and women who serve today, among other things, have a responsibility to advise and consent on nominations that have been sent by the President for our consideration. The Constitution assigns the Senate the role of questioning these nominees, of checking into their backgrounds, and then of deciding whether to approve or disapprove their nominations.  Over the past 2 years, we have seen many of the guardrails in this process disappear. For example, the Republican majority has stopped respecting blue slips on circuit court nominations. Blue slips, which are a Senate tradition, say that if a person is nominated to serve on the circuit court, which is the second highest court in the land, the Senators from the State within which that person would serve would decide with a thumbs up or a thumbs down as to whether the nomination will go forward--the so-called blue slip. For a number of years now, that has been the U.S. Senate's standard practice, its tradition. The Republican majority has decided to stop the blue-slip process when it comes to circuit court nominations.  It also has stopped moving bipartisan board and commission nominations in pairs. We used to say: We have a more trusting relationship if you get your Republican nominee and if we get our Democratic nominee. Let's do it together. That used to ensure that both parties would be equally represented on important Agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to name a few.       Now we have a rules change before us that is being proposed      by the Republican side of the aisle--again changing the      rights of Senators by limiting the debate time on      nominations. This would further tilt the balance of power      away from the Senate, away from Congress, and back towards      1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the Executive. It runs the risk, of      course, of diminishing our constitutional responsibility.  When it comes to executive branch nominations, this administration has had a different approach than what we have seen before. We have a President who says he likes to have administration officials serve in an acting capacity.  In January, President Trump said:       I sort of like acting. It gives me more flexibility. Do you      understand that? I like acting.  Given that approach, perhaps it is no surprise that we have seen long delays in filling leadership positions in important Agencies and ambassadorial posts. We have also seen the highest rate of turnover in modern time with these administration positions. People aren't placed in these positions, and if they are, they are looking for the exit way too soon.  We also have suffered from a lack of proper vetting and examination of a person's background before a nomination is approved, and we have seen a lack of bipartisan cooperation in moving board nominations when there is supposed to be an equal number of Democrats and Republicans. Despite that, we are trying to do the work we were assigned by the Constitution to advise and consent.  If the majority wants to move Executive nominations faster, it can do what all administrations have done in the past and start working with the minority to negotiate packages of nominees. As long as I have been here, that has been done by the leaders of both political parties--fair, bipartisan packages of Executive nominees who have been well vetted. None of us wants the embarrassment of putting a person in the position for which one is not qualified or when there is any question of one's ethical standards. That bipartisanwork can lead to less debate time on the floor if we agree at the outset to work together.  I am particularly opposed to the Republican proposal before us to shorten the time for debate on President Trump's nominees who will serve lifetime appointments in Federal district court. Imagine serving a lifetime appointment on a court--beyond this administration--and making day-to-day decisions, some fundamental to the criminal justice system and some to the civil justice system.  We understand what is really going on here. We understand when the other side says we are obstructing it from confirming judges. The facts don't tell the same story. In fact, my Republican colleagues have been bragging for months about what Senator McConnell called the ``record number'' of judges the Senate has confirmed under this new President Trump.  In President Trump's first 2 years in office, the Senate confirmed 85 article III judges. During the first 2 years of President Obama's Presidency, it was 62. Eighty-five to sixty-two. The number of judges confirmed in the last Congress was nearly four times as many as the number confirmed under President Obama in the previous Congress.  The pace of judicial nominations and confirmations has been extremely fast. So why are the Republicans now pushing for a change to the Senate rules to make it even faster? It is not like the Senate has been busy with legislation here on the floor.  Senator McConnell had a moment of candor last November after the election.  He said:       I think we'll have probably more time for nominations in      the next Congress than we've had in this one. . . . I don't      think we'll have any trouble finding time to do nominations.       Senator McConnell, McClatchy News, November 7, 2018.  Of course, Senator McConnell was frustrated that one Senator put a blanket hold on judicial nominees at the end of last year, and he expressed his frustration publicly. That Senator, incidentally, was not a Democrat; he was Republican Senator Flake of Arizona.  It seems the real reason the Republicans want to change the rules now on district court nominations is so, in the words of Senator McConnell, they can ``plow right through'' with confirming nominees whose records and views are incomplete or extreme.  The reality is that all too often, these judicial nominees just don't stand up to scrutiny. Already, under President Trump, we have had six judicial nominations in which the American Bar Association's peer-review process found these nominees sent by President Trump to be ``not qualified.'' I might add that there were no--zero, none--``not qualified'' nominees under President Obama.  Last year, two nominees, Thomas Farr and Ryan Bounds, were withdrawn on the floor by the Republicans after the Senate had voted to move forward on their nominations. Disclosures about their backgrounds led Members even on the Republican side of the aisle to say they wouldn't vote for them. They were withdrawn because information came to light that caused these Senators to change their minds about confirming them to lifetime appointments. That shows the importance of having some time--30 hours currently--to debate these nominations and to make sure that a lifetime appointment is not going to someone who is unqualified or who shouldn't be in that position.  So who are the district court nominees for whom Senator McConnell wants to change the rules so as to move them through more quickly? Let me tell you about a few of them.  There is Texas district court nominee Michael Truncale, who called President Obama an ``un-American impostor'' and described the Shelby County case, when it came to voting rights, a ``victory.''  There is Nebraska nominee Brian Buescher, who ran for elected office in 2014 and said: ``I will focus on fighting ObamaCare.''  There is Texas district court nominee Matthew Kacsmaryk, who has repeatedly written in his personal capacity about his opposition to LGBTQ rights and the Obergefell case.  There is Oklahoma district court nominee Patrick Wyrick, who is a protege of disgraced former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt's. He allowed an energy company to ghost-write a letter from Pruitt's office when he was Oklahoma's attorney general.  These are just a few. There are many other Trump judicial nominees whose views are far outside the legal mainstream, and Republicans are determined, with these rule changes, to speed up the process so we don't ask questions.  I have to say it is stunning to listen to Republicans complain about obstruction of judicial nominees after watching the unprecedented Republican obstruction of nominees under President Obama.  Under Senator McConnell, Republicans would not even give an appointment for an interview, let alone a hearing, to a well-qualified Supreme Court nominee--Merrick Garland.  In 2013 Republicans pledged they would filibuster anyone who President Obama nominated to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, the second highest court in the land. No matter how qualified the nominee, they pledged to block him or her because President Obama was making the choice.  Republicans filibustered President Obama's judicial nominees 82 times in the first 5 years. Under all Presidents before President Obama, there had been a total of 86 judicial filibusters combined with all Presidents. Under President Obama, in the first 5 years, there were 82, and throughout history leading up to that, 86.  Now that the Republicans control the White House and the Senate, they want to rip up the rules and change the traditions and guardrails on the judicial nomination process on a regular basis.  They are pushing through nominees who have not been found qualified by the American Bar Association. They are pushing through nominees over the objection of home State Senators. They are pushing these nominees without making sure that they have seen their complete records.  In the case of a North Carolina district court nominee, Thomas Farr, his nomination was pulled when critical documents were finally disclosed while his nomination was pending on the floor of the Senate.  It is no secret what is happening here. There is no emergency that justifies changing the Senate rules. Senator McConnell himself admitted the Senate has plenty of time to consider nominees. This is all about avoiding close scrutiny for extreme ideological nominees that Republicans want to pack onto the Federal courts for lifetime appointments.  I oppose the rules change. Let's do our job when it comes to conducting due diligence and providing informed advice and consent for lifetime appointments to the Federal bench. It can be done.  I will tell you that in the first years of the Trump administration, we have been able, by and large, to work out bipartisan agreement on filling judicial vacancies in the State of Illinois, even at the circuit court level, to the point where Senator Duckworth and I gave blue-slip approval to circuit court nominees based out of our own State, and to the point where we have reached a basic agreement when it comes to filling the district court vacancies to this point. It has been bipartisan all the way, and I believe we have found qualified people. It took some time and some bipartisan cooperation, but we did. It can be done. We didn't ask to have the rules changed in the Senate. We used the existing rules to do our job under the Constitution.  All the issues we care about are impacted by these nominees in my State and others. The Senate deserves to take the time to make sure we get this right. We should not be putting men and women into lifetime appointments without close scrutiny as required by our Constitution.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
