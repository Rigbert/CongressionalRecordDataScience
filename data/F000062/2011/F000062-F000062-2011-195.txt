 President, I rise to introduce the Federal Judicial Fairness Act of 2011.  I want to thank Senator Hatch, as well as Senators Leahy, Graham, Reid, Lee, Inouye, Bingaman, Lieberman, and Kerry, for working with me as cosponsors of this important bill.  The Federal Judicial Fairness Act is a straightforward bill that would ensure that Federal judges receive cost-of-living adjustments to their salaries on the same terms as other Federal civilian employees.  Let me be clear from the outset: This bill would not provide a judicial pay raise. In fact, it would not even guarantee a cost-of-living adjustment for this year, the next year, or the next. Instead, it would simply guarantee that in years in which other Federal civilian employees receive cost-of-living adjustments to their salaries to account for inflation, Federal judges will as well.  Under current law, two procedural requirements prevent this from happening.  First, the ``linking'' of judicial and Congressional salaries means that judges cannot receive a cost-of-living adjustment unless Congress first votes to provide an adjustment for its own Members.  Second, due to a 1981 provision known as ``Section 140,'' even if Congress votes to adjust its own Members' salaries, Congress must pass a second, special provision stating that judges should receive this adjustment as well.  The Federal Judicial Fairness Act's would amend this pay structure and provide that Federal judges should receive adjustments on the same term as other Federal civilian employees.  Why is this important?  Article III of the United States Constitution requires that Federal judges shall ``receive for their services, a compensation, which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.''  This is a constitutional guarantee, entitled to due respect. Serious concerns arise when, as is the current system, political pressures result in the real value of judicial salaries diminishing and declining over time. Justice Kennedy expressed it this way in his 2007 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee:       Please accept my respectful submission that, to keep good      faith with our basic charter, you have the unilateral      constitutional obligation to act when another branch of      government needs your assistance for the proper performance      of its duties. It is both necessary and proper, furthermore,      that we as judges should, and indeed must, advise you if we      find that a threat to the judiciary as an institution has      become so serious and debilitating that urgent relief is      necessary. In my view, the present Congressional compensation      policy for judicial officers is one of these matters.  Additionally, as members of the Senate, I believe we have a responsibility to make every effort to recruit and retain the very best for the Federal bench. Both recruitment and retention become far more difficult when we cannot assure candidates that the salary provided at the beginning of a life appointment will hold its value over time. This assurance is basic for other Federal employees and should be for our Federal judges as well.  The Federal Judicial Fairness Act is a commonsense, good government bill. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 569       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Judicial Fairness      Act of 2011''.     SEC. 2. JUDICIAL COST-OF-LIVING INCREASES.       (a) Repeal of Statutory Requirement Relating to Judicial      Salaries.--Section 140 of the resolution entitled ``A Joint      Resolution making further continuing appropriations for the      fiscal year 1982, and for other purposes.'', approved      December 15, 1981 (Public Law 97-92; 95 Stat. 1200; 28 U.S.C.      461 note), is repealed.       (b) Automatic Salary Adjustments.--Section 461(a) of title      28, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:       ``(a) Effective at the beginning of the first applicable      pay period commencing on or after the first day of the month      in which an adjustment takes effect under sections 5303 and      5304 of title 5 in the rates of pay under the General      Schedule, each salary rate which is subject to adjustment      under this section shall be adjusted by an amount, rounded to      the nearest multiple of $100 (or, if midway between multiples      of $100, to the next higher multiple of $100) equal to the      percentage of such salary rate which corresponds to the      overall average percentage of the adjustment in the rates of      pay under the General Schedule.''.                                 ______                                       By
