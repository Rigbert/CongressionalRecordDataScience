 President, I rise to speak in support of the Rail Safety Improvement Act, which passed the House of Representatives last week by voice vote. This legislation is necessary in order to make our rail lines safe. I encourage my colleagues to support it.  First, I thank Chairman Inouye, Chairman Lautenberg, and Senator Hutchison for their terrific leadership on this important bill.
