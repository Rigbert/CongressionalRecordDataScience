Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to thank Congressman Lamborn for initiating this National Park Service study of Camp Hale so Americans can appreciate the events that occurred during World War II and the Cold War because people forget about the Cold War. A lot of activity went on.  The Tennessee Pass and Camp Hale served as the training site for the 10th Mountain Division, a specialized skiing unit whose heroism during World War II inspired our Nation. Later the site was used for covert training operations furthering the cause of freedom during the Cold War.  Colorado today benefits from the ski area and the educational opportunities presented by this unique landmark. Listing Tennessee Pass and Camp Hale as a unit of the National Park Service will allow us to learn about and experience this unique piece of history.  Madam Speaker, I urge passage of this legislation and yield back the balance of my time.
