 President, today Senator Snowe and I are introducing S. 87, a bill to set up a toll-free service so that people with life-threatening diseases and the medical community can find out about research projects on new treatments.  There are thousands of serious and life-threatening diseases, diseases for which we have no cure. For genetic diseases alone, there are 3,000 to 4,000. We are familiar with diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. But there are thousands of others that are not so common, like cystinosis, Tay-Sachs disease, Wilson's disease, and Sjogren's syndrome. Indeed, there are over 5,000 known rare diseases, diseases most of us have never heard of, affecting between 10 and 20 million Americans.  Cancer kills half a million Americans per year. Diabetes afflicts 15 million Americans per year, half of whom do not know they have it. Arthritis affects 40 million Americans every year. 15,000 American children die every year. Among children, the rates of chronic respiratory diseases (asthma, bronchitis and sinusitis), heart murmurs, migraine headaches, anemia, epilepsy and diabetes are increasing. Few families escape illness today. Every family fears it.                                The Bill  Our bill requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a ``one-stop shopping'' database, including a toll-free telephone number, so that patients and physicians can conveniently find out what clinical research trials are being conducted on experimental treatments. By accessingthis database, users would be able to find out the purpose of the study, eligibility requirements, research locations, and a contact person. Information would have to be presented in ``plain English,'' not ``medicalese,'' so that the average person could understand it.  Our bill is endorsed by the American Cancer Society, the National Organization for Rare Disorders, AIDS Action and the Alzheimer's Association.                        A Constituent Suggestion  The need for this information center came from my constituent, Nancy Evans, of San Francisco's Breast Cancer Action, in a June 13, 1996 hearing of the Senate cancer coalition, which I co-chair with Senator Mack. She described the difficulty that cancer patients have in trying to find out what experimental treatments might be available, research trials sponsored by the federal government and by private companies. Most of them are desperate; most have tried everything. She testfied that the National Cancer Institute has established 1-800-4-CANCER, but the NCI information is incomplete. It does not include all trials and the information is often difficult for the lay person to understand.  In addition, the National Kidney Cancer Association has called for a central database.                         People in Serious Need  It is helpful to think about the plight of the individuals that this bill could help. These are people who have a terminal illness; their physicians have tried every treatment they can find. Cancer patients, for example, have probably had several rounds of chemotherapy, which has left them, debilitated, virtually lifeless. These patients cling to slim hopes. They are desperate to try anything. But step one is finding out what is available, even if it is still in the experimental stage.  One survey found that a majority of patients and families are willing to use investigational drugs (drugs being researched but not approved for sale), but find it difficult to locate information on research projects. A similar survey of physicians found that 42 percent of physicians are unable to find printed information about rare illnesses.                          Help for Physicians  Physicians, no matter how competent and well trained, also cannot be knowledgeable about experimental treatments being researched. And most Americans do not have sophisticated computers hookups that provide them instant access to the latest information. Our witness, Nancy Evans, testified that she can find out more about a company's clinical trials by calling her stockbroker than by calling existing data services.  Many desperate families have called me, their U.S. Senator, seeking help. Others have lodged their pleas at the White House. Others call lawyers, 911, the local medical society, the local Chamber of Commerce, anything they can think of. Getting information on health research projects should not require a ``fishing expedition'' of futiile calls, ``good connections'' or the involvement of elected officials.  In 1988, Congress directed HHS to establish an AIDS Clinical Trials Information Services. It is now operational (1-800-TRIALS-A) so that patients, providers and their families can find out about AIDS clinical trials. All calls are confidential and experienced professionals at the service can help people.                       Improving Health, Research  Facilitating access to information can also strengthen our health research effort. With a national database enabling people to find research trials, more people could be available to participate in research. This can help researchers broaden their pool of research participants.                        Modest Help for the Ill  The bill we introduce does not guarantee that anyone can participate in a clinical research trial. Researchers would still control who participates and set the requirements for the research. But for people who cling to hopes for a cure, for people who want to live longer, for people who want to feel better, this database can offer a little help.  If you have a life-threatening illness, you should not have to have political or other connections, computer sophistication or access to top-flight university medical schools to find out about research on treatments of disease  I hope this bill will offer some hope to the millions who are suffering today.                                 ______                                       By
