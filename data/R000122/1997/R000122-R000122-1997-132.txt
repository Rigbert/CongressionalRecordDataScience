The fact is that this will create a significant system impact. For example, private companies may change their insurance packages, et cetera. There is another impact, also. In this country, sick people--and I hope in this country they will still get care someplace. As a result, without the Medicare Program, they will be thrust upon the hospitals for uncompensated care and thrust upon--if they are low-income citizens--Medicaid programs or special programs at the State level. So as we hope to save at the Federal level, we very well may generate other costs, and perhaps larger costs, at local-State levels and in other insurance programs. So, essentially, our commitment to Medicare, I feel, should be maintained. I, again, concur with the Senator and thank him for yielding me this time to further comment.
