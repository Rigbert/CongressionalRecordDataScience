 As I noted, at the request of President Trump and after improvements were secured, we are considering the bill on the floor this week.  Particular credit for this belongs to Senator Cornyn, who has carefully and impressively balanced his role as majority whip with his own personal support for the legislation. His leadership has benefitted everyone who shares his position and would like to see this bill become law, and he deserves every bit of their gratitude.  With respect to the substance of the legislation, a number of Members continue to have outstanding concerns that the bill currently leaves unaddressed. Members will have an opportunity to debate and vote on the pending germane amendments before we vote on final passage.                          ____________________
