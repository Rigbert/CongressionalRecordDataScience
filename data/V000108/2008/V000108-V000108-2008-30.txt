After completing the first phase of a new modernization project, Ivy Tech will be holding a dedication ceremony on Sunday, December 7, 2008 at the campus in East Chicago, Indiana. The event will serve not only as an opportunity to showcase the improvements to the campus and to reaffirm its commitment to excellence in higher learning, but it will also serve as a chance to reflect on the bravery and heroism of one of East Chicago's own.  Ivy Tech Community College's East Chicago campus has served students from Northwest Indiana and beyond since 1994. Always committed to improving the learning environment for its students, the De La Garza campus, which began with 376 students and now serves an impressive enrollment of 1,122 students, recently completed the first phase of a modernization project. This project, which began in July 2006, features improvements to general maintenance and enhanced safety measures, as well as new and improved conference rooms and student common areas. Phase II of this project, set to begin in January 2009, will focus on improvements to the classrooms and computer labs.  These renovations are the result of the continuous outpouring of support from the community, offered as a living memory of one of Northwest Indiana's finest citizens and greatest heroes, Lance Corporal Emilio A. De La Garza, Jr. Lance Corporal De La Garza was born in East Chicago, Indiana on June 23, 1949. Following his graduation from East Chicago Washington High School in 1968, the patriotic and devoted De La Garza decided to serve his country and enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. While serving as a machine gunner with Company E, Second Battalion, First Marines, First Marine Division in the Republic of Vietnam on April 11, 1970, Lance Corporal De La Garza paid the ultimate sacrifice. Demonstrating the most selfless act imaginable, Lance Corporal De La Garza placed himself between two of his fellow Marines and a live grenade. While Lance Corporal De La Garza's life was lost, his courageous act spared the lives of the other Marines.  Lance Corporal Emilio De La Garza, Jr. performed the ultimate act of heroism, setting aside personal safety for the safety of others. For his bravery, Lance Corporal De La Garza was posthumously honored by President Richard Nixon with the nation's highest honor, the Medal of Honor.  Madam Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Ivy Tech Community College's administrators, faculty, staff, students and members of the community who, over the years, have contributed to its success in achieving its standard of excellence, as well as in honoring the school's namesake, Lance Corporal Emilio Albert De La Garza, Jr. The efforts of those involved have made the De La Garza campus a tremendous source of pride of Indiana's First Congressional District, and they have made the campus a constant reminder of one of Northwest Indiana's finest citizens.                          ____________________
