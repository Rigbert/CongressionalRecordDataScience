 Let me ask the Senator from New Jersey, a significant part of Puerto Rico's $70 billion debt has been acquired in recent years by vulture funds. These are folks who purchase bonds for as little as 29 cents on the dollar and who get interest rates of up to 34 percent. I believe something like one-third--I may be wrong on this, but I believe about one-third of the debt of Puerto Rico is now controlled by these vulture funds. People who buy, by definition, ``risky bonds'' but now want to get 100 percent on the dollar, despite the fact that they paid a fraction of what the bond is worth--from a moral perspective, should the U.S. Senate be supporting legislation which allows vulture capitalists, some of whom are billionaires, to make huge profits while at the same time nutrition programs and educational programs for low-income children in Puerto Rico are cut? Does that sound like the kind of morality that should be passed in the U.S. Senate?
