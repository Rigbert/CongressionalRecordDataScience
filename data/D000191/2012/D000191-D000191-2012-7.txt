That is correct.  Mr. DeFAZIO. May I inquire of the Chair how much time I have remaining.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon has 1 minute remaining.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Again, we will hear apocryphal denouncements from the other side of the aisle--this will cost millions of jobs and billions of dollars and stymie our exports. No, it's a study. It's a study that would take 6 months. It's a study that, if it agrees with the industry's conclusions, would assure the American public that there won't be problems with these trains transiting through their hometowns.  It's something we should know. It's something the government should look at. Apparently, there are some propriety studies that we aren't allowed to see that say there's no problem. Well, if that's true, then the railroads and the industry should let the American public see those propriety studies. Really, not too many people are willing to take someone at their word when it comes to an issue of public health.  So it's a very simple amendment. It won't delay anything; it will take 6 months. It will cost very little, and it will give us the information and knowledge we need to figure out how to safely transport coal.  And with that, I yield back the balance of my time.
