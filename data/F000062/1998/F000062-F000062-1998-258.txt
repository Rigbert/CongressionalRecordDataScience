 President, I would like to recognize Dr. Robert Reid, who on February 16, 1998, will become the 133rd President of the California Medical Association, the largest medical association in the nation. With a membership of 35,000 physicians, California Medical Association represents California physician from all regions, medical specialities and modes of practice--from solo practitioners, to academic physicians, to physicians working in large group practices. Reflecting the diversity that is California, the association's members advocate for quality of care and access to health care for all of the state's residents.  Dr. Reid is a practicing Obstetrician-Gynecologist and Director of Medical Affairs for the Cottage Health System in Santa Barbara, California. Prior to becoming the hospital's Medical Director, Dr. Reid served as the hospital's Chief of Staff and has been a member of its Board of Directors since 1991.  Dr. Reid is also a fellow of the American College of Obstetrics-Gynecology and Past President of the Tri-Counties Obstetrics-Gynecology Society.  He became active in organized medicine in 1972 when he joined the California Medical Association. Ten years later he was elected President of the Santa Barbara County Medical Society and has since gone on to serve the House of Medicine as alternate delegate to the AMA, Vice-Speaker of the CMA Committee on Scientific Assemblies, and chair of the CMA Finance, Membership Development and Communications committees.  Born in Milan, Italy, Dr. Reid is a graduate of the University of Colorado Medical Center. He lives in Santa Barbara, CA, with his wife Patricia, and is the father of four grown children. I am sure Dr. Robert Alfred Reid will continue to make many important contributions to medicine and to the nation's health policy debate.                          ____________________
