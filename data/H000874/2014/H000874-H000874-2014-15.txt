 I have had a brief discussion with the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), with whom I have served for, I guess, about two decades while I was on the Appropriations Committee. While you and I have had conversations--I won't disclose the substance of those conversations--I believe strongly that an omnibus will give greater stability and confidence to those who carry out the programs that the Congress has set forth.  So we are very hopeful that we can reach an agreement both on--we have already reached agreement, as you know, on funding levels in the Ryan-Murray budget agreement that related to last year's fiscal year and this year's fiscal year, fiscal year 2015. So we have agreed-upon numbers.  The only thing we need now agree on, I think, specifically, is riders. Those are legislative provisions in the appropriations bills. I know that we are having a lot of discussions about those, and I know we have negotiations about those. In those negotiations, Mr. Leader, I would urge you, as the majority leader of your party, to do what you can to provide for full-year funding for the entire government because I think that will give confidence to people.  With respect to Homeland Security, it will put us in a better security position--less doubt, more ability to plan, more ability to respond effectively. So I would hope that the leader could lend his very, very substantial influence and intellect and judgment to that process, which I think will be good for the country.  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the gentleman for always being willing to give advice, and as soon as we get the negotiations done, we will keep you abreast.
