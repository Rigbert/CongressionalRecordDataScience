President, today, in Moline, IL, Maggie Laine Webb will be buried.  A promising career took Maggie away from Moline. Sadly, gun violence has brought her home.  Maggie Webb was working at the Van Maur department store in Omaha last Wednesday when a 19-year-old man opened fire with an AK-47 assault rifle, killing eight people and wounding five more before taking his own life.  Maggie Webb was the youngest of the gunman's victims. She was just 24; she would have turned 25 in 2 weeks.  She had transferred to Omaha from another Von Maur department store just 6 weeks earlier. In Omaha, Maggie was a store manager--a position of unusual responsibility for someone her age. But then, Maggie Webb was, by all accounts, an unusually responsible, talented young woman.  At Moline High School, where she graduated in 2001, Maggie was a softball standout, she ran track, and she was involved in student council and many other activities. She went on to graduate in 2005 from Illinois State University.  News of her death has hit many of her former teachers at Moline High School hard. Bill Burrus, the school principal, said one teacher remarked of Maggie, ``She was one of the good ones,'' paused, and then said, ``No, one of the great ones.''  Maggie Webb is survived by her parents, Dave and Vicki Webb, of Port Byron, IL, and her two older sisters.  Our thoughts, prayers, and condolences are with the Webb family and all of the families affected by this senseless violence.                          ____________________
