 While the Democratic leader is still on the floor, I would like to address his comment about California's support, theoretically, which I don't think is correct. I address it with a letter from the California Environmental Protection Agency. California is very eager to get out from under the 2-percent oxygenate requirement. Just to sum up this last paragraph of an April 7 letter from Mr. Winston Hickox, the agency Secretary, it says:       Some have suggested that California should go along with      the safe harbor as a small price to pay for elimination of      the 2 percent mandate.       I disagree. Such a tradeoff makes no logical sense.      Elimination of the costly and unnecessary oxygenate      requirement has nothing to do with assuring that the State of      California has a full array of enforcement and restitution      options available to address MTBE-caused pollution problems.      In short, I do not support a tradeoff that puts at risk the      health of the citizens of the State.  I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Without objection, it is so ordered.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                          California Environmental                                            Protection Agency,                                    Sacramento, CA, April 7, 2003.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC       Dear Senator Feinstein: Governor Gray Davis has asked that      I respond to your March 24, 2003, letter regarding the fuels      provision in the new energy bill being considered by the      108th Congress.       You asked if Governor Davis agrees with my statement that      ``. . . California would rather have the status quo instead      of limiting MTBE liability and getting an oxygenate waiver.''      The Governor does agree with this statement; we both feel      that limiting liability for MTBE is the wrong approach. I      appreciate the opportunity to discuss which ``fuels      provisions'' are appropriate for inclusion in any      comprehensive federal energy legislation. Specifically, I      would like to focus on the MTBE safe harbor language and the      two percent oxygenate requirement.       As a matter of policy and to preserve our legal options, I      am strongly opposed to an MTBE safe harbor. Industry made a      calculated business decision to use MTBE with full knowledge      that it was a serious threat to groundwater. The State of      California and others should not be limited in the ability to      take strong action to address pollution problems caused by      MTBE.       I remain steadfast in my support for elimination of the two      percent oxygenate requirement. Studies have consistently      demonstrated that this requirement is not necessary to      achieve air quality goals and that it unreasonably raises the      price of gasoline in California.       Some have suggested that California should go along with      the safe harbor as a small price to pay for elimination of      the two percent mandate. I disagree. Such a tradeoff makes no      logical sense. Elimination of the costly and unnecessary      oxygenate requirement has nothing to do with assuring that      the State of California has a full array of enforcement and      restitution options available to address MTBE caused      pollution problems. In short, I do not support a tradeoff      that puts at risk the health of the citizens of this State.       I also look forward to continuing to work with you on these      important issues.           Sincerely,                                                Winston H. Hickox,                                                 Agency Secretary.                 Amendment No. 844 to Amendment No. 539
