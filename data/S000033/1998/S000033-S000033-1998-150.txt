 Speaker, I would like to have printed in the Record these statements by high school students from my home State of Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people today.           Statement by Abigail Nesson Regarding Gun Control       Abigail Nesson: I believe that our forefathers had the      right idea. Their wish was to create a safe and free nation      for all of us to live in, and they wrote this to prove it:      ``We the people of the United States, in order to form a more      perfect union, establish justice, ensure domestic      tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the      general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to      ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this      Constitution for the United States of America.''       These are beautiful words. But more than beautiful, they      can be used and enforced to create a more perfect union. But      our country is at a time in its history when the words      ``domestic tranquility'' and ``general welfare'' seem to      signify things of the past.       I am here today to talk to you about guns. The widespread      availability of these weapons is frightening and wrong.      Thousand are killed every year in our country by guns bought      legally, guns made not to hunt animals but to hunt humans.      Many have killed or have been killed by the time they reach      my age, if they ever do.       I am a strict constructionist when it comes to the preamble      and the Second Amendment, meaning I believe that our      forefathers wrote just what they meant. They meant for the      Constitution to create domestic tranquility and general      welfare and, especially, common defense. I believe--I know--     that the guns that are available today do none of these      things. I believe and I know that our forefathers would      agree, because I refuse to think that the intentions of the      ones who wrote the Constitution was to put lethal weapons in      the hands of every person who wanted one. That is not ``a      well regulated militia.'' No, their intention was to ensure      the safety and freedom of us, their posterity.       I propose that we follow the words of the preamble and of      our constitution. I propose that we take a step to make our      nation safe again, for me and for the children I want to have      some day. I propose we remove the guns from our streets, our      homes and our hands.       Congressman Sanders: Thank you very much.                                         ____        Statement by Abe Klein Regarding Campaign Finance Reform       Abe Klein: The issue I am choosing to bring up today is      that of campaign finance reform. You mentioned a moment ago,      it is really quite a simple process, to some extent, for      getting people elected to the smaller, local levels,      including in Vermont, our state Congress and the senate, as      well. But once you go beyond that, it is really a different      story, and it takes a lot of money for people to get elected      to office, as I'm sure you are aware of.       Congressman Sanders: Tell me about it. Yes, I know.       Abe Klein: You are the only person in the entire Federal      Government of our nation who has been elected without the      monetary support of the Democratic or Republican party. And I      feel that this requisite amount of money required for people      to attain office is really limiting who can be elected to      office and who can hold power in our country, and the other      real issue behind this problem is that, though people can get      elected with the support of the democratic and republican      parties, both of these parties get a large amount of their      support from large corporations throughout the nation, and it      seems to hold a really evident influence on the policies of      our nation, and I think to the detriment of the people.       The one I am working with, there was a proposal, and there      have been many proposals since 1974 when the first campaign      finance reform proposal was passed, after the Nixon      administration, but that particular proposal left a lot of      gaps, including allowing organizations or PACs, these PAC      organizations, to gather money for the political parties      without restrictions. And a number of people in the Congress,      including you, have attempted to reprimand that with new      proposals, to no success.       I really wanted to bring that issue up as a discussion,      because I feel that it's really limiting the viewpoints and      the opinions of people in Congress, and who can get elected      to Congress. I mean, people continue to work on it, but it      really--I don't know--I think that, at some point, maybe with      large amounts of grassroots support, it could be brought up      as an issue for serious debate, and it could be really      brought into a forefront, and it needs to be done in a manner      which does not limit people's free speech. And that is a      serious issue as well, because a lot of people claim that      their ability to spend money for political elections is      representing their free speech, and any limits on their      ability to spend money is therefore infringing on their First      Amendment.       I am not sure. I guess I would ask you, actually. Have you      found any ways in which a seriously extensive limitation on      who and how much money can be spent, or who can spend this      money to elect people to federal office without infringing on      their First Amendment.       The Court: Abe, thank you very much.                                         ____  Statement by Bridget Guilfoy, Michael Hastings, Kate Charlebois and             Mandy Collier Regarding Violence in the Schools       Bridget Guilfoy: We are going to be talking about violence      in schools. And so a real important question to be asked      initially is: Has the violence actually increased over the      last few years, or several years? And it seems very obvious      that it has increased, but there is a surprising lack of      evidence and information about it. The last official national      study was done in 1978, and, since then, there has been no      national one to compare it with. The only ones that have been      done have been in smaller local settings. So all we can do is      really speculate, based on local studies to compare the      violence over the years.       In 1978, 1.3 percent of students reported being attacked,      and 4 percent of those needed medical attention. And in a      survey in 1989 of 31 Illinois public high schools, 8 percent      of students reported being attacked, 8 percent of those had      been cut, and 4 percent shot. And in a 1990 report, 20      percent of students said that they had carried a weapon to      school within a month before the survey. So with these more      informal reports, it seems clear that the violence has      increased, but it is just very surprising and almost      disturbing that there have been no studies, because it seems      like there is a lack of interest.       It is also very interesting that, in the 1978 report,      students reported 22 times the number of attacks and      robberies that their principals and teachers reported, and it      just is a shame, because it seems that if people are trying      to cover up the problem here, it will make it a lot more      difficult to actually get to the bottom of it and help it.       For causes, one cause attributed to the violence is the      easy availability of guns. And another, violence is often      blamed on gangs and drug traffic, but, really, I mean,      violence occurs outside of major cities where gangs and drug      issues aren't as big of a problem, and these are also just      reasons that explain how the violence occurs and not why.       Violent children are usually victims of abuse themselves,      and psychological studies have shown that child abuse is      invariably connected with child violence.       Kate Charlebois: As Bridget was saying, there is a direct      relation between child abuse and violence among teenagers.      And recently, there was an article in The Burlington Free      Press which stated that the number of reported child abuse      cases is the lowest in 15 years. However, it has also been      reported that these cases that are reported tend to be much      more violent than ever before, which may be in relation to      why there is more guns and shootings happening, rather than      fights in schools.       So we feel as though there is a real need for both more      child abuse programs as well as an increase in the      availability of these programs. Also, as a solution for this      problem, if I could just read a quote from Jimmy Foster, who      is the Mayor of Pearl, Mississippi, where, on October 1st of      '97, there was a shooting which killed two teenagers and      wounded seven others. And he said: ``You know the old cliche,      it happens to somebody     else. It happened to us this time, and it was shocking. It      cut through the heart of the community. What happened to us      that morning was unthinkable.''       And I think the main thing that we would like to do is to      have schools in Vermont be much more aware that this is a      problem that is not just happening in the big cities, it is      now moving to the suburbs. And Pearl, Mississippi, is only a      population of 22,000. So it is definitely not happening just      in the big cities.       Mandy Collier: We wanted to try to offer some solutions      that maybe would help the problem. In doing that, we looked      at the urban schools where school violence has occurred many      times. And one of the solutions that they have been trying      for the past years is to install metal detectors and go      through, and in New York City they have 2,600 officers just      for their schools. And there are many problems with this, and      one of them is that it could take three hours to get all the      students to go through the metal detectors, which cuts into      the school time itself, and you end up spending half the day      making sure no one has weapons. The other problem is the high      cost, that these metal detectors range between $10,000 and      $20,000, and many school districts don't have the money, and      when they can afford it, then they have to rotate it between      the schools, so schools are only getting checked once a week,      and what happens the other four days when someone could bring      a gun to school? And in rural communities and areas like      these, it is a little unreasonable to spend that much money      when an incident may occur once, a random incident, and the      detector might not even be there.       So as far as solution, Rebecca Coffee is a Vermont author      who has written a book on the subject and she suggests that      the kids need to be taught by their parents, by their school      community and by their leaders how to express themselves.      They need to know they have control, because many kids go      through and use guns as a way of gaining control, and they      also need to have a strong sense of community. To do this, I      think that parents need to be taught better and they need to      be aware of how to teach their kids these values. And I      think, also, that schools need to have more teachers and more      guidance counselors in them, because many times there are      only one or two per grade, which is one or two per a hundred      or two hundred students, which isn't enough.       Michael Hastings: It seems that violence in schools is a      consequence of a much larger problem of education that      affects our society, and the question would be, why can't      every school be of the quality of a Phillip's Exeter Academy      or another elite institution like that. And if the answer is,      well, there is no money to give to the schools, then I would      have to consider the question, why does the government give      three times more money to corporations, corporate welfare,      than to social welfare programs.       Also, why do we spend so much money on a massive military      budget, which shouldn't come as a surprise--the military is a      rather violent institution--that just breeds this kind of      mentality of violence. Also, why it seems that we have been      unable to mobilize this awesome American effort that was      shown when we helped win World War II, when we put a man on      the moon, and that we still use this American might to bully      other countries around the world, but why can't we use this      effort towards improving the conditions of our school      standards? Why do we seem to be unable to even feed the      children that go to school? That surely doesn't help the      problems of violence. And when the question comes to what is      the correlation between spending money and economic stability      have to do with violence in schools, I think if you compare      the amounts of shootings you have, say, in Andover,      Massachusetts to southeast Los Angeles, the results are      pretty clear-cut.                               ____________________
