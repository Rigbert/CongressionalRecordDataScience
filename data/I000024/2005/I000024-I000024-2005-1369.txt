President, first let me say to my friend, Senator Wyden, he has always been a champion of that cause. A lot of us with different political philosophies rely on his judgment, his experience, his background, and those things he has accomplished in the field of health care. I look forward to working with him in this coming year.                          ____________________[Pages S15-S18]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                              HEALTH CARE
