Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding me this time, and thank him on behalf of his good work for autistic children.  Mr. Speaker, I also thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Doyle), the cochairman of the Coalition for Autism Research and Education (C.A.R.E.). It is a privilege to work with him, and I thank the gentleman for his work and the work his staff has been doing.  Mr. Speaker, we have 119 members on the Coalition for Autism Research and Education, CARE, and I hope my colleagues who might be watching in their offices and their staffs would look into joining this coalition. We are trying to mobilize Congress in a bipartisan way on behalf of autistic children and adults and their families, who are in great need of our support.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Tauzin) and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Boehner) and the majority leader for releasing this resolution to the floor. It was referred to their respective committees, the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Committee on Education and the Workforce. The majority leader and the committee chairman worked together to get the resolution to the floor.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Greenwood) for his work on behalf of this, and the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Burton), who held a very important hearing on the issue of autism, trying to get to the core reasons as to what is causing it.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), who was the prime sponsor of the Children's Health Act which contained title I which sets up the Centers of Excellence. Many of us worked on that language, and we were very pleased when the gentleman made that title I of his very important health care initiative.                              {time}  1430  Mr. Speaker, H. Con. Res. 91 calls attention to one of the major public health issues of our time, the developmental disorder called autism. Last Friday (April 27), as Members probably know, parents and families of autistic children from all over the country came down to Washington to mark the second annual Autism Awareness Day and to raise awareness of the challenges and sacrifices families make on behalf of their loved ones. H. Con. Res. 91 calls attention to autism and tries to dedicate this Congress, this body, this House, to supporting efforts to treat and to eventually cure autism. In the meantime, we need to at least mitigate its occurrence.  Mr. Speaker, it is not an exaggeration to say that autism spectrum disorders may be the silent epidemic of our time. It is silent because this developmental disorder has robbed at least 400,000 children of their ability to communicate and interact with their families and their loved ones. It is silent because there are currently no operational autism registries in the Nation to tell us how many people are actually afflicted with this disorder. Conventional wisdom and passive reporting suggests that autism affects at least one in every 500 children in America. Much of the recent anecdotal evidence, however, suggests that autism rates are significantly higher, some say closer to one in every 250 children. We have got to get to the bottom of the numbers but more importantly the why of it. Why is this exploding on our scene in America today? What is the cause? What is the pathway? Is it environmental? Is it an immunization shot? Nobody really knows. There are a lot of theories, but not much when it comes to getting to the bottom of the why of it.  Mr. Speaker, let me just say to my colleagues, I was brought into this 21 years ago by a Dr. Holmes who runs the Eaton Institute in Princeton, a very, very important, dedicated person who has done so much, has literally written books and books on the issue of autism. But more recently it was a family, Bobbi and Billy Gallagher in Brick Town, New Jersey who came to me and said, ``We think we have an elevated number of autistic cases in Brick Township, New Jersey.'' They brought evidence. They had done their own survey, finding that there may be as many as 4 per 1,000 rather than the estimates of 2 per 1,000 in that municipality. We then invited the CDC and ATSDR in and they did an empirical, very scientific study.  The bottom line is that they brought forth information that suggested an elevated incidence of prevalence that exceeded what was supposedly the norm. CDC and ATSDR found, about 4 per 1,000 children had autism, and in the spectrum, 6.7 per 1,000 children this was much higher than what we anticipated. This study may indicate that there is a cluster of children with autism in Brick Township, but this study may portend a much higher incidence occurring throughout the country.  We need to spend more money on this. This resolution at least puts us on record as saying it is important to us, we want to get to the bottom of it, and we want to see implementation of title I of the Children's Health Act.
