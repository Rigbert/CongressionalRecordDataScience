Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Cummings], the distinguished ranking member, for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation and congratulate the gentleman from Georgia for bringing this forward. I regret that I did not focus on it earlier, for I would, and have discussed with the committee, an additional what I believe to be also a technical correction.  This deals with life insurance; it does not, however, impact the annuity payment of a survivor that would also be part of a domestic relations divorce or domestic agreement resolution. As a result, I want to thank the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Mica], chairman of the committee, and the staff, as well as the gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Cummings], both of whom I have talked to about this problem.  It was too late in the cycle and we would have slowed this bill down, but we did not want to do that, because this is effecting an excellent solution to an existing problem. But I want to thank the chairman for agreeing to address this issue in future legislation. It is my understanding that there will be some legislation coming along, either in July or shortly thereafter, and I believe this is an important step forward, but I believe the spouse, in a resolution of a case dealing with the annuity as opposed to life insurance, finds themselves in exactly the same situation as it relates to their ability, pursuant to court order, and/or pursuant to agreement, particularly when that court order incorporates an agreement of the parties. It seems perverse that we do not have the same kind of positive dealing in that instance.  So I congratulate the gentleman from Georgia. I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their agreement to address that issue as soon as possible.
