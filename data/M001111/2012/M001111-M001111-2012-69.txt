 I come to the floor this afternoon to talk about a very important bill, the Violence Against Women Act. It is hard for me to believe it has actually been months now since we first came to the floor to talk about this important legislation, which is why we are here again this afternoon: to try and pass a bill into law that has consistently received broad bipartisan approval. It is a bill that passed the Senate now almost 3 months ago by a vote of 68 to 31.  The Violence Against Women Act has successfully helped provide lifesaving assistance to hundreds of thousands of women and their families. Every time we have reauthorized this bill we have included bipartisan provisions to address those who are not being protected by it. But here we are back on the Senate floor urging support for a bill that should not be controversial.  So, today, the women of the Senate and the men who support the Violence Against Women Act have come to the floor with a simple, straightforward message for our friends in the House of Representatives: Stop the games and pass the inclusive, bipartisan Senate bill without delay.  In the coming weeks we are going to be making sure this message resonates loudly and clearly both in the Nation's Capital and back home in our States because we are not going to back down, not while there are thousands of women across our country who are currently excluded from the law. In fact, for Native and immigrant women and LGBT individuals, every moment our inclusive legislation to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act is delayed is another moment they are left without the resources and protection they deserve.  The numbers are staggering: 1 in 3 Native women will be raped in their lifetimes--1 in 3--and 2 in 5 of them are victims of domestic violence. They are killed at 10 times the rate of the national average.  These shocking statistics aren't isolated to one group of women: 25 to 35 percent of women in the LGBT community experience domestic violence in their relationships, and 3 in 4 abused immigrant women never entered the process to obtain legal status, even though they were eligible, because their abuser husbands never filed their paperwork.  This should make it perfectly clear to our colleagues in the other Chamber that their current inaction has a real impact on the lives of women across America who are affected by violence--women such as Deborah Parker.  Deborah is the vice-chairwoman of the Tulalip Tribe in my home State of Washington. Deborah was repeatedly abused starting at a very young age by a nontribal man who lived on her reservation. Not until the abuse stopped around the fourth grade did Deborah realize she wasn't the only child suffering at the hands of that assailant. At least a dozen other young girls had fallen victim to that same man.  He was a man who was never arrested for his crimes, never brought to justice, and still walks free today, all because he committed these heinous acts on the reservation and is someone who is not a member of the tribe. It is an unfortunate reality that he is unlikely to be held liable for his crimes.  Reauthorizing an inclusive VAWA is a matter of fairness. Deborah's experience and the experience of other victims of this man do not represent an isolated incident. For the narrow set of domestic violence crimes laid out in the Violence Against Women Act, tribal governments should be able to hold accountable defendants who have a strong tie to the tribal community.  I was very glad to see Republican Congresswoman Judy Biggert and several of her Republican colleagues echo these very same sentiments last week. In a letter to Speaker Boehner and Leader Cantor, the Republican Members explicitly called on their party leadership to end this gridlock and accept ``Senate-endorsed provisions that would protect all women of domestic violence, including college students, LGBT individuals, Native Americans, and immigrants.''  So today we are here to urge Speaker Boehner to listen to the members of his own caucus and join us in taking a major step to uphold our government's promise to protect its people. I was so proud to have served in the Senate back in 1994 with Senator Boxer, who is here with me today, when we first passed this bill. Since we took that historic step, VAWA has been a great success in coordinating victims' advocates, social service providers, and law enforcement professionals to meet the challenges of combating domestic violence. Along with this bipartisan support, it has received praise from law enforcement officers, prosecutors, judges, victim service providers, faith leaders, health care professionals, advocates, and survivors.  VAWA has attained such broad support because it works. Where a person lives, their immigration status, or whom they love should not determine whether perpetrators of domestic violence are brought to justice. These women across this country cannot afford any further delay--not on this bill.  Today the New York Times ran an editorial on this bill that gets to the heart of where we are. It began by saying:       House Republicans have to decide which is more important:      Protecting victims of domestic violence or advancing the      harsh antigay and anti-immigrant sentiments of some on their      party's far right. At the moment, harshness is winning.  But the editorial pointed out, it doesn't have to be that way. It pointed out:       In May, 15 Senate Republicans joined with the chamber's      Democratic majority to approve a strong reauthorization bill.  Finally, it ends with what we all know we need to take this bill forward: Leadership from Congressman Boehner.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, July 23, 2012]                       Delay on Domestic Violence       With Congress just days away from its August break, House      Republicans have to decide which is more important:      protecting victims of domestic violence or advancing the      harsh antigay and anti-immigrant sentiments of some on their      party's far right. At the moment, harshness is winning.       At issue is reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act,      the landmark 1994 law central to the nation's efforts against      domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking.       In May, 15 Senate Republicans joined with the chamber's      Democratic majority to approve a strong reauthorization bill.      Instead of embracing the Senate's good work, House      Republicans passed their own regressive version, ignoring      President Obama's veto threat. The bill did not include new      protections for gay, immigrant, American Indian and student      victims contained in the Senate measure. It also rolled back      protections for immigrant women, including for undocumented      immigrants who report abuse and cooperate with law      enforcement.       Negotiations on a final bill are in limbo. Complicating      matters, there is a procedural glitch. The Senate bill      imposes a fee to pay for special visas that go to immigrant      victims of domestic abuse. This runs afoul of the rule that      revenue-raising measures must begin in the House. Mr.      Boehner's leadership could break the logjam--but that, of      course, would also require his Republican colleagues to drop      their narrow-minded opposition to stronger protections for      all victims of abuse.       Unless something changes, Republicans will bear      responsibility for blocking renewal of a popular, lifesaving      initiative. This seems an odd way to cultivate moderate      voters, especially women, going into the fall campaign.
