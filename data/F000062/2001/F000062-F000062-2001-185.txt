 President, I am very pleased today to be joined by Senator Olympia Snowe to introduce this important legislation to gradually phase-in the fuel efficiency standards for SUVs and light duty trucks by 2007.  I would also like to thank the other cosponsors: Senators Charles Schumer, Susan Collins and Jack Reed.  Put simply, this is the single most effective action we can take to limit our reliance on foreign oil, save consumers at the pump, and reduce global warming.  Today, the U.S. has 4 percent of the world's population, yet we use 25 percent of the planet's energy.  So as the world's largest energy consumer, I believe it is our responsibility to make every effort to be the world's leader in conservation.  Specifically, the results of this bill would be substantial. It would: Save America one million barrels of oil a day; reduce oil imports by 10 percent; and prevent 240 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions from entering the atmosphere--this is the single biggest cause of Global Warming.  Today, the fuel economy standard for passenger vehicles is 27.5 miles per gallon, while the standard for SUVs and light duty trucks is 20.7 miles per gallon due to a loophole in the 1975 law.  The result: SUVs and light trucks now comprise nearly half of new car sales, bringing the average fuel economy of all the nation's new vehicles to its lowest point since 1980.  The Feinstein-Snowe legislation would: Phase in fuel economy standards for SUVs and all other light duty trucks on the following schedule: By 2002, SUVs and light duty vehicles must average 22.5 miles per gallon; by 2005, SUVs and light duty vehicles must average 25 miles per gallon; and by 2007, SUVs and light duty vehicles must average 27.5 miles per gallon; require that vehicles up to a weight of 10,000 pounds must qualify for fuel efficiency standards by 2007. The current limit is 8,500 pounds; increase the fuel economy of new vehicles comprising the federal government fleet by 6 miles per gallon by 2005.  Last year, former Senators Slade Gorton, Richard Bryan and I fought an uphill battle to try and find a way to increase these fuel economy standards.  But, we were stymied by the auto industry and their supporters in Congress.  Ultimately, at the end of the session, we reached an agreement that directed the National Academy of Sciences to study whether, in fact, we could raise fuel efficiency with sacrificing safety or competitiveness.  Recently, the automakers have said that they will not actively oppose increases in fuel efficiency standards.  The Big Three manufacturers have promised a voluntary increase in efficiency for SUVs by 25 percent by 2005.  This is an important step forward, but we need to do more. I believe this bill is the best way to do that.                                 ______                                       By
