 President, the amendment I just sent to the desk ensures protection of seniors diagnosed with cancer from the high prescription drug costs associated with that illness.  My amendment states specifically that any senior in Medicare and diagnosed with cancer shall have the right to a drug plan in which the beneficiary shall pay no deductible, no monthly premium, no more than a 2.5-percent copayment for any drug spending up to $4,500 a year, no more than a 5-percent copayment for drug spending between $4,500 and $5,800 a year, and no more than a 2.5-percent copayment for any drug spending over $5,800 if their income is below the poverty level.  My amendment states that any senior in Medicare who is also diagnosed with cancer, with an income between 100 percent and 135 percent of the poverty level, shall have the right to a drug plan in which the beneficiary shall pay no deductible, no monthly premium, no more than a 5-percent copayment for drug spending up to $4,500, no more than a 10-percent copayment for drug spending between $4,500 and $5,800, and no more than a 2.5-percent copayment for any drug spending over $5,800.  My amendment provides that any senior in Medicare diagnosed with cancer, with an income between 135 percent and 160 percent of the poverty level, shall have the right to a drug plan in which the beneficiary shall pay no more than a $50 deductible, an average monthly premium not greater than $35, no more than a 10-percent copayment for drug spending up to $4,500, no more than a 20-percent copayment for drug spending between $4,500 and $5,800, and no more than a 10-percent copayment for any drug spending over $5,800.  My amendment also provides that any senior in Medicare and diagnosed with cancer, with an income above 160 percent of the poverty level, shall have the right to a drug plan in which the beneficiary shall pay no more than a $275 deductible, an average monthly premium not greater than $35, no more than a 50-percent copayment for drug spending up to $4,500, and no more than a 10-percent copayment for drug spending over $5,800.  With this amendment, which conforms to the provisions within the bill, all seniors with cancer get help with prescription drug costs, especially the poor and moderate-income seniors.  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?
