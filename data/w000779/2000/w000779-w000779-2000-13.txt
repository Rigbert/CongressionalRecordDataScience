 I am obligated to speak for those Oregonians, each and every one of them, over a million Oregon voters, because I want them to understand that I am going to do everything in my power to make sure the ballot I have in my hand and the ballots they are holding right now actually count. The fact is, the senior Senator from Oklahoma has put into the tax bill legislation that would silence over a million Oregon voices. I am going to be here to make sure those voices are heard.  I yield to the Senator from Nevada. I thank him for his thoughtful comments last night on this issue.
