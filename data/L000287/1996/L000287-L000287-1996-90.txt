Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Texas, for yielding time to me.  Mr. Speaker, I am appalled.  We knew that the extreme Republicans made promises to their special interest friends. We knew that the NRA has too much influence over this Republican Congress.  But I could not believe that it was this bad. I could not believe that that this body would endanger innocent lives.  Republicans say they want to fight crime. Instead, they fight to put military weapons into the hands of common thugs.  This bill means that more police officers will sacrifice their lives to defend our homes--our neighborhoods--our communities. This bill means that more innocent children will be gunned down in our Nation's streets.  Our families will give their lives to pay the debt Republicans owe their special interest friends. The NRA and their money cannot bring back the lives that will be lost--sacrificed to their extreme agenda.  Reject this radical, this dangerous, this sick, and obscene proposal.  These weapons are weapons and tools of death, violence, and destruction.  Reject this proposal.
