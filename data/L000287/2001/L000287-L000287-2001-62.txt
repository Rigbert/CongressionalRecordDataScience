Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague for yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Joint Resolution 19, which will provide for the appointment of Dr. Walter Massey as a member of the Board of Regents for the Smithsonian Institution.  Dr. Massey is the ninth president of Morehouse College, which is located in Atlanta, Georgia, my congressional district. Through his work, innovative thinking, and firm leadership, Dr. Massey has made a remarkable contribution, not just to Morehouse College, but to other colleges and universities, and to our Nation.  I have no doubt that Dr. Massey will have an unwavering commitment to the Smithsonian Institution, with his deep understanding and appreciation of American history, art, and our diverse culture.  I urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution.
