 President, I thank my colleague from Wyoming, and I understand he is opposing the amendment. I just say we are in a crisis in this country. We are in a crisiswhen there are 10,000 people on a waiting list in King County alone to try to get into a training program in order to get the skills they need to get back to work. We are in a crisis when our economy continues to struggle and people are unable to put food on the table, send their kids to college, and to be able to feel secure when it comes to their jobs.  We all know we are spending $1 billion a week in Iraq in order to reconstruct that country. It seems to me totally reasonable to ask for $801 million for next year to help train our workers, to get our economy back on track, and to give American families the security they need in their homes to know they can take care of their own.  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment at the appropriate time.
