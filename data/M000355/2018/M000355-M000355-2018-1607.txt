 President, today the Senate completed its work on the personnel business for this week the way we started--by confirming a talented nominee to be a Federal district judge in Kentucky.  President Trump nominated Rebecca Jennings to be the first woman to serve as a district judge for the Western District of Kentucky. Widely recognized for her outstanding legal talents and judgment, Ms. Jennings has earned the support of Kentucky's legal community. In fact, dozens of her peers wrote that ``she has a first-rate analytical mind and superb judgment. She is principled, thoughtful, and hard-working.'' These qualities are exactly what I believe we need on the Federal district courts. Our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee agreed, advancing Ms. Jennings' nomination to the Senate floor on a voice vote. Just moments ago, the Senate fulfilled its responsibility, confirming another well-qualified nominee for Kentucky and for the Nation, both of which will be well-served by Rebecca Jennings on the bench.  I hope the Senate can build on this momentum and continue confirming more of the President's abundantly qualified nominees without undue delay.
