Ayotte, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Begich, Mr. Merkley, and Mr. Heller) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Finance.                              S. Res. 309       Whereas the United States enjoys a strong Internet retail      market, which, for the past decade, has provided consumers in      the United States with the opportunity to purchase quality      products and services at competitive prices;       Whereas the free Internet marketplace has enabled a large      number of small retailers and entrepreneurs across the Nation      to establish and strengthen businesses on various e-commerce      platforms and therefore protect and create jobs, increase      consumer choice, create competition in the retail industry,      and provide quality goods and services at reasonable and      often discounted prices;       Whereas any Federal legislation that would upset the free      and fair Internet marketplace and allow State governments to      impose new, onerous and burdensome sales tax-collecting      schemes on out-of-State, Internet-enabled small businesses      would adversely impact hundreds of thousands of jobs, reduce      consumer choice, and impede the growth and development of      interstate commerce; and       Whereas at a time when national unemployment numbers are      high and businesses across the country are struggling to keep      their doors open, the Federal Government should promote pro-     growth and pro-business policies instead of enacting      legislation that extracts additional taxes from our Nation's      Internet-enabled businesses: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that Congress      should not enact any legislation that would grant State      governments the authority to impose any new burdensome or      unfair tax collecting requirements on small Internet      businesses and entrepreneurs, which would ultimately hurt the      economy of, and consumers in, the United States.
