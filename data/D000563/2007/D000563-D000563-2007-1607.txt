 After nearly 30 years in public life, Linda is retiring as Secretary of the Illinois State Senate and starting a new chapter in her life. Those who worked with Linda in the Illinois State capitol can tell you what an amazing difference she made in the office of the Secretary of the Senate. The job is a tough one. The hours are long. But Linda has worked tirelessly to serve the people of the Senate and the people of my State.  Linda is going to be missed. Linda and I started together working in the Illinois State Senate. I was fresh out of law school. She had just started as a secretary to one of the State senators back in the early 1970s. She was born and raised in Springfield. Linda is one of eight children. She worked hard throughout her life to raise her daughter. She graduated from Sangamon State University, now known as the University of Illinois-Springfield, with a degree in political studies.  Linda has worked so hard not only for the Senate but for many candidates for the Illinois State Senate over the years. She was the first woman to serve as Secretary of the Illinois Senate, the guardian of the public records of that institution. Before serving in that position, she was assistant secretary. Prior to that, she worked for the Senate Democratic leadership staff and served as special assistant to former Illinois Senate president Phil Rock.  As Secretary of the Senate, Linda is best known as the chief administrative and fiscal officer of the Senate. But those terms don't tell the whole story. She brought a state-of-the-art computer system into the Illinois State Senate to make it easier to track bills and debate them. She was also instrumental in the creation and development of the Illinois Women in Government Organization. In 2004, she washonored by the Illinois Democratic Women with the Eleanor Roosevelt Outstanding Democratic Woman of the Year Award--an award presented to only one woman each year--for her work in grassroots politics. Linda is also a founder of the Illinois Women in Leadership Organization, which provides opportunities and training for women to become more politically involved in my State.  Linda is deeply involved in her community, having worked in a lot of organizations, including the Committee to Study the Honesty and Integrity of Springfield Elections, the University of Illinois at Springfield Alumni Council, the Springfield Urban League, and is a former member of the Executive Committee for the American Society of Legislative Clerks and Secretaries.  But if you ask those who know Linda well, they will tell you that her story should not just be told in terms of what she has done but the people's lives she has affected. She is known as the go-to person in my part of the world, especially if you want to run for office. She is known not just as a fabulous adviser and mentor; she is the hardest working person I have known in the political scene. She is not afraid to roll up her sleeves and get into the thick of it. Linda managed the campaign of Senator Penny Severns, whose life was taken away too soon by breast cancer. They were quite a team. Penny Severns won a district she was never supposed to win, and Linda was right by her side. She has always been a great person to talk to. She always had time to listen. To be Linda Hawker's friend is to know loyalty, honesty, a diligent worker, and the best kind of friendship.  Her leadership as both Secretary and Assistant Secretary of the Illinois Senate has been an example of quiet integrity to all of those, including myself, who have worked with her. She will start a new chapter in her life with retirement, but I know no matter what she does she will be successful.  Last night, they had a reception for Linda in Springfield and I was told by press accounts this morning it was one of the largest bipartisan turnouts in history, which she truly deserved. She was that kind of a person and still is and will be for many years to come. We hope she has many great adventures in the future.  Linda, congratulations for your hard work, and thanks for being my friend.                          ____________________
