Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes and 15 seconds.  Among the largest new sources of revenue we could possibly provide the Castro regime at this point would be large scale United States tourism. So I and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Rothman) are offering this human rights amendment in the hope that any lifting of remaining travel restrictions to Cuba will be done carefully and thoughtfully with some regard to the consequences.  Mr. Chairman, it is important to be honest about what we are talking about when we talk about tourism to Cuba. The dictatorship gets rich--filthy rich--let us make no mistake about that, and will go on its merry way in arresting, beating, and torturing political dissidents.  Let me just point out, Mr. Chairman, that Human Rights Watch, in its report, and I urge Members to read it, makes the point that conditions in Cuba's prisons are inhuman. In recent years, Cuba has added new repressive laws.  Torture is commonplace in Cuba, and ugly beyond words. There is no freedom of speech or assembly in Cuba. The people of Cuba have no right to emigrate. And dissent continues to be suppressed with unspeakable cruelty. In light of this we should lift the travel ban. And to make matters worse, there is another outrageous lucrative form of travel to Cuba called sex tourism. Cuba is on the short list of destinations for middle-aged men looking for inexpensive commercial sex, including sexual exploitation by children, which is actively condoned by the government. We should have no part whatsoever in facilitating this kind of exploitation.  I want to make very clear, Mr. Chairman, that under current U.S. policy vis-a-vis Cuba much travel is permitted. As a result of Clinton's softand feckless policy towards Cuba, Americans can and do travel to Cuba for certain purposes: journalism, educational purposes, humanitarian missions, government business, sick family members, and the list goes on. The amendment I propose today focuses on the tourist industry and whether or not reasonable, modest conditions should be imposed before we lift that particular travel ban.  Our amendment has two conditions: the Cuban government should return the violent criminals who have escaped American justice and who are currently hiding out in Cuba. The case of Joanne Chesimard is particularly egregious. Chesimard was sentenced to life for the murder of a New Jersey State Trooper, Werner Foerster, but is now living it up in Cuba. She--and scores of other murderers and air pirates and drug smugglers--must be returned to the U.S. to serve their time behind bars.  The second condition, Mr. Chairman, has to do with the release of hundreds of political prisoners. The State Department's Country Reports estimates that there are between 300-400 political prisoners, and they are being mistreated, tortured and abused. Before we give the green light to tourism en masse, before we head to Havana with bathing suits in our bags and fun and diversion on our minds, let's not forget the persecuted and the oppressed.  Let us not abandon, undermine or betray some of the most courageous dissidents on the face of the earth.  We should lift the travel ban, if and only if all political prisoners are released. We should lift the travel ban, only when all cop killers and felons convicted in the U.S. are back in U.S. prisons.  Vote ``no'' on Flake and ``yes'' on Smith-Rothman.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  Amendment Offered by Mr. Flake as a Substitute for Amendment No. 5                    Offered by Mr. Smith of New Jersey
