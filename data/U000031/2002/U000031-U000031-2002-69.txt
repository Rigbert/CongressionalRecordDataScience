Speaker, as Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet, I am pleased to join the distinguished Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Tauzin, in introducingthe ``Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act''.  Earlier this year, we significantly changed spectrum auction policy by freeing the FCC's hands with respect to when auctions should be conducted. Now, with this bill, we are making another significant down payment on our Committee's spectrum reform efforts, by eliminating grave inefficiencies in spectrum management which have thwarted spectrum relocation efforts to date.  The commercial wireless industry must have additional spectrum to provide innovative new services and other critical benefits to the American public and to foster economic growth. However, spectrum ideal for next generation wireless services currently is encumbered by the federal government.  We all recognize the need to relocate federal government incumbents to comparable spectrum in order to make way for the commercial wireless industry, but the road to relocating federal government incumbents to comparable spectrum (or alternative facilities) is unpaved and filled with potholes. The ``Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act'' would pave that road, establishing procedures to ensure a timely, certain, and privately--yet fully--funded relocation of federal incumbents to comparable spectrum (or alternative facilities). Hence, this bill represents a ``win-win'' for both the government and the commercial wireless industry, not to mention our nation's wireless users.  Under the bill's provisions, when executive branch agencies are required to relocate spectrum operations to a different spectrum band (or to switch to non-spectrum dependent facilities to transmit telecommunications), the agencies will have access to a trust fund from which their relocation costs will be paid. Relocation will be required when spectrum currently occupied by governmental entities is reallocated for commercial use.  If an agency is required to relocate its spectrum operations, the agency must be able to achieve comparable telecommunications capability in the new band (or with the non-spectrum dependent facilities).  Six months before the FCC conducts an auction of spectrum that has been reallocated for commercial use, NTIA (working in conjunction with the affected agency and OME) submits to the FCC a preliminary cost estimate and timeline for relocation.  For an auction of reallocated spectrum to be valid, the net proceeds of the auction must be at least 110 percent of the preliminary costs estimated by NTIA.  The auction proceeds, rather than being placed in the General Fund at Treasury, are deposited in a Spectrum Relocation Fund, from which relocation costs will be paid.  The relocation fund is administered by OMB in consultation with NTIA. OMB determines whether an agency's costs are legitimate and whether the agency's timeline for relocation is appropriate.  The Energy and Commerce Committee, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, and the House and Senate Appropriations Committees must be notified 30 days before money is transferred from the relocation fund to an agency. Also, the NTIA will be required to file periodic reports to apprise Congress of the progress being made to relocate in a timely and cost-effective manner.  I look forward to working with Mr. Tauzin, other Members of the Energy and Commerce Committee, other interested committees, and the Bush Administration to advance this legislation in a bipartisan fashion.                          ____________________
