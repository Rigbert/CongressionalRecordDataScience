 President, I rise today to offer an alternative to the timber management authorizing language in this bill. I offer my amendment because I believe the language included in the bill by my colleague, the senior Senator from Washington, will backfire. I believe it will hurt--not help--timber communities and workers in the Northwest.  The authorizing language contained in this bill is designed to accomplish three things: respond to a timber salvage problem resulting from last year's forest fires; speed up the rate of timber sales under the President's forest plan, option 9; and to release a few timber sales remaining from legislation passed by Congress 4 years ago.  These are goals with which I can agree. My problem is with the method. I believe the language proposed by my colleague will cause a blizzard of lawsuits, cause political turmoil within the Northwest, and take us right back to where we were 4 years ago.  Our region has been at the center of a war over trees that has taken place in the courtrooms and Congress for almost a decade. There is a history of waiving environmental laws to solve timber problems; that strategy has not worked.  It has made the situation worse. Until 1993, the Forest Service was paralyzed by lawsuits, the courts were managing the forests, and acrimony dominated public discourse in the region.  Now this bill contains language that will reopen those old wounds. I strongly believe that would not be in the best interest of the region.  Let me briefly explain my amendment, and why I think it makes more sense than the underlying bill. There are two distinct issues in question: salvage of dead and dying timber in the arid inland west, and management of the old growth fir forests along the Pacific coast.  There is a legitimate salvage issue right now throughout the West. Last year's fire season was one of the worst ever. There are hundreds of thousands of acres with burned trees sitting there. I believe these trees can and should be salvaged and put to good public use.  I believe there is a right way and a wrong way to conduct salvage operations on Federal lands. The wrong way is to short cut environmental checks and balances. The wrong way is to cut people out of the process. The wrong way is to invite a mountain of lawsuits.  The right way is to expedite compliance with the law. The right way is to make sure the agencies can make correct decisions quickly. The right way is to let people participate in the process--so they do not clog up the courts later.  I believe we can offer eastside timber communities hope, not only in the short term--by delivering salvage volume--but in the long term, too. By following the law, we can immediately harvest timber--and sustain it in the future--because we will not be tied up in lawsuits; we conserve our natural environment by not allowing poorly planned clearcuts to slide into salmon-bearing streams; and we protect human [[Page S4871]] lives by building roads that are rationally planned, not hastily built without planning.  The Chief of the Forest Service and many firefighters agree with me on this. I ask unanimous consent to have some letters and materials to that effect printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                   March 21, 1995.       Letter to The Editor: I would like to answer to the      editorial ``From timber to tinder,'' published in the March      15 Washington Times. It argues that Congress should pass      Representative Taylor's Bill that would eliminate all      environmental and economic rules for Forest Service timber      sales of 6 billion board feet, in the name of forest health      and firefighter safety. Linking this initiative to the 1994      firefighters' deaths is an insult to those that died and a      shameless appeal to emotionalism. I lost my husband of 21      years, and the father of our two young children, Jim Thrash,      in the Colorado fire last year. He was a smokejumper with 16      seasons of experience.       He also loved the forests. Jim and I owned and operated an      outfitting and guide business in the beautiful pristine      mountains of west-central Idaho. We took many people a year      into the backcountry to experience the ``wilderness''. He was      also the President of the Idaho Outfitters and Guides Assoc.,      which represents an industry that takes thousands of      Americans each year into the backcountry. Jim was very much      at home in the forests. He worked for responsible forest      management practices with a high emphasis on maintenance of      clean, free-flowing streams and quality wildlife habitat. He      knew, understood and advocated the use of fire in a more      natural role in the ecosystem as well as prescriptive fires      to aid in the restoration of natural conditions. He did not      support further roading of Idaho's roadless lands or the use      of clearcutting.       It is true that '94's fires were the result of the extended      western drought, but were also the natural fire cycles of      those ecosystems. There are those who are claiming that their      loved ones' deaths resulted from careless forest managers who      failed to log dead and dying timber elsewhere, resulting in a      shortage of firefighting resources. In reality, the Colorado      incident was not one of resource shortages, but one of      mismanagement. Firefighting managers and supervisors used      poor strategies (or had no strategies at all), and failed to      recognize and respond to the existing conditions (drought and      weather) and extenuating circumstances (resources shortages)      when making the decisions to put employees on the firelines.      Ultimately, this resulted in the deaths of 14 people.

Dear Madams or Sirs: I am writing to you regarding the      various ``Forest Health'' initiatives floating around      Congress these days. I am a wildland firefighter from McCall,      Idaho who has worked for the Forest Service as a helitacker,      a hotshot, and 12 years as a smokejumper. As I am sure you      understand, the opinions expressed herein are my own and do      not represent any government agency. Since I was smokejumping      on fires in Idaho and Montana last July, I was not on the      South Canyon Fire. Yet I lost good friends there, and I feel      a duty to them and to myself to speak out about the bills you      have under your consideration.       Given my knowledge of fire and the health of our forests, I      cannot support S. 391 (Federal Lands Forest Health Protection      and Restoration) or any incantation of Mr. Taylor's amendment      (The Emergency Two-Year Salvage Timber Sale Program), or Mr.      Gorton's Bill. I believe a reasonable amount of salvage      harvesting should be carried out, and I believe this can be      carried out successfully within the confines of current law.       I believe all these bills are based on the premise that the      salvaging cannot be done quickly enough to get the burned      wood before it becomes useless. But the evidence shows that      salvage has been occurring successfully in our forests. The      Boise National Forest successfully carried out the      historically biggest sale of any type in the Northwest as the      Foothills Salvage in 1992. The Forest Service anticipates      having all the salvage sales from the fires of 1994 on the      auction blocks by late this summer--with environmentally      sound analyses in place. I believe all of the bills mentioned      above call for forgoing this type of analysis. This does      nothing to help our forests. Given that it would be better to      have salvage available for harvest by the summer following a      burn, why not simply request that the Forest Service speed up      the analyses? Even in the present situation, they only need      to shave off three or four months to have salvage ready by      the summer following a burn. This could be easily done if      they were empowered (and given the necessary budget) to form      a salvage analysis team as soon as it became apparent that      there would be an opportunity for salvage. I believe this      change alone would shorten the process by three months.       Some of the bills mentioned above propose increasing the      national annual cut from four billion board feet to over five      billion board feet. I believe the lower cutting levels are      much more reasonable since they are based on an accurate      level of a sustained yield. If the cut is allowed to continue      at the higher level, at some point in the next decade or two,      yield levels will begin to fall, and they will fall below the      four billion level. This is the scientific advice given to      you by the Forest Service. I urge you to ask yourself, what      sustainable level of harvest can our forests support? Then      who will you listen to for advice, industry or land managers?       I talked to a logger friend just yesterday. He said, ``Why      not let the individual states and industry set the cut level      . . . Do you think they would cut themselves out of a job?      This is our land, not Congress' or some easterner's and we      know what is best for it.'' I told him that I had no doubt      that industry would cut themselves out of a job because they      are only concerned with short term profits.       A true commitment to community stability would help these      mill towns read the writing on the wall. Find other      specialties for their community that will increase jobs. The      real growth industries in Idaho are information technology      and recreation--tourism. People with jobs to offer come to      Idaho because of the ``quality of life.'' This includes low      crime, a lack of urbanization and a healthy natural      environment. We need to make sure that our forest and water      environments are maintained and not sold for short term      profit.       Let the land managers do the job they were trained to do.      The Forest Service will have all the salvage sales on the      auction blocks by this summer with environmentally sound      analyses in place. Mr. Taylor's bill calls for forgoing this      type of analysis, which does nothing to help our forests. And      to link any forest health bill to our fallen firefighters      mocks their deaths.           Yours truly,                                                   Patrick Withen.
