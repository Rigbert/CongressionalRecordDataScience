Madam Chair, ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell.'' What does it mean? It didn't make sense then, and it doesn't make sense now.  Just like the military helped end segregation based on race, we should have put an end to Don't Ask, Don't Telllong ago. It is an affront to human dignity and to the dignity and the worth of every man and woman serving in our military.  We cannot wait. We cannot be patient. We must end discrimination in the military, and we must end it now. Discrimination is wrong, and we must end it now.
