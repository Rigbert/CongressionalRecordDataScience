Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, S. 1275 will enable the Bureau of Reclamation to provide visitors to Hoover Dam an opportunity to buy educational materials. It also will allow material removed from the dam during recent rehabilitation work to be used to create memorabilia, otherwise such material would become surplus and require alternate disposal. Sales authorized by this legislation are expected to generate revenues which will reduce the cost overruns incurred in constructing the visitors center.  I urge support of S. 1275.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
