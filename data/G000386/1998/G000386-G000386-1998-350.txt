 President, I want the record to show that while I am not supporting the Kennedy amendment, I am supportive of many of the principles behind this amendment. I took the lead in sponsoring legislation (S. 701) last year to provide Medicare beneficiaries with consumer protections such as: (1) detailed comparative information and access to a 1-800 number for Medicare beneficiaries to choose the best health plan; (2) an expedited appeals process for urgent cases; (3) a prohibition on gag clauses that restrict patient/physician communications; (4) access to specialty care when needed, with special attention to the chronically ill; and (5) limits on theuse of financial incentives by managed care plans. Many of these provisions were enacted in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Often, Medicare sets the example for the private sector, and this is my hope.  I believe consumers should have good information about their health plans; that they should have protections in place for a fair and timely appeals process; that they should have access to specialty care when needed; and that physicians should be able to discuss all treatment options with their patients.  Regulating the private sector is more difficult because regulations cost money. These costs are shifted onto employers and ultimately employees. I will want to evaluate proposed legislation based on the impact this will have on employees' health benefits. I do not want to do anything to increase the number of uninsured, which is as much as 41 million Americans who lack health coverage. I commend my colleague from Massachusetts for raising this important issue, but as we all know ``the devil is in the details.'' I would like this issue to be debated and for legislation to be proposed and analyzed thoroughly for any unintended consequences to ensure that we are not doing more harm than good. We cannot afford to increase the number of uninsured and must be careful not to hurt those that currently have coverage.
