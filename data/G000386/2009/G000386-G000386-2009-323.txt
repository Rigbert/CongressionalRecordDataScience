 President, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator Kerry today to re-introduce the Empowered at Home Act for the 111th Congress. This bill is a continuation of efforts that I undertook in 2005 and again in 2008 to improve access to home and community based services for those needing long-term care. This is an important piece of legislation that continues our efforts to make cost-effective home and community based care options more available to those who need it.  In 2005, I introduced the Improving Long-term Care Choices Act with Senator Bayh. That legislation set forth a series of proposals aimed at improving the accessibility of long-term care insurance and promoting awareness about the protection that long-term care insurance can offer. It also sought to broaden the availability of the types of long-term care services such as home and community-based care, which many people prefer to institutional care.
