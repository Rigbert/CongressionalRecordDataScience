 President, I rise today in support of S. 240--the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.  Mr. President, Americans need to be assured that their investment are secure--that our money has been invested in good faith.  And, if an American investor has been the victim of fraud--no matter how big or little--how rich or poor--they should get equal treatment under the law.  Guilty parties must be held accountable.  Mr. President, I am not rich. I know that investments are risky. There is no guarantee that you will make money in the stock market, or the bond market, or on any investment.  I learned a long time ago--from my parents--that you should not invest money you cannot afford to lose. So, now as a parent myself, I am very conservative in my investments.  I believe in personal responsibility.  But, Mr. President, there is an appropriate Federal role in this process, as well. We cannot abdicate our responsibility to protect the American people.  And, Mr. president, we in Congress have a unique role in promoting investor confidence.  We have a duty to encourage critical investments--it is needed for capital formation--it is needed for economic growth and job creation.  This is especially true in my home State of Washington--where many consumers invest in small high-technology companies.  For Washington State and for the entire country--we must be vigilant to ensure proper protection for investors.  That is why I am a big supporter of the work of the Securities and Exchange Commission: Chairman Arthur Levitt and his staff do a great job in exposing fraud and protecting even the smallest of investors.  Section 105 of this bill gives the SEC new authority to sue for damages from securities fraud--so that victims of fraud will recover more of their losses.  Right now, Americans--who have been defrauded--have been getting only pennies on the dollar for their losses. Victims of fraud deserve better; they deserve more. This bill will help change that.  Mr. President, that is why this bill is so critical. It returns some common sense to our legal system.  I have been pleased to work with my good friend from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, on this legislation. He has provided real leadership on this issue together with the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici.  This bill is the best of bipartisan cooperation--it passed the Banking Committee by a vote of 11 to 4, with the majority of Democrats, voting in favor of this much needed reform.  I have heard from so many people in my home State of Washington on this issue. Many have told me the present system operates at the expense of the investors it was intended to protect--everyday, hardworking Americans.  We have all heard the stores of court cases which diminish investments. They inhibit job creation. They slow economic growth.  How many times do small business people settle suits out of court just to make them go away?  And, as I said, how many times do small investors--who have actually been the victims of fraud--only receive pennies on the dollar of their investment?  This bill returns power and benefits to the little guy. Sections 101 and 102 of the D'Amato substitute are critical in this regard.  This reform will provide a mechanism for real plaintiffs--instead of a few lawyers--to take charge of the cases.  That way, the interest of plaintiffs are taken into account.  And, investors are the ones who lose money when fraud occurs--they have a right to have more of a say in steering the course of litigation.  Right now, small investors lose out--we all lose out--because company resources are wasted on settling suits, instead of inventing new products.  Biotech companies waste their resources on settling nuisance lawsuits instead of finding the cure for AIDS and breast cancer.  High-technology companies waste their time and resources on legal fees--instead of giving us a cutting technological edge that will bring us into the 21st century.  I have heard from many of these companies in my home State. Companies such as these--new, growing, forward-looking--are a point of civic pride in the Pacific Northwest. They reflect the high-technology, high-wage economy of the future.  I have real letters from real people expressing the importance of this bill. I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                           The Northern Group,                                        Seattle, WA, June 1, 1995.     Senator Patty Murray,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Murray: I would like to voice my strong      support for Senate Bill 240. This long overdue legislation is      critical to the continued success of our nation's      entrepreneurial underpinnings.       It is unfortunate that our judicial system has allowed a      small group of unscrupulous attorneys to create such havoc      among the community of public companies, particularly given      the evidence that shows the lawyers as primary beneficiaries.       Enough! S. 240 deserves your full support.           Sincerely,                                                    Glenn Kalnasy,     President.                                  ____                                                   IMRE Corp.,                                        Seattle, WA, June 7, 1995.     Re Senate Bill 240.     Hon. Patty Murray,     U.S. Senator, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Murray: We urge you to continue to support SB      240, a bill which would reduce the ability of parties to      bring groundless stockholder suits. IMRE Corporation is a      small, publicly held, biomedical company which is seeking to      develop therapeutic products to treat patients with certain      immunologically mediated conditions such as rheumatoid      arthritis and difficulties with kidney transplants. Given the      investor environment for biotechnology companies, wide      fluctuations in a company's stock price can occur because of      rumors, perceptions, and other factors outside the control of      the company.       While there are circumstances in which shareholder suits      should be brought to protect investors, many stockholder      suits which are filed are based solely on a sudden drop in      stock price which may have nothing to do with information      that was or was not disseminated to the public by the      company. Groundless shareholder suits consume vital corporate      resources that should be used for more productive purposes      such as research and development.       If we can be of any assistance in answering questions that      you or your staff may have about this subject matter, please      call me at (206) 298-9400.           Sincerely yours,                                          Edward M. Yoshida, Esq.,     Director, Legal Affairs.                                  ____                                       Washington Natural Gas,                                        Seattle, WA, May 25, 1995.     Hon. Patty Murray,     Senate Russell Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Murray: I am writing to urge your support of      S. 240, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.      This legislation, designed to curb abusive securities suits,      is very important to Washington Energy Company (WECO). We      believe that it is time to restore balance and fairness to      the securities litigation system.       The number of shareholder suits have escalated dramatically      in recent years. Many are unsubstantiated, however, companies      are forced to address them in protracted and extremely costly      processes. In addition, these suits may produce indirect      expenses, such as insurance costs and stock price      fluctuations. As you may know, Washington Energy Company      currently is involved with a shareholder suit. While the      court dismissed the claim as one without merit, we've been      forced to commit considerable resources. These costs will      continue to climb as the decision has been appealed.       S. 240 seeks to establish disincentives against filing      frivolous suits. It encourages voluntary disclosures,      transfers control of suits from lawyers to investors, and      enhances ways to address bona fide shareholder claims.       The Senate Budget Committee soon will be considering the      ``Chairman's Mark'' which reflects a good compromise. Your      support would be greatly appreciated.           Sincerely,                                               William J. Wortley,     Vice President Public Affairs.                                  ____                                         Key Technology, Inc.,                                    Walla Walla, WA, June 5, 1995.     Re S. 240, The Securities Litigation Reform Act.     Hon. Patty Murray,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Murray: I am writing to express my support for      the provisions in the Private Securities Litigation Reform      Act (S. 240). This reform will benefit the growth of      companies, like Key Technology, that provide jobs and      economic expansion in our local communities. In addition, the      proposed reform will provide protection for those who have      invested these companies.       It is important that we work to provide a more fair basis      on which to establish the degree of liability for defendants,      to provide a safe harbor for statements by a company      regarding future economic performance, and to put an end to      litigation suits filed without any substantial evidence.       I am pleased to see that you are a co-sponsor of S. 240 and      encourage your continued support of this needed reform. Thank      you for taking a leadership position on this important issue.           Sincerely,                                                       Tom Madsen,     President.                                  ____                                              Whirlpool Corp.,                                  Benton Harbor, MI, May 24, 1995.     Hon. Patty Murray,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Murray: As a company with a constituent      facility in Redmond, I am writing to request your support of      the Securities Litigation Reform Act. Senate Banking      Committee Chairman D'Amato's substitute for S. 240 is      scheduled to be marked up in the Senate Banking Committee on      Thursday, May 25, 1995.       We especially request your support for a ``safe harbor''      which would correct the ``chilling effect'' on voluntary      disclosure of information to investors by providing companies      with protection from investor lawsuits based upon forward-     looking information. Disclosures that would be protected by a      safe harbor provision are predictive statements on business      trends, possible price movements and other market factors      which investors want and expect companies, such as Whirlpool,      to provide.       Unfortunately, the threat of private securities litigation,      should these predictions not be realized, is causing many      companies to hesitate before sharing such information. A      strong safe harbor provision will help correct the chilling      effect on disclosure and will force American businesses to      redirect their focus away from baseless lawsuits. In turn,      this will allow us to redirect scarce resources toward      competing more effectively in the global market place.       Thank you for your consideration of this important issue.      Please support the Securities Litigation Reform Act with a      safe harbor provision as it is considered in future Committee      and Floor action.           Very truly yours,                                                    Robert Kenagy,     Associate General Counsel.                                  ____                                        Darwin Molecular Corp.                                        Bothell, WA, June 6, 1995.     Hon. Patty Murray,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Murray: I am writing on behalf of Darwin      Molecular, a start-up biotechnology company based in Bothell.      It has come to our attention that the U.S. Senate is      contemplating SB 240, a bill that would dramatically reduce      the ability of lawyers to file meritless stockholder      lawsuits. I am writing to encourage your continued support      for this bill.       As you well know, high technology business and especially      biotechnology companies face many uncertainties on the road      to produce development. This is an industry whose potential      may continue to be in jeopardy because of the inherent      difficulty of balancing out the financial opportunities and      obligations against truly innovative scientific and medical      productivity. It is difficult enough to raise sufficient      funding to do useful and beneficial research without the      additional burdens imposed by other types of ``risks'' often      from individuals who may be looking to enhance their own      situations. New companies in particular are vulnerable to      these risks.       Reform legislation in this area would be extremely      beneficial not only to assist companies but most importantly      to provide a more productive marketplace for the ultimate      beneficiary, the consumer.       We thank you for your support of this bill.                                                Diane Isonaka,                                          Director, Scientific and     Business Development.                                  ____                                                 Conductive Rubber                                             Technology, Inc.,                                        Bothell, WA, June 6, 1995.     Hon. Patty Murray,     U.S. Senator, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Murray: As the President of a small, high-tech      company in Bothell, Washington, I am concerned about the S.      240 legislation drafted to curb the extravagant number of      meritless lawsuits filed against high tech companies. As it      now stands, the bill has been altered from its original      intent and purpose and no longer provides the ``safe harbor''      provision for forward-looking and predictive statements by      companies.       S. 240 is a modest, reasonable and balanced piece of      legislation which assured the right of private action as a      deterrent to fraud. The high-tech community has acted very      responsibly in their desire to provide access for truly      defrauded investors to sue for recovery. The U.S. House of      Representatives has already passed Securities Litigation      Reform Legislation by a veto-proof majority of 325 to 99.       I am asking you to support the original intent and purpose      of S. 240 by cosponsoring the bill and further to add your      vote to strengthening amendments for safe harbor, without      which reform will be meaningless for the high-tech community.       Please give your unqualified support to this important      bill. I look forward to the successful passage of S. 240 as      soon as possible.           Best regards,                                                    R.B. Lawrence,     President.                                  ____                                             Lease Crutcher Lewis,                                                  Contractors,                                        Seattle, WA, June 8, 1995.     Hon. Patty Murray,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Murray: I understand that the U.S. Senate is      considering a bill (SB 240) which would reduce frivolous      stockholder lawsuits. As both a small investor and an      employee of a company that provides services to high      technology companies, I strongly encourage your support of      such legislation.       High-tech companies, particularly high risk biomedical      companies, are susceptible to what amounts to extortion by      attorneys bringing meritless lawsuits. By nature, their stock      values fluctuate widely, and almost any sharp drop can      trigger a stockholder suit.       Officers of high-tech companies have become so fearful of      stockholder suits that disclosure of information of any type      can be a risky proposition. Such an intimidating business      atmosphere stifles the entrepreneurial spirit found in most      young high-tech enterprises.       Unscrupulous attorneys have stunted the growth of high-tech      companies, have cost the small investor money, and have made      themselves rich in the process. Again, I strongly encourage      your support of SB 240, as such legislation is a positive      step in limiting stockholder suits to only those cases which      have merit.           Respectfully,                                                     Mark Johnson,     Division Manager, Biomedical Projects.                                  ____                                      Eagle Hardware & Garden,                                                     June 2, 1995.     Hon. Patty Murray,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Murray: I want to express our thanks and      appreciation for your vote for Senate Bill 240. It is very      important for businesses and employees in the state of      Washington.       Eagle Hardware & Garden, Inc. had a basically unfounded      class action suit filed against the company by Steve Berman.      It was a frivolous suit and the insurance company will settle      the case, but we know these suits can damage a fledging      company and affect the price of the stock for all      shareholders.       Again, your vote for Senate Bill 240 is greatly      appreciated.           Very truly yours,     David J. Heerensperger.                                  ____                                          Hi-Rel Laboratories,                                        Spokane, WA, June 2, 1995.     To: Senator Slade Gorton, Senator Patty Murray.       Dear Senators: I would like to take a moment and thank each      of you for being cosponsors for S. 240.       As you know, we need strong laws to protect the rights of      the people, However, business needs support on many laws      which cause great harm.       We urge you to continue to support this bill and hope that      you will work hard to convince others that this bill as      written, needs to be passed and not a watered down version,       Hi-Rel Laboratories, Inc, and the American Electronics      Association will always stand behind a person who in fact has      a legitimate suit against a company, but to have the suits      for no reason other than to be able to settle a suit on an      un-earned basis just to make sure the defense lawyers have      income, borders on fraud.       Thank you again for the support.           Respectfully,                                                       John Level,                                                  VP Gen. Manager.
