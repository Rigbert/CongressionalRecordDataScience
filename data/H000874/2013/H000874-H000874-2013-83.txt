It won't affect the FAA, except in certain limited instances.  What do you think the morale of the people who work for us, the board of directors, is at this point in time? I will tell you: it's on the floor. That's not good for our country.  This is selective responsibility. Responsibility would be, let's fund government, and then let's debate these issues. We have debated this issue; and by the way, we won the debate in the election--not on this floor, in the election. But you refuse to accept the results of the election.  We are all going to vote for this bill; but I will tell my friends on both sides of the aisle, it is time for us to give respect to our nonuniformed Federal personnel because they are critical to the success of this country, to the success of our people. And we can argue about how large or how small our government is, but we should not argue about the quality of people that we want in the government. We should not argue about the fact that we want their morale to be high because they feel respected, because they feel wanted and worthwhile and that the missions they perform, whatever their role, are appreciated as important for the American people.  Any corporate head that you talk of and talk to and talk about will tell you you want to make sure your people understand that you believe in their worth. Because if you do not, you will not get what you want. We will all support this bill, but it is selective responsibility and will not excuse your rampant irresponsibility.                              {time}  2315
