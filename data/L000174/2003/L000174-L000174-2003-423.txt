President, I would like to take this chance to thank ental holdings1Total= 000>Chairman Stevens for his leadership in funding the Army Peer-Reviewed ental holdings1Total= 000>Breast Cancer Research Program at $150 million in this bill. I would ental holdings1Total= 000>also like to take a moment to enter into a colloquy with the ental holdings1Total= 000>distinguished chair of the Appropriations Committee about the report ental holdings1Total= 000>language in the committee report on cost-sharing in such medical ental holdings1Total= 000>research. Mr. Chairman, when I read this report language, it seems ental holdings1Total= 000>clear that the intent of the language is to determine if there is some ental holdings1Total= 000>way to contain medical research costs within the defense budget.ental holdings1Total= 000>  We all know that the Army Peer-Reviewed Breast Cancer Research ental holdings1Total= 000>Program, BCRP, has proven to be efficient and highly effective, and the ental holdings1Total= 000>committee has supported its efforts strongly. The flexibility of this ental holdings1Total= 000>program allows the Army to administer it in such a way as to maximize ental holdings1Total= 000>its limited resources. The BCRP is able to quickly respond to current ental holdings1Total= 000>scientific advances, and is able to fill gaps by focusing on research ental holdings1Total= 000>that is traditionally underfunded. It is also responsive, not just to ental holdings1Total= 000>the scientific community, but also to the public.ental holdings1Total= 000>
