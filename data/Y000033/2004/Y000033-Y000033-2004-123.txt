The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 593, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo).  Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, my amendment would make States eligible to receive section 410, Alcohol-Impaired Countermeasures grant funding to cover the cost of DWI vehicle impoundment programs.  The motivation for my amendment is the result of a very tragic death of one of my constituents. U.S. Navy Ensign John Elliott, who had just received his commission from the naval flight school in Pensacola, Florida, was struck and killed by a drunk driver on July 22 of the year 2000. The accident instantly killed Ensign Elliott and seriously injured his passenger, Kristen Hoinwarter.  Sadly, it was later discovered, and it was very sad, that the driver responsible for Ensign Elliott's death had been arrested for drunken driving earlier in the evening. He was released from custody, obviously while still being intoxicated, and returned to his car. Elliott was on his way home for his mother's birthday party when he crossed paths with the intoxicated driver.  Nearly 3 years after that tragic accident, his parents, Bill and Muriel Elliott, continue the fight to save other families from the grief they have endured. Lobbying the New Jersey State legislature, the Elliotts saw to fruition the drafting, passage, and ultimate enactment of John's Law. The law ensures that individuals who pick up an arrested driver sign a document accepting custody. Additionally, it gives State Police the authorization to impound the automobile of an arrested driver for up to 12 hours.  My amendment will encourage States to establish DWI impoundment programs for making them eligible for an existing grant program, helping them to defray costs. My amendment does not, I repeat, does not require States to enact impoundment programs, nor does it stipulate the terms of their programs, nor does it penalize States for not enacting such programs. And since funds come from an existing grant program, it will not cost the Federal Government a single penny.  We are making important strides to eliminate the senseless deaths caused by the lethal mix of alcohol and automobiles. Annual deaths from drinking and driving have decreased. However, much work remains to be done. Each death is a preventable one, and this amendment will go a long way to ensuring deaths like Elliott's are prevented, and families are saved from the pain that the Elliotts have experienced and other families have experienced across the Nation.  Mr. Chairman, I urge all Members to support my amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
