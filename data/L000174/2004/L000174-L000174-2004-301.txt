President, this afternoon, while debating my amendment on war profiteering, we became mired in a debate about what is or what is not in the criminal code.  I will not revisit that issue now. However, I will say to the senior Senator from Virginia, who asked from where the language in my amendment originated in the criminal code, that I have more information on that issue that should be to his satisfaction.  First, the term ``material'' appears in terrorism laws prohibiting ``material'' support. In fact, all falsity in the criminal code must ``material''. Pursuant to a Supreme Court ruling, part of proving a false statement must be ``material.''  Second, the term ``overvaluation'' is in Title 15 prohibiting ``criminally overvaluation'' of securities.  Third, with respect to ``intent to excessively profit,'' this is taken, in part, from ``significantly profit'' in 12 U.S.C. 1297 which criminalizes bank crimes. ``Significantly profit'' is, in fact, a lower standard that ``excessively profit.'' We erred on the side of caution and raised the standard.  Although I made this point clear during the debate, this should leave no doubt that my amendment is carefully constructed legislation.
