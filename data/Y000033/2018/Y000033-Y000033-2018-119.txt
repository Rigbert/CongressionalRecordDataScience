Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask the House of Representatives to join me in honoring the career and achievements of Chief Ronda Wallace of Kodiak, Alaska, who has served her community and the Kodiak Police Department with distinction for the past 20 years. Chief Wallace first joined the Department in 1997 as a Public Safety Dispatcher, and the next year was commissioned as a patrol officer. She steadily rose through the Department's ranks and held numerous positions including Narcotics and Investigative Detective, Patrol Sergeant, and Lieutenant, until becoming Kodiak's first female Police Chief in 2013.   Chief Wallace's leadership by example, care for the community of Kodiak, and compassion for its citizens have come to define the Kodiak Police Department. During her career she has gotten countless drugs off our streets, solved homicides, worked tirelessly to help women and children who are victims of abuse and assaults, and consistently raised the bar for professional police work. And, like all true leaders, her shining example will continue through the legacy she has created in Kodiak and the many people she has mentored, both within her police department and the community at large.  Throughout her 20-year career she has displayed the highest possible standards of police work, and is an inspiration to future generations of law enforcement professionals and public servants. I greatly appreciate and admire her selfless dedication to Kodiak, to her fellow citizens, to our great State of Alaska, and to our Nation as a whole through her cooperation with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Coast Guard Investigative Service.  Therefore, it gives me distinct pleasure to honor Chief Wallace today, and I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of Representatives join me in congratulating Ronda and wishing her continued success.                            ____________________
