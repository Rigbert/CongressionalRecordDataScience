President, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, is on his way to the Chamber. I know the time is running. I will speak until he arrives.

Mr. President, 45 of 50 States passed either a constitutional amendment or a law defining marriage as between a man and a woman--45 of 50 States.
