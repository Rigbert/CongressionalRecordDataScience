People's Utility Districts (PUDs) have consistently been at the forefront of this effort.  Emerald PUD, in my congressional district, is an excellent example of People's Utility Districts that have consistently demonstrated a commitment to delivering clean energy and conservation resources to their customers. Due to their relatively small size and local consumer ownership, PUDs are able to meet the unique energy needs of their community while also investing in local renewable energy resources.  For more than a decade Emerald PUD has offered clean renewable energy options to their customers. Their customers have the option to purchase a percentage--or all--of their energy from clean wind power sources. In addition, Emerald PUD regularly assists customers in gaining access to solar energy. Through generous assistance programs they have helped numerous area schools, businesses, and homes to install solar energy systems.  Beyond this investment in sustainable energy, Emerald PUD has made a priority of aiding local residents, industry, and businesses with energy conservation efforts. These projects range from weatherization of homes to the large-scale installation efficient lighting in industrial facilities. Through this sort of individually tailored energy consultation, Emerald PUD has facilitated significant energy savings for many customers who otherwise may not have had access to such resources.  Emerald PUD has demonstrated an extraordinary dedication to bringing clean energy and energy conservation resources to all of their customers. Notably, Emerald--and other PUDS--have shown that this can be done while still holding energy costs well below the national average.                          ____________________
