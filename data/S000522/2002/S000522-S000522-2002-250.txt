Mr. Speaker, as Chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I rise today to recognize Richard L. Glotfelty, the Associate Executive Director for Veterans Benefits of the Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA) on his retirement this month after 23 years of distinguished service for this national veterans service organization.  Mr. Glotfelty was born and raised in Eighty-Four, Pennsylvania. He began service with PVA in 1978 as a National Service Officer in the Pittsburgh PVA Service Office. He also served in chapter level positions at the Pittsburgh-based Tri-State PVA Chapter.  Following his move to PVA's National Office in Washington, D.C. he served in a variety of senior management positions. In 1990, he was selected to direct PVA's entire veterans benefits operation, the organization's largest department. In this capacity, Mr. Glotfelty oversaw PVA's National Service Officer Program designed to provide local and regional support and assistance to PVA members and all veterans through 141 full-time staff located in 54 field offices nationwide.  He was also responsible for the development of extensive training programs for PVA's professional corps of service representatives in both veterans benefits and medical services. These programs allow PVA representatives to provide VA benefits/claims assistance and to monitor the quality and quantity of health care services in VA's Spinal Cord Injury Centers across the country.  Mr. Speaker, Richard Glotfelty served in the United States Air Force from 1966 to 1969. A crew chief on an Air Force C-130 aircraft, he sustained a spinal cord injury in the line of duty while conducting air support operations in Thailand during the Vietnam War.  During the last 23 years, through Mr. Glotfelty's service and leadership, PVA's veterans service representatives have assisted hundreds of thousand of veterans, their dependents and survivors in applying for and receiving the benefits and medical services they have earned and deserve. He and Paralyzed Veterans of America can be rightly proud of this record of achievement in service to those who have served in defense of the United States of America.                          ____________________
