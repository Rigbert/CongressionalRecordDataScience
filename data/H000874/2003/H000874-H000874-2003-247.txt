I am not sure I understood.  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will yield, it concerned me when the gentleman said ``what the minority deems as a substitute.'' Obviously we need to look at all of these things individually and considerations need to be made.  For instance, one consideration is, is the substitute within the bounds of the Budget Act and the budget rules of this House? That may not be the qualifying issue, but that is one example of issues that we consider.  The bill marked up, at least, in the Committee on Ways and Means, I know the Committee on Energy and Commerce has not finished yet, but the billmarked up by the Committee on Ways and Means fits within the budget rules of the House.  So we have to look at everything on its own merits and make that decision, and the Committee on Rules will make that decision.
