It is also the fact, I think, if I am correctly informed, that they have found golden-cheeked warbler in many other different areas but because of the so-called habitat is the reason they classified it, but they never looked at the other areas to find out if there was an abundance of them there or whether in fact they could be helped in another area. They have taken this widow, this 70-year-old widow, invested the money in 1973, and taken her retirement away from her. I say that for those that are interested in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. This is your Government in action, with no science, only an agency's idea of how the act should be implemented. That is why I thank the gentleman for supporting my efforts to improve the act so that the American people can regain their faith in this Government and also protect the species. I thank the gentleman.
