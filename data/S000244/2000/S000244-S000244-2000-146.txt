Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to our distinguished colleague from Seven Valleys, Pennsylvania, the Honorable William Goodling. Bill Goodling has served his constituents and the nation in this body for more than a quarter century. In that time, he has proven himself a dedicated public servant, one who recognizes the importance of, as he says, quality over quantity and results over process.  That philosophy has been most apparent during his tenure as Chairman of the Education and the Workforce Committee. Over the past six years, Bill Goodling has worked tirelessly for fair and comprehensive education and labor policy. He has advocated returning control over our children's education to parents, teachers, principals, and local school districts because Bill knows that no one is better qualified to meet their educational needs than the people who interact with them every day.  In fact, very few among us are as well suited as Bill Goodling to championing the improvement of this nation's educational system. Prior to coming to Washington, he served his community as a teacher, principal, and coach. He even served as school superintendent, so he knows first-hand the educational needs of children.  From his development of the Even Start Program to aid parents in supporting this children's learning process and his support of the Ed Flex bill, to his push to increase the percentage of American children receiving quality education from the current 50 percent to 100 percent, we know that Bill Goodling has recognized the need to work today to create a better tomorrow.  I know I speak for many of our colleagues when I say that Bill Goodling's insight and experience will be missed. Thank you, Bill, for your many years of service, and good luck in your future endeavors.                          ____________________
