 Tim Johnson, a broadcaster who has long made Brattleboro's WTSA Radiohis home, was honored by the town of Brattleboro and the Vermont Association of Broadcasters.  Tim's love of radio and community affairs brought him to radio in 1974, and he has faithfully provided local news to listeners in Brattleboro and in Springfield, MA, ever since then. I have enjoyed knowing him and his work for several decades as we often meet at community meetings, conferences and press conferences in the Brattleboro region and across Vermont.  Brattleboro proclaimed Saturday, November 7, 2009, as ``Tim Johnson Day'' and celebrated with a cake. The same day, at their annual meeting the Vermont Association of Broadcasters heralded Tim for his distinguished service. Distinguished service helps sum up Tim's importance to southern Vermont. His contributions to his community and to Vermont broadcasting have been of the highest quality, and they have been steady. His many hours in the studio each week ensure that residents in Brattleboro receive news that is important, relevant and timely. It is regrettable that today's broadcasting environment sustains less of that kind of community service and community presence.  I know Tim will continue on this path of excellence, and I know that all Vermonters join me in expressing appreciation and admiration for his good work on WTSA.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of an article from The Rutland Herald be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Rutland Herald, Nov. 8, 2009]               Brattleboro--On-Air Celeb Johnson Honored                          (By Susan Smallheer)       Brattleboro.--Tim Johnson is the Energizer bunny of      Brattleboro radio: he's on the air day and night, whether      it's reporting breaking news, broadcasting local football      games and or promoting local food shelf fundraisers.       In fact, Johnson was on the air Saturday morning, not even      taking a break on ``Tim Johnson Day,'' hoping to garner some      donations for ``Project Feed the Thousands.''       Johnson, 53, a longtime radio newsman for WTSA AM & FM, was      honored by the town of Brattleboro last week with a      proclamation and a cake. The proclamation was paired with the      Vermont Association of Broadcasters announcement that Johnson      was honored yesterday for distinguished service at the      organization's annual meeting.       Kelli Corbeil, owner and general manager of the radio      station, nominated Johnson for the award.       ``He's the hardest worker at the radio station,'' said      Corbeil. ``I'm so glad he's on my team.''       By Johnson's own estimation, his love of community radio      lands him in front of a microphone anywhere from 60 to 80      hours a week.       Corbeil, who along with her late husband Bill purchased the      station in 2007, said that Johnson's devotion to local radio      news was obvious to everyone in Brattleboro and deserved to      be recognized statewide. ``I think he has a love and a      passion for it. He loves the community and I think the      community is important to him,'' she said.       Johnson first got into radio back when he was a senior at      Brattleboro Union High School, and as the representative of      the Future Farmers of America, appeared on a WTSA talk show      by Larry Smith, Johnson's predecessor at the news desk. He's      been doing radio news ever since, a total of 36 years.       Smith, who left TSA in 1997 for a job at Entergy Nuclear,      said that even at 17, Johnson had a noticeable voice.       ``Local radio news is a dying art as more stations are      purchased by conglomerates,'' Smith said.       ``If anything, Timmy has expanded the coverage. I don't      know what he doesn't cover. Every time I listen, he's been to      a meeting or a community forum. It's wonderful,'' he said.       ``With so many stations, you're lucky if you get the local      weather,'' Smith said.       After high school, Johnson landed a part-time job as an      announcer at cross-town radio rival WKVT in 1973, and      eventually left Brattleboro for four years to work at WCFR in      Springfield.       Johnson said he came back to his hometown in 1985 to WKVT      rather than go to a bigger market because the area was deep      in his heart, his parents' health was failing and then-owner      Dave Underhill was ``a news junkie just like myself.''       ``Bright lights? Big city? This is my home,'' he said.       Town Manager Barbara Sondag wrote the proclamation for the      Selectboard, and she said until she did the research, she      didn't grasp the scope of Johnson's community work.       ``I had no idea of all the boards he served on,'' said      Sondag. Johnson is currently working hard on Project Feed the      Thousands, the local food drive, as well as the local United      Way, Warm Hands Warm Hearts. In addition to that, Johnson is      also the town moderator in his hometown of Vernon, and also      serves as the moderator for the Brattleboro Union High School      annual meeting.       ``Tim Johnson has for 36 years continuously provided      accurate, reliable, respectful reporting of the issues      important to the citizens of Brattleboro,'' the proclamation      said.       ``Tim can be found at all emergencies, celebrations,      meetings and buffets across Windham County, regardless of      time,'' the proclamation went on with a touch of humor.       Johnson has a well-known proclivity for free food, she      said, as well as multi-tasking.       While covering selectboard meetings, he also ``watches''      Red Sox games on his computer, and keeps people posted on the      score, Sondag said.       And Johnson, whose real name is Tim Arsenault, has an      uncanny ability to report accurately on a meeting despite a      predilection for cat naps during late-night meetings, the      selectboard couldn't resist adding.       As the morning show anchor and news director, Johnson gets      up at 3 a.m. and heads into WTSA's studio in ``the new north      end'' of Brattleboro by 4:30 a.m. He is on the air by 5 a.m.       He works at least until mid-afternoon.       On a recent day, Johnson was busy juggling family, news and      his community commitments, aided greatly that day by instant      messaging.       Johnson and his wife Sue's 16-year-old granddaughter      recently started living with them, and there's plenty to      organize and do.       Smith, who actually hired Johnson to replace himself at      WTSA, said that Johnson is a consummate radio professional,      and overcame a stutter, as well.       ``The first time I ever heard him on the radio, there was      no stutter. He does commercials, he overcame that--quite an      accomplishment,'' said Smith.       In radio, the hardest thing, he said, is doing commercials.      ``You really have to concentrate and Timmy's production is      unbelievable and his ad libs are great too,'' said Smith,      himself a 30-year radio news veteran.       ``I'm delighted for him,'' Smith said.       ``This is really what I enjoy doing,'' said Johnson, his      newscast devoted this day to the local hospital's reaction to      the swine flu epidemic, a major water main break in town, the      upcoming Winter Farmer's Market and Feed the Thousands.       ``This is really what I enjoy doing and I want to do it for      50 years,'' Johnson said. ``That's another 14 years.''                          ____________________
