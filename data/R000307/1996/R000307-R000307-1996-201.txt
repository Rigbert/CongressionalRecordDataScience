Speaker, today I am introducing legislation concerning the Food Stamp Program and the electronic benefit transfer [EBT] system, on behalf of myself and Bill Emerson, the chairman of the Department Operations, Nutrition, and Foreign Agriculture Subcommittee, who is an expert in the food stamp and EBT programs. We are introducing this bill, along with other members of the Committee on Agriculture, because we believe that EBT systems, in which food stamp benefits are provided through a debit card system instead of coupons, are the preferred choice of delivering food benefits. The inspector general of USDA, in his testimony of February 1, 1995, before the committee, made it clear that EBT systems, while not eliminating trafficking in food stamps, were superior to coupons and a tool that can be used in tracking down persons abusing the Food Stamp Program.  It is vital that States be allowed to proceed with implementation of EBT systems for the Food Stamp Program. An element that is standing in the way of implementation of EBT is a Federal Reserve Board rule known as regulation E. This rule, among other provisions, would create a new entitlement to the replacement of food stamps for persons receiving their benefits under an EBT system. The bill we are introducing provides that regulation E will not apply to the Food Stamp Program.  The National Governors' Association supports exemption of State and local EBT programs from the regulation E provisions and have stated their opposition to unfunded mandates that are created by the liability provisions of regulation E. The National Governors' Association also stated that without this exemption, States will not be able to move forward with EBT.  For more than 10 years the U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA], at the direction of Congress, has been investigating the feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and general impact of using an electronic benefit transfer [EBT] system to issue food stamp benefits. Paper coupons are replaced and recipients use a debit-like card at the grocery store checkout. Counties in several States, including Pennsylvania, Minnesota, New Mexico, and New Jersey have implemented EBT and Maryland, Texas, Utah, and South Carolina have EBT systems statewide.  USDA has found that EBT administrative costs are lower than coupon issuance costs; that food stamp benefit loss and trafficking are reduced; grocery store costs are reduced; food stamp participants prefer EBT; and financial institutions also prefer EBT and their costs are reduced.  Law enforcement officials have spoken in favor of EBT because it provides an electronic trail of abuses in the program. While trafficking is not eliminated under an EBT system, incidental street trafficking is reduced considerably.  States want to move ahead with EBT. Regulation E rules stand in their way. Until recently, USDA viewed regulation E as inappropriate for the Food Stamp Program. USDA, in May 1993, stated its opposition to the applicability of regulation E to its programs because those programs do not fall under the jurisdiction of that regulation; legislation and regulations for the USDA programs already have provisions for benefit recipient rights and protection; and regulation E may reduce benefit recipient's services.  However, in June 1995, the Federal Electronic Benefits Transfer Task Force, represented by officials from the Office of Management and Budget, the USDA, and the Department of Health and Human Services, stated its opposition to removing regulation E applicability for the food stamp and other assistance programs. This is very unfortunate and this position is contrary to the positions of the National Governors' Association, the National Conference of State Legislators, the National Association of Counties, and the American Public Welfare Association.  According to a 1993 Department of the Treasury study, application of regulation E for State EBT systems would cost States over $800 million per year for Aid to Families with Dependent Children [AFDC], food stamp and general assistance programs. This represents an unfunded mandate to the States and many States have said they could cease EBT program planning and operations if regulation E is applied to them.  For these reasons we are introducing this bill today and urge our colleagues to support it.                                H.R. --       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Encouragement of Electronic      Benefit Transfer Systems Act''.     SEC. 2. AMENDMENT.       Section 7(i) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C.      2016(i)) is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``(7) Encourage electronic benefit transfer systems.--       ``(A) In general.--The disclosures, protections,      responsibilities, and remedies established under section 904      of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 1693b), and      any regulation or order issued by the Board of Governors of      the Federal Reserve System in accordance with such Act, shall      not apply to benefits under this Act delivered through any      electronic benefit transfer system.       ``(B) Replacement of benefits.--Any regulation issued by      the Secretary regarding the replacement of benefits under      this Act, and liability for replacement of benefits under      this Act, and liability for replacement of benefits under      this Act, under an electronic benefit transfer system shall      be similar to the regulations in effect for a paper food      stamp issuance system.       ``(C) Definition of electronic benefit transfer system.--As      used in this paragraph, the term `electronic benefit transfer      system' means a system under which a governmental entity      distributes benefits determined under this Act, or other      benefits or payments, by establishing accounts to be accessed      electronically by recipients of the benefits, including      through the use of an automated teller machine, a point-of-     sale terminal, or an intelligent benefit card.''.                       THANK YOU, WILLIAM C. AYRE                                 ______                          HON. JAMES A.
