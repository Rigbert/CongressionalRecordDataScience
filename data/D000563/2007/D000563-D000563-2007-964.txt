President, let me say at the outset how much I respect the gentleman from Virginia. I thank him for his leadership time and again thank him for all he has given to this county.  I rise in reluctant opposition to this amendment and I want my colleagues to know why. Within this amendment which establishes benchmarks is a provision giving the President of the United States the power to waive. What does it mean? The same pen the President used to veto our bipartisan timetable to start bringing the troops home will be used to make this proposal a nullity. It will not achieve the goals we want to achieve.  Unless and until the Congress convinces this President to change his policy and does it in forceful terms, this war will continue with no end in sight.  I urge my colleagues not to support this amendment that is before us, cloture on this amendment, because, frankly, giving the President a waiver is a guarantee nothing will change.  I yield the floor.                             Cloture Motion
