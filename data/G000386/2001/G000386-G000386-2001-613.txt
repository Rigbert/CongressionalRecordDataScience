 President, I yield myself such time as I might consume.  Mr. President, I, as I did yesterday, urge my colleagues to vote to confirm President Bush's nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services, the outstanding Governor of the State of Wisconsin, Tommy Thompson.  Statements made during yesterday's session by Senators from both sides of the aisle made it apparent that the qualities that have made Governor Thompson so successful in Wisconsin also make him an ideal choice to lead this very all-encompassing Department of Health and Human Services.  Governor Thompson is a problem solver. He is an innovator and really is a leader with a record of success, particularly during the 14 years he has served as Governor of the State of Wisconsin.  His record as Governor of the State of Wisconsin should show everybody that he is a person committed to improving the lives of real people. The impressive results he has brought about in his great State should inspire all of us. In fact, his success in welfare reform there inspired Congress to pass the Welfare Reform Act of 1996. He was, even while Governor, an advisor to many Members of the Congress who felt we ought to move people from welfare to work, move people from the fringe of our economic society to the center, to the mainstream of that society so they can benefit, as others do, from the dynamics of our economy.  Most Wisconsinites--94 percent--have health insurance because of his leadership. The disabled and elderly persons needing long-term care have a state-of-the-art support system to turn to, thanks to Governor Thompson's leadership.  Programs such as Pathways to Independence and Family Care are efficient and effective and are part of a reliable safety net program. They call the program he instituted in Wisconsin the Wisconsin Works Welfare Reform Program. It has helped the State reduce its welfare caseload by nearly 95 percent. Think of that: reducing the welfare caseload by 95 percent. This is good for government, but, most important, we do not have welfare reform to help government; we have welfare reform to help people.  The program that has been before the country for the last 4 years is not doing everything we want it to do. It is not good to have people on the fringe of our society, people who know no other life than a public check coming from the welfare office. That is not a humane way to treat people. It is humane in our society to help people who cannot help themselves, but for those people who can help themselves--and people generally, if given the incentive, do want to help themselves--we have the responsibility to move them from the edge of society into the mainstream of society. That is exactly what happened in Wisconsin.  More specifically, there was a program in place in Wisconsin before we adopted ours in Washington, DC, for the entire nation, and that program reduced the caseload by 95 percent.  Governor Thompson's record in Wisconsin is, indeed, impressive, and we are prepared, I believe, to confirm his nomination. He will bring a wealth of knowledge, a very positive outlook, and an innovative style to the national debate on welfare reform and to Medicare improvements, including prescription drugs.  Governor Thompson made it clear during his nomination hearings that he welcomes the opportunity to work with any Member, Republican or Democrat, who has a special interest or special concern. One only needs to listen to the glowing recommendations from the distinguished Senators from Wisconsin, both Democrats, to be assured of his commitment to bipartisanship. Such bipartisanship, if anything is going to get done, is dictated by the makeup of the Senate and the closeness of the Presidential election.  More importantly, it is the way that Governor Thompson has worked in Wisconsin. Obviously, it is the way he is going to work with us.  I look forward to his collaborative approach to getting the job done and urge my colleagues to join me in approving this nomination.  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time. Just in case there is an interest in speeding this nomination along, I am prepared to yield back any time I have left.  Before I sit down, Mr. President, I have this request from the leader.                          ____________________
