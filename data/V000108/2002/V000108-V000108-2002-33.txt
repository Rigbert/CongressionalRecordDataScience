Speaker, It is my distinct honor and privilege to congratulate five true American heroes. Adam Kirschner, Joseph Giorgio, Edward Szczepanski, Norman Schoon, and Richard Krame are World War II Army veterans who risked their lives to protect our freedom. These brave men will be honored on Sunday, November 3, 2002 at the Salute 2002 ceremony to be held at Munster High School in Munster Indiana.  Sergeant Adam Kirschner was raised in East Chicago, Indiana and graduated from Washington High School in June 1941. After serving in the Indiana National Guard, Adam was inducted into active duty in the Army on March 2, 1943. He participated in the Landing at Normandy on D-Day, and he continued to fight into Northern France and the Rhineland. Sergeant Kirschner scouted new terrain searching for minefields and enemy troops. He was subjected to heavy artillery, mortar, and small arms fire, but his superior skill and his desire to fulfill his duty guided him. Adam earned many medals and awards for his bravery, including the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart Medal. He separated from the Army on November 16, 1945, and returned to his wife, Theresa, in East Chicago, where they raised a loving family. Sergeant Kirschner has remained loyal to Northwest Indiana by participating in several service organizations, including the American Legion, Purple Heart Association, and the D.A.V.  Mr. Speaker, Joseph Giorgio was also raised in East Chicago and enlisted in the Army after graduating from Roosevelt High School. He joined the Army on August 3, 1944 and served in the Third Infantry Division, 30th Regiment, Company I. On March 15, 1945, Joseph was leading an attack with two other men against German forces in the town of Schmittviller, Germany. Joseph lost one leg and an eye after stepping on a landmine. The explosion alerted the Germans to the American position, and a battle ensued. During the battle, Joseph was shot by German forces and was left for dead. His two companions were also shot and were rescued by American forces later that night, but they left Joseph behind because he had lost consciousness and they believed he had lost his life. His miraculous will to live carried Joseph through the night, and when another battle began the next day Joseph called out for help and was rescued. Joseph was discharged from the Army on December 12, 1945, earning many awards, including two Bronze Stars, a Purple Heart, and the French Croix de Guerre with a Bronze Palm, the highest honor given to a soldier by the French Government, for his heroism.  Edward Szczepanski was called into service by the United States Army on April 11, 1941. After several months of training, Edward arrived in Ora Bay, New Guinea to begin what would be a 27-month tour of duty as a Technical Sergeant with the 38th Division, 151st Infantry. He risked his life in order to save the lives of others while fighting in New Guinea, the Philippines, and the Island of Corriegdor. He was awarded numerous medals for his bravery, including the Asiatic Pacific Theater Ribbon with five Bronze Stars, the Philippine Liberation Ribbon with Bronze Star, the Expert Rifle Badge, and the Good Conduct Medal. Edward was also selected to be a member of the Honor Guard for General Douglas MacArthur on his return to Corriegdor. Edward separated from the Army on October 4, 1945, and returned to his home in East Chicago, where he later married his wife, Dorothy, and raised a family while serving as an active member of the American Legion.  Mr. Speaker, Norman Schoon was a farmer from Wheatfield, Indiana before he entered the Army on January 25, 1943 at Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indianapolis, Indiana. Fewer than eleven months later, Norm was a Sergeant with the famed Golden Lion Division, the 423rd Infantry, 106th Division and fighting the German forces at the ``Battle of the Bulge.'' Norman was one of 7,000 American troops in his Division that were taken as prisoners of war and forced to endure harsh treatment by the German military. Four months after being imprisoned by the Germans, Norman was rescued by Allied troops on November 19, 1945. Norman separated from the Army on October 28, 1945 as a highly decorated and respected soldier. He later married his wife, Marti, and raised a family while becoming active in the VFW and the Purple Heart Member club.  Richard A. Krame joined the Army on March 10, 1943 at Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indianapolis. He was assigned to the 1st Brigade Engineers, who landed on Utah Beach in Normandy at 6:30 a.m. on June 6, 1944. Inclement weather forced the troops to fight only with small firearms. As the weather cleared, they were able to receive the supplies that they needed to fight their way off of the beach and into the heart of France. Richard fought in five engagements in Normandy, Northern France, Rhineland, Ardennes, and Central Europe. He also received the Croix de Guerre with a Star from the French Government, as well as many awards for his bravery from the Army. Richard separated from the Army on December 3, 1945, and is a proud member of his Schererville community.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other colleagues join me in thanking these five men, as well as our other former and current members of the United States military, for their braverv and valor in the face of danger. These men risked their lives in order to protect the freedoms that we enjoy each day, and they deserve all of our honor and respect. I am proud to represent them in the First Congressional District.                          ____________________
