In fact, in the 1999 bill they were able to purchase nearly 400 vests, many of those in the rural areas. If we get this through, now they can purchase 1,176 vests.  I say this because the Senate moved very quickly to pass a bill that increased the penalties if we harmed dogs or horses used by law enforcement. In other words, we could quickly zip this through and pass a bill saying the penalty will be increased if one harms a dog or horse used by law enforcement, but, whoops, we can't pass a bipartisan piece of legislation protecting the law enforcement officer himself or herself. I think of Alice in Wonderland, I have to admit, under those circumstances.
