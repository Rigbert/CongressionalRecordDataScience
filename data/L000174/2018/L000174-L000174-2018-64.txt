President, on behalf of all Vermonters, I would like to honor Enid Wonnacott of Huntington, VT, who this month will be inducted into the Vermont Agricultural Hall of Fame in recognition of her more than 30 years of agricultural leadership in Vermont and the Nation. Enid became the executive director of the Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont, NOFA-VT, in 1987, the same year that I became chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. Enid has been a national leader in advancing the importance of organic agriculture. She provided important technical and advocacy support as I worked on the National Organic Standards Act as part of the 1990 farm bill--which has in turn resulted in making organic agriculture a $60 billion annual industry--with Vermont as a leader. Thirty years later, Enid continues to provide advice on organic agriculture and nutrition issues.  Enid Wonnacott's many accomplishments are presented in detail in her much deserved nomination to the Vermont Agricultural Hall of Fame.  I ask unanimous consent to have the nomination printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:     Vermont Agricultural Hall of Fame 2018 Inductee Enid Wonnacott       Enid has served as the Executive Director of The Northeast      Organic Farming Association of Vermont (NOFA-VT) since 1987.      Over the course of her tenure, thanks to her leadership,      Vermont's organic industry has grown immensely, from just 57      certified farms in 1990, to more than 700, today. Enid has      worked tirelessly to help ensure all Vermonters have access      to local, organic foods, and began a pioneering farm share      program more than 20 years ago to provide subsidized farm      shares for low-income Vermonters. As the National Organic      Program was developed, Enid worked to implement a national      certification program that kept the needs of Vermont's family      farms at the forefront. Over the past three decades, she has      nurtured and guided more than 70 staff and 20 interns,      secured consistent grant and donor funding, and led NOFA-VT      to become a national leader in organic advocacy, food access,      and farm to school education. She has made an indelible mark      on both the local, and national, organic movement. Enid grew      up in Weybridge, and has lived on a small farmstead in      Huntington with her husband, Harry, and children, Lila and      Eli, for the past thirty years.                          ____________________
