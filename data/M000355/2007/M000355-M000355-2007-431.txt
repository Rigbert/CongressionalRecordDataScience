 President, let me just make the point that the key is how many votes are allowed. We were on this measure for 2 weeks last Congress; there were 32 votes. This processwill work fine provided we get votes and move along and follow in an orderly process. But if that breaks down, the Senator from Texas has a point, that we need to get some amendments in the queue and try to handle them as rapidly as we can.
