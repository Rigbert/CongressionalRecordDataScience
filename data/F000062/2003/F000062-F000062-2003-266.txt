S. Institute of Peace's 2003 National Peace Essay Contest, NPEC, Awards Week in Washington.  Mr. Kiley had been selected by the Institute as the California State winner as well as the national award winner for his essay, ``Kuwait and Kosovo: The Harm Principle and Humanitarian War.'' The U.S. Institute of Peace has sponsored the essay contest annually since 1986 in the belief that expanding the study of peace, justice, freedom, and security is vital to civic education.  I am proud of Mr. Kiley's exemplary essay, commend his dedication to this studies, and congratulate his teachers at Granite Bay High School. This young man, who is thoughtful and mature beyond his years, will be a leader in his future endeavors in peace studies.  I would like to bring to my colleaguess' attention a copy of Mr. Kiley's first place essay. I ask that it be printed in the Record.  The essay follows.       Kuwait and Kosovo: The Harm Principle and Humanitarian War       War causes harm; of this there is no doubt. In determining      the justification of war, the question hence becomes: when is      it justified to cause harm? The only morally acceptable      answer is that causing harm is justified if it prevents      further harm. Thus, in general terms, the only justifiable      reason to go to war is to minimize harm--if war is the lesser      of two evils.       Underlying the issue of just and unjust war is the concept      of sovereignty, for declaring war on a nation is a direct      violation of its right to self-government. This adds another      element to the harms calculation involved in justifying war.      Even the United Nations accepts the view that sovereignty has      inherent value, stating in a 1970 Declaration, ``Every state      has an inalienable right to choose its political, economic,      social, and cultural system, without interference in any form      by another state.'' Waging war against a sovereign nation      constitutes a direct violation of this ``inalienable right.''       In determining what circumstances justify violating a      nation's sovereignty, the laws governing the conduct of      individuals provide a useful analogy. In On Liberty, John      Stuart Mill establishes the Harm Principle, a criterion for      when it is justified to violate an individual's sovereignty.      Mill writes, ``the only purpose for which power can be      rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized      community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.''      Mill's aphorism can be taken a step further; it applies with      equal force to sovereign nations. Just as an individual's      freedom must be restricted if it harms other individuals, so      too must a nation's freedom be restricted if it harms other      nations. This principle, however, does not simply govern the      relationship between two warring nations, for today's complex      world is one of political interdependence. With the North      Atlantic Treaty Organization, the United Nations, the Arab      League, and other alliances, even those wars that are      relatively limited in scope are becoming ``world wars.''      Therefore, in applying the Harm Principal to the realm of      nation states, any just war standard must specify what      circumstances justify intervention by an international      coalition. International intervention in Kuwait and Kosovo      illustrate the success and failure of meeting just war      criteria.       In 1990, Iraq sent shockwaves around the world by invading      Kuwait, its small but wealthy neighbor. Within twelve hours      of the invasion, ``all of Kuwait . . . was under Iraqi      control.'' Following Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's      overwhelming victory, the resolve of U.S. President George      Bush quickly became apparent; he immediately declared that      the invasion ``will not stand,'' that ``no nation should      rape, pillage, and brutalize its     neighbor.'' In the five months between Iraq's invasion of      Kuwait and the dropping of the first U.S. bomb, Bush tried to      convince the American people, along with the international      community, that intervention was a moral responsibility.       At the time of the invasion, the depth of Hussein's motives      was unclear. Was he a power-hungry despot--another Hitler--or      was he simply trying to claim the territory he felt was      rightfully his? Would he stop with Kuwait, or did he have his      sights set on hegemony in the Middle East? While Hussein's      territorial ambitions remained uncertain, there were more      tangible consequences of appeasing Iraq's territorial gains.      Western oil interests in the region--and the fate of these      interests if Hussein were to gain control of OPEC--were      undoubtedly a weight on the scale. Moreover, beyond these      utilitarian considerations, the fact remained that      Kuwait's sovereignty had been violated, and according to      the Harm Principal, a military response was justified on      this basis alone.       When the war was over, the stated objectives of the United      States and its allies had been achieved: ``Kuwait was      liberated, Saudi sovereignty assured, Persian Gulf oil      secure.'' Given these results, the ejection of Iraq from      Kuwait was a just end, but a just end is only half of the      just war equation. For a war to be justified, the benefits      must outweigh the costs--the harm of action must be less than      the harm of inaction. Whether this was possible in the      Persian Gulf was a matter of much speculation. As with any      war, the loss of American lives was a foremost concern. This      concern led some--including General Collin Powell--to suggest      that economic sanctions might be a viable alternative to war.      In late 1990, however, it became increasingly clear that      sanctions would do little more than starve the Iraqi people.      According to a PBS Frontline report, ``the CIA was telling      President Bush it could take years for sanctions to drive      Saddam from Kuwait.'' Furthermore, it also became clear that      U.S. technology could enable the U.S. to fight a relatively      painless war, one with few U.S. lives lost and minimal      civilian casualties. And this optimistic outlook became a      reality, as the U.S. and its allies waged one of the most      flawless military campaigns in history. Thus, the Gulf War      meets the criteria of a just war: It achieved a just end and      minimized harms.       While the involvement of the United States in the Gulf War      demonstrates the validity of Mill's Harm Principle as a      justification for war, a key distinction must be made between      the Principle's applicability on an individual level and on a      national level. The constituent parts of an individual have      no inherent worth; it is only the individual himself that is      of value. Nations, conversely, are comprised of individuals.      Thus, the constituent parts of the nation are themselves      valuable. While Mill holds that morality demands the      individual be completely sovereign in his sphere--that no      just law could prevent him from harming himself--this is not      the case with nation states. For if the actions of a      government cause harm to its citizens, the sovereignty of the      nation and the sovereignty of the individuals conflict. And      on this basis, a case can be made for humanitarian war--     military intervention that prevents a nation from harming its      citizens, its constituent parts.       In the last decade, the most vivid example of humanitarian      intervention was the crisis in Kosovo, a ``paradigmatic      instance of humanitarian intervention in the very name of      humanity itself.'' There was little doubt, in 1999, that      Slobodan Milosevic's ethnic cleansing of Albanians      constituted a crime against humanity. While Milosevic's      actions did not directly harm another sovereign nation, they      so egregiously harmed his own people--so ``shocked the      conscience of mankind''--that international action was deemed      necessary. The end of saving Albanian lives was certainly      justified. In fact, the moral responsibility espoused by U.S.      President Bill Clinton was perhaps even greater than that      Bush spoke of in 1990. And aside from war, there existed no      viable option for fulfilling this responsibility. The means      employed by the Clinton Administration and NATO, however,      were inconsistent with just war principles.       The history of the Kosovo crisis is replete with      ``collateral damage'' to civilians. According to Jean      Elshtain, ``once we had exhausted the obvious military      targets, we degraded the infrastructure on which civilian      life depends.'' Largely as a result of high altitude      bombing by NATO forces, 2,000 civilians were killed and      6,00 wounded, and countless others would suffer and die      because of infrastructure destruction. This ``collateral      damage'' can be directly attributed to the ``no-cost''      strategy employed by NATO troops, which refused to risk      American and European lives even as the welfare of the      Serbian people hung in the balance. In the end, this      overemphasis on some lives and devaluation of others      undermined the moral authority of NATO's crusade. In ``War      and Sacrifice in Kosovo,'' Paul W. Kahn sums up this      contradiction well when he writes of the ``incompatibility      between the morality of the ends, which are universal, and      the morality of the means, which seem to privilege a      particular community.''       The incompatibility Kahn speaks of not only caused      unnecessary civilian causalties, but also expedited the very      atrocities NATO forces had entered Kosovo to prevent.      According to Elshtain, NATO attacked Milosevic to halt ethnic      cleansing, but ``our means speeded up the process, as the      opening sorties in the bombing campaign gave Milosveic the      excuse he needed to declare marital law and move rapidly in      order to complete what he had already begun.'' As a tragic      consequence, an estimated 20,000 Kosovo Albanians were      murdered by Serbs in the first eleven weeks of bombing,      compared with some 2,500 people that had died before the      bombing campaign. Thus, the just end NATO entered Kosovo to      achieve was not merely tainted, but completely undercut by      unjust means.       The United States' crusade to liberate Kuwait, along with      NATO's effort to free the Albanians from the torturous grip      of Milosevic, demonstrate two separate, but equally      justifiable criteria for waging war. In the case of Kuwait,      the Harm Principal criterion was met, as one sovereign nation      had harmed another, and a successful war minimized costs. But      in the case of Kosovo, a righteous cause was rendered unjust      by immoral means. The conflicts in Kuwait and Kosovo      demonstrate two situations in which sovereignty can be      justifiably violated and illustrate the necessity of just      means in waging war.                          ____________________
