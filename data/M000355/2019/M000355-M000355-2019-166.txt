 For months, the Republicans have been calling for bipartisan solutions to the NDAA, to the appropriations process, and more, but only in the last couple of days, here in mid-December, have our Democratic colleagues gotten sufficiently serious about these must-pass bills.  In the meantime, while we have waited on the House Democrats to act, the Senate has made good use of our floor time to complete the American people's business with respect to nominations. Last week alone, the Senate confirmed two executive branch nominations and put eight impressive jurists in seats on Federal district courts.  This week, we have considered yet another slate of the President's well-qualified nominees.
