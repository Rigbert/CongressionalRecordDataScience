 Con. Res. 12       Whereas credible reports indicate that thousands of Burmese      women and girls are being trafficked into Thailand with false      promises of good paying jobs in restaurants or factories, and      then forced to work in brothels under slavery-like conditions      that include sexual and physical violence, debt bondage,      exposure to HIV, passport deprivation, and illegal      confinement;       Whereas credible reports also indicate that members of the      Thai police force are often actively involved in, and profit      from, the trafficking of Burmese women and girls for the      purposes of forced prostitution;       Whereas the United States Government conducts training      programs for the Thai police and United States arms and      equipment are sold to the Thai police;       Whereas the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of      Discrimination Against Women requires all States Parties ``to      take all appropriate measures, including legislation, to      suppress all forms of traffic in women and exploitation of      prostitution of women'';       Whereas Article 1 of the 1956 Supplementary Convention on      the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions      and Practices Similar to Slavery calls for the complete      abolition or abandonment of debt bondage;       Whereas forced labor, defined under the 1930 Forced Labor      Convention as ``all work or service which is exacted from any      person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said      person has not offered himself voluntarily,'' is      internationally prohibited;       Whereas the 1949 Convention for the Suppression of Traffic      in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of      Others finds the traffic in persons for the purposes of      prostitution ``incompatible with the dignity and worth of the      human person,'' and calls on States Parties to punish any      person who procures for the purposes of prostitution, keeps,      manages or knowingly finances a brothel, or rents premises      for the prostitution of others;       Whereas Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and      Humanitarian Affairs John Shattuck has testified that the      United States ``urgently needs to encourage countries in      which trafficking of women and children goes on with impunity      to enact new laws, and to enforce existing laws. A particular      target of this stepped-up law enforcement      should be government officials who participate in or condone      trafficking, as well as brothel owners and traffickers'';      and       Whereas Secretary of State Warren Christopher stated before      the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights that      ``(g)uaranteeing human rights is a moral imperative with      respect to both women and men'': Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that--       (1) trafficking in persons violates the fundamental      principle of human dignity, and forced prostitution involving      physical coercion or debt bondage constitutes a form of      forced labor and a slavery-like practice;       (2) the United States State Department should continue to      press the Thai Government to strictly enforce all laws that      can lead to the prosecution of those involved in trafficking      and forced prostitution, including procurers, traffickers,      pimps, brothel owners, and members of the Thai police who may      be complicit;       (3) the State Department should ensure that Thai police      participants in the United States Government-sponsored police      training programs are systematically vetted to exclude those      who are implicated in trafficking and forced prostitution;       (4) the executive branch should take steps to assure that      weapons and equipment provided or sold to the Thai police do      not become available to members of those forces who might be      involved in trafficking, forced prostitution, or abuse of      women and girls who are apprehended;       (5) the State Department should urge the Thai Government to      protect the rights and safety of Burmese women and girls in      Thailand who are freed from brothels or who are arrested as      illegal immigrants because their status as trafficking      victims is unclear;       (6) the United States Agency for International Development      should target a portion of its assistance to Thailand for      AIDS prevention and control to the foreign population in      Thailand, particularly Burmese women and girls in the Thai      sex industry; and       (7) the State Department should report to Congress, within      6 months of the date of this resolution, on actions that it      has taken to advocate that the Thai Government implement the      above steps.
