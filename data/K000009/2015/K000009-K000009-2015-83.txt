Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be postponed.                    Amendment Offered by Mr. LaMalfa  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.  The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the      following:       Sec.__. None of the funds made available by this Act may be      used to deliver water to the Trinity River above the minimum      requirements of the Trinity Record of Decision or to      supplement flows in the Klamath River.  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 223, the gentleman from California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chairman, as was discussed earlier, California is seeing the most severe drought in many, many years. Our own Governor has recently ordered a mandatory 25 percent water rationing across the State.  Despite these dire conditions which have idled hundreds of thousands of productive farmland and caused billions of dollars in economic damage, the Bureau of Reclamation has unnecessarily diverted water from the Central Valley Project which serves the entire State, 20 million or more people, to salmon habitat in the Klamath River. I say ``unnecessarily'' because the chinook salmon of the Klamath River are not threatened or endangered and have, in fact, been returning in near record numbers.  Mr. Chairman, the Bureau has misused over 100,000 acre feet of water over the last 2 years, which will be enough for up to 800,000 people or even 30,000 acres of cropland.  What is more, stakeholders have already reached an agreement. All the stakeholders in the area have a previous agreement to ensure enough water for both humans and for salmon, according to the Trinity Record of Decision.                              {time}  0140  The Bureau's actions go above and beyond the requirements of the agreement and negatively impact the very stakeholders that agreed to it, including my constituents.  Two years ago, a bipartisan group from this Congress sent a letter urging the Bureau of Reclamation not to carry out this activity. Mr. Chairman, this amendment simply prohibits the Bureau of Reclamation from releasing water beyond the record of decision it is a party to and ensures that cities and farms have access to as much water as possible, especially during this acute drought period. It also maintains the river flows that stakeholders have agreed to and forces the Bureau of Reclamation to keep its promises to the people of California.  I reserve the balance of my time.
