 I congratulate him for that. I think all Members are proud that he was able to achieve that. I don't know what it had to do with health care. What it had to do with is the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill.  We had agreed to all of the amendments on a list but one. We said to the majority that we would eliminate the one. So I don't know why they can't take yes for an answer. We basically had an agreement on our amendment list but for one amendment which they objected to, and we said we would take it off the list. It strikes me rather than having a spirited debate about health care and other matters, we ought to agree to the amendment list and finish the bill.
