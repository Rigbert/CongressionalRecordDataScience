Speaker, I agree with the Chairman of the Committee on Rules. This is not a partisan debate. In fact, the Washington Times today, which is not known as a partisan advocate of the President's position, said in an editorial today, ``A vote too far.'' They said about this bill that is before us, ``This is simply the wrong time and the wrong way to make decisions about the most pressing foreign policy issue of the day.'' They then went on to say, ``The Republicans used to know this.''  Mr. Speaker, this is a nonpartisan debate. Jeane Kirkpatrick testified before the Committee on National Security, and at page 36 of the Reuters transcript, so that all of my colleagues will not think I selectively quote, in answer to a question by the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. McHale], Jeane Kirkpatrick, in the Reagan administration our ambassador to the United Nations, an advocate, with me, of lifting the arms embargo said this: ``I guess I think that the President's initiative, or his response in this letter,'' referring to the November 13 letter to the Speaker, ``makes it unwise for the Congress to pass a binding resolution in advance of the completion of an agreement.''  In a bipartisan way, I ask my colleagues to reject this rule, so that we do not debate the substance of this, but say that this rule ought to be rejected because the timing is not now, as the Washington Times so aptly stated.
