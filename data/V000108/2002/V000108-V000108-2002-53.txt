Speaker, it is with great honor and esteem that I wish to congratulate Reverend F. Brannon Jackson, who is celebrating his 36th year in the ministry. As the congregation at Calvary Institutional Church will attest, this praise is well deserved. Having overcome many obstacles in his life, Reverend Jackson serves as a role model for those wishing to start their life afresh and to have a positive influence over the lives of others.  To the benefit of Northwest Indiana, Reverend Jackson's arrival in Gary was, in his own words, ``God's will.'' In 1946, after serving in the military, he planned to visit his cousins in the city while en route to San Francisco. Once here, this young man from Mobile, Alabama abandoned his plans to travel west, for he felt strangely drawn to this area, in spite of its differences from his native state.  Until he received the call to the ministry, Reverend Jackson openly admits his early years in Gary were spent enjoying the frivolities in life. At the age of 22, eager to set himself on the path of success, he offered his skills as a welder to Gebraltar Insurance Company; later he secured other positions, first at Reliable Cab, and then at the Budd Plant. It was while at the Budd Plant that he accepted his call to the ministry. Incidentally, this call came disguised as a church hymn: while playing poker with friends, Reverend Jackson became agitated when a man began walking room to room singing these songs. He followed the man, intending to ask him to quiet down, but instead discovered the verses sung stirred a passion within his soul that has yet to be quelled. Under the direction of Reverend L.J. Harris and the New Mount Moriah Missionary Baptist Church, Reverend Jackson freed himself from the entanglements complicating his life and set his feet upon this path of righteousness.  Knowing his congregation would benefit from a minister well versed in spiritual, as well as secular affairs, Reverend Jackson began to challenge himself intellectually. He attended Chicago Baptist Institute and completed his GED, but his hunger for this intellectual development remained insatiable. Bolstered by his renewed faith in God and in himself, Reverend Jackson enrolled in Indiana Christian University, where he attained not only a bachelor's degree, but successfully earned a master's degree in religious arts.  Reverend Jackson's devotion to the Baptist Church is best reflected by the distinguished positions he has held and by the awards he has garnered during his 36 years in the ministry. He served as the president of the General Missionary Baptist state convention and the Indiana state convention. He lent his religious expertise to the National Baptist Convention, where he participated as an active board member. The culmination of his many years of dedicated service to the Baptist Church was achieved in 1998, when Indiana Governor Frank O'Bannon honored him with the Sagamore of Wabash Award, the highest award the governor can bestow upon a citizen.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring Reverend F. Brannon Jackson as he observes his 36th year in the ministry. His commitment to his faith, as well as his selfless contributions to his congregation, is worthy of our commendation. Reverend Jackson is one of many extraordinary examples of leadership and integrity characteristic of the citizenry of Northwest Indiana.                          ____________________
