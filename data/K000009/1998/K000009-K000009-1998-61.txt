Chairman, I just want to say for purposes of the record, this Member believes that life begins at conception. St. Augustine may not agree with me. The author of the amendment may not agree with me. We each make those decisions on our own. However, I would say to the gentleman that as far as the procedures we follow on committee, no one came to our staff, I as ranking member, and our legislative people, regarding this particular amendment. It is extremely complicated. Had I known, we would have asked for special hearings on this amendment. But I would say with all due respect to the gentleman, we were never afforded the opportunity to consider this. We did not know this was going to come up until just yesterday.
