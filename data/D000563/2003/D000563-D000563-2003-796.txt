Thank you for your leadership in bringing us to this debate. I ask you, to make certain this point is clear on the record, is it the position of the Senator from West Virginia that we all believe the world would be a safer place without weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, even without the leadership of Saddam Hussein, but that in order to be strong in our war on terrorism, we need the cooperation of countries all around the world which now are questioning our wisdom in pursuing this war in Iraq?
