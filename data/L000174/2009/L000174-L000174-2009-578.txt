President, today, Senator Hatch and I renew our bipartisan effort to improve and modernize our intellectual property laws. We are reintroducing the Performance Rights Act to ensure artists are compensated fairly when their works are used. I am pleased that performance rights legislation will be introduced in the House today, as well.  When radio stations broadcast music, listeners are enjoying the intellectual property of two creative artists--the songwriter and the performer. The success, and the artistic quality, of any recorded song depends on both. Radio stations pay songwriters for a license to broadcast the music they have composed. The songwriters' work is promoted by the air play, but no one seriously questions that the songwritershould be paid for the use of his or her work. The performing artist, however, is not paid by the radio station.  The time has come to end this inequity. Its historical justification has been overtaken by technological change. In the digital world, we enjoy music transmitted over a variety of platforms. When webcasters, satellite radio companies, or cable companies play music, and profit from its use, they compensate the performing artists. Terrestrial broadcast radio is the only platform that still does not pay for the use of sound recordings.  Radio play surely has promotional value to the artists, but there is a property right in the sound recording, and those that create the content should be compensated for their work. The United States is behind the times in this regard. Ours is the only Nation that is a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development but still does not compensate artists. An unfortunate result of the lack of a performance rights in the United States is that American artists are not compensated when their recordings are played abroad.  Artists should have the same rights regardless of the platform over which their work is used. All platforms promote artists and all platforms profit off the artists' work. Today, different rate standards and restrictions are applied to different music delivery platforms, with broadcast radio stations being uniquely and completely exempt. In the last Congress, Senator Feinstein chaired a hearing in the Judiciary Committee that addressed whether the time has come to achieve platform parity by harmonizing the terms and conditions for use of the statutory copyright license. Senator Feinstein has been a leader on this issue, and I am pleased to accept her offer to lead negotiations this year to develop a new standard that can be applied across platforms.  We also need to make certain that songwriters are protected in this process. Songwriters currently do receive compensation from radio stations. The changes made by this legislation, which will ensure performing artists are compensated, should not have any negative effect on songwriters. I will work closely with the songwriters and we will make sure that is the case.  In introducing the Performance Rights Act today, we are sensitive to the needs of broadcast radio stations; we are sensitive to the regulatory regime under which they operate; and we are particularly sensitive to the fact that it is not just artists, but also broadcasters that are facing a difficult economic climate. Rather than require all radio stations to pay fair market value to artists for the songs they play, the legislation includes special provisions for noncommercial and all but the largest commercial stations. In addition, every radio station can use a statutory copyright license to transmit sound recordings, instead of negotiating licenses separately in the marketplace.  Noncommercial stations have a different mission than do commercial stations and they require a different status. Our legislation, appropriately, permits noncommercial stations to take advantage of the statutory copyright license subject only to a nominal annual payment to the artists.  Similarly, we intend to nurture, not threaten, small commercial broadcasters. Smaller music stations are working hard to serve their local communities while finding the right formula to increase their audience size. We intend to foster the growth of these stations--nearly 85 percent of the radio stations in Vermont--and the legislation does that by also providing a flat fee option for use of the statutory license to the more than 75 percent of commercial music stations earning less than $1.25 million a year. This payment may only provide minimal compensation to the artists whose music is used by the vast majority of commercial music stations, particularly when viewed against the fair market value of the music, but by helping radio stations grow, artists, the stations, and the public will all benefit.  I am an avid music fan and much of the music I enjoy I first heard on the radio. There is no question that radio play promotes artists and their sound recordings; there is also no doubt that radio stations profit directly from playing the artists' recordings.  Traditional, over-the-air radio remains vital to the vibrancy of our music culture, and I want to continue to see it prosper as it transitions to digital. But I also want to ensure that the performing artist, the one whose sound recordings drive the success of broadcast radio, is compensated fairly. I will continue to work with the broadcasters--large and small, commercial and noncommercial--to strike the right balance.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bil was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 379       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
