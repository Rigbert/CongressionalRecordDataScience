First of all, I would like to commend Chairman Nussle of the Committee on the Budget for bringing this resolution to the floor. I am very pleased with the cooperative working relationship that has developed between our two committees.  As you know, the President's budget proposes an $8.6 billion, or 27 percent, reduction in highway funding, from $31.8 billion in fiscal year 2002 to $23.2 billion in fiscal year 2003. Most of this proposed decrease in funding is based on the revenue-aligned budget authority provision of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, otherwise known as TEA-21, which I continue to support in principle. However, it is simply too harmful to our State transportation budgets and our economy to allow such a dramatic funding cut to take place next year.
