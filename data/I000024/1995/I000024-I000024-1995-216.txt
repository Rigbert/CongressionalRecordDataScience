President, this morning, the leader time has been reserved, and there will now be a period for the transaction of morning business, not to extend beyond the hour of 10:15 a.m., with Senators permitted to speak for up to 5 minutes each.  At 10:15 a.m., the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 956, the product liability bill.  At that time, there will be 60 minutes of debate to be equally divided between the two managers. At the hour of 11:15, the Senate will begin a series of stacked votes on or in relation to second-degree amendments to the Dole amendment. Further rollcall votes can be expected today, and the Senate may be in session into the evening to make progress on the product liability bill.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
