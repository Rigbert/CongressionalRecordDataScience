President, I would like to let the entire Senate know how proud I am of Joyce Rouille, a wonderful person and someone who I am fortunate enough to call my friend. Joyce was recently named the Volunteer of the Week by the Burlington Free Press for her work at the Community Health Center in Burlington, VT. While Joyce may technically be retired, anyone who knows her will attest to her constant devotion to her family, church, and community. The time and love she spends each day on other people would exhaust any normal person. Joyce and Jack have shown all of us how to be good parents and good citizens.  I ask unanimous consent that the article appearing in the Burlington Free Press be printed in the Congressional Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, Jan. 22, 1996]                         Volunteer of the Week                          (By Beth Gillespie)       Joyce Rouille is enhancing her retirement by helping      parents at the Community Health Center of Burlington.       As coordinator of the CHC library, Rouille helps ensure      that patients have easy access to the hundreds of parenting      books and other materials.       She keeps track of the books patients take out, sends      notices for overdue items and generally keeps library      materials organized. She also helps with filing, billing,      mailing and other clerical work in the center's main office.       ``Joyce does anything we ask her to,'' says CHC director      Alison Calderara. ``She's totally committed and always here      when we need her. It's been really nice to have her around.''       Rouille lives in Burlington with her husband, John. She      enjoys sewing, seasonal crafts, gardening and quilting.       ``After you stop working, you don't want to just sit in a      chair and do nothing. I really do enjoy working at the      center--the staff are very outgoing and friendly,'' Rouille      says.                          ____________________
