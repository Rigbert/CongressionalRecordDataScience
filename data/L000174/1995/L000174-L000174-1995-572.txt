President, imagine a government, a democracy, whose officials withheld information about its involvement in the death of one of its citizens, and lied about its knowledge of the torture and death in a secret prison of the spouse of another of its citizens.  Imagine if at least one of the people connected to those atrocities had been trained by that government, paid by that government, and continued to receive payments of tens of thousands of tax dollars even after the government knew of his crime.  It would be bad enough if I were talking about a foreign government, but I am not. I am talking about the United States, where an American citizen, Jennifer Harbury, practically had to starve herself in order to get her government to admit that it had information about the fate of her husband, Efrain Bamaca, who disappeared in Guatemala in 1992.  Ms. Harbury fasted for 32 days before she was told that, contrary to what she, I and other Senators had been told by both the Guatemalan Government and the State Department, her husband had been captured by the Guatemalan army and tortured.  The Guatemalan army, many of whose members were trained in the United States at the School of the Americas, claimed Mr. Bamaca had shot himself. Then, when it turned out that someone else was in the grave where they said he was buried, they denied he had ever been captured.  Then they tried to discredit Ms. Harbury, who unfortunately for them was not intimidated. Two years ago a witness told her that her husband had been captured alive and tortured, but she could not prove it and the administration did little to find the truth until the press stories about her hunger strike became too embarrassing.  Even today, the Guatemalan army denies it captured Bamaca, and the Guatemalan Government says it has no information about his fate even though it has had the information for at least a month.  Mr. President, I was sickened, as were we all, by the murder of the Jesuit priests in El Salvador, by soldiers trained in the United States. Almost as bad was the attempt of the Salvadoran army, including the Minister of Defense who for years had been coddled by American officials, to cover up its involvement in that heinous crime and so many other atrocities there.  But here we have a situation where the CIA, presumably believing by some twisted logic that it was furthering some national interest, reportedly paid a Guatemalan colonel, probably one of many, who it believed was involved in torture and murder.  The CIA continued its payments to Colonel Alpirez even after it had information about his connection with the murder of an American citizen, Michael DeVine.  According to reports, the CIA sent millions of dollars to the Guatemalan military even after the Bush administration cut off military aid on account of the Guatemalan military's cover-up of the DeVine murder.  I remember that, Mr. President, because I was among those who urged the cut-off of aid, and I was assured by the State Department that it had been cut off. Now we learn that was false, because the CIA was secretly keeping the money flowing.  The CIA withheld information about Colonel Alpirez' involvement in the DeVine and Bamaca murders, even while President Clinton and State Department officials were saying publicly that the U.S. Government had no information.  And now we have reports that the U.S. Army and the National Security Agency not only may have known about those murders, but may have recently tried to conceal their involvement by shredding documents.  Mr. President, that is deplorable. What national interest does that serve? What is served by the CIA withholding information from the President of the United States? What message does it send, for our Ambassador to be telling the Guatemalan army how much we value democracy and human rights, when the CIA is paying them to commit torture and murder, and to betray their own Government?  Those soldiers knew there were criminals in their own ranks who were on our payroll, while our Ambassador was making lofty speeches about human rights.  The State Department said it had stopped aid to the Guatemalan military to send a message about the murder of Michael DeVine, while the CIA was subverting that policy by paying them under the table. What national interest did that serve?  You would have thought we learned our lesson after so many similar episodes during the 1980's in Central America, but obviously the CIA never did. It orchestrated the overthrow of the Guatemalan Government in 1954. During the Reagan years, the CIA repeatedly behaved like it was above the law, and apparently little has changed. Even when the sordid truth came out, the CIA's response was that it had not known about Colonel Alpirez' involvement at the time the crimes occurred. What a typical, feeble attempt to hide its own responsibility during the years since.  Mr. President, our goals in Central America today should be unambiguous. They are democracy, human rights, civilian control of the armed forces, and economic development for all people. Absolutely no national interest is served by subverting those goals.  Before we lecture the Guatemalans about democracy and human rights, maybe we should pay attention to what is going on in our own country. I am very encouraged by reports that President Clinton has a governmentwide review of these allegations, and has said that anyone who intentionally withheld information will be dismissed. That would send a strong message that there is a price for this kind of outrageous behavior.  I am also pleased that the White House has ordered that all documents relating to these allegations be preserved. I only wish someone had thought to do that weeks or months ago.  [[Page S4843]] Jennifer Harbury has been trying to get the facts about her husband ever since she learned for sure that he was captured alive. She still does not know when her husband died, how he died, who killed him and what was done with his body. She is like the widows and mothers of tens of thousands of other Guatemalan victims of the army's brutality and impunity, but at least one would hope that her own Government would give her whatever information it has that might lead to answers.  Any information concerning the fate of Ms. Harbury's husband should be promptly turned over to her.  Mr. President, the deaths of Michael DeVine and Efrain Bamaca are but two examples of the tragic consequences of many disgraceful relationships our intelligence agencies have cultivated in Central America. They have given money and protection to the worst criminals. They have withheld information from the White House, the State Department and the Congress, and from American citizens who are the victims of their intrigues. They have even behaved like criminals themselves.  What is this intelligence for? It causes the murder of innocent people. It corrupts. It obstructs justice. It is contrary to our policy. There is no national interest in that.  Mr. President, with a new director of intelligence about to take office, it is long past time to take whatever steps are necessary, and I mean whatever steps, to ensure that this kind of activity stops once and for all. People paid by the CIA should be warned that they will not be shielded if they commit murder or other gross violations of human rights. And the Congress should have prompt access to information from any government agency about the fate of American citizens or their relatives. If the law needs to be changed to make that happen, then let us change the law.                          ____________________
