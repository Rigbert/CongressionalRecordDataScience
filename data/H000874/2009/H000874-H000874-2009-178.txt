Now, there will be changes. There will be amendments. There have already been amendments in the three committees and those have been online.  So, I think the gentleman's concern is correct. We share it. We want to make sure the public has the opportunity to know what is being done, that we transparently have the specifics for the American public to know what we are doing and for the Members to have that knowledge, and we intend to do that.  Now, whether or not we are going to have a timeframe in which somebody can have a townhall meeting, which may take a month to notice and get together, I think you would be shocked if I responded to you that, oh, sure, we will just wait around until you have your town meetings. So I am not going to say that. But I do appreciate the gentleman's point, which is we want to make sure the public does in fact have notice.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. Well, I thank the gentleman and I appreciate his answers today. The one thing I would say, I did this townhall in Bakersfield, California, where I did no notice, I didn't do a mailer, and gave enough opportunity. We have an opportunity now to know we will be in past October. I had 3,000 people, that is 1 percent of the whole city's population, turn out, and very engaged, very knowledgeable of the bill itself.  So I just hope the opportunity comes that knowing maybe there is a different number on this bill, but it is still H.R. 3200, that the public would be able to see it. And I will tell the gentleman that the Republicans on this side have a lot of ideas about health care, a lot of bills out there, of ways that we can lower the costs, take care of preexisting conditions and actually make health care much better for all Americans.  I appreciate the time and yield back.                          ____________________
