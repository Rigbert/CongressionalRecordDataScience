 President, it is my honor to welcome Father Jim Trainor to the Senate this morning, but I think it was his honor to be escorted to the President's chair by one of the great men of the Senate, Senator Strom Thurmond. I am sure one of the things that Father Trainor will take from this experience is, not particularly the fact that he gets to see Senator Carper and me--he sees us all the time at home--but the fact he got to meet Strom Thurmond, the legendary Strom Thurmond.
