 President, the conference report (105-252) on Department of Agriculture appropriations includes $34.4 million for resource conservation and development [RC]. The conferees note that this increase in funding is not specifically earmarked for any initiative but should be used for approved RC Councils waiting for funding. I agree that the Natural Resource Conservation Service [NRCS] should prioritize funding for newly approved RC Councils. These councils provide much needed assistance to watersheds and conservation districts seeking to maximize the environmental benefits of their conservation programs. RC Councils should be funded. RC is a very important program for protection and prudent development of our Nation's natural resource base. Working through local RC Councils, this program helps enhance our ability to meet economic objectives within the context of a wise and sustainable use of our natural resources. In Washington State, a State rich in natural resources, RC offers the chance to meet the challenges of threatened resources in the face of demands for continued economic development.
