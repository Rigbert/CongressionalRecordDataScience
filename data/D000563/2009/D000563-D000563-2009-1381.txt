President, I rise to oppose the Cornyn amendment and urge my colleagues to oppose it as well.  On January 30, President Obama issued Executive Order 13496 to inform Federal contractor employees of their rights under Federal labor law. Under the Executive order, there are 120 days of rulemaking to prescribe the size, form, and content of this notice to be posted. In other words, it is underway at this moment.  I am opposed to this amendment because we didn't restrict the ability of former President Bush to inform employees of Federal employers of their labor rights. We should allow President Obama the same opportunity.  I urge Members to vote no.
