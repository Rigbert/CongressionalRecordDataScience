Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker's table the Senate bill (S. 2873) to extend the authority of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa to hold court in Rock Island, Illinois, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.  The Clerk read the title of the Senate bill.
