President, on August 16, I had the honor of attending a naturalization ceremony at the Ethan Allen Homestead Museum in Burlington, VT, conducted by the Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Vermont, Christina Reiss. This naturalization ceremony was especially timely as the Senate had in June voted strongly in favor of passing a comprehensive immigration reform bill. I am proud of the Senate's work on that legislation, and especially proud of the thorough process we had in the Judiciary Committee to give that legislation a fair and public hearing.  I have attended many naturalization ceremonies over the years and never fail to come away inspired by the process and by the participants. Judge Reiss' most recent naturalization ceremony was a reminder of how meaningful American citizenship is, and of what an accomplishment it is for those who earn it. Judge Reiss invited me to address the new Americans, but I was particularly moved by her remarks to the 10 new Americans who were naturalized as citizens of the United States that day.  Judge Reiss delivered a positive, uplifting, and powerful message to these men and women about what it means to be an American. Her message to them was one of hope. It was also a challenge to be the transformative force that so many immigrants have been for America throughout our history. Judge Reiss encouraged their civic participation and commitment to our constitutional values. She called upon them to be full participants in our democracy, to exercise their rights and their responsibilities by voting, and to embrace the rule of law. And Judge Reiss' remarks were a warm Vermont welcome to the 10 new citizens who chose to make Vermont their home.  As I listened to Judge Reiss deliver her remarks, I reflected on my own family's history of immigration and the experience of my wife Marcelle's mother and father who became citizens and made Vermont their home. I hope the message they heard when they swore the oath to become citizens was as inspirational as the one Judge Reiss delivered this summer in Vermont. And I hope the 10 new American citizens we welcomed together on August 16 will take her words to heart as they begin this new chapter in their lives.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Judge Reiss' remarks of August 16, 2013, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:        Remarks by United States District Judge Christina Reiss Delivered at the Ethan Allen Homestead Museum in Burlington, Vermont,                             August 16, 2013       Ladies and Gentlemen:       It is my honor as Chief Judge of the United States District      Court for the District of Vermont, and as an American      citizen, to address you on this special occasion. You are      about to undergo an important transformation for which you      have carefully and thoughtfully prepared. By the end of this      ceremony, you will be a United States citizen.       I am sure that you had many thoughts and feelings as you      went through the process of becoming a United States citizen.      I want to assure you that you are not alone. Most people      here, including me, have had family members who went through      this very same process. America is a land of immigrants. With      the exception of Native Americans, we all come from other      places. Like you, our family members made sacrifices and      faced challenges in order to live in this country. We made      this country our home. You have made the important decision      to make it your home. This is exciting and important for both      you and for our country. Your transformation is our country's      transformation. Our country gains strength and becomes a      better place with the contributions of our new citizens.       You are about to take a solemn oath. In that oath, you will      claim the United States as your own country and you will      renounce allegiance to all others. You will swear to support      and defend the Constitution, and the laws of the United      States. And you will promise that you will bear true faith      and allegiance to this country. I want to talk with you      briefly about what some of those promises mean.       As you know, the United States of America was created      through a declaration by its citizens that it would, from now      on, be a free and independent nation. The Declaration of      Independence also recognizes that we are all created equal,      and that we are all entitled to ``life, liberty and the      pursuit of happiness.'' Those rights are not just something      written on a piece of paper. Those rights represent an      agreement between us, as fellow citizens, regarding how we      will treat each other. Those rights also represent an      agreement between us and our Government, regarding what we      may expect from our Government, and what it may expect from      us in return.       You, too, will be able to enjoy the freedoms guaranteed by      the United States Constitution. But as always, with any right      comes responsibilities. In accepting the benefits of American      citizenship, you likewise accept its responsibilities.       Our society, our freedom, depends on the rule of law. The      rule of law requires that every person obey the laws of this      country. No person and no organization is above the law. The      rule of law is thus an agreement of the citizens of this      country to obey the law, to defend it, and to uphold it. The      rule of law is what makes our country safe, free, and      productive.       If you disagree with a law, you may work to change it. You      may vote, you may exercise your freedom of speech, you may      seek elected or appointed office, and you may petition the      Government. In this country, we encourage citizens to get      involved and to work to change the country and its laws for      the better.       I know that some of you may come from countries where this      opportunity was not available to you. Indeed, you may come      from places where by seeking to change a law, you put your      life in danger. Here, your right to lawfully seek change will      be fully protected.       I urge you to exercise all of your rights and      responsibilities as a United States citizen. The right to      vote is endangered each time you fail to vote. The freedom of      speech is threatened when you do not express your opinions,      and stand silent when you should speak up. It is also      threatened when you do not tolerate the views of others, or      allow their rights to be violated. The rights of all citizens      must be protected, if you expect your own rights to be      protected.       Before I end my remarks, I want to say a few things about      Vermont because I believe that you have chosen to live in a      very special place. As you know, Vermont was not one of the      original 13 colonies to sign the Declaration of Independence,      but it was the first state to forbid slavery in its own      constitution in 1777. Vermont has often been at the forefront      of this country in protecting human rights. This is a special      place. It is a beautiful place. Enjoy it, cherish it, and      make it your home. You are welcome here. President Dwight D.      Eisenhower said something about Vermonters which I think is      very true. In speaking to the people gathered at the State      Dairy Festival in Rutland, he said:       ``There are certain things I do know about you. I know that      Americans everywhere are the same, in their longing for      peace, a peace that is characterized by justice, by      consideration for others, by decency above all, by its      insistence on respect for the individual human being.''       It is my hope that your life in the United States is      characterized by justice, by consideration for others, by      decency, and by insistence on respect for all human beings.       In conclusion, I wish simply to say, ``Welcome my fellow      American citizens. Welcome, my American brothers and      sisters.'' I wish you success and happiness in pursuing the      American dream.                          ____________________
