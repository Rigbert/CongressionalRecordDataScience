President, as a neighboring agriculture State, it is a pleasure to work with the Senator from Kansas, in fact both Senators from Kansas, on numerous issues that provide for important research, relief, and aid to our States. I ask that language be included in the conference report indicating the urgent need for additional scientific personnel at the Southern Plains Range Research Station in Woodward, OK, near our joint borders, through the Agricultural Research Service in order to establish a Center for Warm-Season Grasses Research at the station in fiscal year 2010.  The Southern Plains Range Research Station is a research unit of the USDA's Agricultural Research Service. It has a mission to conduct research that addresses the challenges and opportunities associated with managing America's rangelands through innovative production practices and improved plant germplasm. The current research program at the station includes a team of three scientists: a ruminant nutritionist for range-livestock production research, a research agronomist for germplasm evaluation, and a geneticist for breeding improved plants. The goal of establishing and developing a Center for Warm Season Grasses Research would be improved plant materials management alternatives for rangelands and pastures in the southern plains. This center would provide a focused effort in native and introduced warm-season grass research to address issues with biofuels and feedstock production which is a critical issue to farmers and ranchers throughout the country. Additional personnel are needed to accomplish this mission. The addition of these two essential scientists will assist the Southern Plains Range Research Station in working towards its goal of establishing itself as the Center for Warm-Season Grasses Research in the south central United States.
