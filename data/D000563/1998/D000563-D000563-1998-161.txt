DASCHLE. The Senator from Illinois is absolutely correct. We don't have to use Social Security trust funds. We don't have to use the surplus to pay for a marriage penalty amendment. We can find an appropriate offset and delineate that offset, which is what I think is the responsible thing to do. There was no delineation of an offset in the previous amendment, so one has to assume that the Republican amendment was, again, more of a demonstration of rhetoric than genuine effort to provide responsibly-funded tax relief. The rhetoric we get from our colleagues on the other side that they will not use the Social Security trust funds. The facts are otherwise. For example, in this amendment, $100 billion in Social Security trust funds were likely to be used.  There is a difference between our approaches to fiscal responsibility, protecting Social Security, and providing tax relief. I think that ought to be made clear in the Record. We will have an opportunity once more to debate that this afternoon.
