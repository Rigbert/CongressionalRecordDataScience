Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to close.  Mr. Speaker, working to improve taxpayer service is no easy task. Every person in this body agrees on the importance of better access to quality taxpayer service, whether it is online, over the phone, or in person.  The IRS is a complex organization that is responsible for a core function of our government. We asked for input from Members of Congress, Federal agencies, and the public. When we reached out, we were responsive and thoughtful. We will continue to work to improve the IRS, to support their staff, and to put taxpayers first.  Again, I want to thank my friend, the gentlewoman from Kansas (Ms. Jenkins), the subcommittee members, and all of the staff for their hard, great, and good work for this bill.  Most important, Members of Congress must remain focused on doing what is right, what is just, and what is in the best interests for every American taxpayer. I encourage all of our colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 5444.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
