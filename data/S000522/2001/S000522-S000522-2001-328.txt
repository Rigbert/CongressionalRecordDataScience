Mr. Speaker, I offer an amendment in the nature of a substitute.  The Clerk read as follows:       Amendment in the nature of a substitute offered by Mr.      Smith of New Jersey:       Strike all after the resolved clause and insert the      following:       That the House of Representatives--       (1) expresses its sincerest condolences to the families of      the 42 people killed in the March 6, 2001, explosion at the      Fanglin elementary school in the Jianxi province of the      People's Republic of China, including to the parents and      families of the 37 young children who lost their lives as a      result of this dangerous and forced child labor; and       (2) expresses its gratitude to the Chinese and      international journalists who reported the true cause of the      explosion in response to the Chinese Communist Party's      original attempts to put forward an ``authorized'', but      false, version of the events.
