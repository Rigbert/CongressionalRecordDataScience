 Madam Speaker, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers), my good friend, is simply incorrect in his statements that this bill does give blanket immunity for various types of sexual harassment and sexual molestation. Because the bill is being considered as amended, the amended version of the bill that is before the House now, on the bottom of page 7, says nonapplicability to certain claims. And it says: The limitation on liability provided by subsection (a) does not apply to an action or claim arising out of a Federal, State, or local antitrust, labor, environmental, defamation, sexual assault, fraud, sexual molestation, freedom of expression, sexual harassment, tortious interference of contract law, or civil rights law or any other Federal, State, or local law providing protection from discrimination.  So this exemption very clearly deals with the objection that has been expressed by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers). The bill does not provide any immunity whatsoever for all of these types of activities and claims that I have mentioned.  Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Souder).
