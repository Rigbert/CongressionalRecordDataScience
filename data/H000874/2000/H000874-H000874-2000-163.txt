Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, the reason I do so is, I understand that the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Wynn) is on his way. He is going to offer an amendment and withdraw it. But he wants to make the point similar to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Quinn) with reference to the FDA consolidation at White Oak, which is in his district.  The President included over $100 million for the FDA consolidation in his request. That is a consolidation which was supported by the Reagan administration, by the Bush administration, and now the Clinton administration to save very substantial dollars in terms of leases that exist all over the Washington metropolitan region with respect to the FDA.  Some of those leaseholds are very aged and very inefficient. The fact that FDA is spread over such a wide area leads to a lack of efficiency in the operations of its responsibilities.  I know the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Wynn), when he gets here, will make it very clear that this is something that we think is supported in a bipartisan fashion.  This is an item that was not included in the budget, as was the Buffalo courthouse project that the gentleman from New York (Mr. Quinn) just referred to because of the fact that we had insufficient funds. However, I know that the administration will be looking very carefully at this bill as it moves through the process and is very supportive of adding the FDA money back in as it is in adding the courthouse money back in as well as I know the chairman is. So I am hopeful that we will have the requisite dollars to get there.  The facility in question, which, again, is in the district of the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Wynn) is a facility which is vitally needed. It is a facility that has been in this administration's plans and certainly the Bush administration's in terms of planning.  To delay this, as I said in my opening comments, will cost millions of dollars because it will prolong the payment to leaseholds and leasehold expenses as we fail to consolidate and provide space at the White Oak site.  The particular project in question is a little over $100 million for lab space for FDA and additional office space as well. It will be a more efficient and effective use of space than currently exists.                              {time}  1645  So that I would hope that we could see that amount added to the bill at the appropriate time.
