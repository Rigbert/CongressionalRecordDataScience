 I am disappointed. It takes forever to get anything done in this body, and we have a situation now where we have seen a process develop in the Committee on Veterans' Affairs by which there has been bipartisan support. It is kind of the way things are supposed to be done. Yet because of the objection, we are going to be unable to move forward in the way I think most of the Members want.  Thank you very much. I note the absence of a quorum.
