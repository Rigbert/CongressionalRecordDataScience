 I thank you so very much.  I also want to thank my longtime ally in defense of the first amendment. We have worked together for 10 years now, Tam Somerville and I. She is from the staff, who is also in the stress reduction program, along with Alison McSlarrow and myself, as this matter pops up from time to time. Thank you again for your outstanding service to the country in helping us protect our ability to participate in the political process. And Lani Gerst, of my staff, who assisted Tam, has done yeoman's service. I thank her as well.  I yield the floor.  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.
