President, first, I thank the minority leader for his comments. I said before he came in that there is no issue more meaningful to our people in Oklahoma than health care. I think there is an awareness. If you look at the polling data that was given by the Senator from Arizona, people are now aware this is not the way we should go.  We do have good ideas on this side of the aisle in terms of the health savings account, medical malpractice, and small businesses getting together to resolve this problem.                          ____________________
