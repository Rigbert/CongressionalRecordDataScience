 President, I was not able to participate in today's debate and vote on the extension of the national debt limit. I was attending the funeral of a great civil rights leader in Delaware, Jane E. Mitchell. Had I been here to vote, Mr. President, I would have cast a symbolic vote against an extension of the debt limit. Today's fiscal mess, the transformation of historic surpluses into record deficits, is not an accident. It is the inevitable outcome of policies that consistently ignored evidence and experience.  When we launched out on a course of tax cutting, with expanding domestic and international obligations and responsibilities, many of us in Congress argued that we could not afford to do everything, that we needed a fiscal policy that matched our revenues with our expenditures. Some tax cuts, especially for the middle class, were needed, tax cuts that could have revived job growth and aided economic recovery. Instead, we have a policy that calls for permanent tax cuts that overwhelmingly favor those who are already well off. When twice the administration asked us to appropriate funds for our military actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, I stood here on the Senate floor and said that we should pay for those obligations with smaller tax cuts for our wealthiest taxpayers, and not just pass the bill on to all our children.  We are here today because that advice was ignored, those hard choices were ducked, and the bill for our decisions will be sent to our children and grandchildren, in the form of the additional debt we will authorize today. It did not have to be this way, Mr. President. In the next Congress, the threat of massive deficits, which have made us increasingly dependent of foreign lenders to stay afloat, will still be with us. My symbolic vote against raising the debt limit would have been a protest of the policies that have brought us to this point, and a demand that we change course.  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.
