President, I rise as a strong supporter of Amtrak, recognizing the tremendous potential that advanced rail-passenger technology can play in developing our nation's 21st Century economy.  Amtrak has a distinct and important relationship with the state of Illinois. Chicago is the headquarters of one of Amtrak's three Strategic Business Units and the Intercity Business Unit, which manages all passenger trains in America with the exception of the Northeast Corridor and West Coast services. Downtown Chicago is also home to one of the three nationwide Reservation Call Centers. Amtrak also operates over forty trains per day in Illinois, with a total ridership in excess of 2.5 million passengers. Illinois has first-hand experience with Amtrak's current services and recognizes its future potential.  The Congress has also understood Amtrak's potential. In last year's Taxpayer Relief Act, the Senate and House provided $2.3 billion in Amtrak capital investment to make our federally owned rail passenger carrier a strong contributor to our nation's mobility. Congress also worked diligently to enact the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997. With the authority conferred on it by this legislation, Amtrak now has the ability to undertake the organizational restructuring and operational fine-tuning necessary to realize the full benefits promised by the $2.3 billion in capital funding.  An integral component of the reform envisioned by this legislation was the timely selection and seating of an ``Amtrak Reform Board'' comprised of directors with fresh ideas and experience in dealing with the business world. We must ensure that the Administration moves swiftly enough to avoid the consequences of failing to appoint a new Amtrak Reform Board by the statutory deadline, July 1, 1998. Quick action on this matter will allow Amtrak to maintain the authorization mandated in the law signed last December.  I am hopeful that the President will move quickly to appoint the seven directors required under the new law. These appointments should include professionals experienced in the leasing and financing of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment and people familiar with debt rescheduling and refinancing, which are among tasks tailored to Amtrak's business needs.  I would also encourage the Administration to make certain that these appointments fairly represent the various regions of the country, and Illinois is certainly deserving of such representation. Amtrak provides service to over thirty cities in Illinois. In addition, Amtrak employs some 2,200 Illinois residents, with earnings totaling over $50 million per year. Regional representation will also ensure that the diverse interests of our regional economies can be brought to the table for equitable decision making in the Amtrak Boardroom.  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues who support Amtrak will join me in encouraging the Administration to submit qualified candidates, women and men with the knowledge and experience required to strengthen our national system of passenger transportation, to the Senate as soon as possible.                          ____________________
