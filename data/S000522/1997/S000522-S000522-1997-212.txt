Mr. Chairman, I strongly support House Joint Resolution 36 to endorse the Presidential finding and release international family planning funds on March 1.  Family planning programs are common sense. Democrats and Republicans ought to put partisan differences aside and come together to support population assistance. Mr. Gephardt and Mr. Armey have set an excellent example of bipartisanship by cosponsoring this important bill.  U.S. population assistance aid is critical to our world's future. The high rates of population growth in developing countries affect Americans through its impact on the environment, immigration, and the economy. Unintended pregnancies threaten the society of developing countries as well: it can put economic development at risk, it damages the health and economic status of families, and increases the abortion rate.  Mr. Chairman, I urge this Congress to support family planning services. It is not a pro-choice or pro-life issue; it is a pro-family issue. This vote today is very important. If we don't vote to release the funds on March 1, we will reduce this year's total population assistance program funding by $123 million. At least 17 worldwide programs will need to defer, suspend, or terminate family planning health care services. The consequences of the delay would be enormous; there would be more unintended pregnancies, more abortions, and more maternal and infant deaths, and more economic and environmental strain on families and societies.  Opponents of this legislation argue that we should place extreme restrictions on health care providers who receive U.S. aid. I oppose this draconian policy: denying families the right to plan their childbearing is wrong. Access to birth control is good for children, good for families, good for the environment, and good for the society. I urge my colleagues to vote to support House Joint Resolution 36 and release the previously appropriated family planning assistance funds on March 1.
