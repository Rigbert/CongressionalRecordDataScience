President, today I am introducing legislation along with my colleague Senator Clinton, that establishes a Medical Education Trust Fund to support America's 144 medical schools and 1,250 graduate medical education, GME, teaching institutions. These institutions are national treasures, they are the very best in the world and deserve explicit and dedicated funding to guarantee that the United States continues to lead the world in the quality of its medical education and its health care delivery system.  The Medical Education Trust Fund Act, METFA, of 2001 recognizes the need to begin moving away from existing medical education payment policies. The primary and immediate purpose of the legislation is to establish as Federal policy that medical education is a public good that all sectors of the health care system must support. This bill ensures that public and private insurers share the burden of financing medical education equitably. As such, METFA will be funded through three sources: a 1.5 percent assessment on health insurance premiums, Medicare, and Medicaid. The relative contribution from each of these sources is in rough proportion to the medical education costs attributable to their respective covered populations.  GME is increasingly becoming hostage to fights over larger questions about the solvency and design of the Medicare system. The very commission entrusted to protect the integrity of the Medicare program, MedPAC, itself has succumbed to political and idelogical pressures by recommending that the GME program be removed from the Health Insurance Trust Fund and thrown into the appropriations process. I cannot stress stronglyenough how important it is to reject this recommendation. To subject GME to the annual appropriations process does nothing more than to put a vital program in direct competition with many other important federal priorities in a budget that the Bush Administration is already severely constraining. We have seen this first hand in working through the 2002 budget, where the current Administration has proposed to cut a large portion of the Pediatric GME program to fund other programs. Leaving this program unprotected, will incite the same type of particularized special interest advocacy that we see emerging in other areas of health care. I urge my colleagues to reject this dangerous notion and instead call on all of you to support the concept embodied in this bill.  This legislation, METFA, is not my innovation. It is an idea, pioneered by our former colleague, Senator Moynihan. This bill recognizes that medical education is the responsibility of all who benefit from it and must therefore share in the responsibility to support it. As Senator Moynihan once said ``medical education is one of America's most precious public resources.'' He understood that despite the increasingly competitive health care system of our time, that medical education was a public good, that is, ``a good from which everyone benefits but for which no one is willing to pay.''  Some health reformers argue that in fact, GME does not meet the requirements of a public good and that therefore, an all-payer system is nothing more than a form of taxation. I beg to differ. Health care is not a commodity. While we can and should rely on competition to hold down costs in much of the health system, we must not allow it to bring a premature end to this great age of medical discovery, an age made possible by this country's exceptionally well trained health professionals and superior medical schools and teaching hospitals. Indeed, through the NIH and the tax code we have successfully and robustly, subsidized the development of new wonder drugs, and I certainly don't think anyone is suggesting that we change this policy, my legislation complements a competitive health market by providing tax-supported funding for the public services provided by teaching hospitals and medical schools.  The legislation we introduce today is only the beginning. It establishes the principle that, as a public good, medical education should be supported by a stable, dedicated, long-term source of funding. To ensure that the United States continues to lead the world in the quality of its medical education and its health system as a whole, the legislation would also create a Medical Education Advisory Commission to conduct a thorough study and make recommendations, including the potential use of demonstration projects, regarding the following: alternative and additional sources of medical education financing; alternative methodologies for financing medical education; policies designed to maintain superior research and educational capacities in an increasingly competitive health system; the appropriate role of medical schools in graduate medical education; polices designed to expand eligibility for graduate medical education payments to institutions other than teaching hospitals, including children's hospital.  The services provided by our nation's teaching hospitals and medical schools, groundbreaking research, highly skilled medical care, and the training of tomorrow's physicians, are vitally important and must be protected in this time of intense economic competition in the health system.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 743       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
