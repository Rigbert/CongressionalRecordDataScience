 I thank the Senator from California.  I ask unanimous consent that at 5 o'clock today the Senate proceed to the consideration of the following nominations en bloc: Executive Calendar Nos. 28, 29, 30; provided further that there be 15 minutes of debate equally divided between the chairman and ranking member. I further ask unanimous consent that following that debate, the Senate then immediately proceed to three consecutive votes on the confirmation of the nominations, with no intervening action or debate; provided further that, following those votes, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.
