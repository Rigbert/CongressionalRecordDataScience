 President, I offer my personal congratulations and all good wishes to Jeri. I think she is going to be a superb Secretary of the Senate. What most people don't know about Jeri Thomson is that not only is she a talented professional, but she is a very nice person. She and I had knee surgery at approximately the same time, and I really never had a better friend during that period. She sent me books to read, made phone calls, even sent me a special pillow that could be used to help the pain from one knee to another. It was a wonderful gesture.  In the course of discussions about our relative injuries, over the past almost year now, I have come to know her very well. This is truly a distinguished woman because it is very hard to be an excellent professional and also to take the time that is necessary to reach out a hand to make someone feel a little bit better.  Jeri, you are all of the above. Congratulations and godspeed.
