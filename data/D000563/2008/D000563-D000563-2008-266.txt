President, it is time for this debate. No, this debate is overdue. It is about time the American people understand the choices we are making on the floor of the Senate. Every month this President asks us for $12 billion to $15 billion to wage the war. Is it paid for? No. It is added to the deficit. We are told we have to do it; we have to do it, not just for the troops--no one wants to see the troops go without--but because it is our moral responsibility, according to the Bush administration, to rebuild Iraq. We liberated them. We removed their dictator. We have lost over 4,000 of our best and bravest lives and thousands injured. But month after month, the administration tells us we need to spend $10 billion to $15 billion on the war in Iraq.
