President, I also ask unanimous consent that letters of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                           Letters of Support       My name is Kevin Riggins from Lincoln, IL. and I would like      to tell you my story. On Sep. 3, 2002, my wife and I lost our      son, 16 year old, Sean Riggins to a heart attack brought on      by the use of ephedra. Sean was a healthy, active student      athlete with no health problems overt or latent. Sean played      football, wrestled, and was a ``Black Belt'' in Tae Kwon Do,      and while he excelled in each sport, he and his teammates      strived for more. To ``enhance'' their performance in      football they began taking dietary supplements containing      ephedra. Because of the current FDA rules concerning dietary      supplements, or more precisely the lack thereof, my son lost      his life.       As you may or may not know, dietary supplement companies      fall under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act      (DSHEA) and NOT under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act. Under      DSHEA, supplement companies do not need a license to      manufacture these products, nor do they require a medical or      science professional to formulate and create said products.      As a result, there are numerous companies that are owned and      run by persons with no more than a high school diploma, in      fact, I know of at least 3 owners that have State and Federal      convictions for a variety of offenses including drug      possession and distribution. Imagine a high school graduate      convicted felon formulating the mixtures and dosages for      these products.       There are no good manufacturing processes set in place for      these companies, which means that dosage requirements and      contents are irrelevant due to the lack of standardization.       There are no requirements for adverse event reporting to      the FDA. If a supplement company receives a report that their      product injured someone, the company can and in certain cases      has thrown the AER away.       These are but a small sample of the problems with this      industry and that is why I support any and all efforts to      reign in these lawless companies.       As an honorably discharged decorated veteran, I applaud      requiring adverse event reports turned in by military members      to be reported to the FDA. Our soldiers, sailors and airmen      deserve this protection. They put themselves on the line and      tell our enemies ``you will not pass'', and for that we must      accord them every protection.       If I sound somewhat bitter, I am. If I sound driven and      committed to reigning in these types of corporations, I am. I      lost my son. You cannot know that pain, that emptiness, that      hole in your soul when you lose a child unless you have been      there, and I pray that none of you ever have to experience      that. Please, help our service men and women, my brothers and      sisters in arms. Pass this amendment. Let them know that      somebody gives a damn. Let me know somebody gives a damn. Let      Sean know.           Thank you.     Kevin S. Riggins.                                  ____       My name is Debbie Riggins. My son, Sean, died of a heart      attack almost 3 years ago at age 16 due to ephedra. That day      changed my life forever. I still struggle with the memory of      that day; the moment I saw the life drift from the eyes of my      only child. As Sean started high school, he thought of what      he might want to do with his life. He considered a life in      the armed services. He never got that chance. He was robbed      of the chance to do many things.       Now it's time for the military to set an example to the      private sector; a chance to show the Nation that it truly      cares about the health and welfare of its troops. We are      asking the military to track and report adverse event reports      of their troops. Since the pharmaceutical companies have been      so lax and unprofessional in their reporting practices, many      events are either being diagnosed incorrectly or being swept      under the rug. The military should be an example for the rest      of the Nation. The armed services is a more controlled      environment and would thus be a more consistent reporting      base reflecting truer figures and facts.       It's already a tragedy when a family is informed that their      loved one has been killed in action but to later discover      that it was from an uncontrolled herbal supplement while they      were deployed is even worse. It's ``chemical warfare meets      friendly fire''.       Protect the service men and women as they protect us.     Debbie Riggins.                                  ____     From: Hilary Spitz     Sent: Tuesday, July 19, 2005, 10:02 p.m.       On March 16, 2000, our lives forever changed. My daughter,      Hilary Spitz had worked midnights as a deputy sheriff for      Coles County. When she got home, we went shopping. I dropped      her off at home and left to go sign documents at the school      board office. My husband worked midnights also. They both      closed their respective doors. Soon after I arrived, Dr. Berg      received a call for me. I was told my daughter was in trouble      at home and an ambulance had been called. My husband had      heard our dogs barking and went to check on them. They were      scratching at Hilary's door and he could hear a horrible      wailing sound coming from her room. He burst in and found her      lying on the floor in a very violent seizure. He could not      get her to respond and quickly dialed 911. He physically had      to lay across her to keep her from hurting herself. Her feet      were bleeding from kicking the bed and dresser. When I      arrived home, I could hear her from the doorway. No one knew      what was wrong. When I arrived at the hospital, I was met at      the door by a nurse and told they were doing everything they      could for her and I could not go in. Soon after my family      arrived, we convinced them to let me in, maybe I could talk      to her. By that time, she was still unresponsive and      uncontrollable. No amount of medicine would calm her down.      They did all kinds of tests and eventually transferred her to      Carle Clinic. Her seizure lasted 13\1/2\ hours. It was      eventually determined that this was caused by an herbal diet      supplement that contained ephredra. She had taken 5 pills in      10 days. That wasn't even the amount that was suggested to      take. She was in a coma for 7 days. When she woke up, she had      no idea what had happened. Since that time, she has     had other health issues that have come up, but cannot be      linked directly to the ephedra seizure, but it seems strange      that they happened after that. But, since the seizure and the      hypoxic aftereffects, she is unable to work. She suffers from      depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, agitation, and sever      memory dysfunction. I am so grateful that she is here with      me. I wish she did not have the symptoms, but I am content      that she is alive. We continually live with her problems and      continually have to be with her. She was afraid to go to      sleep for a long time and had the light on in the bedroom      closet. Hilary lives with us and we help raise her 7 year old      daughter. If there is anything that we can do to keep this      horrible product off the market, we would be happy to discuss      this with you. We want to prevent anyone else from going      through this. Unfortunately, most people do not survive this.      Hilary is one of the lucky ones. It is just too bad that she      had to go through this.           Thank You, Michelle Skinlo.                                  ____                                                Center for Science                                       in the Public Interest,                                                    July 21, 2005.     Hon. Richard J. Durbin,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Durbin: The Center for Science in the Public      Interest (CSPI) wishes to commend you for introducing an      amendment to S. 1042 that would require manufacturers who      sell on military bases dietary supplements containing      stimulants to submit to the Food and Drug Administration      (FDA) reports of serious adverse health reactions relating to      such products. Serious reactions include death, life-     threatening conditions, hospitalization, persistent      disability or incapacity, and pregnancy-related effects.       Members of the armed forces are particularly at risk from      potentially harmful stimulants that are promoted for weight      loss and performance enhancement. Such claims ``are enticing      to soldiers [and other members of the armed forces] who are      trying to meet or maintain weight standards, improve physical      fitness test scores, or be competitive in specialized unit      requirements.''       Between 1997 and 2001, 30 active duty personnel died after      taking ephedra, the most widely used stimulant at that time.      As a result, the Marine Corps banned the sale of dietary      supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids at its      commissaries more than two years before FDA's nationwide ban      became effective on April 12, 2004. The other members of the      Armed Forces implemented their own bans soon thereafter.      Although replacements for ephedra, such as bitter orange,      usnic acid and aristolochic acid appear to present similar      risks, it may take years before FDA has amassed the data      necessary to ban or otherwise restrict the sale of these      and other stimulants. We, therefore, believe that, in the      interim, military personnel should be protected.       Passage of this amendment will also provide FDA with sorely      needed data to support restrictions on the sale of harmful      supplements. In July 2000, the General Accounting Office      concluded that:       ``Once products reach consumers, FDA lacks an effective      system to track and analyze instances of adverse effects.      Until it has one, consumers face increased risks because the      nature, magnitude and significance of safety problems related      to consuming dietary supplements and functional foods will      remain unknown.''       Similarly, a report by the Office of Inspector General (IG)      of the Department of Health and Human Services, Adverse Event      Reporting for Dietary Supplements: An Inadequate Safety      Valve, concludes that ``FDA receives less than 1 percent of      all adverse events associated with dietary supplements''      under its voluntary reporting system. This under-reporting is      particularly problematic because, as the IG explained,      dietary supplements do not undergo premarket approval for      safety and efficacy, and the adverse event reporting system      is the FDA's primary means for identifying safety problems.      The IG, therefore, recommended that manufacturers be required      to report serious adverse health reactions to the FDA.       The most recent report by the National Academy of Sciences      Institute of Medicine underscores the necessity of passing      such legislation. As the report explained, ``[e]ven though      they are natural products, herbs contain biological and      chemical properties that may lead to rare, acute or chronic      adverse effects.'' Therefore, the IOM recommended that      Congress strengthen ``consumer protection against all      potential hazards'' and called for legislation to require      that a manufacturer or distributor report to the FDA in a      timely manner any serious event associated with the use of      its marketed product of which the manufacturer or distributor      is aware. Adverse event reports are an essential source of      ``signals'' that there may be a safety concern warranting      further examination.       While we believe the FDA should be given new authority to      ensure that all supplements are safe before they are sold      regardless of whether they are sold at military      installations, and to promptly remove unsafe products from      the market, the measures in this bill are an important first      step towards evaluating the safety of dietary supplements now      on the market. We, therefore, believe that the legislation      should be enacted.           Sincerely,                                                Bruce Silverglade,                                        Director of Legal Affairs.                                              Ilene Ringel Heller,     Senior Staff Attorney.                                  ____                             American Osteopathic Association,                                    Washington, DC, July 20, 2005.     Hon. Richard Durbin,     Democratic Whip, U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Durbin: As President of the American      Osteopathic Association (AOA), I am pleased to inform you of      our support for the ``Make Our Armed Forces Safe and Healthy      (MASH) Act.'' We appreciate your willingness to offer this      provision as an amendment to the ``Fiscal Year 2006      Department of Defense Appropriations Act'' (H.R. 2863). The      AOA and the 54,000 osteopathic physicians it represents,      extends its gratitude to you for introducing this important      amendment.       The AOA continues to evaluate the impact of increased use      of dietary supplements and other ``natural'' products upon      the patients we serve. Over the past ten years we have seen a      steady increase in utilization of dietary supplements by      consumers. As a result, we are increasingly concerned about      the unregulated manner in which many of these products are      produced, marketed, and sold.       As evidenced by a 1999 study conducted by the U.S. Army      Research Institute for Environmental Medicine, the use of      dietary supplements is a significant health care issue for      American soldiers. A similar study conducted by the      Department of the Navy found that overall seventy-three      percent of personnel reported a history of supplement use,      with the number as high as eighty nine percent of Marines      reported using supplements. These studies demonstrate the      prevalence of these products among our men and women in      uniform.       The AOA believes that it would be beneficial for consumers      and physicians to have an increased understanding of the      potential serious side effects of dietary supplements. All      too often patients fail to inform their physician when they      use one or more of these products. This leads to potential      interactions with prescribed medications and may obscure an      accurate diagnosis of an underlying condition or disease. The      physical rigors of the military place soldiers at an even      greater risk of harm caused by dietary supplements that have      not been properly monitored.       The AOA supports the ability of the Food and Drug      Administration (FDA) to monitor dietary supplements. Your      amendment would take a significant step in ensuring the FDA,      and ultimately military personnel, physicians, and the      general public, become more knowledgeable with regard to      possible serious side effects of certain dietary supplements.      By requiring that the FDA receive serious adverse event      reports for dietary supplements sold on military      installations, a significant gap in knowledge about these      products and their effect on a person's health would be      closed.       On behalf of my fellow osteopathic physicians, I pledge our      support for your efforts to promote the health of American      soldiers by confronting the issue of dietary supplements and      the health of our armed services. Please do not hesitate to      call upon the AOA or our members for assistance on this or      other health care issues.           Sincerely,                                             Philip Shettle, D.O.,     President.                                  ____                                              Consumers Union,                                                    July 21, 2005.     Hon. Richard Durbin,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Durbin: Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer      Reports magazine supports your ``Make our Armed Forces      Healthy (``MASH'') amendment to the FY 2006 Department of      Defense Authorization bill. Your amendment would require      manufacturers that sell dietary supplements containing      stimulants on military installations to file reports of all      serious adverse events relating to the products (including      death, a life-threatening condition, hospitalization,      persistent disability or incapacity, or birth defects) with      the FDA.       Many members of the military invest a lot of time and      attention in their physical fitness. In addition to physical      training, some have turned to dietary supplements--including      those containing stimulants--believing they may increase      their performance. Unfortunately, use of such stimulants too      often results in harm. Prior to its action banning this      ingredient from herbal supplements on February 11, 2004, the      FDA had received at least 16,961 adverse event reports      relating to ephedra supplements, including reports of heart      attacks, strokes, seizures and fatalities. Consumer Reports,      however, continues to strongly urge people to avoid all      weight-loss and energy-boosting supplements, including those      that are now touted as ``ephedra-free.''       As reported in the January 2004 issue of Consumer Reports,      herbal supplements that are labeled `ephedra-free' are not      necessarily safer than ephedra. Many include similar central      nervous stimulants, such as synephrine-containing bitter      orange (citrus aurantium) that not only are structurally      similar to ephedrine, but also affect the body in similar      ways. Because there is no required pre-market safety      evaluation for those products, consumers have no assurance      that the problems experienced by ephedra users will not      continue with a switch to ephedra-free products.       We therefore commend you for crafting this amendment that      will better ensure that the military--and the broader      public--is informed about the potential harms that can     result from the use of these products. Thank you again for      your sponsorship.           Sincerely,                                               Janell Mayo Duncan,                               Legislative and Regulatory Counsel.
