 President, over the past several weeks, Americans have heard a number of proposals for reforming health care, and they are increasingly concerned about many of the details. Americans want reform, but they want the right reform, not a reform that ends up costing them much more for worse care than they already receive. Unfortunately, the government-run plan that some are proposing would do just that.  A government-run plan would force millions of Americans to give up the care they currently have and replace it with a system in which care is denied, delayed, and rationed. Instead of increasing access and quality, it could limit access and options. It could lead us into deeper debt. And millions could well remain uninsured.  Americans are skeptical about all of this.
