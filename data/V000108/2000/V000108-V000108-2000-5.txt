Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to consider cosponsoring House Resolution 635, the Executive Steel Defense Resolution. We currently have 205 cosponsors calling upon the President of the United States to initiate a section 201 trade case to bring to an end illegally traded steel in the U.S. domestic market.  Despite investing $35 billion to modernize, despite the loss of 240,000 jobs, despite cutting back capacity by 20 percent, despite doubling productivity since 1983 because of collusion overseas, because of illegal dumping from countries overseas, particularly during the intervening time from 1998 until now, we have seen six bankruptcies of steel companies. We have seen an additional 6,000 steelworkers lose their jobs. We have seen capacity utilization decline from 90 percent to 75 percent.  We cannot afford to wait till the next Congress. We cannot afford to wait for the next administration. I call upon President Clinton to immediately file a section 201.                          ____________________
