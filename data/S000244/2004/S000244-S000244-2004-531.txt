Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  There have been times when I have been the chairman of the committee where we have given the other body a choice. I seem to recall that in the last Congress the House passed two versions of the visa and border security bill. One contained provisions extending section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act and one did not, and the Senate chose to take up the bill that did not contain section 245(i) and passed it. Both bills, I believe, were supported both by the gentleman from North Carolina and myself. So sometimes giving the other body a choice speeds things along, and that is what this bill proposes to do.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn).
