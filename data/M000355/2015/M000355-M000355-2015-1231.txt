 President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture motion with respect to the motion to proceed to H.R. 1735, which is the Defense bill, be withdrawn; further, that at 11 a.m. on Wednesday, June 3, the Senate proceed to the consideration of H.R. 1735, and it be in order for Senator McCain to offer amendment No. 1463, the text of which is identical to S. 1376, the Armed Services Committee-reported NDAA bill; finally, that the time until 2:30 p.m. be for debate only and equally divided between the bill managers or their designees.
