Speaker, I just spoke about two who served our Capitol and our country. Unhappily, they lost their lives.  I now speak about one who has served our House of Representatives as an institution much more happily, because she has served so well and so faithfully and so long and is now retiring, hopefully, to a very happy retirement.  We could not do our job representing the American people without the tireless and sometimes thankless labors of the men and women who make this House function behind the scenes.  They sit at the desk behind us. They sit at the upper rostrum. They make a difference. And they record what we have to say.  From the Clerk's Office to the Parliamentarian staff, from the C-SPAN crew to the stenographers, the nonpartisan, professional staff who enable the work of the House and its Members are central to the success of our constitutional mission.  The House has relied on the services of shorthand reporters of debates for almost 200 years, and the verbatim proceedings of House business have been published as the Congressional Record since 1873.  We have a young woman who is now taking down my remarks, which may or may not be profound, but somebody will be able to say: ``What did Hoyer say?'' ``What did my Representative say?''  A division of the Office of the Clerk, the Office of Official Reporters is charged with providing nonpartisan, professional stenographic services for the House floor, committees, and leadership.  It has grown from a 5-person shop in the 19th century to a diverse 43-person operation today. They work extraordinarily long hours; they work very hard; and they are extraordinarily competent.  Today, I join all my colleagues in thanking one of those outstanding, wonderful individuals who is retiring as the Chief Reporter of Debates, Melinda Walker.  Melinda is with us on the floor today.  Melinda, thank you very much.  And I know, Mr. Speaker, if it weren't out of order, I would mention that her family is in the gallery, but because that is not in order, I won't do that.  Melinda will step down in August, after more than 20 years of service to the House of Representatives.  A proud native of Texas, Melinda came to the House in 1999, after serving as a court reporter for the U.N. International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha, Tanzania.  Her career began after graduating from the Stenograph Institute of Texas in 1989, and her work took her around the country and across the world, with positions in the United Kingdom, the Caribbean, and South Africa.  Melinda has reported both House committee hearings and floor proceedings. She has taken down committee testimony from two Chief Justices of the Supreme Court and three Secretaries of State, among many others.  On the floor, Melinda has reported the State of the Union messages for three Presidents, as well as the remarks of numerous foreign dignitaries during joint meetings of Congress.  Upon Melinda's promotion to Chief Reporter in 2015, she led the team of reporters and staff in charge of the production of the Congressional Record. Under her watch, the office has been successful in meeting its daily production deadlines, while capturing the intricate parliamentary nuances of House proceedings.  Melinda has contributed a fully revised and updated style and formatting manual, more than 200 pages long, for the Office of Official Reporters. Americans will be advantaged by that work for decades to come.  She has been recognized by the National Court Reporters Association as a Registered Professional Reporter and a Certified Manager of Reporting Services, and she remains a certified shorthand reporter in her native Texas.  Melinda plans to return to her hometown of San Saba, Texas, and spend more time with her family and faithful dog, Bleu.  Lucky dog to have Melinda back.  Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking Melinda Walker for her many years of distinguished and dedicated service to the House and in wishing her the very best in retirement.  Melinda, we owe you and your colleagues a debt of gratitude. You silently serve and sit and listen to verb after noun after adjective after word after word after word--and you stay awake. It is amazing. And you do it so well, to the advantage of all of us who serve here, but, much more importantly, to the advantage of the people of the United States, who will know what their Representatives say on their behalf and will be, therefore, able, in a democracy, to make a sound judgment as to whether those words are the words they want intoned on this floor on their behalf.  So, Melinda, to you and to all of your colleagues, we say thank you. Godspeed. Be well.                          ____________________
