 President, scientific studies continue to show cause for concern about the chemical Bisphenol-A, BPA, especially the effects on babies and young children. Endocrine disrupting chemicals alter the function of the body's hormonal system. BPA is a synthetic estrogen, which means that it mimics this hormone when in the body. While studies continue to examine the exact effects this endocrine disrupting chemical has on humans, consumers deserve more information. They have the right to know if it is in the food products they purchase for their families.  The BPA in Food Packaging Right to Know Act requires that food packaging that uses BPA include a clear label informing consumers. The label would read, ``This food packaging contains BPA, an endocrine-disrupting chemical.'' This basic message would allow individuals to make informed decisions about the products they purchase.  BPA is most commonly found in food products, such as the lining of cans. Parents are busy enough caring for their children and juggling what feels like a hundred things at the same time. Having factual information about whether the food they are buying at the grocery store contains BPA, a potentially harmful chemical, shouldn't be one more thing they have to go to great lengths to figure out.  This legislation also directs the Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, to do a safety assessment of food containers containing BPA to determine if there is reasonable certainty that no harm will come from long-term low dose exposure to BPA as well as high dose exposure.  This safety standard would also be used to evaluate proposed uses of alternatives to BPA. There is no use in replacing BPA in products if what we are replacing it with is just as bad or worse for human health.  The President's Cancer Panel focused on reducing the environmental cancer risk in its 2008- 2009 Annual Report. BPA is just one of many chemicalsthat pose a potential environmental cancer risk, with links to various cancers and also potentially affecting how well cancer treatments work. This panel, appointed by former President George W. Bush, decided that even though studies are ongoing, they had enough information to state that ``the true burden of environmentally induced cancer has been grossly underestimated.''  I agree with this finding and strongly believe that as scientific studies continue to seek definitive answers to the role of chemical exposure in adversely affecting human health, the very least that consumers deserve is the right to know what chemicals, such as BPA, are in the products they are purchasing. The panel specifically mentions concern that even though studies continue to link BPA with a variety of diseases, it still remains in products.  I am particularly concerned about the negative health effects to children who are exposed to chemicals both while they are developing in the womb and in the first few years of their lives. Children are particularly susceptible to toxins while their bodies are developing at such a rapid pace. A recent study by researchers at the University of California, Berkley, stated that fetuses and pregnant women may be particularly susceptible to BPA exposure. The study found that exposure to BPA may have an effect on thyroid function, and suggests continued studies to confirm these findings.  An article published in Health Affairs in 2011 estimated that the annual cost of diseases that can be attributed to negative environmental exposures was more than $76 billion per year in 2008. The incidence of endocrine system-related diseases continues to rise, and animal studies have shown adverse health effects in connection with exposure to BPA.  A recent study by researchers at the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health examined a link between BPA exposure and an increased risk for asthma in young children. They found that there was an elevated risk associated with BPA exposure and more research is needed to determine specific links.  BPA is one of the most pervasive chemicals in modern life. This chemical is used in thousands of consumer products and the most common exposure is through the lining of food packaging- like cans of green beans and ready-made soups. As with so many other chemicals in consumer products, BPA has been added to our products without knowing if it is safe or not.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the BPA in Food Packaging Right to Know Act to stand up for the right of consumers to make informed choices about the food products they buy for their families. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important issue.                                 ______                                       By
