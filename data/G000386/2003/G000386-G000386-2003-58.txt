 President, we want to make sure there is time this evening for Senators Bingaman and Levin to give their remarks. If there is no further business to come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in adjournment under the previous order, following the remarks of Senator Bingaman and Senator Levin.
