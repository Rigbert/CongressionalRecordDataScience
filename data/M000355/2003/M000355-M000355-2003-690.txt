 President, to make sure we all understand what the provision is in the bill we have been discussing, let's put it this way, Mr. President: This provision only allows a jury to know the victim has received benefits from a third party, such as a health insurer. It allows the jury to know that, I say to my friend from Mississippi, but the jury is free to ignore that evidence if they like. It would allow them to know there was insurance coverage, but the jury is free to ignore that evidence if they like. The provision also prevents health insurers, a third party, from recovering payments it made to the victim. That is what this bill actually does.  I think it is important just to set the record straight on what is, in fact, contained in this legislation on that point.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
