Speaker, I rise in support of this rule. Back in 1983, I would bring to the attention of my Democratic colleagues, the equal rights amendment was brought up on the floor with the support of most of them, under suspension of the rules.  There were no amendments allowed, there was no motion to recommit, and because I was the manager on the Republican side, in fairness, I yielded half of my time to Republican supporters of the ERA, but the Democrats did not yield any of their time to Democratic opponents of the ERA, so the split in the 40 minutes that we had to debate that important constitutional amendment was split 3 to 1 for the supporters, because of the unfairness of the folks on the other side of the aisle.  Mr. Speaker, this rule is fair. It will allow for an extensive debate. I think that, given what the other side did with another important constitutional amendment, maybe they ought to take up a collection to build a statue to the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon], because of the fair rules that he puts together.
