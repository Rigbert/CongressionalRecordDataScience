Speaker, I returned to my district in Springfield, IL this weekend as I do virtually every weekend, and it was interesting that some of my friends when I came across them at a party on Saturday night said, ``What in the world was going on in the House of Representatives last week? We tuned into the news and we saw grown men and women shouting, red in the face, emotional. What was it all about?''  What it was all about was a 1-minute speech, like those given every day, by the gentlewoman from Florida, Carrie Meek, in which she raised the question of the Speaker's book contract. It led to a ruling by the Chair concerning which words were appropriate to be spoken on the floor and a reaction from my Democratic side of the aisle where there was a feeling that perhaps this ruling, which relied on a precedent almost a century old, had perhaps gone too far.  People in the ordinary course of life with their families may find it hard to imagine why grown men and women would get so exercised and so emotional over something which appears as inconsequential as what words can be spoken on the floor of this House. But frankly, ladies and gentlemen, I think when we take an oath of office to uphold the Constitution, including therein our freedom of speech, that this House probably as much if not more than any other place in the United States should be the situs where free speech is respected. As a result, our emotions ran high, on the Republican side in defense of their Speaker, on the Democratic side in defense of the concept of free speech.  I did not come to make this comment this morning on the issue of free speech, but merely to let you know as previous speakers have how much time has been focused in the last weeks on this floor of the House of Representatives on Speaker Gingrich's financial dealings. I would like to make a suggestion this afternoon as to how we can really start focusing instead on some of the critical issues facing this country and move away from that  Last week, of course, we were embroiled for an entire day on the question of what could be said on the floor of the House about the Speaker's multimillion-dollar book deal. Then in sequence every nightly news Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, all of the major networks were consumed with variations on that theme:  Did in fact the Speaker meet with the lobbyist to discuss policies relative to telecommunications? The same lobbyist for the same magnate, Mr. Murdoch, who owns the publishing company the Speaker is doing business [[Page H482]] with, did in fact Mr. Murdoch come to the Capitol and so forth.  In fact by Friday of last week, the Republican chairman of the House Banking Committee sent a letter to the administration and said that he was not prepared to consider the Mexican financial crisis as long as Mr. Gringrich's ethical problems were being discussed on the floor. He did not think that was a political environment that he could in good conscience discuss the Mexican financial crisis in.  I think that is unfortunate and it suggests how much business on Capitol Hill is now being subsumed into the Speaker's financial situation.  We have seen reaction across the country. In the Midwest, my hometown of Springfield and in Chicago, major newspapers have editorialized that the Speaker has to get away from this book deal and get back to focusing on issues important to America. Virtually every editorial writer with the politically predictable exception of Rush Limbaugh has said it is time for the Speaker to do something about this and get it behind him. It went to far this morning as to have an article in the Wall Street Journal questioning the members of the House Ethics Committee on the Republican side.  Let me say at the outset that I know all three of the gentlemen referred to in the article and I have absolutely the highest confidence in their honesty and integrity. I would gladly have them sit in judgment of myself should a question ever be presented. But in this situation, where they have been involved with GOPAC, the Speaker's political action committee, there is a legitimate question about conflict of interest.                              {time}  1310  I think it goes to the point raised by the gentleman from California. It is time for us to take this whole swirl of controversy about GOPAC, the Speaker's foundations, the book deal and such, and take it off of the floor of this House, off of Capitol Hill and put it in the hands of an outside counsel, someone who is chosen on a bipartisan basis to look into the facts and report to this body as well as to the American people.  We can then step aside from this and get down to the real business that is before us. It is certainly important that we be concerned about the ethics and integrity of the House of Representatives. I think the outside counsel is the best way to go. It will not be a Republican or Democratic choice, it will be a bipartisan choice. It has been done before and it should be done in this instance. We can put this behind us. We can stop focusing on it and move forward on important issues which we will continue.  This week we are considering unfunded mandate legislation and tomorrow night, right here at this podium, the President of the United States will have the opportunity, as others have before him, to speak to the American people. Then we will go on to consider a balanced budget amendment. These are all critically important issues for the Nation.  In order that we give our full attention, as we should, to them, an outside counsel should be called immediately to take this ethics question involving the Speaker off of our agenda and put it in the hands of a nonpartisan source that can make a decision as to whether or not anything has happened.                          ____________________
