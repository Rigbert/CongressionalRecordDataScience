 President, next week, the students, parents and faculty from Orange Grove Junior High in Hacienda Heights, California, will be visiting our nation's Capitol. This will be the twentieth consecutive year that students from Orange Grove have visited Washington, D.C. This also marks the twentieth consecutive visit by Orange Grove's tour leader and history teacher, Rick Fries.  It was in the Spring of 1979 when Rick Fries first led a group of more than 25 students and adults to the East Coast, visiting Jamestown, Yorktown, Williamsburg, Charlottesville and finally Washington, D.C. For each succeeding year thereafter, he would bring another group of Orange Grove students, sometimes to new historic places, but always to Washington. His students have seen where Revolution was born in Boston, where Independence was declared in Philadelphia, where the Union was preserved in Gettysburg, and where our laws are made right here in Washington.  From the very first tour in 1979, Mr. Fries' goal was simple: to make American History come to life for his students. The name of his tour says it all: Living History. It's fair to say he has succeeded. This year, Mr. Fries will be leading a group of 63 students and 20 adults to Washington. His tour is so popular among Orange Grove students, it is sold out well before the beginning of the school year.  The tour has remained popular after all these years because the enthusiasm Mr. Fries shows for history and for his students has never wavered. Those who have traveled with and learned from Mr. Fries all agree: He makes the history of our country an enjoyable experience for both students and parents because he enjoys it as well.  It's no secret to all who are associated with Orange Grove Junior High that Mr. Fries consistently has been one of the school's most popular teachers--popular with both students and parents. He is well-liked simply because he truly cares about his students. And he's considered a wonderful teacher of history because he truly cares about his country.  Mr. Fries is one of those remarkable teachers who has made a lasting impact on the lives of young people. In fact, one of his students who traveled with Mr. Fries on his first tour to Washington back in 1979 is now a Legislative Director for my friend and colleague from Ohio, Senator Mike DeWine. This former student has said that his own interest in government, and his own love of history, was due largely to Rick Fries. I am sure there are quite a few more current and former students who were inspired by Mr. Fries, and not just in history and government. Mr. Fries also dedicates his time with young people as a football and basketball coach, and follows the example of the legendary UCLA Coach John Wooden, who developed in his athletes not just physical strength, but also strength of character.  It is fitting that the Orange Grove students will be visiting Capitol Hill on April 13--the birthday of the author of the Declaration of Independence and our third president, Thomas Jefferson. I understand Mr. Fries is a great admirer of President Jefferson, and it shows when he and his students visit Monticello--President Jefferson's home--and the Jefferson Memorial. I also understand that of all the tributes given to President Jefferson, Mr. Fries is particularly fond of the one given by President John F. Kennedy, when the following at a White House dinner honoring Nobel Prize winners: I think this is the most extraordinary collection of talent, of human knowledge, that has ever been gathered together at the White House, with the possible exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone.''  Mr. President, I am sure I speak for the community of Hacienda Heights when I express my admiration and thanks to Rick Fries. 1He is truly an inspiration to his students and his fellow teachers for his tireless devotion to young people and to his profession. I wish Mr. Fries, and the students, parents and faculty from Orange Grove an enjoyable and memorable twentieth visit to our nation's capitol.                          ____________________
