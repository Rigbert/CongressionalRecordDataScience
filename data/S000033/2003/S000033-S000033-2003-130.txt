 Speaker, my friend said that we do not have to do anything. My friend said that it should be voluntary. What happened at IBM is that thousands of workers stood up and fought back. Unfortunately, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of other workers did not even know what was happening to them. They could not fight back. If the gentleman thinks that giving people a choice is a bad idea, why do the 35 million members of AARP think it is a good idea and the 13 million members of the AFL-CIO? Choice is right.
