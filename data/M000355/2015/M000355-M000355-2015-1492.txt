 President, we are continuing to make progress on the bipartisan antitrafficking bill. Senator Cornyn is working with Chairman Grassley and Senators on both sides of the aisle to resolve the remaining issues.  It is my hope we will be able to go through an orderly amendment process and pass the trafficking bill early next week. The Senate will then consider the Lynch nomination through the regular order, as I have already committed to doing, followed by consideration of the Iran bill as reported unanimously by the Foreign Relations Committee earlier this week.                 Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 1191  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by the majority leader, with the concurrence of the Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to vote on the motion to proceed to calendar No. 30, H.R. 1191, and that if the motion to proceed is agreed to, Senator Corker or his designee be recognized to offer a substitute amendment, which is the text of S. 615 as reported by the Foreign Relations Committee.
