 President, the Senator from Minnesota is asking the Senate to put these provisions in law in the bankruptcy code for loans that are legal under State law.  He would have this done in two ways: No. 1, he would say that the State judges could not enforce these debt collections; and, No. 2, he would say that in bankruptcy it could not be recovered in bankruptcy.  First of all, these are legal contractual relations. They are legal under State law. So it ought to be questioned whether or not the Senate of the United States or the legislatures of Minnesota and Iowa ought to be making these determinations. It is my judgment that we should not use the bankruptcy code to upset the legal bankruptcy laws of the respective States.  I ask my colleagues to vote this amendment down.
