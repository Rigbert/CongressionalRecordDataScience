 This morning I expressed my condolences to the families and friends of all of those who have given their lives in this war, but I particularly recognize the brave soldiers being mourned today by the people of Oregon. Army Reserve Specialist Brandon Tobler, who was only 19, lost his life in a humvee accident during a sandstorm. Brandon was the only son of Leo and Gail Tobler of Portland. He grew up there and joined the military to help pay for college. He was in a convoy headed to Baghdad providing engineering support to the combat troops. Private Tobler's death reminds us that a soldier doesn't have to be on the combat line to face tremendous danger and possible death.  It reminds us how brave each and every person who puts on a uniform for the United States must be regardless of their particular assignment.  Air National Guard MAJ Gregory Stone was a 20-year veteran of military service. He was killed in the grenade attack at the base of the 101st Airborne in Kuwait. He leaves behind two young sons today, Evan and Joshua, as well as his mother in Ontario--who I just spoke with--and others across our State who loved him dearly. Major Stone graduated from Oregon State University, and from Benson High School in my hometown of Portland. He died far from the front lines but, again, called to sacrifice in war.  Army SGT Donald Walters is now missing in action after his convoy was ambushed in Southern Iraq. His wife and kids are in Missouri. His parents, Norman and Arlene, are in Salem, OR, awaiting word on his safety. Sergeant Walters comes from a family with a rich tradition of service across the military, including the Army, Navy, and the Air Force. He is a specialist in decontamination. His convoy was moving to support troops in battle when they took a wrong turn into terrible circumstances.
