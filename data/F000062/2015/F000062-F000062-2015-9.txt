 President, today I rise to introduce the Requiring Reporting of Online Terrorist Activity Act, which would require technology companies to inform appropriate law enforcement authorities when they become aware of terrorist activity online.  This provision is modeled after a similar requirement on technology companies under current law, which requires the companies to report instances of child pornography that they become aware of online.  This legislation passed the Intelligence Committee earlier this year by a vote of 15-0 as part of our annual Intelligence Authorization Act, but it was later dropped, along with other provisions, to try to move the broader intelligence bill through the Senate.  I have continued to believe that terrorists' use of the Internet is a problem that we need to address, and that the government can't do it alone. I have had conversations with the senior leaders and general counsels of major technology companies and unfortunately, I don't believe that they will report terrorist activity on their websites without a legal requirement to do so.  So I am reintroducing this provision as a stand-alone bill, especially in the wake of recent terrorist attacks that highlight the problem of terrorist activity on social media.  The investigation into the San Bernardino attack is ongoing, but so far, we have learned that sometime around the time of the attack, the female shooter, Tashfeen Malik, or an account connected to her, posted something on her Facebook page declaring allegiance to the Islamic State in Syria and the Levant or ``ISIL.''  Facebook has publicly confirmed that the company identified and removed the account connected to Malik because praising a terrorist attack or declaring allegiance to leaders of ISIL would violate the company's standards for use.  Facebook has said it is cooperating with law enforcement on the matter as part of the post-shooting investigation, but I would like to see technology companies notify law enforcement about terrorist activity they see online before an attack occurs.  It is important to recognize how ISIL has used social media to reinvent terrorist recruiting and plotting over the past year and a half. I believe that now is the time for Congress to pass legislation to help law enforcement better respond to the threat.  Unlike in the past when terrorists devised intricate plots years in advance, today, thousands of ISIL followers have flooded social media with a vast and persistent effort to find followers inside the United States, identify targets of opportunity, and instruct their new supporters how to conduct more small-scale, yet lethal terrorist attacks--all in a matter of days or weeks and all online without ever meeting or vetting their operative in person.  This new trend shows that terrorism has adapted to the digital age, spreading first its propaganda and then its operational reach across the globe. Its lack of coordination or complexity makes it faster and harder to thwart than ever before, and the ubiquitous use of social media gives ISIL a wider direct audience than al-Qa'ida ever enjoyed.  To respond, we must ensure that law enforcement is aware of the threat. To do this, Congress should pass this legislation immediately, which requires technology companies to inform the appropriate authorities when they become aware of terrorist activity.  This type of requirement is not new. For years, companies have been required to notify law enforcement when they become aware of online child pornography. This bill would do essentially the same thing, but for cases of terrorism. It would not require companies to monitor their customers, nor would it chill free speech protected by the Constitution. Instead, it simply requires that clear acts of terrorist plotting or illegal activity associated with terrorism be conveyed to law enforcement.  Most social media companies already devote considerable resources to remove content or suspend the accounts of individuals who post or transmit blatant terrorist-related content. But under the current system, there is no requirement that a company provide notice to law enforcement when, through the normal course of business, it becomes aware of images, posts, or other online terrorist activity. By closing that gap and requiring that companies notify law enforcement, there is a better chance the attempts by terrorist groups like ISIL to direct an individual inside the United States to conduct a violent act will be discovered and thwarted before it is too late.  When technology companies see a picture of a child being exploited, they are required to inform law enforcement. Terrorist activity should be no different.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
