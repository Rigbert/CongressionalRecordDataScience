Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I realize this has gone longer, but we do not have a crisis of this type very often.  The majority leader has indicated we were sending bills down as quickly as we could to the President for consideration to move beyond this present crisis. The Treasury-Postal bill was passed on Wednesday. The legislative bill is also ready to go to the President. I am wondering if we have sent those down or we are expecting to send those down to the White House.                              {time}  2115  I know we seem to be inconveniencing the gentleman from Ohio. I am really sorry that, the 800,000 people that twist in the wind. But I would like to know whether or not the bills are going to be sent down?
