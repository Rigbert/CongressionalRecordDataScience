Mr. Speaker, people from the Balkans are often characterized according to their ethnic background, and the assumption is made that each person--from the villager to the leader in society--looks out for the interests of only their own people. In Bosnia, that can be a very mistaken assumption.  Three years of aggression in Bosnia have admittedly sharpened the priority given to ethnic identity by all sides, Bosnian, Muslim, Croat and Serb, which is shaped largely by religious background. However, there remains a large number of individuals more committed than ever to the concept of a multiethnic Bosnian society in a unified state, where all are equal before the law, where all tolerate each other and respect their cultural differences.  Few, if any, symbolize this true Bosnian spirit, with which Americans find so much affinity, more than the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Sarajevo, Vinko Cardinal Puljic, who recently visited Washington. During his visit, he expressed a sense of optimism about the ability of the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina to [[Page E846]] live together in peace, but evoked as well a sense of urgency about the current plight of the Roman Catholic community. He also expressed a sense of frankness about the troublemakers that continue to exist among his fellow Bosnian Croats. Finally, he expressed a sense of outrage about the abandonment of Bosnia--Herzegovina by the international community.  On the latter point, I would like to quote an appeal for a just peace which the Cardinal released on March 30, prior to departing Washington. He said:       I, like so many in Bosnia-Herzegovina, am astonished and      bewildered, almost to the point of despair, at the      international community's indifferent, half-hearted,      inconsistent and ineffectual response to aggression and      ethnic cleansing. Not only has the international community      not acted decisively, it has even contributed to the ethnic      division of Bosnia and has legitimized aggression by failing      to uphold basic moral and legal norms. * * * In Bosnia, the      international community's tepid response has only encouraged      those who would respond to extremism with extremism, to      intolerance with intolerance, to aggression with aggression,      and to ethnic cleansing with ethnic cleansing.  I ask that the full text of the Cardinal's appeal be printed in the Record, and I ask my colleagues to read it. While the politician, the diplomat or the soldier can bring about an end to hostilities in Bosnia Herzegovina, it will take people like Cardinal Puljic to bring about a real peace, a lasting peace through reconciliation and outspoken opposition to the evil forces of exclusivity that permeate his society. I applaud his efforts.            An Appeal for a Just Peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina       I come to Washington, D.C. to offer another heartfelt plea      that the United States, in conjunction with the international      community, will take more decisive steps to support those of      us in Bosnia-Herzegovina who are struggling to bring about a      just peace, based on equal respect and equal rights for all      ethnic and religious identities in my country.       1. The facts of Bosnia's tragedy are well known, but they      bear repeating. In three years, I have seen the Catholic      population of my archdiocese reduced from 520,000 to about      125,000 people, most of whom live in small enclaves. Less      than a third of the parishes are still functioning. The      situation is even worse in the Banja Luka Diocese, where more      than 80% of the Catholics have been forced out by ``ethnic      cleansing.'' Overall, of the 830,000 Catholics who lived in      Bosnia before the war, only half remain. If the war      continues, Catholics risk being exterminated from large parts      of Bosnia and Herzegovina, despite thirteen centuries of our      organized presence there. The Catholic community does not      have a monopoly on suffering in Bosnia and Herzegovina. I      cite these statistics simply to remind Americans of the      magnitude of the suffering that is being inflicted upon the      people of Bosnia and Herzegovina.       2. Despite obvious obstacles, there can be no alternative      to pursuing a just peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Time is      running out but it is still not too late.       A just peace requires respect for the territorial      boundaries of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its multi-ethnic and      multi-religious character. The international community must      support us in our efforts to rebuild a country in which      ethnic Bosnian Muslims, Serbs and Croats can cultivate their      respective identities at the same time that they respect the      equal rights and equal legitimacy of the ethnic and religious      identities of other citizens. Therefore, it is imperative      that the Bosnian Federation receive the support it needs to      succeed, but it would be a tragedy if the Federation and      international peace plans were used to partition Bosnia along      ethnic lines. A peace which does not correct injustices,      which rewards aggression, which does not permit refugees and      displaced persons to return to their homes, and which is      based on ethnic division can be neither a just nor a      permanent one.       3. I, like so many in Bosnia-Herzegovina, am astonished and      bewildered, almost to the point of despair, at the      international community's indifferent, half-hearted,      inconsistent and ineffectual response to aggression and      ``ethnic cleansing.'' Not only has the international      community not acted decisively, it has even contributed to      the ethnic division of Bosnia and has legitimized aggression      by failing to uphold basic moral and legal norms. If the      principles of peace and international justice are buried in      the soil of the Balkans, Western civilization will be      threatened. In Bosnia, the international community's tepid      response has only encouraged those who would respond to      extremism with extremism, to intolerance with intolerance, to      aggression with aggression, and to ``ethnic cleansing'' with      ``ethnic cleansing.''       I am convinced that there are moral means to thwart immoral      aggression. The international community must have the will to      use the means available to it to protect threatened      populations, to encourage demilitarization, and to establish      other conditions necessary for progress towards peace. The      solution can not be simply to give up and withdraw. If the      United Nations and the international community do not now      have effective means to respond to the humanitarian crises in      Bosnia and elsewhere--and it is clear that they do not--then      nations have the responsibility to take the steps necessary      to develop more effective international structures.       4. This is not a religious conflict, but some would misuse      religion in support of ethnic division and extreme      nationalism. Therefore, as a religious leader, I believe I      have a special responsibility to stand beside those who are      victims of injustice and aggression, regardless of their      religious, ethnic, or national identity. I also believe that,      even though a just peace seems far off, religious and other      leaders must not wait for an end to war to begin the daunting      task of reconciling deeply divided communities. We must      promote a moral and spiritual renewal that can heal the      hatred, despair and division which this war has brought. Only      by rebuilding the spiritual life of our people can we ensure      that the horrors we have lived through for the last three      years will not be repeated. With God's grace, we will      succeed.       5. Amidst the great suffering we have been forced to      endure, we have found the grace to persevere in hope, for we      know that this war is not our destiny. We have also found      hope in the prayers and moral and financial support we have      received from the Catholic Bishops Conference and its aid      agencies, and countless individuals and organizations in the      United States. For these generous acts of solidarity, we are      deeply grateful.       I conclude where I began. The ordinary people of my      archdiocese and my country are tired of war; they yearn to be      allowed to live together in peace. But we cannot do it alone.      We need more decisive action by the international community.      I implore you: Do not continue to abandon us! Do not continue      to acquiesce in the practical victory of injustice and war!      Help us to realize the justice, peace and reconciliation for      which we so ardently pray and struggle!       There are many forces fueling this conflict, some of them      coming from within my own Croatian community. This is not,      however, a religious conflict, nor is it simply a consequence      of the resurgence of ``ancient hatreds'' between different      religious, ethnic, and national groups who cannot live      together in peace. Ethnic, religious differences certainly do      exist, and, regrettably, they have been depended by the war.      But they cannot explain adequately what is happening in my      country. The main cause of the conflict and suffering in      Bosnia-Herzegovina is an attempt by extreme nationalists and      others who fear democracy to create an ethnically pure      Greater Servia.                               ____________________
