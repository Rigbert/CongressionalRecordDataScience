 We are looking for a way to get the immigration issue to conference in a way that will guarantee the conference can go forward. It will be a contentious conference, in any event, but to make sure the conference can go forward in a way that guarantees we do not get derailed by some parliamentary technicality.  I offer a different unanimous consent. I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to Calendar No. 326, H.R. 4096; provided further that all after the enacting clause be stricken, and the text of the Senate-passed immigration bill be inserted in lieu thereof.  Further, that the bill be read the third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.  I further ask that the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House, and the chair be authorized to appoint conferees.
