 President, I wish to recognize the current World Boxing Council, WBC, World Heavyweight Champion Deontay Leshun Wilder.  Mr. Wilder is a native of Tuscaloosa, AL. He graduated from Tuscaloosa Central High School in 2004, and he attended Shelton State Community College. From there, he focused on forging a career in boxing.  Mr. Wilder began his boxing career in 2005, and he has achieved outstanding success as both an amateur and professional boxer. In 2007, Wilder upset the favorites to win the National Golden Gloves and the U.S. championships. Wilder was awarded the bronze medal in boxing at the 2008 Olympics. In 2012, he won the WBC Continental Americas heavyweight boxing title.  In January of this year, Wilder became the first American heavyweight champion in 9 years after his win over Bermane Stiverne. Since then, Wilder has successfully defended his WBC title twice, most recently in September.  Deontay Wilder has made a proactive effort to give back to the State of Alabama by hosting his first two title defenses in Birmingham, AL. He has also been a champion of charitable causes such as the fight against spina bifida.  Mr. Wilder is an incredible athlete and an inspiration to many. I am honored to recognize his great talent and success, and I am proud to call him a fellow Alabamian.                          ____________________
