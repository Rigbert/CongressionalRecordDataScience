Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and for his excellent amendment.  Mr. Chairman, volunteerism is not something that is in the eye of the beholder. It needs a definition. We have heard it is voluntary, what goes on in China. It is not. In many countries, including many democracies, there is something far less than a voluntary program for family planning.  I had a hearing in my Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights of the Committee on International Relations last February 25th, and we heard from a doctor, a whistle-blower who actually worked in the program in Peru, and he talked about how coercion and all kinds of games and brinkmanship was used to get women to get tubal ligations against their will.  We had two women who were sterilized against their will. One, bottom line, she said, ``They tricked me.'' Now, we want no part of that. It should be voluntary. And I really think the amendment of the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Tiahrt) sets a great and valuable service and I urge support for it.
