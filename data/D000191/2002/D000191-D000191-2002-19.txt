  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Republican majority leader, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Armey), defended the actions of corporations that moved their headquarters overseas to avoid taxes. He said it is just like families taking an itemized deduction. Well, I have got to say it is not exactly like that because Americans who take itemized deductions are paying taxes at a much higher rate than these corporations.  Citizenship has its privileges. It also has some obligations. In a time of crisis, for some of the largest and most profitable corporations in this country to be engaging in a tax dodge to avoid their obligations to our Nation, at thesame time shovelling more burden on to working Americans, and then for the majority leader of the Republican Party to say, hey, this is fine, that is a new low for the United States House of Representatives.  More than 90 million tax paying American families every April 15 are obligated to pay, but the CEOs and some of the largest corporations in this country, they do not pay anymore. Tyco International is one of the ones who has moved down there. Enron, another corporate citizen. He said it is about competitiveness. It is not about competitiveness. It is about corruption and theft.                          ____________________
