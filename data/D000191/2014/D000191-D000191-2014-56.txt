Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon has 2 minutes remaining.  Mr. DeFAZIO. I do have the right to close, so I will yield myself 90 seconds.  Mr. Chairman, as described, that might be an amendment that would be much more acceptable, but it actually doesn't say that. It says that, after the conclusion of the public comment period for a planned competitive lease sale, the Secretary shall not cancel, defer, or withdraw any lease parcel announced to be auctioned in a lease sale.  Now, what the gentleman described is not what this section F would do. This basically says we listen to people--we listened, we heard, it goes forward. Maybe that is not the intent, and if it isn't the intent, then it would need to be modified. So I believe that the public comment period for leases that are drawn up by bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., headquarters should be meaningfully commented upon through a process by people in the vicinity, and their comments should be given some weight in whether or not the lease is modified or goes forward, as I previously described, if it impedes upon prime habitat or particularly on a recreational corridor.  Mr. Chairman, with that, I reserve the balance of my time.
