 Let me very briefly highlight a few of them.  First, we have an amendment proposed by Senator Bingaman affirming the importance of the Partnership for Peace program.  Second, there is a provision offered by Senator Hutchison of Texas related to the strategic importance of NATO.  Third, there is an amendment offered by Senator Specter related to payments owed to the victims of Nazi Germany oppression.  Fourth, there is a requirement for a report on future rounds of enlargement. This amendment is a combination of amendments offered by our colleagues, Senators Bingaman, Harkin, and Jeffords.  This is a very useful amendment, in my view, because it will require the executive branch to submit a detailed analysis related to the possible new members of NATO, including cost and military readiness issues before--before--a nation is invited to begin accession talks. This will, I hope, allow the Senate to have a better understanding of the ramifications of admitting new members in the future and thereby enable the Senate to fulfill its constitutional function of providing advice to the President in the negotiation of treaties.  Finally, Mr. President, there is an amendment related to intelligence issues which was proposed by the chairman and vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Senator Shelby and Senator Kerrey of Nebraska.  I appreciate very much the cooperation of all our colleagues and urge the approval of the managers' amendment.
