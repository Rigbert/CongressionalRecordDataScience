I would like to express my appreciation for his dedication to making sailing accessible for everyone, regardless of economic status and physical or intellectual ability.  Mr. Muldoon grew up in Gary, Indiana and didn't learn how to sail until he finished his Air Force service and graduated from the University of Maryland. Since then, Muldoon has been an advocate of community sailing programs at the grassroots level, especially in the areas of youth sailing, training, and safety. He has long been actively involved in international sailing and boating-related organizations. He has captained his own 73-foot yacht, DONNYBROOK, with a highly competitive amateur team in hundreds of races and has accrued over 75,000 miles of ocean racing.  In August, more than two dozen, sailing and boating-related organizations assembled to honor Mr. Muldoon for his lifelong contributions to boating safety. During the ceremony, Martin O'Malley, Governor of Maryland, awarded Mr. Muldoon with the Chesapeake Bay Ambassador Award. Peter Franchot, Comptroller of the State of Maryland also presented Mr. Muldoon with a Certificate of Recognition for his outstanding contributions to the State. Organizations paying tribute to Mr. Muldoon included the U.S. Coast Guard, Special Olympics of Maryland, American Red Cross, Annapolis Community Boating, Annapolis Community Foundation, Annapolis Sailing School, Chesapeake Bay Yacht Racing Association, Coast Guard Foundation, Downtown Sailing Center Baltimore, Kidship, National Association of State Boating Law Administrators, National Boating Federation, National Boating Safety Advisory Council, National Maritime Heritage Foundation, National Safe Boating Council, National Sailing Hall of Fame, National Water Safety Congress, Sailing Center Chesapeakei, Shearwater Sailing Club, Spirit of America, United Safe Boating Institute, United States Coast Guard Auxiliary, United States Power Squadrons, and United States Sailing Association (US SAILING), join together to honor Mr. Muldoon's contributions to the sailing world.  Shelia Hixson, the chair of the Ways and Means Committee of the Maryland House of Delegates, presided over the ceremony and said, ``We have no doubt that Mr. Muldoon will make many more contributions to the recreational boating community in years to come, but we wanted to take this opportunity to thank him for all he has done over the past four decades.''  In October, US SAILING awarded Mr. Muldoon its most prestigious award, the Nathanael G. Herreshoff trophy, for his outstanding contributions to the sport of sailing in the U.S. over many years. Since being founded in 1897, U.S. SAILING has been the national governing body (NGB) for sailing and provides leadership for the sport in the United States. Past winners of the Herreshoff trophy have included Harold Sterling Vanderbilt, Harry C. Melges Jr., Gary Jobson, and Roy E. Disney.  US SAILING has also awarded Mr. Muldoon the Timothea Larr trophy for the outstanding vision and guidance he has provided to the advancement of sailor education in the United States. The president of US SAILING, Gary Jobson, said that Mr. Muldoon ``has been and always will be an outstanding asset to US SAILING and the general sailing community.''  Mr. Muldoon has held more than 30 leadership positions over the years including the following: chair of the Department of Homeland Security's National Boating Safety Advisory Council, member of the Board of Directors and chair of the Development Committee for the Coast Guard Foundation, founder and president of the Brendan Sailing Training Program for Youth with Learning Differences, founding board member and vice president of the National Sailing Hall of Fame, and president, vice president of the Government Relations Committee, administrative division director, and chairman of the Training Committee for US SAILING.  As chairman of the National Boating Safety Advisory Council for eleven years, Mr. Muldoon has influenced the direction of boating safety and increased the awareness and value of on-the-water skills-based training.  I have the honor of serving with my friend, Jim Muldoon, on the Board of Trustees of St. Mary's College of Maryland. He has been an outstanding Chairman of the Board and continues to contribute his talent, vision and resources to the growth and excellence of Maryland's Honors College. While at St. Mary's, he supported the sailing program and collegiate team. His generosity enabled the school to build its new sailing center which is the training center for St. Mary's 2010 national championship sailing team, as well as, a center with classroom facilities for sailing classes and where any student, faculty or staff member can learn to sail free of charge or use the college boats. St. Mary's sailing coach Adam Werblow said ``Thanks to Mr. Muldoon's passion, vision, and drive, [St. Mary's] now has the best sailing center in the country.''  Mr. Muldoon also facilitated an agreement between St. Mary's College and National Water Safety Congress where Spirit of America's boating safety courses are taught to middle school students.  Mr. Muldoon founded the Brendan Sail Training Program for Youth with Learning Differences. Through this program, he has been able to make sailors out of a lot of people who wouldn't have otherwise had the opportunity.  He has contributed greatly to the Special Olympics Maryland by initiating training Special Olympians and their coaches to sail large yachts in addition to small crafts. This year, for the first time, a boat crewed completely by Special Olympians competed in the Governor's Cup Race. Patricia Fegan, president and CEO of Special Olympics Maryland said, ``Jim has not only donated his boat for Special Olympics Maryland fundraising auctions but he also came to Special Olympics Maryland with the idea of having Special Olympians sail aboard his boat on major bay races.''  He established a National Faculty; while he was chairman of US SAILING's Training Committee, which has become the curriculum and standards development engine for the education and training of students, instructors, coaches, and instructor trainers.  He also was a key player in the development and funding approval of US SAILING's national keelboat training and certification program.  Mr. Muldoon is credited with significantly strengthening US SAILING's partnership with the U.S. Coast Guard. According to Captain Mark Rizzo, chief of the Office of Auxiliary and Boating Safety for the U.S. Coast Guard, Muldoon is ``one of the Coast Guard's most caring and compassionate partners.'' He assisted with the development of the U.S. Coast Guard's Strategic Plan of the National Recreational Boating Safety Program and most recently he advised the U.S. Coast Guard and its Boating Safety Division that on-the-water skills based training is necessary to increase safety and reduce accidents and fatalities. As a result, more Coast Guard nonprofit grants are being directed toward funding on-the-water programs instead of the previous reliance on classroom only courses and publication of safety brochures.  He currently resides in Washington, DC, with his wife Linda. They have one son, two daughters, and five grandchildren.  I commend Jim Muldoon for his commitment to the sailing and boating safety community. As evidenced, Jim Muldoon has made tremendous contributions to the boating community and it is an honor to represent someone who has been such a prominent figure in the area of community sailing education throughout the past four decades and will continue to make many more contributions in years to come.                          ____________________
