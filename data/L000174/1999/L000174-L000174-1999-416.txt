President I would like to engage the Chairman in a colloquy. First, let me thank the Senator from New Mexico for his diligence in balancing funding for the wide variety of programs within the Energy and Water Appropriations bill under very difficult budget constraints. Under these constraints, you were able to fund the biomass programs at $72 million. However, one very important program to the Northeast has not been funded. The Northeast Regional Biomass Program has helped my State make significant steps to develop and market the use of wood as an energy source. It is now being used in Vermont schools, low-income housing projects, State office buildings and mills. Without support from the Northeast Regional Biomass Program, Vermont will not be able to build on these successes. Although funding is not included in the Senate bill for this program, the Department of Energy should be given the flexibility to continue support for some of these projects.
