 President, I rise to re-introduce the Fair Contracts for Growers Act of 2007. This bill would simply instill fairness into contractual dealings between farmers and processors. It ensures that parties to a dispute related to agricultural contracts have a true choice of venues.  I introduce this legislation because I believe that anti-competitive activity has become a grave threat to the family farmer. During the last Farm Bill debate, I brought this same bill forward, along with several others. Despite this policy passing the Senate, remarkably the final Farm Bill included no provisions to address concentration.  So, earlier this year, I announced that I will be putting forward a package of bills that will focus on anti-competitive activity in the agriculture industry. This bill is the first step of my agriculture concentration agenda.  Today's legislation is one piece of the puzzle to help stop the unfair impact that vertical integration is having on the family farmer. In the last several years we've seen a tremendous shift in agriculture toward contract production. Under many of these contract arrangements, large, vertically integrated agribusiness firms have the power to dictate the terms of ``take-it-or-leave-it'' production contracts to farmers.  Then, when there is a dispute between the packer and the family farmer, and the contract between the two includes an arbitration clause, the family farmer has no alternative but to accept arbitration to resolve the dispute. These clauses limit farmers' abilities to pursue remedies in court, even when violations of Federal or State law are at issue. This mandatory arbitration process puts the farmer at a see disadvantage. Even in a situation where discrimination or fraud is suspected, a farmer's only recourse under such a contract is to submit to arbitration. The farmer cannot seek redress in court, even if the result is bankruptcy or financial ruin.  Make no mistake, arbitration is very useful in certain situations. It reduces the load on our courts, and can save parties the expense of drawn-out litigation. This bill would not rule out arbitration-just forced arbitration.  The Fair Contracts for Growers Act would amend the Packers and Stockyards Act to require that any contract arbitration be voluntarily agreed upon by both parties to settle disputes at the time a dispute arises, not when the contract is signed. This would allow farmers the opportunity to choose the best form of dispute resolution and not have to submit to the packers. It ensures that a farmer, most often the ``little guy'' in these dealings, is able to maintain his constitutional right to a jury trial. It also gives him a chance to compel disclosure of relevant information, held by the company, which is necessary for a fair decision.  During consideration of the Farm Bill, the Senate passed, by a vote of 64-31, the Feingold-Grassley amendment to give farmers a choice of venues to resolve disputes associated with agricultural contracts. I urge my colleagues to join with Senator Feingold and me, along with our other cosponsors, in supporting this important legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and letters of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                           Iowa Farmers Union,                                        Ames, IA, January 3, 2007.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: I am writing on behalf of Iowa      Farmers Union, Women, Food and Agriculture Network (WFAN) and      the Iowa Chapter of National Farmers Organization to      reiterate our strong support for the Fair Contracts for      Growers Act, and to thank you for your leadership in      introducing this legislation.       Contract livestock and poultry producers are being forced      to sign mandatory arbitration clauses, as part of a take-it-     or-leave-it, non-negotiable contract with large, vertically      integrated processing firms. These producers forfeit their      basic constitutional right to a jury trial, and instead must      accept an alternative dispute resolution forum that severely      limits their rights and is often prohibitively expensive.      These clauses are signed before any dispute arises, leaving      farmers little if any ability to seek justice if they become      the victim of fraudulent or abusive trade practices.       Because basic legal processes such as discovery are waived      in arbitration, it becomes very difficult for a farmer or      grower to prove their case. In these cases, the company has      control over the information needed for growers to argue      their case. In a civil court case, this evidence would be      available to a grower's attorney through discovery. In an      arbitration proceeding, the company is not required to      provide access to this information, thus placing the farmer/     grower at an extreme disadvantage. Other standard legal      rights that are waived through arbitration are access to      mediation and appeal as well as the right to an explanation      of the decision.       Many assume that arbitration is a less costly way of      resolving dispute than going to court, but for the producer,      the opposite is usually true. The high cost of arbitration is      often a significant barrier to most farmers. The up-front      filing fees and arbitrator fees can exceed the magnitude of      the dispute itself, with farmers being required to pay fees      in the thousands of dollars just to start the arbitration      process.       Arbitration can be a valid and effective method of dispute      resolution when agreed to voluntarily through negotiation by      two parties of similar power, but when used by a dominant      party to limit the legal recourse of a weaker party in a non-     negotiable contract, it becomes an abusive weapon.      Independent family farmers all over the U.S. will benefit      from a law that stops the abuse of arbitration clauses in      livestock and poultry contracts.           Sincerely,                                                   Chris Petersen,     President.                                  ____                                                  January 4, 2007.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     U.S. Senate,     Washington DC.       Dear Senator Grassley, On behalf of the Campaign for      Contract Agriculture Reform, I would like to thank you for      your leadership in introducing the Fair Contracts for Growers      Act.       With the rapid rise of vertically integrated methods of      agricultural production, farmers are increasingly producing      agricultural products under contract with large processors.      In many cases, particularly in the livestock and poultry      sector, the farmer never actually owns the product they      produce, but instead makes large capital investments on their      own land to build the facilities necessary to raise animals      for an ``integrator.''       Under such contract arrangements, farmers and growers are      often given take-it-or-leave-it, non-negotiable contracts,      with language drafted by the integrator in a manner designed      to maximize the company's profits and shift risk to the      grower. In many cases, the farmer has little choice but to      sign the contract presented to them, or accept bankruptcy.      The legal term for such contracts is ``contract of      adhesion.'' As contracts of adhesion become more commonplace      in agriculture, the abuses that often characterize such      contracts are also becoming more commonplace and more      egregious.       One practice that has become common in livestock and      poultry production contracts is the use of mandatory      arbitration clauses, where growers are forced to sign away      their constitutional rights to jury trial upon signing a      contract with an integrator, and instead accept a dispute      resolution forum that denies their basic legal rights and is      too costly for most growers to pursue.       Because basic legal processes such as discovery are waived      in arbitration, it becomes very difficult for a farmer or      grower to prove their case. In these cases, the company has      control of the information needed for a grower to argue their      case. In a civil court case, this evidence would be available      to a growers' attorney through discovery. In an arbitration      proceeding, the company is generally not required to provide      access to this information, thus placing the farmer/grower at      an extreme disadvantage. Other standard legal rights that are      waived through arbitration are access to mediation and      appeal, as well as the right to an explanation of the      decision.       In addition, it is often assumed that arbitration is a less      costly way of resolving dispute than going to court. Yet for      the farmer, the opposite is usually true. The high cost of      arbitration is often a significant barrier to most farmers.      The up-front filing fees and arbitrator fees can exceed the      magnitude of the dispute itself. For example, in one      Mississippi case, filing fees for a poultry grower to begin      an arbitration proceeding were $11,000. In contrast, filing      fees for a civil     court case are $150 to $250. Lawyer fees in a civil case are      often paid on a contingent-fee basis.       In addition, the potential for mandatory arbitration      clauses to be used abusively by a dominant party in a      contract has also been recognized by Congress with regard to      other sectors of our economy. In 2002, legislation was      enacted with broad bipartisan support that prohibits the use      of pre-dispute, mandatory arbitration clauses in contracts      between car dealers and car manufacturers and distributors.      The Fair Contract for Growers Act is nearly identical in      structure to the ``car dealer'' arbitration bill passed by      Congress in 2002.       Thank you again for introducing the Fair Contracts for      Growers Act, to assure that arbitration in livestock and      poultry contracts is truly voluntary, after mutual agreement      of both parties after a dispute arises. If used, arbitration      should be a tool for honest dispute resolution, not a weapon      used to limit a farmers' right to seek justice for abusive      trade practices.       I look forward to working with you toward enactment of this      important legislation.           Sincerely,                                                Steven D. Etka                                 Legislative Coordinator, Campaign     for Contract Agriculture Reform.                                  ____                               National Family Farm Coalition,                                  Washington, DC, January 9, 2007.     Senator Charles Grassley,     Hart Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley; I am writing as president of the      National Family Farm Coalition to express our strong support      for the Fair Contracts for Growers Act, and to thank you for      your leadership in introducing this legislation. As you know,      the National Family Farm Coalition provides a voice for      grassroots groups on farm, food, trade and rural economic      issues to ensure fair prices for family farmers, safe and      healthy food, and vibrant, environmentally sound rural      communities. Our organization is committed to promoting      justice in agriculture, which is stymied by current practices      that give farmers unfair and unjust difficulties when they      wish to arbitrate a contract dispute.       Therefore, the Fair Contracts for Growers Act is very      timely. With the rapid rise of vertically integrated methods      of agricultural production, farmers are increasingly      producing agricultural products under contract with large      processors. Under these contracts, it is common for farmers      and growers to be forced to sign mandatory arbitration      clauses, as part of a take-it-or-leave-it, non-negotiable      contract with a large, vertically integrated processing firm.      In doing so, the farmer is forced to give up their basic      constitutional right to a jury trial, and instead must accept      an alternative dispute resolution forum that severely limits      their rights and is often prohibitively expensive. These      clauses are signed before any dispute arises, leaving farmers      little if any ability to seek justice if they become the      victim of fraudulent or abusive trade practices.       Because basic legal processes such as discovery are waived      in arbitration, it becomes very difficult for a farmer or      grower to prove their case. In these cases, the company has      control of the information needed for a grower to argue their      case.

In an arbitration      proceeding, the company is not required to provide access to      this information, thus placing the farmer/grower at an      extreme disadvantage. Other standard legal rights that are      waived through arbitration are access to mediation and      appeal, as well as the right to an explanation of the      decision.       In addition, it is often assumed that arbitration is a less      costly way of resolving dispute than going to court. Yet for      the farmer, the opposite is usually true.

Thank you for your leadership in recognizing these      concerns, and your willingness to introduce common sense      legislation to stop the abuse of arbitration clauses in the      livestock and poultry contracts.           Sincerely,                                                    George Naylor,     President.                                  ____                            Sustainable Agriculture Coalition,                                  Washington, DC, January 8, 2007.     Senator Chuck Grassley,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: I am writing on behalf of the      Sustainable Agriculture Coalition in support of the Fair      Contract for Growers Act and to thank you for your leadership      in introducing this legislation.       The Fair Contracts for Growers Act is necessary to help      level the playing field for our farmers and ranchers who      enter into production contracts with packers and processors.      The rapid rise of vertically integrated production chains,      combined with the high degree of concentration of poultry      processors and meatpackers, leaves farmers and ranchers in      many regions of the country with few choices, or only a      single choice, of buyers for their products. Increasingly,      farmers and ranchers are confronted with ``take-it-or-leave-     it,'' non-negotiable contracts, written by the company. These      contracts require that farmers and ranchers give up the basic      constitutional right of access to the courts and sign      mandatory binding arbitration clauses if they want access to      a market for their products. These clauses are signed before      any dispute arises, leaving the producers little, if any,      ability to seek justice if they become the victim of      fraudulent or abusive trade practices.       Arbitration can be a valid and effective method of dispute      resolution when agreed to voluntarily through negotiation by      two parties of similar power, but when used by a dominant      party to limit the legal recourse of a weaker party in a non-     negotiable contract, it becomes an abusive weapon. Many basic      legal processes are not available to farmers and ranchers in      arbitration. In most agricultural production contract      disputes, the company has control of the information needed      for a grower to argue a case. In a civil court case, this      evidence would be available to the grower's attorney through      discovery. In an arbitration proceeding, however, the company      is not required to provide access to this information, thus      placing the grower at an extreme disadvantage. In addition,      in most arbitration proceedings, a decision is issued without      an opinion providing an explanation of the principles and      standards or even the facts considered in reaching the      decision. The arbitration proceeding is a private, closed to      effective public safeguards, and the arbitration decisions      are often confidential and rarely subject to public oversight      or judicia1 review.       Moreover, there is a growing perception that the      arbitration system is biased towards the companies. This      private system is basically supported financially by the      companies which are involved repeatedly in arbitration cases.      The companies also know the history of previous arbitrations,      including which arbitrators generally decide in the      companies' favor. This arbitration history is rarely      available to a farmer or rancher involved in a single      arbitration proceeding.       Arbitration is often assumed to be a less costly way of      resolving disputes than litigation. But this assumption must      be tested in light of the relative resources of the parties.      For most farmers and ranchers, arbitration is a significant      expense in relation to their income. One immediate financial      barrier is filing fees and case service fees, which in      arbitration are usually divided between the parties. A few      thousand dollars out of pocket is a minuscule expense for a      well-heeled company but can be an insurmountable barrier for      a farmer with a modest income who is in conflict with the      farmer's chief source of income. This significant cost      barrier to most farmers, when coupled with the disadvantages      of the arbitration process, can deny farmers an effective      remedy in contract dispute cases with merit.       The Sustainable Agriculture Coalition represents family      farm, rural development, and conservation and environmental      organizations that share a commitment to federal policy      reform to promote sustainable agriculture and rural      development. Coalition member organizations include the      Agriculture and Land Based Training Association, American      Natural Heritage Foundation, C.A.S.A. del Llano (Communities      Assuring a Sustainable Agriculture), Center for Rural      Affairs, Dakota Rural Action, Delta Land and Community, Inc.,      Future Harvest-CASA (Chesapeake Alliance for Sustainable      Agriculture), Illinois Stewardship Alliance, Institute for      Agriculture and Trade Policy, Iowa Environmental Council,      Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation, Kansas Rural Center, Kerr      Center for Sustainable Agriculture, Land Stewardship Project,      Michael Fields Agricultural Institute, Michigan Agricultural      Stewardship Association, Michigan Land Use Institute, Midwest      Organic and Sustainable Education Service, The Minnesota      Project, National Catholic Rural Life Conference, National      Center for Appropriate Technology, Northern Plains      Sustainable Agriculture Society, Ohio Ecological Food and      Farm Association, Organic Farming Research Foundation,      Pennsylvania Association for Sustainable Agriculture, Rural      Advancement Foundation International-USA, the Sierra Club      Agriculture Committee, and the Washington Sustainable Food      and Farming Network. Our member organizations included      thousands of farmers and ranchers with small and mid-size      operations, a number of whom have entered into agricultural      production contracts or are considering whether to sign these      contracts. As individuals, these farmers and ranchers do not      have the financial power or negotiating position that      companies enjoy in virtually every contract dispute. We agree      with Senator Grassley that, in the face of such unequal      bargaining power, the Fair Contract for Growers Act is a      modest and appropriate step which allows growers the choice      of entering into arbitration or mediation or choosing to      exercise the basic legal right of access to the courts.       Thank you for your leadership in recognizing these      concerns, and your willingness to introduce commonsense      legislation to stop the abuse of mandatory arbitration      clauses in livestock and poultry contracts.
