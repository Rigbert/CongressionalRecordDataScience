Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5225, introduced by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Bliley), chairman of the Committee on Commerce, revises the boundaries of the Richmond National Battlefield Park. These revisions are based on the findings of the Civil War Sites Advisory Committee and the National Park Service. The bill also encourages cooperative management, protection and interpretation of the resources associated with the Civil War and the Civil War battles in and around the city of Richmond, Virginia.  The boundary revision would establish the Richmond National Battlefield Park to include approximately 7,300 acres. The bill authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire land within the boundaries of the new park, but only from willing sellers. This bill also specifies that, to the extent practicable, the Secretary will purchase permanent conservation easements in lieu of outright land acquisitions.  H.R. 5225 also directs the Secretary to provide for the establishment of a suitable monument or memorial to honor the 14 Medal of Honor recipients from the United States Colored Troops who fought in the Battle of New Market Heights.  Mr. Speaker, this is an important piece of legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5225 with an amendment.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
