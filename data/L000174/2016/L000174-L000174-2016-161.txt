President, all of us mourn the passing of a distinguished former Member of this body, Senator Bob Bennett of Utah, who died of an illness on May 4.  I doubt that there were any in the Senate who did not truly like and admire Bob Bennett. His gentle spirit, his kindness, his civility, and his empathy for others were reflected in his work here for the people of Utah and for the Nation. Marcelle and I are fortunate to have called Bob and Joyce Bennett our friends while we served together.  Senator Bennett and I were poles apart on many issues that came before the Senate, but, as with many others in this body, we were able to work together in good faith to find ways forward through many issues, knowing how important it was to our constituents, to the country, and to the Senate for us to do that. He followed the tradition of other highly respected Senators when I joined this body: He always kept his word.  At the very end of his life, as he lay in a hospital bed in Salt Lake City, we now have heard from his family of yet another sign of his decency and humanity, as he specially sought out Muslim members of the hospital staff to thank them and to personally apologize to them for what they have heard of the divisive and hateful messages and the pandering to fear that has spilled out from the current Presidential campaign. He wanted them to know that he and most Americans welcome them, appreciate them, and recognize the pain that these invectives have caused and continue to cause.  Reading and hearing his son's description of his dad's outreach in his final days touched me deeply, as I am sure is the case for all of us here and for all Americans of goodwill everywhere. All of us can learn from his poignant gestures, and we can resolve to deepen our own commitment to the eternal values--and the American values--that motivated him. What a powerful lesson he leaves for us all.  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Salt Lake City Deseret News about this remarkable and telling episode from the final days of Senator Bennett's life be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From The Deseret News, May 19, 2016] Former Utah Sen. Bob Bennett's Apology to Muslims Receiving Attention                       From News Outlets Worldwide                           (By Scott Stevens)       Weeks after former Utah Sen. Bob Bennett's death, several      national news media outlets have published stories praising      the Utah politician for comments he made regarding Muslims      and their acceptance in America shortly before his death on      May 4, 2016.       In the weeks following former Utah Sen. Bob Bennett's      death, several national news media outlets published stories      praising the Utah politician for comments he made about      Muslims and their acceptance in America, shortly before his      death.       In late April the Deseret News reported about Bennett's      battle with pancreatic cancer and a stroke. He told the      Deseret News ``I want to go to every Muslim and say thank you      for being in our country . . .,'' and, like many other      politicians, Bennett expressed his distaste in the tone and      tenor of the Republican presidential race as he remarked ``I      want to apologize on behalf of the Republican Party for      Donald Trump.''       The Daily Beast picked up on the Deseret News' interview      with the Bennetts a few weeks after the former senator's      death and followed up with their own interview with Bennett's      family. ``He would go to people with the hijab (on) and tell      them he was glad they were in America, and they were welcome      here,'' Bennett's wife Joyce told The Daily Beast. ``He      wanted to apologize on behalf of the Republican Party.''       Quartz followed suit, citing the Deseret News and Daily      Beast interviews with the Bennetts, and adding that Bennett's      thoughts on the treatment of Muslims seemed to be frequently      on his mind in the weeks and months leading up to his death.       NBC News echoed the report that in Bennett's last days he      approached Muslims to offer his well-wishes to them--even      going as far as to ask his son, Jim, if there were any      Muslims in the same hospital as him so he could thank them      for their residence in the United States.       An active member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-     day Saints, Bennett's faith was also at the forefront of his      thoughts as cancer and a stroke left him partially paralyzed.      Bennett ``recognized parallel between the Mormon experience      and the Muslim experience,'' The Week reported, and he      ``wanted to see these people treated with kindness and not      ostracized.''                          ____________________
