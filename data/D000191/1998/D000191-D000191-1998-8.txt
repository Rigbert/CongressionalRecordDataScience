Speaker, it is day 110 of this Republican-led Congress. We have worked 110 days here in Washington, D.C., and you have got to wonder, why is not the Nation's work done?  The average American has worked 201 days so far this year while Congress has worked only 110, first time in 24 years. We have had funding crises before at appropriations time, but it is the first time in 24 years, since the passage of the Budget Act, that the leaders of the House and the Senate, now both from the same party, have failed to agree on a budget resolution.  Now, the casualties of this do-nothing-to-offend-powerful-special-interests Congress are things that the American people want and need, but they will not be considered nor passed by this Congress. Health maintenance organizations, HMO health insurance reform, millions of Americans in this next year will be denied needed tests, needed referral to specialists and needed treatment, some will probably even die because of this neglect. They have no right of appeal under current law. The insurance industry is exempt, the HMO industry, from liability. And they are exempt from antitrust law, and the Republicans do not want to do anything to rein them in and give patients and providers, the doctors who are gagged and want to talk about this any rights, because there is a lot of campaign cash flowing from those special interests.  Teen smoking is up. We are all alarmed. We just read about it last week. There was legislation proposed in the House and the Senate by the Democrats to reign in teen smoking. Guess what? The campaign contributions of the industry speak louder than the needs of suffering Americans and kids who will become addicted to tobacco.  Social Security, nothing except an attempt to raid the Social Security trust fund which they are now calling a surplus. It is the money that is supposed to pay future retirement benefits, to raid it for tax cuts.  Remember last year's tax cuts were paid for by reducing Medicare reimbursements and raising Medicare premiums, that is how those tax cuts the previous gentleman spoke about, those things that are wonderful for the middle class. Look at the statistics on the first year of the tax cuts. People across America should compare their forms for 1996 and 1997 and see what they got.  If they are a family that earns less than 59,000, the average was $6. If they earned between 59,000 and 112,000, the average was $61. But if they are in that stratospheric 1 half of 1 percent who earn over $600,000 a year, $7,381.  Now, someone rose earlier when I raised this on the other side and said, well the middle class tax cuts will kick in later. Why did not the middle class tax cuts kick in first? Why did the tax cuts for the most wealthy people in the country come first? Because that side of the aisle is servicing them because they are servicing their campaigns.  What about education? The President had an initiative, he proposed it in January, school construction, crumbling schools, crowded classrooms, smaller class size, more teachers. They tell us we have no time and no money to address those needs, no time and no money. Yet they added $4.1 billion to the Department of Defense budget that was not requested by the Pentagon, things that ranged from transport plans in the Speaker's district, retiring other serviceable transports 12 years early so we could build those in the Speaker's district, to a beauty, pharmacokinetics research. The American taxpayers are going to spend 1 quarter of $1 million on pharmacokinetics research, unrequested by the Pentagon in the next year.  What does that mean? It means in a powerful Republican Member's district a company called Stay Alert makes gum that you can chew that has caffeine in it. It is called Stay Alert. And he has ordered the Pentagon to pay that company a quarter of a million dollars to investigate what that might do for our troops.  They did not like gum in the barracks when I was doing my basic training. But I guess he wants to introduce gum into the barracks, or I do not know what the deal is. But why did the American taxpayers have to pay a quarter million dollars?  We do not have money for teachers. We do not have money for smaller class size. We do not have money to do a whole bunch of things around here that benefit average American people, but we have a quarter of a million dollars to spend on pharmacokinetics research for the Stay Alert Gum Company. They chew it, they are going to stay awake. Truckers chew it, they stay awake. You drink coffee, helps you stay awake. Give me the quarter of a million dollars, hell, I will do the study for $10,000.  This is absurd. There is money. It is a matter of priorities. The people have got to choose whose priorities they prefer. The priorities that service the tobacco industry, the insurance industry, military industrial complex, or the priorities that serve the American people.                          ____________________
