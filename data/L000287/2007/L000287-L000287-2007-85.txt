Mr. Speaker, we are here today to honor one of our colleagues, Representative Juanita McDonald of the 37th District of California.  Representative McDonald was an extraordinary woman. She was born in Birmingham, Alabama at a time of racial violence and overt displays of the most open and systematic forms of racism. But she did not let that hold her down or hold her back. She went to college in California, she became a teacher in the Los Angeles school system, and throughout her career she used education as an instrument for change.  She was a great teacher, and she used the power of knowledge and her commitment to human understanding to break down institutional barriers and to reach across the aisle.  I think that is why she made so many strides as a Member of Congress. She knew gaining mutual understanding was the only way to build coalitions and lay all differences aside.  That's why her creativity and skillful leadership became legendary. She was the first Democrat to chair the Congressional Caucus For Women's Issues and she used that power to build a coalition between the women of the Supreme Court and the women of Congress. She knew the differences in their roles as public servants didn't matter. She believed all women in government shared a common bond.  She took concerned women of Congress to meet delegates to the United Nations to unify the global struggle against the exploitation of women and girls.  She developed the first National Teen Dating Violence Week as a platform for all women to speak out against a common problem--violence against teen girls. And she was the first Member to bring the head of the CIA to the city of Watts to address longstanding, widespread allegations of drug dumping in that community.  And, of course, she was the first African American to chair a full committee, the Committee on House Administration. This committee oversees some of the great educational institutions of our Nation--the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian Institution, the Government Printing Office, and the Capitol Fine Arts Board.  We can only dream about what this great teacher would have done in this capacity. I know she would have used the power of knowledge and education as an instrument of change.  But beyond that, Juanita McDonald was an elegant lady. She may have moved to California, but she never lost her southern charm. She was always a lady--as tough as steel but as sweet as honey. She was more than a colleague. She was our sister, our friend. Juanita was a sharp dresser, and sometimes she would dress to kill. She was beautiful on the outside and on the inside. She had a sweet, sweet spirit, and she will be deeply missed.  Sometimes when she would see me, she would call me Mr. Civil Rights. And sometimes when she would see Sanford Bishop, David Scott and me together, she would say, ``What are you Georgia boys doing? What are you up to?''  And when she was planning programs in her district, she would stop by to see members of the Georgia delegation and tell us she needed a box of peanuts. And we would all ante up and make those peanuts available to her.  It is so unreal. It is so unbelievable that we will not see her on the floor of this Chamber again. Life is short, too short. We are here today, and we're gone tomorrow, but her spirit and her memory will live on in all of us.  With the passing of Congresswoman McDonald, it seems the world is a little darker. It seems that a light has gone out. Maybe here in this Chamber and on this Earth a light has gone out. But in another part of the universe Juanita is shining brighter than ever before.                          ____________________
