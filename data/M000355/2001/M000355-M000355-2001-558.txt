 President, let me explain to everyone that if this amendment is tabled, the next one comes from the Democratic side of the aisle. The first opportunity to do something about one of the most pervasive problems in American politics today, the purchasing of public office by people of great wealth, will have been lost.  Yes, it is true we may get back to this later, but there are a lot of amendments seeking to be offered on this side of the aisle. I don't know about the other side. I hope Senator Domenici's amendment will not be tabled, giving him an opportunity. Normally the courtesy of the Senate would give an offeror of an amendment an opportunity to modify his own amendment. Here that is being denied.  In the beginning, we got off to a good start, and now people won't even let the offeror of an amendment modify his own amendment. Senator Domenici is trying to keep his amendment alive so he can offer a second degree which, under the agreement, would be appropriate if the motion to table is not successful, which is something normally he would have an opportunity to do in the Senate, almost as a matter of right. So what the Senator is asking for is not inappropriate. It is the only way he can modify his amendment under the circumstances.
