 This morning, I joined a number of our colleagues in the first conference committee meeting for the farm bill, including the occupant of the Chair. Others of our colleagues are continuing to confer with the House on appropriations bills so we can stay on track with respect to funding the government.  On the floor this week, we will continue attending to personnel business. We voted yesterday to advance the nomination of Elad Roisman to serve on the Securities and Exchange Commission. After we confirm him, we willturn to eight more qualified district court nominees.  Of course, the Nation turned its attention yesterday to the start of Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings to serve as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. Those who tuned in heard about a well-respected judge and well-respected professor with flawless judicial temperament and integrity, someone who makes those around him better. They heard these accounts from a former U.S. Secretary of State, a sitting U.S. Senator, and a prominent liberal litigator with extensive experience before the Supreme Court. From Judge Kavanaugh himself, they heard about his guiding principles--among them, ``Interpret the Constitution as written, informed by history and tradition and precedent.''  In sum, the American people saw the impressive, talented, measured jurist they have heard so much about. Unfortunately, the country also saw disappointing displays of attempted partisan obstruction. The rude, disrespectful, and boorish behavior we saw yesterday in the Judiciary Committee was the confirmation hearing equivalent of an ``abolish ICE'' protest--the confirmation hearing equivalent of an ``abolish ICE'' protest right here in the Senate Judiciary Committee room.  Well, I guess we shouldn't be too surprised. The antics confirmed two things that our Democratic colleagues have told us before: Their minds are already made up--they have already made up their minds about the Kavanaugh nomination--and they will try anything to stop it.  Democrats interrupted Chairman Grassley literally scores of times. They treated the nominee rudely, even insulting the patriotism of this devoted public servant and highly esteemed judge. They offered one stale process complaint after another--completely ignoring the fact that more documentation has been produced for Judge Kavanaugh's nomination than for the last five Supreme Court nominations combined.  I guess our Democratic friends' coordinated plan was to throw a pot of spaghetti at the wall and see if anything stuck. Nothing stuck. Nothing stuck except the complete contrast between a gracious, thoughtful, patient nominee and the hyperventilating by Senate Democrats who are obviously not interested in giving Judge Kavanaugh the fair consideration he deserves.  Half a million pages of documents, 12 years of opinions, the testimony of peers and colleagues from across the political spectrum--any Member who is actually willing to give Judge Kavanaugh fair consideration has every tool they already need to do so.  I implore my friends across the aisle, let's put the partisan theatrics behind us--it is rather embarrassing to see that in the Senate--and continue these hearings with the dignity befitting the serious task before us.                          ____________________
