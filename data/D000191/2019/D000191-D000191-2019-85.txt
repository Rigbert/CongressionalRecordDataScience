Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).    Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this amendment, which rejects the administration's plan to terminate the joint partnership between the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Labor that governs the operation of the Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers.  The Trump administration wants to turn its back on disconnected and vulnerable youth, especially those who depend on Job Corps programs in rural communities. These centers give disadvantaged young people valuable, on-the-job experience and training, putting them on a path to a good job while learning about how to conserve and protect our natural resources.  As a matter of fact, of the top-performing 15 centers, 6 were Civilian Conservation Centers.  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bipartisan amendment.
