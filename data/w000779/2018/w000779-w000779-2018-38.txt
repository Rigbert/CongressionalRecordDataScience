President, my letter went unanswered for almost 5 weeks. Eventually, the Parliamentarian indicated to both Democratic and Republican staff that she was prepared to allow Senator Tester and me to move forward with a disapproval resolution under the CRA without an IRS response to my letter, so that we would not lose our right to challenge the rule on a timely basis. Based on this, on Monday, September 24, Senator Tester and I submitted our disapproval resolution, S.J. Res. 64. That same day, I finally received a reply from Acting Commissioner Kautter. In it, he confirmed, at long last, the elementary proposition that the dark money rule would not be published in the Federal Register. In addition, he went on to discuss an issue I had not raised in my original letter. He stated that, despite the fact that the administration had formally submitted the rule to the House and Senate for review under the CRA, understanding now that Senator Tester and I intended to challenge the rule under the CRA, the Treasury Department intended to reverse its previous decision and argue that Rev. Proc. 2018-38 was somehow not subject to congressional review.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       Department of the Treasury,                                     Internal Revenue Service,                               Washington, DC, September 24, 2018.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Wyden: Thank you for your inquiry regarding      whether the IRS will submit Revenue Procedure 2018-38 for      publication in the Federal Register.       Revenue procedures are not published in the Federal      Register; rather, they are published in the Internal Revenue      Bulletin (IRB). Revenue Procedure 2018-38 was published in      IRB 2018-34 and will not be published in the Federal      Register.       Not all revenue procedures, including many transmitted to      Congress using the form prescribed by the Office of      Management and Budget (OMB), meet the definition of a rule      under the Congressional Review Act (CRA). We define a revenue      procedure as ``an official statement of a procedure by the      Service that affects the rights or duties of taxpayers or      other members of the public under the Internal Revenue Code,      related statutes, tax treaties, and regulations, or      information that, although not necessarily affecting the      rights and duties of the public, should be a matter of public      knowledge.'' Chief Counsel Directives Manual (CCDM) section      32.2.2.3.2 (emphasis added). Procedural rules that do not      substantially affect the rights or obligations of the public      are not subject to the CRA. See 5 U.S.C. Section 804(3)(C).       We generally submit revenue procedures to Congress and to      the Government Accountability Office (GAO) out of an      abundance of caution and in the interest of keeping Congress      fully informed. This longstanding practice serves two goals.      First, it allows Congress to consider whether a revenue      procedure is subject to the CRA by requesting advice from      GAO. Second, if a revenue procedure meets the definition of a      rule under the CRA, the consequences of failing to submit it      when required are significant. Because rules are effective      only after submission to Congress, a revenue procedure that      is later deemed to be a rule would not be effective if it had      not been submitted following the CRA. Consequently, our      submission of a revenue procedure using the standard CRA form      prescribed by OMB does not necessarily indicate that we have      determined the revenue procedure is subject to the CRA.       We do not believe Revenue Procedure 2018-38 is a ``rule''      within the meaning of the CRA, and we are consulting with GAO      on this matter. See 5 U.S.C. Section 804(3)(C). In this      revenue procedure, we exercised our discretion under existing      regulations to limit our receipt of personally identifiable      donor information that is not necessary for efficient tax      administration. The revenue procedure did not alter the      substantive standards or criteria that apply to tax exempt      organizations, nor did it alter the requirement that      organizations maintain donor information and submit the      information to the IRS upon request. The revenue procedure      imposed no new substantive burdens and in no way limited      public access to return information that was previously open      to public inspection. For these reasons, we believe Revenue      Procedure 2018-38 is exempt from the CRA.       I hope this information is helpful. If you have questions,      please contact me, or a member of your staff may contact      Leonard Oursler, Director, Legislative Affairs.           Sincerely,                                                 David J. Kautter,                                              Acting Commissioner.
