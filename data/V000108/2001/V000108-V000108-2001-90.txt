Speaker, Northwest Indiana lost a great environmental leader late last year. Hanus Jan Steiner, who devoted every ounce of his spirit to conservation, passed away on December 28, 2000. On Saturday, May 19, 2001, Hanus Steiner's friends and family will gather to honor his memory at a Memorial Service in Chestertown, Indiana. Due to Hanus' dream, vision, and extraordinary efforts, Northwest Indiana retains numerous environmentally sensitive areas unique to our region and the world.  Hanus led a very eventful and interesting life. Born July 5, 1920, in Prague, Czechoslovakia, he was the only member of this family to survive the Holocaust. In the fall of 1939, he received a scholarship to New York University. He entered the United States in 1940 and received his bachelor's and master's degrees in chemistry from NYU. After leaving school, Hanus worked for over 40 ears as a chemist in paint research for Sherwin-Williams on the South Side of Chicago. In 1945, he married his wife, Mary Ann Pickrel, who survives him in Alameda, California.  In 1959, Hanus helped found the Porter Country Chapter of the Izaak Walton League of America and served as its president and treasurer. As a member of the League, he was dedicated to the continued success of the Chapter and the efforts to establish and protect the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. Hanus received both State and national awards for his outstanding conservation work.  Additionally, during my tenure in Congress, I have had the privilege to work firsthand with Hanus on various pieces of legislation that affect the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. Hanus' latest effort was to increase the public awareness of E. coli occurring at Indiana Dunes' beaches, specifically Dunes Creek.  Mr. Speaker and my other distinguished colleagues, Hanus Jan Steiner's legacy is a superb example of how activism can make a difference. Hanus will be missed not only by his family, but also by all those who knew him and worked with him throughout the years.                          ____________________
