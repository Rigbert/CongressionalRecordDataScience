President, today, we vote to confirm 5 district court nominees, including 4 nominees to the U.S. district courts in New York.  With today's confirmations, the Senate will now have confirmed 151 judicial nominees for this President. This stands in stark contrast to what occurred with judicial nominees during the Clinton administration. More than 3 years passed during President Clinton's second term, when Republicans controlled the Senate, before the 150th judicial nominee was confirmed. It also took more than three years from when the Republicans gained control of the Senate majority in 1995 to confirm 150 judges for President Clinton.  Moreover, this President's nominees have been considered more expeditiously than were his father's or President Reagan's. It took President Reagan, during his first term, almost to the end of his fourth year to get 150 of his judicial nominees confirmed, and that was with a Senate that was controlled by the same party. President Reagan's 150th judicial nominee was not confirmed until September 17, 1984. It also took President George H.W. Bush well into his fourth year to get 150 of his judicial nominees confirmed. His 150th judicial nominee was not confirmed until April 8, 1992.  In contrast with the shifts in Senate control, it has effectively taken just 2 years of rapid Senate action to confirm 150 judicial nominees for this President. The fast and fair pace at which this Senate has considered this President's nominees is also demonstrated by how many circuit court nominees have been confirmed. We have now confirmed 28 circuit court nominees for President Bush since July of 2001, which is more than were confirmed at this time in the third year of President Reagan's first term, President George H.W. Bush's term, or either of President Clinton's terms.  In contrast to how President Clinton's nominees were treated, the confirmation process for these 5 district court nominees has been expeditious and smooth. The 4 New York nominees come to us with broad bipartisan support, including the support of their two home-state Senators. Their confirmations today show how cooperation can work to fill vacancies on the Federal bench with qualified, experienced and diverse candidates.  All four New York nominees were given hearings at the end of July under an agreement that allowed them to be on a hearing on an expedited basis. This was an example of how the Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee cooperated with the President and with the Committee's Republicanmajority. Given the nominees' bipartisan support, I expect them to be unanimously confirmed today.  New York is an example of how a bipartisan process can work right to equip the Federal bench with excellent and moderate judges. All 4 of these nominees have impressive legal careers, and received the highest rating from the American Bar Association.  Justice Feuerstein, nominated to the Eastern District of New York, currently serves as a justice in the New York State Appellate Division and has served as a judge in the New York State court system for approximately 15 years. Justice Feuerstein also has a distinguished record of service as a judge beyond her work on the bench, including serving as director of the Nassau County Bar Association and as president of the Women's Bar Association of the State of New York.  Mr. Castel, Mr. Holwell, and Mr. Robinson, nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, all have significant litigation experience as well as commendable records of providing legal services to disadvantaged persons. Peter Castel is currently a partner at Cahill Gordon & Reindel and has litigated there for over 20 years. Among other civic activities, Mr. Castel has served on the board of directors for the Legal Aid Society.  Richard Holwell has been practicing for over 31 years as a litigation attorney with White and Case in New York, where he has served as executive partner of the global litigation practice and a member of the firm's management board. He has dedicated hundreds of hours to pro bono activities every year, and received a Pro Bono Award from the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund for his services.  Stephen Robinson has significant experience in litigation and investigations. He served as the first African-American U.S. Attorney for Connecticut, appointed by former President Clinton, from 1998 to 2001. Prior to that, he had served as a litigator in private practice, as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York, and as a counsel and special assistant to the Director of the FBI. Mr. Robinson has also served as secretary and a member of the board of directors of MFY Legal Services, an organization that provides legal services to the poor.  David Proctor is nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, and comes to us with experience as a private practice attorney and the support of both of his home-state Senators. Mr. Proctor is filling a new position that was just created on July 15, 2003.  Finally, I would like to point out that there are now more active George W. Bush appointees on the bench than there are active George Herbert Walker Bush appointees. The President's father served 4 full years. This President has served less than 3 and already has made as much impact on the Federal courts across the country.  We are glad that the Republican leadership has now agreed to confirm these consensus nominees. We have and will continue to work with the Republican leadership and Administration. We would like to be more helpful in the President's identification of nominees and advising him on the selection of consensus nominees so that we can join together in adding those confirmations to the 151 achieved as of today.                          ____________________
