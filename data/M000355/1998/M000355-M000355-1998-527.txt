 President, I rise today to honor a world statesman and one of the most heroic figures of this century on the occasion of his 75th birthday. Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze, the President of Georgia, celebrated his birthday this past weekend and I know each of my colleagues join me in wishing him health, happiness and many years of success.  Mr. President, as I advance in years I become increasingly aware that each additional birthday is a milestone of sorts. However, when one looks at the dramatic changes in both the world and the man over the past 75 years of Eduard Shevardnadze's life, it is more than a mere birthday that is celebrated. I would suggest we should recognize his as a life of dignity, service and commitment to fighting for principle. His has been a life ``in the arena''--one richly deserving of honor.  President Shevardnadze has enjoyed a wide range of experiences in public life. Most Americans became aware of his remarkable abilities when he held the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union from 1985 until 1991.  With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, he left the Communist Party, resigning in protest against the anticipated military dictatorship. It was at this time, as a private citizen, that President Shevardnadze returned to his homeland of Georgia. Here he found a nation in complete disarray, struggling to shake off the years of Soviet domination. Faced with this challenge what was he to do? He did what comes naturally to him, Mr. President--he chose to lead.  Beginning in March 1992, he led the State Council. In October 1992, he was elected Chairman of the Parliament of Georgia from which he was elected head of State. Finally, in November 1995, he was elected President of Georgia with over 70% of the vote. This completed a historic personal and governmental transition.  Mr. President, since his election, I have had the distinct honor of working with President Shevardnadze on a variety of issues. I can say without fear of embellishment that I find him to be one of the true heroes of the 20th century. His vision for a free, prosperous and democratic Georgia is one I support and believe him to be uniquely qualified to deliver. Further, he is one of the principal architects of the Post Cold War world, and for that we should all give thanks.  While many leaders in this part of the world are consumed by their own position and power, President Shevardnadze has demonstrated his commitment to his nation in a unique way--he has consistently appointed, selected and surrounded himself with exceptionally talented men and women half his age. President Shevardnadze's legacy is the determined leadership he not only has shown, but the team of leaders he has cultivated and supported--leaders who will secure Georgia's bright and independent future.                          ____________________
