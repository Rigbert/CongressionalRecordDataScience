Chairman, the question is, if I go to the Deschutes Forest and pay $25 for a trail head parking pass, it is not good in the next door Willamette Forest, and it is not good in the Siuslaw Forest. If I buy one in the Willamette Forest, it is not good in the Siuslaw Forest. But the one in the Willamette Forest is good in some other forest. I mean, one has to get a road map to figure out which of the forests have reciprocity and which do not. It is very, very, very complicated and potentially very costly.
