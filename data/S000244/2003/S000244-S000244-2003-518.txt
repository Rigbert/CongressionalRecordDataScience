Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the outstanding performance of Wauwatosa East High School in the We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution national finals held here in Washington, DC this past April. These exceptional young people competed against 48 other teams from across the country, and demonstrated a remarkable understanding of the fundamental ideals and values of our constitutional government.  Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the program is one of the most extensive of its kind, reaching more than 26 million students at the elementary, middle and high schools. The national finals competition simulates a Congressional hearing whereby high school students testify as Constitutional experts before a panel of judges.  I wish to express my sincere congratulations, respect, and best wishes to Ida Assefa, Stephen Brown, Jon Bzdawka, Michael Chay, Erin Curtis, Devin Drobka, Kathryn Finley, Ayesha Hasan, Angela Jarosz, Suzanne Jarosz, Margaret Jarvis, Elisabeth Kebbekus, Rebecca Keber, Jacob Kriegisch, Laura Krumenauer, Jaclyn Mich, Emily Nell, Meagan Parker, Jessica Ried, Heidi Simon, Madeline Smith, Kristina St. Charles, Carly Stingl, Sheila Vance, Ignatius Vishnevetsky, Sarah Wainscott, Lucas Westaas and their teacher, Beth Ratway.                          ____________________
