President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator fromMinnesota for her comments. She speaks from experience and knowledge, as has the senior Senator from Washington State, on this issue.  In my years here, I have seen thousands of confirmation votes, literally at all levels, up to and including Cabinet members and Supreme Court justices. I have voted for a large majority of a President's nominations--both Republican and Democratic Presidents. Some may not have been those I would have chosen, but I felt that, at least, the President should be given the prerogative, if the person is qualified.  Now, ideology is one thing, and qualification is another. Out of those thousands of confirmation votes, I have a hard time remembering any that were like this one. This one had a whirlwind confirmation hearing and committee vote. It was almost as though they were afraid to have the nominee actually have to appear and answer questions. And now the Senate is going to vote on the nomination of Betsy DeVos to lead the Department of Education.  I will be very blunt. On the very little time that she was allowed to be shown to the public, she showed--and I certainly believe this--that she does not have the qualifications to uphold the Department of Education's primary goal--that of ensuring that all students--all students, not just the wealthy, but all students--have access to a quality, public education that allows them to succeed.  I am both a father and a grandfather, and I am proud of it. I watched my children go to school. And now I see my grandchildren going to school. I understand well the impact of education on our children. When students have access to strong public education from the very beginning, they are more apt to succeed in the long run.  Our Nation's public schools--as is the case in my home State of Vermont--hold the promise of student success through strong State accountability measures and legal protections regardless of one's race, income, or learning ability. They offer nutritious meals for underserved students, many of whom receive their only meals of the day at school. Any teacher will tell you that if you have a hungry child, you have a child who cannot learn. If a child is fed, you have a child who can learn.  Public education means strong teachers and school leaders, technology in the classroom, an assessment to test not just how well a student can memorize material for an exam on a particular day of the year, but how much they have grown over the course of many months.  Many of the schools have counselors and nurses. They operate under a modern infrastructure to support those with disabilities and children in foster care. But public education also means that both the States and the Federal Government are held accountable for everyone having access to the same excellent resources.  In fact, just over 1 year ago, this body agreed to these protections. We passed the Every Student Succeeds Act here in the Senate by a vote of 85 to 12--an amazing, overwhelming, bipartisan vote. It was the firm agreement among the majority of the Senate--Republicans and Democrats alike--that all students deserve access to critical public school resources in order to succeed. We made a promise that we would do better by our students; that public schools would be the premier standard for outstanding education for all.  Unfortunately, the nominee before us--in the very little time that she was allowed to testify and be questioned in the confirmation hearing--showed that she does not share these same goals. Instead, she has referred to public schools as a ``dead end.''  Well, if you are a billionaire, you have a choice to go wherever you want to school. Maybe these people in a public school are not good enough for you? Well, then, go buy a school if you want. Most people don't have that option. Most people are hard working. My wife and I were when our kids were in school. Our children are today.  What does Betsy DeVos advocate for? She advocates for the privatization of education. She has funneled millions of dollars into organizations and initiatives to promote private school vouchers and school choice.  These efforts have diverted public funds toward private schools, schools that are not held to any antidiscrimination or accountability standards. These schools can discriminate all they want.  At her confirmation hearing--in the very little time that she did speak--she did not understand the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. This is a landmark law. It is a Federal law that public schools in all 50 States must follow.  Lastly, Mrs. DeVos and her family have contributed to anti-LGBT causes and anti-women's health efforts, which are in direct conflict to the one who is supposed to lead the Department of Education. How can a nominee disagree with the mission of the Department of Education and be fit to oversee that agency and promote the civil rights of schools and college campuses?  She also appears to oppose efforts to expand college access, in an era when college is so important. Again, in the little bit of time she was allowed to testify before the Senate HELP Committee in January, Mrs. DeVos, when asked, would not agree to work with States to offer free community college to eligible students, instead saying that ``nothing in life is truly free.'' This is an easy thing to say if you are a billionaire.  She also admitted to knowing little about the Pell Grant Program and Federal student loans, as neither she nor her children have ever had to use such resources. As most of us know our children will have to use them, this is simply out of touch with the real life expectations of millions of students and families who rely on these funds to make college attainable.  It is what I hear from hard-working families in Vermont. Parents tell me that their child is going to be the first one in their family to go to college, and the only reason they can do it is because they can get Pell grants or Federal student loans. Mrs. Devos's answer is: What are those?  College tuition rates have climbed more than 300 percent in the last decade. It is unacceptable to deny students Federal financial resources. To say, well, if you are rich, you can have them, but otherwise, tough.  As it is, students are increasingly saddled by insurmountable student loan debt. Many forgo starting a family, or buying a house or a car. Many of these students have also fallen prey to for-profit institutions, many of which continue to offer the false promise of gainful employment upon graduation. In reality, many of these institutions offer nontransferable credits or unaccredited degrees, and are increasingly shuttering their doors, leaving students with egregious debt and nowhere to turn to finish their degrees.  The Department of Education has an extremely important role to ensure that all students--of every race, income level, or whether that student has disabilities or not--have access to the critical tools provided by public schools and by student financial aid programs.  Thousands--thousands--of Vermont-ers have called or written to me worried that Mrs. DeVos does not agree with these principles. When I say thousands, to put that in context, we are the second smallest State in the Union. Thousands have contacted me. I share these concerns of my fellow Vermonters.  They know my children went to public school. They want to be able to send their children to public school too. They want the best education.  I am telling these Vermonters I will not support this confirmation. It is dangerous and shortsighted to confirm someone who has so much to learn about our Nation's public schools and the challenges they face.  Universal free public schools were a revolutionary American invention. It has helped make America the great Nation it is today. So in the United States, we should strengthen public schools, not snub them.  Mrs. DeVos is the wrong choice for our children but also for our Nation's future. Our public schools need strong leadership, not someone who has made it her life's work to undermine their success. So I oppose this nomination. I hope my fellow Senators will too.                               Travel Ban  Mr. President, while I have the floor, I will just take another minute or two to mention something else, as I have mentioned Vermont.  On February 1 of this year, Vermont welcomed 31 new U.S. citizens from 14 countries through a naturalization ceremony in Rutland, VT. Later that night, more than 1,000 people from oursmall city in Vermont gathered on our statehouse lawn--just a few feet from where I was born and raised--in support of refugees and immigrants.  We Vermonters understand what community means. It is a helping hand in a time of need. It is a kind word in a moment of distress. It is a welcoming embrace to calm a fear. We may be small, but in Vermont there is no limit to our compassion.  As with each of our 50 great American States, immigration is a rich part of Vermont's past. For decades, we have opened our communities to immigrants and refugees. They have all become part of the fabric of our State. They have enriched us with their diverse cultures.  Since the President signed his disgraceful Executive order that stymied our immigrant resettlement program and sent a shameful message to Muslims that they are not welcome in our country, I have heard from hundreds of Vermonters. Compassionate Vermont-ers, pleading that we continue our Refugee Resettlement Program and welcome refugees of all religions, concerned Vermonters, anxious about the threats to our Constitution's protected freedoms and rights, nervous Vermonters wondering what next steps this administration will take in the name of security, but are just rooted in politically charged scare tactics.  Vermonters have already proven that we will not back down. Marching in Montpelier and in Washington on January 21, Vermonters' voices were heard. In candlelit vigils across the State, their empathy has been seen. At the naturalization ceremony on February 1, Vermont's welcoming spirit could be felt.  A man I admire greatly, Federal District Court Judge Geoffrey Crawford, gave stirring remarks at that naturalization ceremony, and the impact of those remarks are summarized by this one line, which he directed particularly to our new Muslim citizens: ``You are equal in the eyes of the law.'' Judge Crawford's message was simple: You are welcome. You are equal. You are protected.  My fellow Vermonters inspire me every day. We should all take note from their example of what it means to be patriotic Americans.  So I ask unanimous consent that Judge Crawford's remarks from the February 1, 2017, naturalization ceremony in Rutland, VT, be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  I look at Judge Crawford. Frankly, I have no idea what either he or the other Federal district judge's politics are. I just know they uphold the law. We are fortunate in this country to have a Federal court system made up of men and women of integrity, competence, and independence.  I was shocked this weekend when the President of the United States tried to demean the Federal judiciary, tried to downgrade an individual Federal judge because he disagreed with him. And it was almost within hours that he praised President Putin and tried to excuse the assassinations--the assassinations--carried out in Russia against journalists or those who disagreed with Putin--by saying: Well, that is no different than our country.  Well, Mr. President, I am proud to be a citizen of the United States of America, and we are different than Russia. You may have some ``friendship'' with Vladimir Putin, but let me tell you right now, show some more respect to our country and to our Constitution.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:   Remarks of Judge Geoffrey Crawford at 2/1/17 U.S. Naturalization                          Ceremony, Rutland, VT       Welcome--all of you--to your naturalization ceremony. You      will all leave here as American citizens. We are very happy      to include you among us. Let me take a moment to talk about a      few things.       First, although our theme today is one of welcome and new      beginnings, we should all start by considering both the      difficulties of the journeys you have made and the richness      of the backgrounds which you bring. First the journey. The      Latin poet Catullus said it best:       ``Multas per gentes et multa per aequora vectus''       In English,       ``Carried through many nations and over many seas''       Your journeys have not been easy. Some of you have left      family--all of you have left friends and the comfort of      familiar surroundings for this new place. Some of you are      refugees from lands which are broken by war. Today we honor      the commitment of our nation to welcoming and caring for      refugees. Some of you experienced hunger, illness and      hardship. All of you come in search of a better life. But it      would not be right to forget the value of the lives and      communities from which you come.       As we welcome you, we honor your heritage--your parents,      your culture, and the lands of your birth. You bring variety      and energy and new ideas to us. You know a lot that we do not      know. You have had experiences that we want to hear about. We      are lucky that you have chosen to make your lives here. We      need each of you because of what you will contribute to us--     your work, your ideas, your sense of humor, your food, your      children.       Let me speak directly about our new citizens who are      Muslims. What I have to say is simple: you are equal in the      eyes of the law. You are just as welcome here as citizens as      anyone else. Your faith and your right to worship are honored      and protected by our laws. We recognize that the Muslim faith      is ancient and learned and that it has contributed greatly      over more than a thousand years to our shared civilization.      Muslim citizens and residents have served America for more      than two centuries in military service, in scientific      research, in literature and the arts, in the professions, in      commerce, in labor--in all the ways that we all contribute to      the daily life of our nation. As Muslims, you have the same      right as any other citizen. These include protection from      discrimination on the basis of your relations and your      national origin and protection of your right to worship      freely. These protections are not empty promises. They form      part of our constitutional law. These protections are      enforced every day by our courts. But let me turn towards a      happier subject. This is a day of celebration. Today we      welcome you as our brothers and sisters, common citizens of      the county we all love and which you have chosen as your own.       What can you expect in the years ahead as American      citizens? Two things stand out: opportunity and individual      freedom. These are the values which have brought people like      your family and mine to America for more than two centuries.      Let's talk about both.       Opportunity means the chance to work, to go to school, to      find a way to support yourself which has meaning for you, to      have money for your family, to rent or buy a home, to educate      your children and some day to retire with dignity. Because      our economy is strong, there is room for you to find a place      which suits you. It is never easy, and there are many      disappointments along the way, but it is possible and      millions have succeeded before you.       This is a very open society for workers. One job leads to      another. Your first job is not going to be your last. You are      already in a select group--people who have chosen to come      here and have the drive and enthusiasm to join us as      citizens. The same energy which carried you through the      naturalization process will help you in your search for a      good job.       Now, let's talk about freedom. Freedom means the chance to      speak, assemble in groups, worship, and engage in politics      without fear of interference from the government.       If I can make one respectful suggestion, it is that you use      this freedom by getting involved in a cause or a committee or      a campaign. Maybe something local--like asking for a sidewalk      where one is needed--maybe national--like volunteering on a      political campaign. In case you haven't noticed, we are in      the middle of a presidential race this year. There is a      candidate for every possible political belief. I urge you to      take part in any way that suits your own convictions and      interests. Freedom is strongest when it is used, not when it      sits dusty on the shelf, and we welcome your involvement in      public life together.       People who are born in the United States sometimes take it      for granted. Like people anywhere. Or they concentrate on our      faults and the unfair things about our society. New Americans      such as you bring optimism. You would not have come if you      did not see the chance for a better life for your family. One      thing is certain--after the work to obtain citizenship, no      one here is going to take it for granted. I ask that in the      years ahead, you hold on to the hope and great expectation we      all share with you on this day.       Thank you so much for coming to join us today as American      citizens.
