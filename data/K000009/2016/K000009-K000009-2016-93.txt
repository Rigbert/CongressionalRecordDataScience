Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I also oppose this amendment, which will reduce jobs in our country and hurt the middle class. There will be less investment in science, environmental cleanup, energy research and development, all of which create the future in this country, and have substantial returns on investments.  Since 2003, by the way, the United States has spent $2.3 trillion on importing foreign petroleum. This is a vast shift of wealth. That is the big shift of wealth, and thousands upon thousands of jobs from our country elsewhere. This amendment only exacerbates this shift of wealth from the American middle class.  The bill funds support in science and R&D activities necessary for our competitiveness. The world is becoming more competitive, not less. Energy is at the center of that.  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this amendment.
