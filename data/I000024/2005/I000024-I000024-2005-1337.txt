President, it is my honor to submit today a resolution congratulating the National Ready Mixed Concrete Association on reaching a historic milestone--its 75th anniversary. The NRMCA entered this world in 1930 when the Nation was facing some trying times. The country was suffering from a deep economic depression and midwestern farmers were struggling through a drought. Still, many people were flocking to the movies to see ``All Quiet on the Western Front'' and ``Cimarron,'' which went on to win the Academy Award for best picture. Golfer Bobby Jones won both the British Open and the U.S. Open and in Pennsylvania, a group of men met to officially form the National Ready Mixed Concrete Association.  The founders of the NRMCA wanted to establish a single voice for the ready mixed concrete industry to represent the industry before all levels of government. They wanted the NRMCA to set product quality standards for the entire ready mixed concrete industry, without governmental intervention or mandates.  If you were to ask the founders today about the progress of their National Ready Mixed Concrete Association, I am certain the founders would be proud of the association's accomplishments and the quality of the ongoing work.  While the National Ready Mixed Concrete Association continues to represent the ready mixed industry, it has also become the leader in the practical use and applications of ready mixed concrete, a pioneer in the development and implementation of its education and certification programs, and a strong hand reaching out to ready mixed concrete State associations, ready mixed producers, and other members across the country.  In my State, the Oklahoma Ready Mixed Concrete Association has a close working relationship with the NRMCA. These benefits can be felt across the State as the use of ready mixed concrete continues to increase. In the latest data, Oklahoma ready mixed production hit 5,440,000 cubic yards by the end of 2003. That is an increase of more than 1 million cubic yards from just 7 years earlier when ready mixed concrete production was at 4,206,000 cubic yards.  The growing use of ready mixed concrete has spurred a host of new ready mixed concrete companies and businesses in the State and made the ones already in existence even stronger. People in Oklahoma know some of the names of the ready mixed companies just by the names on the side of the concrete trucks traveling on the roads and highways.
