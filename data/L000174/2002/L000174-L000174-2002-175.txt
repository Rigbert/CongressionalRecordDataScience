President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I ask consent that following me, the Presiding Officer recognize the senior Senator from Utah; at 7:50 this evening, without using time from either side, the senior Senator from New Jersey be recognized for 10 minutes; and then we revert back to whichever member of the Judiciary Committee sought recognition.
