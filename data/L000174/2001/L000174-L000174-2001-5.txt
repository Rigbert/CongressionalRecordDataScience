President, I am also very concerned that we develop policies to more adequately protect our maritime vulnerabilities and protect the public from the threats emerging as a result of maritime trade. I would be happy to work with Chairman Hollings and Ranking Member McCain next year to evaluate whether any gaps in our criminal laws to protect our maritime safety and seaport security exist and the appropriate steps we should take to close those gaps and at the same time ensure that the rights of port employees are protected.  Mr. President, I have also expressed to Chairman Hollings my concerns that we properly limit access to and use of sensitive law enforcement information relating to background checks which are provided for in this bill. Chairman Hollings has assured me that the bill sets strict and appropriate limits as to both when such access will be required and how the information will be used once obtained. Additionally, the Chairman understands my continuing concern over the need for appropriate due process protections for employees of ports at all levels who may be subject to background checks. These would include a hearing that would consider mitigating and extenuating circumstances related to the individual in question. Am I correct that it is the intent of the Chairman to ensure that the Department of Transportation and the nation's ports carry out background checks with proper safeguards in place that ensure due process protections for employees. And will the Chairman commit to work with me to that end? I would like to ask Chairman Hollings if he could explain these provisions?
