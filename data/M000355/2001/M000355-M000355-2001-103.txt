 President, I rise today in support of S. 1, the Better Education for Students and Teachers, or BEST Act. Debate on this bill has provided the Senate with an important opportunity to assess the Federal Government's role in educating our children. It has given us the chance to strengthen the programs which are working and to reform those that are not. Most importantly the Senate has taken this opportunity to empower parents, teachers and local administrators with new flexibility and resources, so that we can achieve the fundamental goal of our schools: helping every student learn.  America's continued prosperity demands a well-educated workforce. In their lifetimes, our children and grandchildren will witness scientific and technological advances which are unimaginable today. Yet, their ability to take advantage of these marvels will be dependent upon a strong foundation in the fundamentals of learning--reading, writing, math, and science. After all, a computer is nothing but a useless plastic and metal box, if a student doesn't know how to use it. Likewise, the Internet, with all its possibilities, is meaningless if a child can't read the words on the screen.  Over the course of this debate, the American people have had the opportunity to view two contrasting visions for our Nation's schools. For far too long, the vision of too many has been based on the Washington-knows-best philosophy of the last 35 years. Under this mind set, for every possible problem in our schools, the Federal Government should design a new Government program with new government regulations and a new government bureaucracy. For instance, the Federal Government provides only seven percent of total spending on education yet demands 50 percent of all school paperwork. This requires 25,000 education professionals struggling to fill out forms in order to comply with Washington's onerous regulations rather than teaching students. What folly and what a colossal waste of time, talent, and resources.  Under this flawed approach, a program is accountable if its triplicate forms' are turned in on time and all the ``I's'' are dotted and their ``T's'' are crossed. Whether the program actually helps students learn has too often been an afterthought. Simply put, school districts are told to make their problems fit the federal government's so-called ``solutions'' rather than allowing schools the flexibility to design their own appropriate solutions.  This leads one to the question ``Has this approach worked?'' Not surprisingly, it hasn't.  Unfortunately, too many American children are falling behind. A recent study found that U.S. fourth graders are ranked third in the world in science and compete favorably against their international counterparts in math. This same study shows that by the time these kids reach middle school, they finish near the middle of the pack in math and science. Worse still by high school, U.S. students rank 19th among 21 industrial nations in Mathematics and 16th in Applied Sciences, Third International Mathematics and Sciences Study. These results are unacceptable. How can we tolerate a system in which the longer American students spend in school, the further they fall behind? We should not fool ourselves into thinking that America's international competitors will sit idly by as we struggle to catch up. We must improve our schools now in order to ensure that America's students are prepared to compete and succeed at the highest levels.  Another failing of this Washington-knows-best vision is the belief that more money will magically solve all that ails our nation's schools. Let there be no doubt, resources are important and I am committed to providing substantial increases in education funding. In each of the past 2 years, Republicans in the Senate not only met President Clinton's education funding requests, but exceeded them by billions of dollars. However, money is only part of the answer. The title I program was enacted in 1965, in an attempt to close the achievement gap between poor students and their wealthier counterparts. Thirty-five years and $165 billion later, poor students still lag far behind their wealthier peers by an average of 20 points on national achievement tests. Worse yet, a recent appraisal by the National Assessment of Education Progress found that the achievement gap among fourth grade students is growing even wider--NAEP, 4/6/2001.  I am proud to say that President Bush, through his ``no child left behind'' blueprint, has offered us a better vision. This legislation expresses the obvious truth that parents, teachers, principals, and administrators have a better understanding of the needs of their students than the Washington bureaucrats who will never meet these children, never learn their names, and never come to understand their hopes and aspirations. This legislation provides States and local schools unprecedented flexibility to design and implement programs tailored to their needs with one requirement: results.  For the first time in history, we will establish a blueprint for holding schools accountable for producing results. States will be required to set high standards and demonstrate progress as measured by annual assessments. Now I recognize that annual testing is not the cure for poor performing schools, much the same way that an x-ray cannot heal a broken bone. But the x-ray will allow us to better understand the problems and more importantly, better develop the solutions. Testing will help parents and teachers evaluate their students and schools, determine which are struggling and why, and then ensure they receive the help they need to meet high academic standards.  In a perfect world, these assessments would show that all of our children are learning and that all of our schools are preparing them for the future. Unfortunately, experience tells us otherwise. Therefore, we must be prepared to provide both the resources to help those schools which are committed to change and consequences for those which refuse. For those schools that spurn reform and chronically underperform, I believe we must allow parents choices--whether that be public school choice, supplementary tutoring services, or a private institution. I believe this point was best expressed by the editorial board of one of my home state newspapers, The Paducah Sun, when it encouraged the President and Congress to ``change the formula for reform by putting power in the hands of parents--not education bureaucrats who have avested interest in protecting the status quo.'' I am pleased this bill takes some positive, first steps in that direction by providing low-income children with expanded access to charter schools, other public schools, and private tutors. I am deeply disappointed, however, the Senate rejected Senator Gregg's very modest proposal to provide these same children in chronically poor performing schools with the option of attending a private school.  While the President's accountability and assessment provisions are clearly the hallmark of the BEST Act, one should not overlook several of the other key provisions included the bill. The President has stated that every child should read by the third grade and the BEST Act incorporates his ambitious ``Reading First'' initiative to meet that goal.  It also includes a new teacher empowerment initiative which allows school districts increased flexibility in solving their unique professional development problems: whether that is through hiring new teachers, retraining current ones, instituting professional development programs, recruiting other mid-career professionals, or reducing class size.  I am also pleased that the BEST Act includes the Straight A's Demonstration championed by my colleagues, Senator Gregg and Senator Frist. Straight A's is the embodiment of local control. This demonstration project would allow seven States, and up to 25 local school districts, to receive most of their Federal funds in the form of a single federal grant. In exchange for this unprecedented flexibility, the participating school systems would be required to meet even higher standards of academic achievement than already required in the BEST Act. Jefferson County Public Schools, the largest school district in Kentucky, has expressed an interest in securing one of these Straight A's waivers and I hope this fine school system is given full consideration.  Over the past several weeks, the Senate has engaged in an earnest and lively debate. I am particularly proud of an amendment I authored which the Senate adopted ``The Paul D. Coverdell Teacher Protection Act.'' This legislation builds upon the work of our colleague, Senator Coverdell, by extending liability protections to teachers, principals, administrators who act in a reasonable manner to maintain order in the classroom. I am honored that the Senate adopted this amendment in an overwhelming 98-1 vote, and I look forward to working with the BEST Act's conferees to ensure that it is included in the final conference report.  This is not a perfect bill. At times during this debate, the Senate has succumbed to the easy temptation to create more of the narrowly targeted Government programs designed to satisfy needs of one interest group or another. I believe the Senate could have better served America's local schools by simply providing them the necessary resources and allowing them the flexibility to design solutions which will meet their particular needs.  However, while I may not agree with every amendment the Senate has adopted, I believe that on balance this legislation will empower parents, teachers, and local administrators with new flexibility and resources, so that we can achieve the fundamental goal of our schools: helping every child learn.
