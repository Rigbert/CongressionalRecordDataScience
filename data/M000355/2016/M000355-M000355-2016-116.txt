 President, I now ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by the majority leader, after consultation with the Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to the consideration of H.R. 6297, which was received from the House; further that the bill be read a third time and the Senate vote on passage of the bill with no intervening action or debate; finally, if passed, that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.
