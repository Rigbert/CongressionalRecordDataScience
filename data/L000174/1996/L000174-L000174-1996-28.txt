President, like many Senators I have been concerned about human rights in Indonesia and East Timor for many years. I was therefore pleased when the Clinton administration indicated on July 25 that it had added armored personnel carriers to the list of military equipmentit will not sell to Indonesia until there is significant improvement in respect for human rights. The administration's policy already prohibited the sale of small arms and crowd control equipment.  Two days after the United States reaffirmed and expanded its policy, an Indonesian paramilitary group stormed and destroyed the headquarters of the Indonesian Democratic Party to eject supporters of the leading opposition leader, Megawati Sukarnoputri. Party members had occupied the building to protest the forced replacement of Ms. Megawati as party chair in June. The breakup of the protest sparked days of rioting in which at least 5 people were killed, 149 were injured, and dozens disappeared.  In the months after the riot, the Suharto government has cracked down on opposition groups, arresting more than 200 members of labor, human rights, and political organizations. Some individuals have reportedly been tortured in detention.  Under pressure from Congress, the administration agreed to delay the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Indonesia in response to the crackdown. In a letter I wrote urging the administration not to proceed with this sale, I noted that providing military equipment to a government that engages in a pattern of human rights violations is contrary to section 502(B) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, and that the Indonesian Government clearly fits this description. I urged the administration not to proceed with the sale until the Indonesian Government ``provides a full accounting of the individuals who have been detained and the charges against them, assurances that they are not being subjected to mistreatment and that they have access to lawyers and their families, and that people detained for their political views have been released.''  I was therefore disturbed to learn weeks later that administration officials, having delayed the sale of F-16's on account of the human rights situation, were saying publicly that the sale would proceed ``as early as January.'' This undercut an opportunity to send a strong signal to a regime that has quashed political dissent consistently and whose actions since July reveal a disregard for the principals of democracy that the United States seeks to promote around the world. The administration should make clear, both privately and publicly, that this sale will not proceed until the Indonesian Government complies with international human rights standards.  Indeed, I urge the administration to condemn all human rights violations in Indonesia. Abuses continue to occur throughout the country and in East Timor. On November 12, East Timorese will honor the victims of the 1991 massacre of more than 200 people by Indonesian troops at Santa Cruz cemetery in Dili, East Timor. A long-standing pattern of violations by the Indonesian military persists on that island, and the anniversary of the massacre at Santa Cruz presents an opportunity for the United States to urge the Indonesian Government to withdraw its troops from East Timor.  To that end, I urge the administration to actively support the efforts of Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo to promote dialog and bring peace to East Timor, and to support the United Nations talks on East Timor's future.  Mr. President, the senior Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Pell, who has been a long-standing champion of human rights in East Timor, visited that island in May and issued a report of his trip. In that report, he describes a meeting with clergy in East Timor, who told him about some of the abuses they had witnessed. I ask that these excerpts from his report be printed in the Record.  The excerpts follow:   Excerpts of Trip Report of Senator Claiborne Pell on His Visit to                Indonesia and East Timor in May-June 1996       I had hoped to meet with the Bishop of East Timor, Msgr.      Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo. Bishop Belo is widely admired for      his forthright objections to Indonesian human rights abuses      and is a vital leader of his people. Regrettably, he was away      from East Timor during my visit, though we were able to talk      by phone.       I was able to meet with eleven priests from a variety of      East Timorese parishes in what was by far the most fruitful      and dramatic meeting of my trip . . . these priests gradually      and fearlessly opened up to me and told me what they had seen      and heard in their parishes over the last 20 years.       They spoke of military harassment of the Church that varies      from obstructing their ability to meet with their      parishioners to trying to create mistrust among the people of      the Church . . .       None of the priests had been present at the 1991 massacre      but one told us, with great emotion, of his experiences, that      day and in the months afterwards. His home is near the Santa      Cruz cemetery where the massacre occurred. He had heard the      shots that morning, but thought at first they were the      rumblings of a storm. When he went out later, he heard from      people what had happened and he went to the cemetery and      tried to give last rites to those who were dying or were      dead. The military would not let him approach and tried to      make him leave. He stayed anyway and soon saw three large      military trucks approach and be loaded with corpses. Then he      saw other trucks come that were filled with water and he      watched them spray the blood off the ground where the      killings had taken place.       The wounded were all taken to military hospitals, he said.      He then proceeded, without prompting, to confirm the stories      I had read and been told earlier, that no one was allowed to      visit these wounded in the hospitals, not even the priests.      Again he was unable to give last rites to the dying. He      estimated that in the month following the massacre as many      people died in the hospitals, either from poor treatment or      from torture, as had been killed in the cemetery. He told of      hearing eyewitness accounts of mass graves holding as many as      100 corpses in one pit. He said the month following the      massacre came to be known as ``The Second Massacre.'' . . .      Emotions around the room continued to rise, both for those      telling the stories and those of us listening to them. I was      struck by the knowledge that 5 years previously this group      would have risked the sudden intrusion of armed officials, as      the priests systematically contradicted everything the      Indonesian government officials in Jakarta and Dili had said      . . .  Mr. President, we owe Senator Pell our gratitude for his defense of human rights in East Timor. I want to again urge the administration to use its influence with the Suharto government to permit the supporters of democracy to associate and speak freely, and to stop the violations of human rights.                          ____________________
