 President, Senator Sessions and I are introducing legislation today that will enhance our national security by expanding and strengthening the current passport and visa fraud laws.  The Passport and Visa Security Act bill adds much needed law to punish trafficking in passports and visas and clarifies the current criminal law. It also punishes those who engage in schemes to defraud immigrants based on changes in the immigration law.  This bill is an improved version of a bill Senator Sessions and I introduced in the 109th Congress. We both have long been concerned about the need to strengthen our national security by strengthening our document fraud laws.  In fact, we introduced our passport fraud bill well before the comprehensive immigration reform bill was passed in the Senate last Spring.  For that reason, I was pleased that the comprehensive immigration reform bill contained important document fraud provisions. This bill builds on those provisions.  The evidence has shown repeatedly that false immigration documents provide a gateway for organized crime and terrorism. The need to take action against this crime is clear.  For too long, the Federal Government has moved too slowly--or not at all--to enhance our border security. According to the 9/11 National Commission Staff Report on Terrorist Travel, prior to September 11, 2001, no agency of the U.S. government thought of border security as a tool in the counterterrorism arsenal.  Still today, over five years since the tragic attacks on September 11, the Federal Government has failed to devote sufficient time, technology, personnel and resources to make border security a cornerstone of our national security policy.  Last year, Congress passed a law to build a border fence. I believe this law was an important first step, but a fence alone cannot sufficiently protect our vulnerable borders.  In fact, as the 9/11 Commission report demonstrates, individuals with fraudulent documents can pose a far greater threat to our national security than those traveling with no documents at all.  Fraudulent documents give criminals free reign to create a new identity and to plan and carry out attacks in the United States.  We know, for example, that at least two of the 9/11 hijackers used passports that were altered when they entered this country and as many as 15 of the 19 hijackers could have been intercepted by border officials, based in part on their travel documents.  The 9/11 Commission Report detailed the way the terrorist operatives carefully selected the documents they used for travel--most often relying on fraudulent ones.  The terrorists altered passports by substituting photographs, adding false visas, bleaching stamps, and by substituting pages.  The terrorists devoted extensive resources to acquiring and manipulating passports--all to avoid detection of their nefarious activities and objectives.  Today, over five years later, Interpol reports that they have records of more than 12 million stolen and lost travel documents from 113 different countries. These are only the ones we know about.  Interpol estimates that 30 to 40 million travel documents have been stolen worldwide.  We know that over the past few years, passport and visa forgery has become even easier thanks to home computers, digital photography, scanners and color laser printing.  News articles document that passport and visa fraud has become so lucrative that gangs are offering franchises in the multimillion-dollar scam to forgers.  Unfortunately, it's not only foreign passports that can be forged. Forged and fraudulent United States passports can be the most dangerous when in the wrong hands.  With a U.S. passport, criminals can establish American citizenship and have unlimited access to virtually every country in the world.  It's no surprise, then, that passport and visa fraud are often linked to other, very serious crimes in the United States and abroad: narcotics trafficking, organized crimes, money laundering, human trafficking, and identity theft.  For example, this past December, the son of former Liberian President Charles Taylor, Charles McArthur Emmanuel, who headed a violent paramilitary unit in his father's government, was sentenced in Miami for passport fraud.  A day later, a Federal grand jury indicted him on charges of torture and conspiracy involving acts committed in Liberia in 2002.  Emmanuel, also known as Charles ``Chuckie'' Taylor and Roy Belfast Jr., was on Interpol's Most Wanted list and the United Nations travel watch list.  Nevertheless, he escaped detection by falsifying his passport application, ultimately gaining easy entry and exit from the United States while he perpetrated his crimes.  Despite evidence that these crimes are widespread and that millions of travel documents are on the black market, in 2004, the State Department's Diplomatic Security Service reports that it made about 500 arrests for passport fraud, with only 300 convictions.  For these reasons, Senator Sessions and I are introducing a bill today to strengthen current passport and visa laws in a number of key ways.  First, this bill adds two new laws with strong penalties to punish those who traffic in fraudulent travel documents. The current law makes no distinction between those caught with multiple false travel documents--the very worst offenders who are often part of organized crime rings--and those with only one false document. Our bill would change that.  The bill also updates the current travel document fraud laws--using plain language advocated for by the practitioners that passed the Senate as part of the comprehensive immigration reform bill.  Thirdly, the bill adds provisions to the current passport and visa fraud laws to ensure that conspiracies and attempts to commit these crimes are investigated and prosecuted just as vigorously as the completed crime.  Fourth--the bill makes explicit that there is extraterritorial jurisdiction over these offenses, so that individuals who counterfeit travel documents while abroad but are caught trying to enter the United States are still subject to prosecution.  The bill also directs the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Commissions to reconsider the relatively low sentencing guidelines to reflect the potential seriousness of these crimes.  Currently, offenders who engage in passport or visa fraud generally serve less than a year imprisonment, providing little incentive for U.S. Attorney's Offices to expend scarce resources in prosecuting these crimes.  Finally, the bill creates a law to punish sham attorneys who cheat immigrants out of thousands of dollars by preying on their fears that they could be forced to leave the country. We know that when Congress discusses changing the immigration law, scam artists target and exploit these vulnerable populations. These crimes should not go unpunished.  This bill provides much needed reform. It strengthens the security of documents used to illegally gain entry to this country and empowers the agents and prosecutors who enforce our borders to take swift and strong action against these criminals.  I ask my colleagues to join Senator Sessions and me in supporting this legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that a bill summary and the text of this bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   The Passport and Visa Security Act                                of 2007                              bill summary       Adds two new crimes to penalize the trafficking in 10 or      more passports or visas and creates a 20 year maximum penalty      for violating these provisions. Under current law, there is      no specific provision punishing the trafficking of multiple      fraudulent documents and each document must be prosecuted      individually.       Simplifies the language of the current passport and visa      fraud laws, specifically by changing the required criminal      intent from ``knowingly and wilfully'' to ``knowingly.'' The      maximum penalty for committing these crimes is amended from      10 years for a first or second offense and 15 years in the      case of any other offense to simply 15 years.       Creates a new crime that would penalize those who engage in      schemes to defraud aliens in connection with matters      authorized by or arising under Federal immigration laws.        Clarifies existing law that the maximum sentence for      passport fraud, when used to facilitate a drug trafficking      crime, is 20 years; and the maximum sentence for passport      fraud, when used to facilitate an act of international      terrorism is 25 years. (This change is technical, not      substantive, as these are the maximum penalties already in      the individual sections of the criminal code.)       Adds language to punish conspiracies and attempts to commit      passport fraud and other false document crimes.       Makes explicit that there is extraterritorial jurisdiction      over these offenses, so that the United States can prosecute      individuals who may have committed a passport fraud crime      while abroad (e.g., the law would reach someone who      manufactures fake passports in Cameroon and is arrested in      the United States).       Adds a definitional section to clarify the terms used in      these laws.       Directs the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Commissions to      reconsider the current low sentencing guidelines to reflect      the potential seriousness of these crimes and the changes      made by this bill.       Creates a rebuttable presumption that a person who commits      one of these crimes, or who is found to be unlawfully in the      country after having already been ordered deported, is to be      detained pending trial.       Adds language directing the Attorney General to create      binding regulations to ensure that the prosecution of these      crimes is in keeping with current U.S. treaty obligations      relating to refugees (which states that refugees carrying      false passports should not be prosecuted) without creating a      private right of action to enforce this provision.       Clarifies that the Diplomatic Security Service (of the      State Department) has authority to investigate these new and      revised crimes (using the language found in the 109th      Congress Senate passed immigration bill, S. 2611). The      Diplomatic Security Service currently investigates passport      fraud, this section just clarifies their authority to do so.       Clarifies that the same statute of limitations (10 years)      applies to all of the offenses     added or modified by this bill--again incorporating language      from the 109th Congress Senate passed immigration bill, S.      2611.                                  ____                                 S. 276       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
