Frankly, during the course of the debate here, the Senator can remember that when they referred to reputable medical leaders in the United States, such as Sloan Kettering--which is a great institution when it comes to cancer treatment and research and is respected around the world--they said, after their survey, that clinical trials really open the door for new treatments and therapies that, frankly, save us money. They found better and more efficient ways to keep people healthy. Meanwhile, the health insurance companies won't pay for them, and we are literally stopped in our tracks from moving forward with this kind of medical research and clinical trials.  In this case, with this little boy, Eric, who passed away from this disease, he was closed out of a clinical trial. Would he have survived with it? I am not sure, but because of the health insurance company, he never got a chance.
