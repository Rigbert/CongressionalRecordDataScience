 President.  Mr. President, there is no more important aspect to this debate than the amendment put forward by my good friend from South Dakota, the minority leader.  Yesterday, the Budget Committee heard very important testimony from Dr. Laura Tyson, the Chair of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. Dr. Tyson explained how risky passing this resolution can be if we do not know exactly what is going to be cut, how much, and when.  She outlined for us how dangerous these drastic, irrational cuts can be to the current economic expansion. She described how our fiscal policy will be ``handcuffed,'' that is her word, not mine, if this resolution becomes part of the Constitution.  I refer our colleagues, Mr. President, to her testimony before the Budget Committee yesterday. And, I ask unanimous consent that the text of an article by Dr. Tyson in yesterday's Washington Post be made a part of the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    It's a Recipe for Economic Chaos                          (By Laura D. Tyson)       Continued progress on reducing the deficit is sound      economic policy, but a constitutional amendment requiring      annual balance of the federal budget is not. The fallacy in      the logic behind the balanced budget amendment begins with      the premise that the size of the federal deficit is the      result of conscious policy decisions. This is only partly the      case. The pace of economic activity also plays an important      role in determining the deficit. An economic slowdown      automatically depresses tax revenues and increases government      spending on such programs as unemployment compensation, food      stamps and welfare.       Such temporary increases in the deficit act as ``automatic      stabilizers,'' offsetting some of the reduction in the      purchasing power of the private sector and cushioning the      economy's slide, not be able to moderate the ups and downs of      the business cycle on its own as well as it can with the help      of the automatic fiscal stabilizers.       First, monetary policy affects the economy indirectly and      with notoriously long lags, making it difficult to time the      desired effects with precision. By contrast, the automatic      stabilizers of fiscal policy swings into action as soon as      the economy begins to slow, often well before the Federal      Reserve even recognizes the need for compensating action.       Second, the Fed could become handcuffed in the event of a      major recession--its scope for action limited by the fact      that it can push short-term interest rates no lower than      zero, and probably not even that low. By historical      standards, the spread between today's short rates of 6      percent and zero leaves uncomfortably little room for      maneuver. Between the middle of 1990 and the end of 1992, the      Fed reduced the short-term interest rate it controls by a      cumulative total of 5\1/4\ percentage points. Even so, the      economy sank into a recession from which it has only recently      fully recovered--a recession whose severity was moderated by      the very automatic stabilizers of fiscal policy the balanced      budget amendment would destroy.       [[Page S2284]] Third, the more aggressive actions required      of the Fed to limit the increase in the variability of output      and employment could actually increase the volatility of      financial markets--an ironic possibility, given that many of      the amendment's proponents may well believe they are      promoting financial stability.       Moreover, they do so quickly and automatically, without the      need for lengthy debates about the state of the economy and      the appropriate policy response.       By the same token, when the economy strengthens again, the      automatic stabilizers work in the other direction: tax      revenues rise, spending for unemployment benefits and other      social safety net programs fall, and the deficit narrows.       A balanced budget amendment would throw the automatic      stabilizers into reverse. Congress would be required to raise      tax rates or cut spending programs in the face of a recession      to counteract temporary increases in the deficit. Rather than      moderating the normal ups and downs of the business cycle,      fiscal policy would be required to aggravate them.       A simple example from recent economic history should serve      as cautionary tale. In fiscal year 1991, the economy's      unanticipated slowdown caused actual government spending for      unemployment insurance and related items to exceed the      budgeted amount by $6 billion, and actual revenues to fall      short of the budgeted amount by some $67 billion. In a      balanced-budget world, Congress would have been required to      offset the resulting shift of more than $70 billion in the      deficit by a combination of tax hikes and spending cuts that      by themselves would have sharply worsened the economic      downturn--resulting in an additional loss of 1\1/4\ percent      of GDP and 750,000 jobs.       The version of the amendment passed by the House has no      special ``escape clause'' for recessions--only the general      provision that the budget could be in deficit if three-fifths      of both the House and Senate agree. This is a far cry from an      automatic stabilizer. It is easy to imagine a well-organized      minority in either House of Congress holding this provision      hostage to its particular political agenda.       In a balanced budget world--with fiscal policy enjoined to      destabilize rather than stabilize the economy--all      responsibility for counteracting the economic effects of the      business cycle would be placed at the doorstep of the Federal      Reserve. The Fed could attempt to meet this increased      responsibility by pushing interest rates down more      aggressively when the economy softens and raising them more      vigorously when it strengthens.       Finally, a balanced budget amendment would create an      automatic and undesirable link between interest rates and      fiscal policy. An unanticipated increase in interest rates      would boost federal interest expense and thus the deficit.      The balanced budget amendments under consideration would      require that such an unanticipated increase in the deficit be      offset within the fiscal year!       In other words, independent monetary policy decisions by      the Federal Reserve would require immediate and painful      budgetary adjustments. Where would they come from? Not from      interest payments and not, with such short notice, from      entitlement programs. Rather they would have to come from      either a tax increase or from cuts or possible shutdowns in      discretionary programs whose funds had not yet been      obligated. This is not a sensible way to establish budgetary      priorities or maintain the health interaction and      independence of monetary and fiscal policy.       One of the great discoveries of modern economics is the      role that fiscal policy can play in moderating the business      cycle. Few if any members of the Senate about to vote on a      balanced budget amendment experienced the tragic human costs      of the Great Depression, costs made more severe by President      Herbert Hoover's well-intentioned but misguided efforts to      balance the budget. Unfortunately, the huge deficits      inherited from the last decade of fiscal profligacy have      rendered discretionary changes in fiscal policy in response      to the business cycle all but impossible. Now, many of those      responsible for the massive run-up in debt during the 1980s      are leading the charge to eliminate the automatic stabilizers      as well by voting for a balanced budget amendment.       Instead of undermining the government's ability to moderate      the economy's cyclical fluctuations by passing such an      amendment, why not simply make the hard choices and cast the      courageous votes required to reduce the deficit--the kind of      hard choices and courageous votes delivered by members of the      103rd Congress when they passed the administration's $505      billion deficit reduction package?
