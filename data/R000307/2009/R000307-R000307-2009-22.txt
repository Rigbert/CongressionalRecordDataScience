Indeed, the Democratic Party assumed control of the White House almost a year ago, as everybody knows, and seated large majorities here in the Congress. The one unmistakable distinction between the parties is this: Our party has respectfully opposed--I underline the word respectfully--opposed numerous efforts by the majority party to impose broad-based taxes increases on American workers and families. So one only need to look at the stimulus debate or the budget debate or the cap-and-trade legislation, and I could go on and on and on, more especially with the health care debate, and the bill before us.  Don't you follow from that general principle?
