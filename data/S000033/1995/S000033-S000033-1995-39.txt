 At that time what the gentleman was doing and many other Members of this House, and what I was trying to do, is bring forth a program that would not be cutting programs for the seniors or the low-income people, but in fact, in a cost-effective way, would be guaranteeing health care to every man, woman, and child in this country without out of pocket expense. In fact, it would be providing health care to all of our people without spending any more than we are currently spending. We have come a long way in 2 years. Unfortunately, we have moved rapidly in the wrong direction.  Today, instead of talking about how we are going to cover everybody, what we are talking about is how we are going to throw huge numbers of people off of health insurance altogether.  What I wanted to focus on for a few moments is the impact of the cuts in Medicare and Medicaid on small, rural States like the State of Vermont. As the gentleman indicated, in terms of the Medicare cuts, we are talking about a $270 billion cut over a 7-year period. In terms of Medicaid, we are talking about a $180 billion cut over 7 years. I want to make a point here that is not made often enough, I think, that the cuts in Medicare and the cuts in Medicaid are only part of an overall attack by the Republican leadership on senior citizens in general. Medicare, yes; Medicaid, yes, cuts. The LIHEAP program, the fuel assistance program that is very important in the cold weather States like Vermont, is being proposed for elimination by the Speaker, the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. Gingrich], and the other leaders in the House. What that means is that many elderly people throughout this country are going to find it very difficult to pay the fuel bills when the weather gets to be 20 below zero in the State of Vermont.  I would also mention that senior citizen housing, which is very important in the State of Vermont, and I am sure important in Washington State as well, is targeted for no more new construction. In Vermont senior citizen housing is terribly important. I used to be the mayor of Burlington, VT. We had long waiting lists of elderly people who wanted to get into the reasonably inexpensively comfortable senior citizens housing. No more senior citizen housing.  Furthermore, we are talking about the elimination of the RSVP program and other senior citizen programs, so we should look at the cuts in Medicare and Medicaid within a broader scope, and that is part of a savage attack on the needs of elderly people.  The gentleman is correct when he talks about the fact that the real reason behind these terrible cuts in Medicare and also in Medicaid have far more to do with tax breaks for the wealthy than they do with protecting the Medicare system.  The Republican leadership is proposing a $245 billion tax break over a 7-year period, and much of those tax breaks are going to the wealthiest people in America. In addition to the individual tax breaks, we should reemphasize the point, reiterate the point, that the Republicans are proposing to repeal the minimum corporate tax, so on one hand we are going to be telling elderly people that they must pay more for health care when they cannot afford it. On the other hand, we are telling the largest corporations in America who make billions of dollars in profits, whose profits now are at an all-time high, that they are not going to have to pay any taxes at all.                              {time}  1915  Furthermore, we are talking about increases in military spending, more money for B-2 bombers, more money for star wars.  Furthermore, we are talking about the maintenance of a system which provides $125 billion a year in corporate welfare.  Now, why, in God's name, are we cutting back on Medicare, cutting back on Medicaid, but not making significant cuts in corporate welfare, which is tax breaks for the wealthy and subsidies for large corporations.  In my State of Vermont, as a result of the Republican Medicare cuts, some 80,000 senior citizens and disabled Vermonters will be paying higher premiums for a weakened Medicare system. In Vermont, these cuts represent a $356 million loss of revenue. As a result of the Republican proposal, Medicare part B premiums will rise from the current cost of $46.10 a month to $87 per month in the year 2002. Under current law, the part B premiums would have increased to $61 a month.  In other words, the Republican proposal will cost Vermont senior citizens and disabled people, by the year 2002, $312 a year more in part B premiums.  What I would point out is that there may be some people who are not senior citizens who think, well, Medicare is providing great coverage right now. Is that not great? As I know the gentleman from Washington knows, that is not the case. In my State of Vermont, I talk to many seniors who have Medicare who today cannot afford the high cost of prescriptions. They cannot afford to pay their fuel bills. They are hurting, despite Medicare, as the gentleman, I think, knows. Elderly people are paying a larger percentage of their fixed incomes out of their own pockets for health care today than before Medicare because of the escalating cost of Medicare in America. So with Medicare today untouched, many of the elderly are having a hard time affording their health care needs. With these cuts, there will be an absolute disaster.  I also want to say a word on the issue of Medicaid. Medicaid, of course, applies to many senior citizens who use Medicaid for long-term care in nursing homes, but it also applies to the low-income disabled, and it applies to low-income children, and I would hope that the American people would take a deep breath and take a look at the values of a society which say, yes, more money for star wars, more money for B-2 bombers, more money for corporate welfare, more money for tax breaks for the rich, but we are going to go after the weakest and most vulnerable people in our society, low-income elderly people, low-income disabled people, and low-income children. What a set of values. It does not make a whole lot of sense to me.  I would also point out that in the State of Vermont and all over the country, when these cuts come to Medicaid and these cuts come to Medicare, many, many middle-class families today that are struggling with declining incomes are suddenly going to wake up and find out that they are going to have to pay more out of their limited incomes to take care of their parents who are in senior citizen nursing homes or wherever, because Medicaid will not be covering those needs.  I would also point out that in rural States these Medicaid cuts are going to be very devastating, and the Medicare cuts as well, for our hospitals. We do not have huge hospitals. Many of the hospitals in the State of Vermont are small, rural hospitals which today are barely hanging in, and when we appreciate the fact that in the State of Vermont, a rural State, 55 percent on average, 55 percent of the revenue that comes into the hospitals comes from Medicare or Medicaid, there is no debate that in rural America and in rural Vermont, many of the hospitals, we have hospitals, Central Vermont Hospital, 60 percent of the revenue comes from Medicare and Medicaid, Grace College, 66 percent, North Country Hospital, 64 percent, Northeastern, 59 percent, Northwestern, 59 percent, Springfield Hospital, 61 percent, Mt. Ascutney, 68 percent of their revenues coming in from Medicare and Medicaid. How do these hospitals continue if there are savage cuts in those programs?  The last point I want to make, and the gentleman from Washington has already make this point, is we are talking about drastic cuts in programs which are going to affect tens of millions of Americans all over this country. The calls coming into my office now are primarily calls which say, ``Bernie, do not cut Medicare. Do not Medicaid. We just can't survive if those programs are cut.'' I am sure that is true of most of the Members of this House.  One would think, one might think that when we are talking about drastic cuts in programs which affect the lives of tens and tens of millions of American people, there would be very long, serious debates in committee and on the floor of this House, that these debates would go on day after day, we would hear discussion from the most knowledgeable people in America as well as from the senior citizens and the low-income people who are going to be impacted. But as the gentleman has already points out, that debate is very, very limited, and we know the reason why.  I think the Republican leadership understands that the more the American people learn about their proposals, and the polls all indicate this, the less support there is for that. So they are trying to push these things through and in, I think, a very unfair and undemocratic way.  I thank the gentleman from Washington very much for the opportunity, to say a few words.  Mr. McDERMOTT. Your last point reminds me of the fact that Seattle is playing, tonight, baseball against the Cleveland Indians. The pitcher on the mound is a guy named Randy Johnson, who throws about a 95-mile-an-hour fast ball. The Republicans are throwing a 95-mile-an-hour fast ball past the American people. They want this jammed through here so fast that nobody can really figure it out. That is really what this is all about, only they do not understand it. The American people have seen that pitch before, and they are going to hang in there and clobber it. I hope the Cleveland Indians cannot clobber Randy Johnson tonight.
