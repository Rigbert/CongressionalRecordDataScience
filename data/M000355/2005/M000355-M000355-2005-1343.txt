 His party was in the majority for 18 months between 2001 and 2002. Then, Majority Leader Daschle got to decide the order of matters to be considered in the Senate. That is the prerogative of the majority leader.  I am certainly pleased to hear of the enthusiastic support of my good friend from Illinois for the nominee, Griffith. Nevertheless, the majority leader, Senator Frist, is charged with the responsibility of determining the order in the Senate. We are on a nomination that enjoys bipartisan support, a majority of bipartisan support, and that is Texas Supreme Court Judge Priscilla Owen.  I am of the belief that some of the efforts to shut down the activities of the Senate may be coming to a close, and I will seek the floor for the purpose of offering a unanimous consent to allow the Foreign Relations Committee to at least meet, which is good news. Unfortunately, other committees are still shut down by not following the normal procedure in the Senate where committees are busily at work while action is occurring on the Senate floor. As a result of actions in the last 2 days, the Energy bill is thwarted, the JOBS bill is thwarted, disaster relief is thwarted, and a closed intelligence meeting was not held again today. The Energy bill, the HELP Committee is out of action today. Asbestos is not going forward.  All of these efforts to delay activity in the Senate, to shut down the Senate are not necessary. It is routine in the Senate for committees to be doing work while we have debate on the floor. Nothing extraordinary is happening on the floor. We are following regular order. The majority leader, as is his right, had called up a nomination, and we are debating it.  We will get around to Mr. Griffith, and I am certainly pleased to hear that the assistant minority leader is in favor of him. That is good news. That is one, when we turn to him, I look forward to confirming with not a great deal of debate.  With regard to the current consent agreement, I object.
