 President, today I introduced a companion piece of legislation to H.R. 3822, the Oil Price Reduction Act of 2000. This bill will help to address the problems our constituencies are experiencing throughout the nation due to climbing fuel prices.  Last weekend I traveled back to my home and held a briefing near Des Moines to explain to my constituents that prices will likely rise significantly past current levels. I had the displeasure of looking truckers and farmers in the eye and telling them there is no relief in sight. In my home state we are experiencing price levels not seen in almost a decade, but all I could tell them was that it is going to get worse.  Many of my colleagues know the cold, hard truth of the matter. When the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) finally makes a substantive, definitive decision to increase oil production, it will still most likely take 60 days before adequate levels of fuel can be distributed throughout the U.S. That means if the OPEC Cartel decided to remedy the harm they have imposed on the American consumer today, we are still at least six weeks away from witnessing the peak in the price increase. We could very well see $2 per gallon gasoline by May and that is not acceptable.  Iowans and the rest of the nation should not have been subjected to this price spike. The monopolistic production controls promulgated by OPEC in March of 1999 should have been challenged by our administration upon establishment, not when we finally felt the pinch.  In addition, the Administration's energy policy is an aberration. This crisis only accentuates the problem with relying on foreign energy instead of expanding domestic opportunities. Since 1992, U.S. oil production is down 17% while consumption has risen 14%. We now import 56% of our oil and that number is growing rapidly. DOE predicts that by 2020 we will import 65% of our oil. Guess which country has benefited the most from the Administration's energy policy? As unbelievable as this seems it's Iraq. Saddam Hussein's Iraq. Iraq is now our fastest growing source for oil. How can we be administering a policy that strengthens this dictator's grip on our economy and the Middle East?  The bill I introduced today would require the President of the United States to cut off foreign aid and arms sales to countries engaged in oil price fixing.  Specifically, the legislation would require the President to send a report to Congress, within 30 days of enactment, detailing the U.S. security relationship with each OPEC member and any other major oil exporting country; assistance programs and government-supported arms sales provided to those countries; and his determination regarding the extent each country is engaged in oil price fixing and whether such price fixing is detrimental to the U.S. economy.  The bill would then require the President to reduce, terminate or suspend any assistance or arms sales to the country or countries determined to be fixing oil prices.  In addition, the legislation would require the President to submit a report to Congress 90 days after enactment describing the diplomatic efforts by the U.S. to convince all major net oil exporting countries that current price levels are unsustainable and will cause widespread economic harm in oil consuming and developing nations.  Even if the production quotas put in place last year are lifted, low reservesmay continue to plunder American consumers and farmers during the busy summer vacation and planting seasons. The Clinton administration was caught off-guard this year without much of an energy policy. Now, the President needs to exercise his authority to help solve the problem, which is going to get worse before it gets better.                                 ______                                       By
