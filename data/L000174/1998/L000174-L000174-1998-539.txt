President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues on the Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, as I have done many times before on nutrition issues, to introduce a bill that begins the child nutrition reauthorization process.  For many years on the Committee, when I was Chairman, and later Ranking Member, we always tried to make our nutrition efforts consensus bills--agreed to by all members of the Committee. Now as Ranking Member of the nutrition subcommittee I look forward to working with the Committee to report out a strong child nutrition reauthorization bill.  The bill I cosponsor today extends existing programs but does not include improvements which I will discuss with other Committee members and the Secretary in the near future.  Last November, I introduced the ``Child Nutrition Initiatives Act'' which contained a number of changes that I will discuss with my colleagues. That was not a reauthorization bill but rather an effort that I hope will be carefully looked at by my colleagues in the Senate and in the House.  I intend to meet with representatives of the various nutrition programs as I work with other Members to help craft a good bill. I look forward to meeting with Under Secretary Shirley Watkins who has a number a great ideas to improve our child nutrition programs. In addition, I will carefully review Senator Johnson's school breakfast bill which has been strongly endorsed by many groups at that national and local level.  I will also gain input from Vermont nutrition leaders, Vermont program directors, community leaders and program participants.  My November 13 statement explains the basis for my bill--I am hopeful that many of those provisions will be supported by the Committee and the Senate as a whole.                                 ______                                       By
