  In 1990, a group of investors led by Frederick Weyerhaeuser incorporated the Weyerhaeuser Company. With three employees in Tacoma, Washington, Weyerhaeuser began one hundred years of expansion and growth across our State, Nation and international borders. Today, Weyerhaeuser is the world's largest owner of softwood timber, and the largest producer and distributor of engineered wood products.  An economic pillar in the Northwest and throughout the nation, Weyerhaeuser employs over 45,000 people. The company's current success is directly related to its commitment to sustainable forestry and community involvement. Frederick Weyerhaeuser's founding vision is captured in his statement ``this is not for us, it is for our children.'' Steven R. Rogel, Weyerhaeuser's current chairman, CEO, and president has committed the company to ``safety and to being a good corporate citizen. Weyerhaeuser continues to manage woodlands to sustain the supply of wood and protect the ecosystem.'' Through product research, Weyerhaeuser has successfully developed new products and services to meet changing customer demands.  Dedicated to the communities which support it, Weyerhaeuser has distributed over $127 million to communities for educational, environmental and other programs. Through the years, Weyerhaeuser has supported recycling programs becoming the third largest recycler in the Nation. The company's 24 recycling facilities collect nearly four million tons of paper each year. In 1980, Mt. St. Helens in Washington state erupted, destroying thousands of acres of forest. Weyerhaeuser salvaged timber and replanted 18 million seedlings in the volcanic area. The company joined the Department of Transportation to create the visitor center at Mt. St. Helens which educates people about the environment.  Over the years, Weyerhaeuser has become an international trade leader and an engine adding to the economic success of Washington state and the entire nation. I would like to congratulate the Weyerhaeuser Team on its past 100 years of business success. I know their innovation will carry them through the next century, and I look forward to the benefits Weyerhaeuser will continue to bring to the people of Washington State.                          ____________________
