 President, I want to pick up on a few things that the Senator from Connecticut has been talking about. We got a vote a few minutes ago, I believe 83 to 9, on cloture on this bill.  Last week we had three or four well-debated amendments offered by various Senators, and they were overwhelmingly rejected, huge votes.  Where are we now? We have worked on this a long time. We have GSE reform in here, which I have worked on for 5 years on the Banking Committee, as Senator Dodd recalled, and the Presiding Officer, a member of the Banking Committee and very involved in the Banking Committee.  This is a very complicated piece of legislation in this title dealing with GSEs, which we have come a long way with. Everybody here knows, I believe on both sides of the aisle, that the GSEs provide a lot of the mortgage funds, most of them today. But they do need to be well regulated.
