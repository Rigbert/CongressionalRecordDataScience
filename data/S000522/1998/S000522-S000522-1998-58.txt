Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), my good friend and colleague, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, for his very eloquent statement. Sometimes there are differences of opinion, Democrats and Republicans. But when it comes to human rights, we do link arm and arm. We have worked very well together over the years, and nowhere is that more apparent than in the Balkans and now with Kosovo being an area under siege.  Mr. Speaker, people literally are dying by the thousands. Refugees are in flight across and through Albania and elsewhere. I think we need to send as clear a message. Milosevic is laughing in our face. He has gotten away with it before. He has been, quote, our partner in peace at the Dayton Peace Accords. Regrettably, he gained stature through that and his gross misdeeds have been put under the table.  This resolution, and the fact that it has passed on the Senate side as well, I think puts everyone on notice that we will push hard until he is brought to justice. And I want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos) for his excellent statement.
