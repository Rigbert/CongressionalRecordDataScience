Speaker, I thank the able gentleman from Cleveland, Ohio (Mr. Kucinich), for bringing us together and exhibiting the leadership role that he has, both within the Congress and outside in our country, in attempting to deliver the messages to the American people that they need to hear about decision-making here in Washington on the important issues of war and peace, and how it affects them in their families, in their communities, and, obviously, in our country.  I know there will be many other Members who will speak, and I want to thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Kucinich) for also appearing on programs like ``Crossfire'' and trying to get out the message to the American people, which largely is being blocked here in Washington because of the way we are functioning as a Congress. Here it is the middle of the week, we have had a few votes today, we could not say any of them were very earthshaking, and now votes have been canceled next Monday and Friday. We will not be here this Friday, we were not here this Monday, and our floor time is extraordinarily limited. So it has been very difficult to talk to the American people about this continuing drumbeat toward war because essentially, our institutions and our ability to function as a lawmaking body have been heavily proscribed by the Republican leadership in this Chamber, and it has been hard to get the word out.  I would say that no gentleman has worked harder than the gentleman from Cleveland, Ohio, to talk to the American people and to present the information that is very important. I know this will be an exchange tonight, and we will go back and forth; but it is probably important to put in some context what happened about one year ago, 9-11, 2001 when 17 individuals, international criminals from Saudi Arabia, 17 of 19 created carnage in our country in New York, over Pennsylvania, and here in Washington, from the al Qaeda network, which is a Middle Eastern terrorist network.  Their supposed leader, Osama bin Laden, made the statement at that time that these crimes were being committed against the American people because he wanted Western infidels out of Saudi Arabia. Iraq was not even on the table. Iraq is not an issue. Our major confrontation has been with al Qaeda; and, of course, they took refuge inside of Afghanistan, and so all of us have troops from our districts currently deployed, Navy, Army, Air Force, and Marines, in that region of the world and here at home protecting the American people and defending our freedom. But it is important to remind ourselves that the enemy we are fighting is the terrorist network of al Qaeda. The President came down here to the floor of Congress and said that.  I think it is also important to point out that al Qaeda is an Islamic fundamentalist network. In other words, it is very religious. They have a sacred rage that has turned their views highly political and highly dangerous into the international realm, and they do not have a presence in Iraq, because Iraq is a secular state.                              {time}  1830  Al Qaeda has not been known to use Iraq as its base. So there is a disconnect between the policies that we are pursuing in order to bring to justice those who have done so much harm globally through al Qaeda, and also there has been an ignorance of Saudi Arabia's role in permitting the Saudis to operate inside Saudi Arabia and then promoting madrassahs outside of Saudi Arabia as well, producing hate-filled young boys who ultimately become terrorists in years hence in places like Pakistan and Afghanistan, in Malaysia, indeed around the world.  So I wanted to just place on the record as we begin who the enemy is in terms of September 11 and subsequently, and all of a sudden emerging then through this summer we begin to hear about war with Iraq, and we ask ourselves the questions and we have gone to all the security briefings here on the Hill, what is the connection? What has Iraq done in the last 4 months different than the prior 4 years? What is anticipated over the next 4 months or 8 months or 1 year different than what happened over the last 5 or 10 years? And no evidence. We have been presented with no photographs, with no intelligence information to give us any connection between what has happened relative to al Qaeda and the enemy we are fighting and Iraq, and yet there is this tremendous drumbeat toward going to war with Iraq.  The President said at the United Nations last week, and I am very thankful that President Bush went to the United Nations because we still have been engaged as one of 189 nations in the world, the international community, he said that Iraq presented a grave and gathering threat. Not an imminent threat, a grave and gathering threat to the world. So those words I listened to very carefully. I asked myself what is really going on here?  I also want to place on the record tonight an article that was in the Washington Post on Sunday entitled An Iraqi War Scenario, Oil Is Key Issue. I think it is important for the American people to know that even though technically the President wants to go to war with Iraq, today 8 percent of the oil we consume here in the United States is from Iraq. That may sound like a paradox. After Saudi Arabia, Iraq presents the largest oil fields in the world and in fact has proven reserves of 112 billion barrels of crude oil. This article talks about the reshuffling of the world petroleum markets related to any change of regime in Iraq, and I think it is important to follow the business pages which today showed that with the possibility of Iraq's regime changing, oil prices in the world were beginning to actually drop because, as this article states, five permanent members of the Security Council, the United States, Britain, France, Russia, and China, have international oil companies with major stakes in a change of leadership in Bagdad; and without question, it says, the United States would almost certainly be the dominant foreign power in Iraq after the aftermath of Saddam Hussein's fall.  The leader of a group called the Iraqi National Congress, based in London, an umbrella organization of opposition groups backed by our country, among others, the leader of that group, Ahmed Chalabi, says that American oil companies would have a big shot at Iraqi oil. I think it is really important for the American people to distinguish between our war with the al Qaeda terrorist network and Islamic fundamentalist network, with no real home country but with deep roots in Saudi Arabia, and Iraq, which actually had been an ally of the United States prior to the Persian Gulf war, and we should be insisting as a country on the evidence for any invasion.  I know that the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Kucinich) would like to add to what I have said and I again thank him so much for his international leadership on this important question.  The article referred to is as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 15, 2002]                In Iraqi War Scenario, Oil Is Key Issue                  (By Dan Morgan and David B. Ottaway)       A U.S.-led ouster of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein could      open a bonanza for American oil companies long banished from      Iraq, scuttling oil ldeals between Baghdad and Russia, France      and other countries, and reshuffling world petroleum markets,      according to industry officials and leaders of the Iraqi      opposition.       Although senior Bush administration officials say they have      not begun to focus on the issues involving oil and Iraq,      American and foreign oil companies have already begun      maneuvering for a stake in the country's huge proven reserves      of 112 billion barrels of crude oil, the largest in the world      outside Saudi Arabia.       The importance of Iraq's oil has made it potentially one of      the administration's biggest bargaining chips in negotiations      to win backing from the U.N. Security Council and Western      allies for President Bush's call for tough international      action against Hussein. All five permanent members of the      Security Council--the United States, Britain, France, Russia      and China--have international oil companies with major stakes      in a change of leadership in Baghdad.       ``It's pretty straightforward,'' said former CIA director      R. James Woolsey, who has been one of the leading advocates      of forcing Hussein from power. ``France and Russia have oil      companies and interests in Iraq. They should be told that if      they are of assistance in moving Iraq toward decent      government, we'll do the best we can to ensure that the new      government and American companies work closely with them.''       But he added: ``If they throw in their lot with Saddam, it      will be difficult to the point of impossible to persuade the      new Iraqi government to work with them.''       Indeed, the mere prospect of a new Iraqi government has      fanned concerns by non-American oil companies that they will      be excluded by the United States, which almost certainly      would be the dominant foreign power in Iraq in the aftermath      of Hussein's fall. Representatives of many foreign oil      concerns have been meeting with leaders of the Iraqi      opposition to make their case for a future stake and to sound      them out about their intentions.       Since the Persian Gulf War in 1991, companies from more      than a dozen nations, including France, Russia, China, India,      Italy, Vietnam and Algeria, have either reached or sought to      reach agreements in principle to develop Iraqi oil fields,      refurbish existing facilities or explore undeveloped tracts.      Most of the deals are on hold until the lifting of U.N.      sanctions.       But Iraqi opposition officials made clear in interviews      last week that they will not be bound by any of the deals.       ``We will review all these agreements, definitely,'' said      Faisal Qaragholi, a petroleum engineer who directs the London      office of the Iraqi National Congress (INC), an umbrella      organization of opposition groups that is backed by the      United States. ``Our oil policies should be decided by a      government in Iraq elected by the people.''       Ahmed Chalabi, the INC leader, went even further, saying he      favored the creation of a U.S.-led consortium to develop      Iraq's oil fields, which have deteriorated under more than a      decade of sanctions. ``American companies will have a big      shot at Iraqi oil,'' Chalabi said.       The INC, however, said it has not taken a formal position      on the structure of Iraq's oil industry in event of a change      of leadership.       While the Bush Administration's campaign against Hussein is      presenting vast possibilities for multinational oil giants,      it poses     major risks and uncertainties for the global oil markets,      according to industry analysts.       Access to Iraqi oil and profits will depend on the nature      and intentions of a new government. Whether Iraq remains a      member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,      for example, or seeks an independent role, free of the OPEC      cartel's quotas, will have an impact on oil prices and the      flow of investments to competitors such as Russia, Venezuela      and Angola.       While Russian oil companies such as Lukoil have a major      financial interest in developing Iraqi fields, the low prices      that could result from a flood of Iraqi oil into world      markets could set back Russian government efforts to attract      foreign investment in its untapped domestic fields. That is      because low world oil prices could make costly ventures to      unlock Siberia's oil treasures far less appealing.       Bush and Vice President Cheney have worked in the oil      business and have long-standing ties to the industry. But      despite the buzz about the future of Iraqi oil among oil      companies, the administration, preoccupied with military      planning and making the case about Hussein's potential      threat, has yet to take up the issue in a substantive way,      according to U.S. officials.       The Future of Iraq Group, a task force set up at the State      Department, does not have oil on its list of issues, a      department spokesman said last week. An official with the      National Security Council declined to say whether oil had      been discussed during consultations on Iraq that Bush had had      over the past several weeks with Russian President Vladimir      Putin and Western leaders.       On Friday, a State Department delegation concluded a three-     day visit to Moscow in connection with Iraq. In early      October, U.S. and Russian officials are to hold an energy      summit in Houston at which more than 100 Russian and American      energy companies are expected.       Rep. Curt Weldon (R-PA) said Bush is keenly aware of      Russia's economic interests in Iraq, stemming from a $7      billion to $8 billion debt that Iraq ran up with Moscow      before the Gulf War. Weldon, who has cultivated close ties to      Putin and Russian parliamentarians, said he believed the      Russian leader will support U.S. action in Iraq if he can get      private assurances from Bush that Russia ``will be made      whole'' financially.       Officials of the Iraqi National Congress said last week      that the INC's Washington director, Entifadh K. Qanbar, met      with Russian Embassy officials here last month and urged      Moscow to begin a dialogue with opponents of Hussein's      government.       But even with such groundwork, the chances of a tidy      transition in the oil sector appear highly problematic. Rival      ethnic groups in Iraq's north are already squabbling over the      giant Kirkuk oil field, which Arabs, Kurds and minority      Turkmen tribesmen are eyeing in the event of Hussein's fall.       Although the volumes have dwindled in recent months, the      United States was importing nearly 1 million barrels of Iraqi      oil a day at the start of the year. Even so, American oil      companies have been banished from direct involvement in Iraq      since the late 1980s, when relations soured between      Washington and Baghdad.       Hussein in the 1990s turned to non-American companies to      repair fields damaged in the Gulf War and Iraq's earlier war      against Iran, and to tap undeveloped reserves, but U.S.      government studies say the results have been disappointment.       While Russia's Lukoil negotiated a $4 billion deal in 1997      to develop the 15-billion-barrel West Qurna field in southern      Iraq, Lukoil had not commenced work because of U.N.      sanctions. Iraq has threatened to void the agreement unless      work began immediately.       Last October, the Russian oil services company Slavneft      reportedly signed a $52 million service contract to drill at      the Tuba field, also in southern Iraq. A proposed $40 billion      Iraqi-Russian economic agreement also reportedly includes      opportunities for Russian companies to explore for oil in      Iraq's western desert.       The French company Total Fina Elf has negotiated for rights      to develop the huge Majnoon field, near the Iranian border,      which may contain up to 30 billion barrels of oil. But in      July 2001, Iraq announced it would no longer give French      firms priority in the award of such contracts because of its      decision to abide by the sanctions.       Officials of several major firms said they were taking care      to avoiding playing any role in the debate in Washington over      how to proceed on Iraq. ``There's no real upside for American      oil companies to take a very aggressive stance at this stage.      There'll be plenty of time in the future,'' said James      Lucier, an oil analyst with Prudential Securities.       But with the end of sanctions that likely would come with      Hussein's ouster, companies such as ExxonMobil and      ChevronTexaco would almost assuredly play a role, industry      officials said. ``There's not an oil company out there that      wouldn't be interested in Iraq,'' one analyst said.
