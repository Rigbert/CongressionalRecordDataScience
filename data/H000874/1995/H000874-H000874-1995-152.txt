Speaker, I don't recall that the gentleman yielded to me. If I could have recalled that, perhaps I would.  The fact of the matter is, ladies and gentlemen, we know what we should do responsibly. We know that we ought not to, in this bill, for the next 12 days, have to attack senior citizens and their Medicare and put them additionally at risk. That does not happen until January 1. There is no panic on that. Why is this Medicare proposal in here to increase the premium on seniors? It is not necessary.  This does put at risk, as all of us know, because the President has said very clearly, I will not sign this bill. Therefore, we have a decision to make. Do we pass a continuing resolution which substitutes for our ability to do our job? Not the President, but our ability.  As the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Obey] said, last year all the bills passed in a timely fashion and were signed by the President. The fact of the matter is that we have not done our job and, therefore, what we should do, responsibly, is not look back and blame and point fingers. We should do the responsible thing today, and the responsible thing to do today is to say if we have not done our job, then we will provide for the next 2 weeks or 4 weeks for the ongoing operations of Government, which everybody intends to happen, without placing at risk Federal employees, but, more important, without placing at risk all Americans who rely on the jobs they do day to day.  Ladies and gentlemen of this House, let us not go through the charade of striking Istook and sending it to the Senate, then going to the President and having him veto it and come back here. Let us do our job first and do it responsibly.
