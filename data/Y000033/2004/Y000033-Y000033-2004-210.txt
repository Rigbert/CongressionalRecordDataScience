Mr. Speaker, I submit the following two letters for the Record.     The Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,          House of Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building,          Washington, DC       Dear Chairman Young: I am writing with regard to H.R. 5163,      the Norman Y. Mineta Research and Special Programs      Reorganization Act, which was ordered reported by the      Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure on September      29, 2004. As you know, the Energy and Commerce Committee      received a named additional referral upon introduction.       I understand that you will include an amendment when the      bill goes to the floor. The intent of new section 4(b) is to      clarify that nothing in H.R. 5163 alters the jurisdiction of      the Committee on Energy and Commerce over the National      Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Specifically,      section (b)(1) and (2) states that nothing in this Act shall      grant any authority to the Research and Innovative Technology      Administration over research and other programs, activities,      standards, or regulations administered by the Secretary      through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,      but does not include those provisions within the jurisdiction      of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.       Accordingly I will waive the Committee's consideration of      this legislation. By agreeing to waive its consideration of      the bill, however, the Energy and Commerce Committee does not      waive its jurisdiction over H.R. 5163. In addition, the      Energy and Commerce Committee reserves its right to seek      conferees on any provisions of the bill that are within its      jurisdiction during any House-Senate conference that may be      convened on this legislation. I ask for your commitment to      support any request by the Energy and Commerce Committee for      conferees on H.R. 5163 or similar legislation.       I request that you include this letter and your response in      the Congressional Record during consideration of the      legislation on the House floor. Thank you for your attention      to these matters.           Sincerely,                                                       Joe Barton,     Chairman.                                  ____                                       Committee on Transportation                                           and Infrastructure,                                  Washington, DC, October 6, 2004.     Hon. Joe Barton,     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Rayburn Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter of October 6,      2004 regarding H.R. 5163, the Norman Y. Mineta Research and      Special Programs Reorganization Act, and for your willingness      to waive consideration of provisions in the bill that fall      within your Committee's jurisdiction under House Rules.       I agree that your waiving consideration of these provisions      of H.R. 5163 does not waive your Committee's jurisdiction      over the bill. I also acknowledge your right to seek      conferees on any provisions that are under your Committee's      jurisdiction during any House-Senate conference on H.R. 5163      or similar legislation, and will support your request for      conferees on such provisions.       As you request, your letter and this response will be      included in the Congressional Record.       Thank you for your cooperation in moving this legislation      to the House Floor.           Sincerely,                                                        Don Young,     Chairman.                          ____________________
