President, the Contact Lens Prescription Release Act of 2002 will rectify a troubling anomaly in competition and health care law: Eye doctors have long been required to provide patients with the prescriptions for their eyeglasses, but not for contact lenses. This bill will require ophthalmologists and optometrists to release contact lens prescriptions to their patients, just as they have long been required to do for eyeglass wearers.  Since 1973, when the Federal Trade Commission issued a regulation requiring the automatic release of eyeglass prescriptions, the millions of citizens who wear glasses have had access to,and the use of, their own prescriptions. They have long been able to ``shop around'' for the best provider of eyeglasses for themselves, but contact lens wearers are often forced to purchase their contacts from their eye doctors, because they have been denied possession of their own prescriptions.  The contact lens industry was in its infancy in 1973, and thus was excluded from the FTC's regulation. Now that 35 million Americans wear contact lenses, the industry is profoundly different. Thirty years ago, it made sense that the FTC did not extend its rule to cover contact lenses, but now that so many patients wear contacts, it seems the time is ripe for the law to reflect this growing health care trend. In addition, because patients' prescriptions can be exclusively held by their doctors, anticompetitive behavior among some eye doctors has escalated, to the detriment of consumers and competition.  In some instances, doctors can effectively force their patients to buy contact lenses from their doctors who can also require them to come in for eye exams before they receive replacement lenses, even if there is no change to the prescription. Patients must then pay for medical services they do not want, and cannot shop around for the best price or most convenient delivery service for their contact lens, like on-line ordering, or discount dealers. In fact, thirty-two State Attorneys General have recently settled an antitrust suit against the American Optometric Association and Johnson & Johnson, maker of ACUVUE disposable contact lenses, in which the attorneys general alleged that defendants conspired to force patients to buy their lenses only from eye doctors, and to eliminate competition from alternative distributors of contact lenses.  The Contact Lens Prescription Release Act would require the FTC to amend its trade regulation rule on ophthalmic practice to require a contact lens prescriber to release to the patient, or her agent, a copy of the prescription, and it would make it an unfair practice for any contact lens supplier to represent that the lenses could be obtained without a valid prescription. This bill would put contact lens wearers in the same position as their bespectacled brethren: They could have control of their own medical information, and be able to choose the right supplier, from a more competitive marketplace of suppliers, for themselves.                                 ______                                       By
