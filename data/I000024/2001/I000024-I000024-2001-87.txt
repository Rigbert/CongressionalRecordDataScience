Even Oklahoma derives its name from the Choctaw words, ``okla'' meaning people and ``humma'' meaning red. Today, I am pleased to introduce, along with my colleague, Senator Nickles, a bill that will provide a grant to help fund the construction and development of the Native American Cultural Center and Museum, which will be centrally located along the North Canadian River at the southeast corner of Interstate 35 and Interstate 40, in Oklahoma City. This project marks the culmination of years of dreaming and planning by many people, including state Senator Kelly Haney, who is recognized world-wide for his Indian art.  The Native American Cultural Center will provide people from all over the world with an extensive picture of American Indians from the earliest civilization in North America, to their current role in today's society. Through art, music and dance, visitors will be able to see the wide array of lifestyles, customs and language of American Indians come alive as they walk through the various displays. The Center will include a 300-seat theater, a museum store, a 40,000 square-foot amphitheater, a festival market place, and artist and dance exhibits. As an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution, it will share and showcase artifacts from one of the world's most renowned museums. An internationally acclaimed team of architects, planners, engineers, and technical consultants, who have participated in projects from the National Holocaust Museum to films such as Jurassic Park, have come together to create a complex that features the distinct characteristics of all of Oklahoma's tribes.  By bringing economic development and cultural diversity to Oklahoma, the Native American Cultural Center and Museum will not only benefit the people of Oklahoma, but the nation as a whole. This important project will serve as a reminder of the rich heritage of the first Americans as well as a symbol of hope and progress for the future.
