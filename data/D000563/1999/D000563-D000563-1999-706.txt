I am happy to.  Really, it is a good illustration of what happened. Back in 1995 with the Government shutdown, this was a time when the Republican Party was calling for tax cuts of $250 billion and was going to cut Medicare for that to occur. And that is exactly what led to the President's veto of their bill and ultimately led to the shutdown of the Government.
