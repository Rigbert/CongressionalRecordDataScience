President, while I appreciate the comments made by my good friend from Arizona, I would only say some of the things there--I know he doesn't intend to say things that aren't true. I would like to quote an article that was in this morning's USA Today. James Morison, who is a scientist with the University of Washington--this is a front page article in USA Today--said the temperature increases and the shifts in winds and ocean currents occurred early in the 1990s and have since ``relaxed.'' This is a recent discovery.       These big changes ``are not related to (global) climate      change.''  This was just in this morning's paper, speaking of the Arctic Circle.  So if we have time, when I have a chance to wind up, I want to repeat some of the things I said about the flawed science on which all these things are based. Until then, I recognize the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, for a time not to exceed 12 minutes.
