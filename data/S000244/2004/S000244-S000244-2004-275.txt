The people of Nebraska's First District wisely votedMr. Bereuter into the House of Representatives in November of 1978, the same year I was first elected to this chamber. As a member of the same freshman class I got to know Representative Bereuter during those weeks preceding our first terms. Over that period, and in the years since, I have found Congressman Bereuter to be a consummate professional and a remarkable representative for the people of Nebraska.  He is the quintessential public servant, having served as an officer in the United States Army, as well as various capacities within Nebraska's State government, including service as a State Senator, prior to his election to Congress.  Mr. Bereuter  has announced his retirement effective at the end of the 108th Congress. During his distinguished career, Mr. Bereuter has left his mark in the halls of Congress. I know that Congressman Bereuter  will be missed in this body for the integrity with which he dealt with each person he came across during his tenure.  Madam Speaker, I join my colleagues in congratulating Congressman Bereuter on a job well done. The people of Nebraska have been well served for the past twenty-six years. He has served with distinction, and will retire with the respect of his peers. Congratulations and best wishes for a long and prosperous retirement, Congressman Bereuter.
