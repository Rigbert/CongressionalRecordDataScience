President, right now I think we are facing a very serious threat. I know there are people in this Chamber who would like to believe that the cold war is over and that there is no longer any real serious threat out there when, in fact, as I have said several times before, I am not the only one who looks back wistfully at the days of the cold war; at least then we had two superpowers and we had an idea of what the Soviet Union at that time had. We could predict what they were going to do. They have a more predictable type of personality. Our intelligence knew more about what their capabilities were. Today we have 25 or 30 nations out there, run by the type of people who murder their own grandchildren, and here we are in a position where we could very easily be challenged in two geographic areas.  So, Mr. President, I hope as we progress here and as we follow through the rest of the year we can change some of the attitudes in this Chamber and over in the other Chamber and in the White House as concerns our ability to defend America.                               Exhibit 1Air Force Leaders Lose Pilots' Faith--Pentagon Memo Details Low Morale,                               Shoddy Work                         (By Rowan Scarborough)       The Air Force is suffering from pilots who have lost faith      in their generals, jet engines that still don't work after      repairs and maintenance depots with ``little quality or      quantity of work being produced,'' according to an internal      Defense Department memorandum.       The draft memo, a copy of which was obtained by the      Washington Times, paints a troubling picture of the state of      American air power.       It says Air Force pilots are in the dumps, fleeing the      service at a rate higher than aviators in the Army, Navy or      Marines.       ``Many pilots expressed great distrust of the senior      leadership,'' said the memo prepared for Louis Finch, deputy      undersecretary of defense for readiness. The memo calls the      Air Force cadre of instructor pilots ``a very disgruntled      group.''       The memo didn't spell out why the senior leadership,      including Air Force Secretary Shelia Widnall and Gen. Ronald      Engleman, the chief of staff, has failed in the eyes of      pilots.       But the service has been hit by a series of public-     relations disasters, including the Khobar Towers terrorist      bombing that killed 19 service members and the attempted      court-martial of Lt. Kelly Flinn. Pilots complain of poorly      equipped fighter wings, too much time away from their      families and air patrol-type missions that do little to hone      air-combat skills.       ``Discussions with fighter pilots reveal a great deal of      dissatisfaction with the ongoing deployments,'' the memo      says. ``There is no training, they are not doing what they      are trained to do, they are simply `boring holes in the sky.'      Combining this lack of mission satisfaction with increased      airline hiring makes civilian life much more attractive.''       In what should be a troubling finding for safety officials,      the memo states that nearly two-thirds (65 percent) of      engines for the giant C-5 cargo jet are returning from repair      shops still malfunctioning.       It says two major depots in California and Texas are caught      up in the battle between Congress and President Clinton over      whether they should stay open. A nonpartisan base-closure      commission recommended closing the air-logistics centers in      Sacramento, Calif., and San Antonio and transferring the work      elsewhere.       But last year Mr. Clinton, making what critics say was a      political decision to garner votes in two large states, said      the bases would be handed over to civilian companies.       Said the Pentagon memo, ``Due to the ongoing political      contest regarding privatization, there is little quality or      quantity of work being produced. Both workers and plants are      underutilized. Further, the operational units are not      satisfied with the products received from the depots.''       It is the San Antonio depot that is sending out      malfunctioning C-5 jet engines, the memo states. ``Currently,      there is a 65 percent reject rate of the engines coming back      from [San Antonio],'' it states. ``The quality is getting      better though.''       Dated yesterday, the memo seems to bolster complaints from      pro-defense conservatives in Congress. They contend the      Clinton administration is underfunding the armed forces at      the same time it deploys troops at a high rate around the      world.       Robert Maginnis, a retired Army lieutenant colonel, said      the report shows the negative effects of cutting defense      spending by more than 30 percent the past five years.       ``The sad state of Air Force readiness can be blamed on the      Clinton administration, which treats the military as a toy to      be deployed for meals-on-wheels-type missions without due      consideration for its impact on readiness,'' said Mr.      Maginnis, an analyst at the conservative Family Research      Council.       ``Depots are caught in never-never land between      privatization, base closures and status quo,'' he said. ``The      results are devastating.''       Maj. Monica Aloisio, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said the memo      is a ``trip report'' periodically done on all four branches.      The Pentagon readiness office uses such reports in making      budget recommendations.       The Air Force declined comment, saying the report is still      in draft form.       The report was based on site visits by defense officials in      June to warplane squadrons, repair depots, the Air Force      entry-level pilot school and an air-refueling unit.       It draws a particularly negative portrait of pilot morale      at the Air Education and Training Command at Randolph Air      Force Base, Texas.       The inspection report calls Randolph a ``poor training      ground for future pilots.''       ``The instructor pilots at Randolph are sick of high      `OPTEMPO' [operational tempo],'' says the memo. ``Most said      that they came to Randolph as a three-year break from being      gone from home too much on deployment. Most of the pilots      also said that they will be getting out of the Air Force as      soon as their commitment is over.       ``The pilots liked the quality of the mid-level leadership,      but totally disliked their senior leadership. They stated      that they did not trust senior leadership and that things are      getting worse. In general they felt they were lied to,      betrayed and treated very poorly.''       Officers at the 940th Air Refueling Squadron complained of      excessive training.       ``Everyone complained that the number of days of mandatory      training per year should be capped and purged of everything      that is not mission essential or job critical,'' the memo      said. ``All of the politically correct, brainwashing,      propaganda and white laboratory mouse training should be      purged from the curriculum.''
