 Let me say that none of the bills that we adopted this week violated the PAYGO rule, as I think the gentleman is aware. The 9/11 bill was an authorization subject to appropriation. Those programs will be paid for within the budget, we believe. We are committed to doing that.  The student loan bill will comply with the PAYGO rule. And the energy bill will raise revenues. That clearly complies with the PAYGO rule.  But the gentleman's point that they did not go to committee is accurate. When we adopted the rule, that was debated fully. The rule was adopted. We had a commitment as you know on our side to do those. We had a commitment to do those in the first 100 hours. That is what we are doing. We believe that they are overwhelmingly supported by the American public, and we are very pleased there was substantial bipartisan support for these bills as well.
