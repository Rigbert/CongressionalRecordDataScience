Brothers' Keeper, a non-profit organization located in Gary, Indiana, celebrates its twenty-fourth anniversary this month. In honor of its anniversary, a celebratory banquet, which will also help raise funds for the continued operation of Brothers' Keeper, will take place on Thursday, March 25, 2010, at the Genesis Convention Center in Gary, Indiana.  The anniversary banquet will feature a keynote speech by Harry Porterfield, who is well known in Chicago media and is the creator and host of ``People You Should Know.'' The banquet will also feature the inspirational music of The Winslett Family Singers.  Founded by the late Reverend James Anderson of Washington Street Church of God on March 16, 1986, Brothers' Keeper is the oldest and only full service men's homeless shelter in Northwest Indiana. Throughout the years, thousands of lives have been improved through the many services and programs offered by Brothers' Keeper. Brothers' Keeper offers not only food, clothing, and shelter to the men it serves, but also counseling services, information and referral services, job placement assistance, and weekly motivational sessions, as well as a new computer room for members of the community to utilize.  While many people have benefited from these services and from the generosity of the Brothers' Keeper staff, the organization has also made extraordinary efforts to reach out to the surrounding community. In addition to the services offered at the shelter, Brothers' Keeper also operates a soup kitchen, food pantry, clothing bank, recycling program, community service work site, and a senior aid work site.  Madam Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in recognizing the tireless efforts of Brothers' Keeper's Executive Director, Mary Edwards, and the many staff members and volunteers whose generosity and selflessness have touched thousands of lives throughout the last twenty-four years. Their efforts are to be commended, and they are to be honored for their unwavering commitment to their community.                          ____________________
