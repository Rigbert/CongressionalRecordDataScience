 President, I rise today to the offer the Procedural Fairness for September 11 Victims Act, a simple bill that ensures procedural fairness for the parties to litigation arising out of the terrible events of September 11, 2001.  When we passed the September 11 Victims Compensation Fund of 2001, we established a Federal cause of action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York as the exclusive remedy for damages arising out of the September 11 attacks. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure effectively limit service of a subpoena by a party to an action under the Victims Compensation Fund to within 100 miles of the Southern District of New York. Litigating a Federal cause of action under the Victims Compensation Fund is likely to involve the testimony and the production of documents by a substantial number of witnesses who may not reside within 100 miles of theSouthern District of New York. Neither the Victims Compensation fund statute nor the Federal rules, however, currently provide an effective means for securing such testimony or documents.  The Procedural Fairness for September 11 Victims Act addresses this oversight by allowing parties to Victims Compensation Fund actions to subpoena witnesses and documents from anywhere in the U.S. The court retains its authority to quash or modify any such subpoena if it is unduly burdensome to the witness subpoenaed.  Justice requires that the parties to cases arising under the Victims Compensation Fund have access to all the testimony and documents relevant to their claims, regardless of where in the U.S. the witnesses or documents are located. By granting the parties to such cases nationwide subpoena authority, administered by the Federal court, this act ensures that they do. As the bipartisan cosponsorship of the act attests, ensuring procedural fairness in these cases bearing on the terrible attacks of September 11 is not a Democratic issue or Republican issue, it is an American issue. I strongly encourages my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to join me and the other cosponsors of this important bill.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2106       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Procedural Fairness for      September 11 Victims Act of 2007''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) The September 11th Victims Compensation Fund of 2001      (49 U.S.C. 40101 note) establishes a Federal cause of action      in the United States District Court for the Southern District      of New York as the exclusive remedy for damages arising out      of the hijacking and subsequent crash of American Airlines      flights 11 and 77, and United Airlines flights 93 and 175, on      September 11, 2001.       (2) Rules 45(b)(2) and 45(c)(3)(A)(ii) of the Federal Rules      of Civil Procedure effectively limit service of a subpoena to      any place within, or within 100 miles of, the district of the      court by which it is issued, unless a statute of the United      States expressly provides that the court, upon proper      application and cause shown, may authorize the service of a      subpoena at any other place.       (3) Litigating a Federal cause of action under the      September 11 Victims Compensation Fund of 2001 is likely to      involve the testimony and the production of other documents      and tangible things by a substantial number of witnesses,      many of whom may not reside, be employed, or regularly      transact business in, or within 100 miles of, the Southern      District of New York.     SEC. 3. NATIONWIDE SUBPOENAS.       Section 408(b) of the September 11 Victims Compensation      Fund of 2001 (49 U.S.C. 40101 note) is amended by adding at      the end the following:       ``(4) Nationwide subpoenas.--       ``(A) In general.--A subpoena requiring the attendance of a      witness at trial or a hearing conducted under this section      may be served at any place in the United States.       ``(B) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection is      intended to diminish the authority of a court to quash or      modify a subpoena for the reasons provided in clause (i),      (iii), or (iv) of subparagraph (A) or subparagraph (B) of      rule 45(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.''.                                 ______                                       By
