 President, in summary, I very much regret this, but I think the U.S. Department of Justice is a unique Department. I think whoever is the head of it has to stand on his own two feet, has to be totally independent of Congress, of the White House, and has to be willing to submit to rigorous oversight by the Senate, by the Judiciary Committee, and has to set a tone which enables the Department of Justice to function as a fair and independent voice of the American people, as its chief law enforcement officer.  I very much regret that I will vote no on this nomination.  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The Senator from Utah.
