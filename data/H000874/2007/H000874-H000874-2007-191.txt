I might say we did so, for the most part, with bipartisan votes, significant bipartisan votes, not necessarily a majority on each side, but significant bipartisan votes.  The Senate, as you point out, has passed two, although I understand that we just read across the desk, the military construction bill was just reported with a request to go to conference. We are hopeful that the Senate will pass other bills within the near term.  It's my understanding that the Senate does expect to be moving a numberof the appropriation bills in the next 2 weeks.  The fiscal year ends, of course, September 30. If we have not passed those appropriation bills, we will have to make an accommodation to keep the government running. We usually do that in the form of a continuing resolution, a CR, as we call it, which simply provides for the continuation of funding of government at present levels until such time as we can complete the appropriation process.  We are hopeful that we will complete the appropriation process in the near term. I won't define the near term, but we are hopeful that it will be nearer rather than further apart; but we are looking at all the alternatives that will be necessary to keep government operating as the American public expect and as we expect it.
