Fifty years ago, the New York Mets, led by star pitcher Tom Seaver, and manager--former Brooklyn Dodgers star Gil Hodges--shocked the baseball world by defeating the heavily favored Baltimore Orioles in the fall classic.  Rabbi Cohen, who has led an exemplary life, taking action on major issues including Mideast peace, antisemitism, and other difficult challenges, sees a common theme in these two victories, 50 years apart. Life, as in sports, offers all of us the opportunity to achieve what at the outset seems insurmountable. Peace in the Middle East is possible. We can end the scourges of antisemitism, xenophobia, and racism.  Rabbi Cohen's words in an article published in the Jerusalem Post on October 28, 2019, ``Letter from America: The `69 Mets and lessons for today'' are a powerful reminder of what we humans can achieve against the odds.  I ask unanimous consent that Rabbi Cohen's writing be printed in the Congressional Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                          [The Jerusalem Post]                (By Michael M. Cohen, October 28, 2019)        Letter from America: The '69 Mets and lessons for today       The articles we read in The Jerusalem Post and other news      sources can be daunting, leaving us with a feeling of      hopelessness and a debilitating sense that the conditions of      the world are only getting worse.       From the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, which      seems intractable, to climate change, to endless strife in      the Middle East, to an assault on the institutions of, and      belief in, democracy, to the worldwide rise of antisemitism,      xenophobia and racism, to name but a few, the odds appear      against us.       Fifty years ago the New York Mets began the baseball season      with 100 to 1 odds against the scenario they would win the      World Series. Before the 1969 season they had won a total of      394 games and lost a staggering 737 games since they first      started playing in 1962. A sense of gloom pervaded the team.      But in 1969 they would win 100 games, and this year's World      Series marks the 50th anniversary of the final out in game      five against the favorite and imposing Baltimore Orioles led      by Frank Robinson and Boog Powell.       Baseball and other sports are not only about wins and      losses and statistics. On a deeper level, sports are a      metaphor for life and a holder of lessons for life. The '69      Mets are no different for us today.       The 1969 Season did not begin with a stellar start for the      Mets. By the end of May they were continuing to lose more      than win, with a record of 18-23.       I attended my first major league baseball game on June 19,      when the Mets beat the Phillies in Philadelphia at the old      Connie Mack Stadium, 6-5. Member of the tribe Art Shamsky      went four for four, including two home runs, and pitcher Tom      Seaver stole second base!       Three weeks later Seaver would pitch two outs short of a      perfect game against the Chicago Cubs, as the Mets moved      within 3 games of the division-leading Cubs.       Change seemed at hand, but change is rarely perfectly      linear. By mid-August the Mets had fallen 10 games behind the      Cubs. But then the Mets took all the accumulated and      invaluable lessons from the losses of those previous seasons      and applied them to win an incredible 38 of their last 49      games, and win the Eastern Division of the National League.       That is the thing about baseball. A good batting average is      .300, which means that 70% of the time a good player fails      when he is at bat. Players will tell you they take all the      lessons from their previous at bats every time they are in      the batter's box, with most of those lessons coming from      failed experiences.       In addition, baseball is the only sport where the team on      offense, the team at bat, does not have the ball. Rather, the      team on defense pitches to you. That dynamic makes the      encounter more difficult, but batters know those are the      conditions they operate within.       The Mets would go on to sweep baseball legend Hank Aaron      and the Atlanta Braves in the National League playoff series      and then face the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series. They      would win the Series by tenacity, hustle, a strong work      ethic, smart baseball, and that factor out of our hands,      serendipity.       On the second pitch of the first game of the World Series,      Don Buford hit a home run off Seaver, and the Orioles would      go on to win     the game. After that game many felt that an Orioles sweep of      the Mets was a very good possibility. The tenacious Mets had      other ideas, and went on to win the next four games in a row      to become the champions.       In game two, their oldest member, Ed Charles, 38, came      through, batting, and helped end the game with a difficult      and brilliant throw to Donn Clendenon at first base.       Game three was all about two magnificent running catches by      center fielder Tommie Agee. The first, with two runners on      base, was caught in the webbing of his glove, the white of      the baseball protruding from the glove, while the second      diving catch was made with the bases loaded.       Game four the Mets won because the correct call was not      made. J.C. Martin bunted in the bottom of the 10th inning and      ran to first base on the wrong side of the first base line.      Because of that, Oriole pitcher Pete Richert's throw hit      Martin's wrist and the ball rolled to the ground, allowing      Rod Gasper to score the winning run. Martin should have been      called out, but he was not.       The final game was won by the Mets because of smart,      creative and detailed thinking by Mets manager Gil Hodges. In      the bottom of the sixth inning, with the Mets trailing 3-0,      Dave McNally's pitch to Cleon Jones went low and ended up in      the Mets dugout. Umpire Lou DiMuro ruled the ball had not hit      Jones. Hodges then emerged with the baseball showing a smudge      of shoe polish on it. Jones was then awarded first base, and      the next batter, Donn Clendenon, would hit a two-run homer,      and the Mets would go on to win the game, 5-3.       The challenges we face can feel disheartening. We may feel      like the Mets before the '69 season began, when the past      suggested 100 to 1 odds against a different and better      outcome. But change did happen. Fifty years later, that      uplifting lesson should not be lost on us.       We are also reminded of that lesson in the Bible, where      Moses's last speech to the people is a poem. We see in the      life of Moses--who 40 years earlier said to God, ``I have      never been a man of words . . . I am slow of speech and slow      of tongue'' (Exodus 4:10)--someone who develops from a poor      orator to a master of prose and poetry.       That which appears to be insurmountable may be difficult to      overcome, but as Babe Ruth said, ``Never let the fear of      striking out keep you from playing the game.'' The batter's      box awaits.
