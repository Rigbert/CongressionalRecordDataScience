President, I associate myself with the words of our distinguished leader. I came over to the Senate for the express purpose of this moment.  Like the distinguished leader, I recall this tragedy. I had just arrived in Vermont on that day, and I recall when the police officers in the airport said: Senator, have you heard what happened? Any of us who has served in law enforcement has a sense of what goes through everybody's mind.  I thought of Officer Chestnut who just a few days before as I was going through the door stopped me and said my wife had just gone through. We were at some event up here. I do not even remember now what the event was. He said: I sent your wife on up. He said as a joke: You must be late because you are behind her. That is a family thing.  Detective Gibson traveled with different groups I had been with when we had hearings outside Washington and had gone with Senators on different events. A lot of times we were around when there would be dignitaries up here, and he would recognize the different Senators. It was always the same thing: He would see us or a family member: Here, come on through; and he would take care of us.  It can sometimes be very easy to take for granted the law enforcement around the Capitol. There is a significant law enforcement presence. It is, as the distinguished leader said, like family. We see them and are with them, and yet when something such as this happens, you realize they are the line of defense between us and that tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of people in this country who would do injury, not to us individually but to really the symbols of our Government.  I thank the distinguished leader for his words. I know they are words thatwill be joined by Senators on both sides of the aisle.
