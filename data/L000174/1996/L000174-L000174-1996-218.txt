President, I would like to take this opportunity to call attention to a unique project developed by the Vermont Council on the Humanities that was recently honored at a White House ceremony as one of the best arts and humanities programs to help at-risk youth in this country. The teen parent literacy project is simple in concept, yet it is an innovative approach to tackling complex problems that can often result from teenagers having children. Through participating in a series of free reading and discussion programs, teen parents across the State are encouraged to read to their children. This program benefits parents and children in several ways. First, parents learn the value and joy of reading to their children who are in turn, introduced to the importance of reading. Reading to children at home has proven to influence future educational success and bringing together teen parents and their children can help to cultivate a more comfortable relationship as teen parents learn to become their children's first teacher.  The teen parent literacy project has brought together members of Vermont communities who are dedicated to making this program a success for teen parents and their children. Under the leadership of Victor Swenson, the Vermont Council on the Humanities is working with the Vermont Department of Health, local libraries, and individuals from each district. It is no surprise that this program was selected as one of the very finest programs designed to improve the plight of at-risk-youth. Teaching parents to read to their children enables us to forge ahead as a literate nation. It demonstrates a commitment to our investment in our children and also in their parents, many still children themselves.  For many young parents in Vermont and throughout the United States, raising children is often met by insurmountable barriers and this program, supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities, will help them to overcome some of those hurdles. I am extremely proud of the members of the council and the participants of the program who have made this program a success.                          ____________________
