President, I thank the Senator from Maryland. She is of proud Polish heritage. When she spoke of her grandmother coming to Fells Point in Baltimore, I couldn't help but think of my grandmother coming to that same place, 99 years go, from Lithuania, to become part of this American family. I would like to acknowledge, too, on behalf of many who followed her, our gratitude to Poland over the years. Poland was first to democracy in the region, and stood by the Baltic States, particularly Lithuania, their neighbor, as they reached their own level of democracy and freedom.
