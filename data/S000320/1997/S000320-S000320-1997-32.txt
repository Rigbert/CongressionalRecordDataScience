 President, I rise today in honor of The Honorable Albert Lee Smith, Jr., who died at age 65 on August 12, 1997, from injuries suffered in a tragic fall at his home. Mr. Smith was a friend, dedicated husband and father. He served with distinction in the U.S. House of Representatives during the 96th Congress on behalf of the people of Alabama's Sixth District.  Albert Lee Smith, Jr., grew up in Birmingham, AL and received his bachelor's degree from Auburn University. Always a leader, he served as an officer in the U.S. Navy, and was later awarded an honorary doctor of law degree from Samford University.  In 1956, Mr. Smith joined the Jefferson-Pilot Life Insurance Co. in Birmingham. For the next 41 years, Mr. Smith had a distinguished career as a Chartered Life Underwriter. He served as president of the Birmingham Association of Life Underwriters and held several leadership positions in other professional organizations.  Albert Lee Smith, Jr. was a true gentleman and conservative visionary. He was an extraordinary leader for the Alabama Republican Party. Active since 1962, Mr. Smith served as apollwatcher, precinct captain and vicechairman of the county party. At the time of his untimely passing, he was serving as a vice-chairman of the Alabama Republican Executive Committee. Further, Mr. Smith was a delegate to the 1968, 1972, 1976, and 1984 Republican National Conventions.  Driven by his desire to help Alabamians, Albert Lee Smith, Jr., ran for Congress to work for lower taxes and a smaller, more efficient government for the American people. Among the first in Congress to do so, Congressman Smith demonstrated concern for the strength of American families as the sponsor of the Family Protection Act. As a member of the House Budget Committee and the Committee on Veteran's Affairs, he supported tax cuts and a strong national defense.  Albert Lee Smith, Jr., knew the importance of restoring America's financial and spiritual health for our children and grandchildren. For his dedicated service, Congressman Smith was honored by several important awards: The Taxpayers Best Friend Award from the National Taxpayers' Union; the Leadership Award from the American Security Council; and the Golden Bulldog Award from the Watchdog of the Treasury, among others.  Congressman Smith was a public servant of the first order. The Alabama Republican Party nominated him as its candidate for the U.S. Senate in 1984. Following his departure from the House of Representatives, President Ronald Reagan named him in 1985 to the Federal Council on Aging, an appointment subsequently confirmed by the U.S. Senate.  An exemplary citizen, leader and role model, Congressman Smith served as a board member of the Birmingham Campus Crusade for Christ and was a member of the Kiwanis Club and the Metropolitan Board of the YMCA. Mr. Smith served as a deacon at the First Baptist Church in Birmingham and was elected by the Southern Baptist Convention to the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs. As a husband, father and friend, Albert Lee Smith, Jr., was a compassionate and thoughtful human being.  My prayers go out to Albert's wife, Eunie Walldorf Smith, their children, Karen, Smith, Albert Smith, and Meg Wallace, and their family and friends. The Honorable Albert Lee Smith's lifelong dedication to community and country made our world a better place.                          ____________________
