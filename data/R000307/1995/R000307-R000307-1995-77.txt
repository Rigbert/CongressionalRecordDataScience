Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the gentleman's amendment to restore the $25 million in funding for title III of the Food for Peace Program.  I think it is essential, as the gentleman has pointed out, that we fund [[Page H5529]] all titles of the Food for Peace Program. The amendment does not increase spending. Let me emphasize that to all of my colleagues. It cuts spending responsibly without really gutting the program.  Last year marked the 40th anniversary of the Food for Peace Program. It started in the Eisenhower years. It started with a gentleman who formerly represented the district I have the privilege of representing now, Mr. Cliff Hope, Sr.  We on the Committee on Agriculture have a very keen interest in making the Food for Peace Program as sound and as effective as possible. We are going to work very closely with the gentleman from New York [Mr. Gilman], the chairman, and the gentleman from Nebraska [Mr. Bereuter], and the rest of the committee to see that the Food for Peace Program effectively and efficiently meets its goals.  The gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Emerson], chairman of the Subcommittee on Department Operations, Nutrition, and Foreign Agriculture, intends to hold hearings on this program. We intend to address any concerns with the program as a whole in the 1995 farm bill.  I urge support in regards to the Bereuter amendment. I thank the gentleman for his leadership in this regard.
