 I believe it is the only section of the bankruptcy code that is sunset from time to time. It is not a permanent part of the bankruptcy code. It was passed about 13 years ago to meet the needs of agriculture in depression in the 1980s, and it has been renewed by Congress continually since then.  It has been a very successful part of the bankruptcy code because, of the farmers who have sought the protection of chapter 12, an Iowa State University study indicates that 84 percent are still in business farming, family farmers still farming.  We are at a situation where 1 year ago, about this period of time, chapter 12 actually sunset. It was extended for 6 months in the omnibus spending bill because the feeling was that we wanted to take it up at the very same time a revision of the entire bankruptcy code was taken up. The comprehensive bill is the bill that Senator Torricelli has spoken about and which I will discuss shortly. Within that bill, there is a permanency brought to chapter 12 in the bankruptcy code so it will no longer sunset.  The March 31 deadline came, and this bill was not up. It was extended yet again for 6 months. I urged the majority leader to extend it for a year because I anticipated some of the problems we have recently faced regarding the bankruptcy code. It was thought by a lot of interests in this city that it was necessary to have chapter 12 not made permanent, separate from the entire bankruptcy law, because it was needed to help get the general bankruptcy revisions through. So it was extended for another 6 months.  This week it is going to expire again. It is ludicrous that the House of Representatives, just yesterday, passed only a 3-month extension of chapter 12 so that somehow if we don't get this permanent bankruptcy bill passed, we are going to have chapter 12 expiring again on New Year's Eve. That is a Y2K problem for agriculture we better be alerted to because Congress is not going to be in session on New Year's Eve to renew chapter 12. I hope that when the Senate considers the House version, we ignore it, and we move with a permanent extension of chapter 12 bankruptcy which I introduced last week and which is currently on the calendar.  As the Senators from West Virginia, New Jersey, and also the Senator from Montana were just speaking about the agricultural crisis, it is that way in agriculture any place in the United States. This is no time to play footsie with chapter 12 being extended for just a 3-month period of time. Those are games that don't need to be played. They don't do justice to agriculture in America, and they do not put the family farmer in the forefront of our policymaking or thinking in Washington.  I want to go to this issue about which Senator Torricelli spoke--the Senate not invoking cloture on the bankruptcy bill last week.  While this is unfortunate, I think it is important to say a few words in support of the bill outside of the adversarial context and the very political context of the cloture vote. I think it would really be a tragedy if both parties can't come together and deal with this bill, which has such broad support from Senators on both sides of the aisle. It was voted out of committee by a 14 to 4 vote, very bipartisan.  Bankruptcy reform is really all about a return to personal responsibility in a bankruptcy system which actively discourages personal responsibility by wiping away debts on a no-questions-asked basis.  Basic common sense tells you every time a debt is wiped away through bankruptcy, someone loses money. Of course, when somebody who extends credit has that obligation wiped away in bankruptcy, that creditor is forced to make a decision: Should this loss simply be swallowed as a cost of doing business? Or, do you raise prices for other customers to offset those losses?  When bankruptcy losses are rare and infrequent, lenders may be able to swallow a loss. But when bankruptcies are very frequent and common, as they are today, lenders have to raise their prices to offset losses. For this reason, when Treasury Secretary Larry Summers testified at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, he said that bankruptcies tend to drive up interest rates.  If you believe Secretary Summers, bankruptcies are everyone's problem. Regular, hard-working Americans have to pay higher prices for goods and services as a result of bankruptcies. That is a real problem for the American people, and one which the Senate has an obligation to tackle.  Under our current bankruptcy laws, someone can get full debt cancellation in chapter 7 with no questions asked. If we pass our reform bill, if someone seeking bankruptcy can repay his or her debts, they will be channeled into chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code, which requires people to pay some portion of their debts as a precondition for limited debt cancellation.  The bankruptcy bill, which the Senate will hopefully consider soon, will discourage bankruptcies and, therefore, lessen upward pressure on interest rates and prices. Right now, under present bankruptcy laws, one of the richest captains of industry could walk into bankruptcy court and walk away with his debts erased. Of course, the rest of America will pay higher prices for goods and services as a result. If we pass this bill, higher-income people will be unable to use bankruptcy as a financial planning tool. All Americans will be better off. The message of Senate bill 625 is simple: If you have the ability to pay debt, you will not get off scot-free.  These are good times in our Nation, thanks to the fiscal discipline initiated by Congress, and the hard work of the American people--and more due to the hard work of the American people than what we have done in Congress. We have the first balanced budget in a generation, unemployment is low, we have a burgeoning stock market. Most Americans, except for the American farmers who are in a depression, are optimistic about the future. But in the midst of such prosperity, about one and a half million Americans declared bankruptcy in 1998. Based on filings for the first two quarters of 1999, it looks like there will be just under 1.4 million bankruptcy filings for this year. To put this in some historical context, since 1990, the rate of personal bankruptcy filings has increased almost 100 percent.  Now, I don't think anyone knows all of the reasons--I don't pretend to know either--underlying the bankruptcy crisis. But I think I can talk about what is not at the root of the bankruptcy crisis. I have a chart here that has four smaller charts on it that I think demonstrates it is not the economy that isdriving the crisis. Here we have the high rise in bankruptcies over the last 6 years, a very rapid near 100-percent increase in bankruptcy filings. We have, during that same period of time, a very dramatic drop in unemployment in the country. We have a very sharp rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. We have a rise in the average wage of American workers. This shows that it is not the economy that is causing so many bankruptcies.  The economic numbers tell us that the bankruptcy crisis isn't a result of people who can't get jobs; and the jobs that people do have are paying more than ever. So the bankruptcy crisis isn't about desperate people confronting layoffs and underemployment. With the economy doing well and with so many Americans with high-quality, good-paying jobs, we have to look deep into the eroding moral values of some people to find out what is driving the bankruptcy crisis. Some people flat out don't want to honor their obligations and are looking for an easy way out. In the opinion of this Senator, a significant part of the bankruptcy crisis is basically a moral crisis. Some people just don't have a sense of personal responsibility.  It seems clear to me that our lax bankruptcy system must bear some of the blame for the bankruptcy crisis. Just as the old welfare system encouraged people not to get jobs and encouraged people not to even think about pulling their own weight, our lax bankruptcy system doesn't even ask people to consider paying what they owe, particularly when they have the ability to pay. Such a system, obviously, contributes to the fray of the moral fiber of our Nation. Why pay your bills when you can walk away with no questions asked? Why honor your obligations when you can take the easy way out through bankruptcy? If we don't tighten the bankruptcy system, the moral erosion will certainly continue.  The polls are very clear that the American people want the bankruptcy system tightened up. In my home State of Iowa, 78 percent of Iowans surveyed favor bankruptcy reform, and the picture is the same nationally. According to the Public Broadcasting System program Techno-Politics, almost 70 percent of Americans support bankruptcy reform.  The American people seem to sense that the bankruptcy crisis is fundamentally a moral crisis. I have a chart that also deals with that. This chart is done by the Democratic polling firm of Penn & Schoen. It talks about the perceptions people have about bankruptcy. You can see here that 84 percent of the people think that bankruptcy is more socially acceptable than it was a few years ago. This is the same polling firm President Clinton uses; so I think this number is very telling, given that it was produced by a liberal polling firm. In my State of Iowa, the editorial page of the Des Moines Register has summed up the problem that we have with the bankruptcy system by stating that bankruptcy ``was never intended as the one-stop, no-questions-asked solution to irresponsibility.'' I totally agree.  I hope we can soon get to the bankruptcy bill, which has so much support in the Senate. As my colleague who worked so closely with me on this legislation, the Senator from New Jersey, has said, we are committed to bringing this bill to a vote this year and getting it done in a fashion that will show the bipartisanship that has operated throughout this year to bring us a 14-4 vote out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to duplicate that wide margin on the floor of the Senate, to send a clear signal to people who use bankruptcy as financial planning that if you have the ability to pay, you are never going to get out of paying what you have the capability of paying. That is good for our country, it is good for the economy and, most important, it is good for the pocketbooks of honest Americans. Bankruptcies cost the average American family to the tune of $400 a year. That's not fair to the American men and women working to pay taxes and make a better life to have to pay $400 more per year because somebody else isn't paying their debts.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
