Madam Speaker, I rise to oppose H.R. 3962.  Madam Speaker, our health care system is the envy of much of the world. That does not mean it is perfect.  Major challenges such as pre-existing conditions and portability can be dealt with by breaking down barriers between states and through nationwide underwriting.  California-style liability reform provides a model to reduce the cost of defensive medicine and can significantly reduce the cost of health care.  Tax incentives can be used to encourage broader participation by families, without federal mandates.  The Speaker and her congressional advisors are committed to government-run health care. We can solve existing problems without adding a trillion dollars on the backs of average American taxpayers.  Vote ``no'' H.R. 3962. Help save us from single payer healthcare.
