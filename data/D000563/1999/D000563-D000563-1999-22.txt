I can tell you, literally, there were Democratic Members of the House of Representatives who lost in the next election, in 1994, because of that vote they cast. It was a really courageous effort on their part. It was exploited by those who said they were going to somehow destroy the economy and raise taxes across America. Yet look at what has happened. From 1993 to the current day, we have seen the Dow Jones index go from 3,500 to over 11,000, and all the things the Senator from Nevada has alluded to.  So that decision by President Clinton, supported exclusively by Democrats on Capitol Hill, had a very positive impact on America and its future. We have gone through one of the longest and strongest economic growth periods in our history. I think it relates back directly to that 1993 vote.  I can recall a number of my colleagues--Congresswoman Mezvinsky, a new Congresswoman from Pennsylvania who only served one term because she had the courage to cast that vote. If she had not, America might have gone on a different course than we have seen recently.
