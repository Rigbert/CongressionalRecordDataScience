Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Just to conclude, Mr. Speaker, I urge every Member to vote for this resolution. Again it puts us on record supporting not only the peace process, but the all important inclusiveness of the human rights dimension. We do not want it to be a sub or a sidebar issue. It ought to be a mainstream issue. There is not evidence enough that it has been.  Let me also just say, as I have done in meeting with Mo Mowlam, and I know many of my colleagues have done this in the past, we have all raised specific questions and issues. I raised Sean Kelly and Michael Timmons when I met with her. Our hope is that these two gentlemen and others who find themselves in a similar circumstance or who have been incarcerated because of the common purpose laws, were not convicted of committing a crime but were in proximity to a crime and therefore found themselves getting life sentences for their unfortunate proximity to a heinous act. I met with those two individuals in the Maze prison last year. I was very much impressed. The human rights organizations with whom I have had contact with believe that they are innocent and our hope is that in the spirit of reconciliation and, above all, in the spirit of justice these individuals will find their way to freedom.  We had Sean Kelly's father testify at our hearing and he gave a very persuasive account as to what happened. Again, the human rights organizations have looked at these cases very carefully and have concluded that this has been a miscarriage of justice if ever there was one. So our plea to the government of the United Kingdom would be to let these individuals out. It is a positive step towards reconciliation, but above all it would be a step in the right direction towards peace.
