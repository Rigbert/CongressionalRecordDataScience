President, I thank the Democratic leader for his comments. This is an important piece of legislation. It has been completely bipartisan. The legislation reported by the Homeland Security Committee was reported with only one dissenting vote. The bill that was reported by the Rules and Administration Committee was reported unanimously. We have worked very closely with our ranking members, and I appreciate the assurances of the Democratic leader that his side ofthe aisle recognizes the importance of enacting this bipartisan legislation. There is no reason why with a good effort we can't complete the bill today.  I thank the Democratic leader for his comments.  I thank you, Mr. President.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
