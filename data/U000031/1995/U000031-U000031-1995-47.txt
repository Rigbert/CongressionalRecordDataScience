It does not address a whole number of things you talked about. I was not able to add 100 amendments as someone would have perhaps liked on this bill.  Mine is a very small amendment that goes after folks who abuse the system who are trying to get a free lunch at the expense of the taxpayers, and I say enough is enough.
