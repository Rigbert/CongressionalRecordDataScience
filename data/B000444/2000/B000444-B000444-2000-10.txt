 President, I will not use all of the time.  We will hear from our friend from Massachusetts and others on this floor about how this has harmed women and children in support payments. That is simply, flat out not true. We have improved the position of women. We have improved the position of children. We have improved the position of people who do not have much money.  We have included a safe harbor provision, saying that unless you meet a certain minimum income level, you don't even get considered in this process.  This is a good bill subject to a lot of exaggeration.  My good friend from New York had a very good provision which I supported relating to abortion clinics and bombs.There can't be any intimidation of any kind.  You cannot declare bankruptcy in this country under present bankruptcy law if you engage in activities which under the FACE Act are prohibited.  There is no court in the Nation that has said that. People are trying to get out of bankruptcy. They are trying to be discharged. But the courts have not discharged them and will not discharge them.  I would like to see the Schumer amendment become law. But, in fact, it is not necessary to protect the very people we want to protect and to hold responsible those who engage in that kind of activity under the FACE Act.  I hope reason will overcome passion. I hope the truth will overcome exaggeration. But I have been in this institution 28 years and who knows?  I yield the floor.
