President, I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by the Senator from Illinois. I commend her for her incisive amendment, which will aid the children of America and the parents of America. I appreciate very much her effort today.  Does the Senator from Delaware wish to say something? I will be happy to yield temporarily.
