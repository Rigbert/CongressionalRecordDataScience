 President, I rise to provide additional clarification regarding a congressionally directed spending items included in the fiscal year 2010 Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee. At Senator Reid's request, the committee included $100,000 for the U.S. Forest Service to fund trail improvements in Nevada. It is my understanding that Senator Reid intended those funds to be used for improvements for the Tahoe Rim Trail, to be conducted through a partnership with the Tahoe Rim Trail Association. Due to a clerical error, the project is not listed correctly in the committee report, and I would like to ensure that the Record clearly reflects Senator Reid's intended use for these funds. Through the chair, I would like to ask my colleague from Nevada, the distinguished majority leader, if my understanding of his intent is correct?
