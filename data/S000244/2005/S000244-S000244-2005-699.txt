Chairman, I rise to offer this amendment to respond to the law enforcement problems being faced by Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Texas, and other States as a result of the devastation from Hurricane Katrina.  It is estimated that at least 15,000 sex offenders have been relocated from the affected area as a part of disaster relief efforts. Criminal records and sex offender information are, in many cases, not available to law enforcement or the community to track these offenders as they move to new areas. But this is just the tip of the iceberg.  It has been reported by the Texas Department of Justice, for example, that the State is experiencing significant increases in violent crime. There are 1,350 sex offenders unaccounted for in Houston alone after being evacuated from Louisiana. The parole department in Louisiana has no idea where these people are and can provide no identifying information, fingerprints or photos.  Reports also indicate that crimes against children in Texas shelters are rising. These States are in desperate need of Federal assistance. My amendment does just that by directing the Justice Department to provide technical assistance to help law enforcement in these areas and to identify sex offenders who have been relocated.  It is critical we protect our children while disaster relief is being provided, and I urge support of the amendment.
