Speaker, this week U.S. deaths in the war in Iraq surpassed the number of lives lost in the first Persian Gulf War, 220 Americans have died, another today, with over 740 wounded. If you recall back in February, Army Chief of Staff Eric Shinseki, a soldier's soldier, testified to this Congress that several hundred thousand soldiers might be necessary for the occupation of Iraq.  He was immediately attacked by Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, who termed General Shinseki's assessments as wildly off the mark. Wolfowitz said, ``I am reasonably certain that the Iraqi people will greet us as liberators, and that will help us to keep requirements down.''  Secretary of the Army Thomas White sided with Shinseki, not Wolfowitz, sealing his own fate. White announced his resignation 2 months later. General Shinseki himself stepped down as Army Chief of Staff and retired from the military about 5 weeks ago, June 11; and neither Secretary Rumsfeld nor Mr. Wolfowitz attended the ceremonies honoring General Shinseki for his lifetime of service to our country. Then last week, Secretary Rumsfeld admitted that the Bush administration does not know how long the occupation of Iraq will last. Secretary Rumsfeld also was forced to admit he does not know how much the occupation will cost. Indeed, the costs have doubled from $2 billion a month now to $4 billion a month, and the costs are rising daily.  There are approximately 150,000 U.S. troops in Iraq. Secretary Rumsfeld would say only that they may be there for the foreseeable future and the number could be increased if necessary. Mr. Wolfowitz has not been heard to say that Secretary Rumsfeld's estimate is not wildly off the mark, even though it is very close to what General Shinseki predicted.  As far as the Wolfowitz prediction that Americans would be greeted as liberators and that would keep the force level low, it bears noting that more than 30 Americans have been killed in Iraq, with more casualties every day, since President Bush landed on that flight deck and said that peace was at hand.  A close look at the record will reveal that Secretary Rumsfeld's predictions about U.S. force levels in Iraq are skyrocketing. As recently as 2 months ago, he was predicting that our force levels could be reduced by 30,000 by the end of the year; but a Time Magazine article I will include in the Record tonight shows that the idea appears to be shifting closer to what General Shinseki told us initially, and today General Wesley Clark warned that our U.S. Armed Forces are overstretched because of Iraq and we need to take measures to take care of our men and women in uniform. Reserves need to be called up and we need a rotation plan because, let us face it, we are going to have to sustain the force in Iraq for some time. And I would add, sending Marines trained for aggressive combat to do policing is an absolutely inappropriate deployment.  We can look back to the date of May 1 when our soldiers were led to believe that they would be coming home in June. Then they were told on May 24 that maybe they would come home in August. And then Secretary Rumsfeld said last week they would be home by September. And then Major General Buford Blount said today that troop levels must remain at the current level and all bets are off.  This is not the way to treat the men and women who are giving their lives in the interest of this country. I have a very simple statement and that is: stop jerking our forces around. Treat them with the respect that they are due.  It is very odd to me that General Tommy Franks announced his retirement with 160,000 men and women under his command in the field.                              {time}  2115  I can remember back to Vietnam, when General Abrams stayed the course right to the very end; in World War II, when our generals stuck it out through thick and thin.  Strange things are happening. Maybe we do not know all the facts, but I want to voice my concerns tonight about the safety of our men and women in uniform and the importance of rotation and a definite time when they can take a break. They deserve it. If that requires a draft in our country, so be it, but no General or any President or any Secretary of Defense or any Under Secretary of Defense should have our men and women in harm's way without the rotation that they are due for the absolutely incredible job that they have done for us.  In the Record tonight I would like to place several articles that document the statements of many of our soldiers who are in Iraq today, and I would commend them to my colleagues and say God bless those who are in the field for us. We are thinking of you every minute that we hold these positions here in Washington. We want to bring you home as quickly as possible. We want to meet our worldwide obligations, but, absolutely, you deserve a break, especially those who have been there in the Persian Gulf for over a year now. It is long overdue.                   [From Reuters.com, July 16, 2003]              U.S. Soldiers Complain of Low Morale in Iraq                            (By Sue Pleming)       Washington.--Fed up with being in Iraq and demoralized by      their role as peacekeepers in a risky place, a group of U.S.      soldiers aired their plight on U.S. television on Wednesday      and said they had lost faith in the Army.       Told several times they would be going home only to have      their hopes dashed this week, a small group of soldiers from      the 3rd Infantry Division in Iraq spoke of poor morale and      disillusionment with Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.       ``If Donald Rumsfeld were here, I'd ask him for his      resignation,'' one disgruntled soldier told ABC's ``Good      Morning America'' show.       Asked by a reporter what his message would be for Rumsfeld,      one said: ``I would ask him why we are still here. I don't      have any clue as to why we are still in Iraq.''       About 146,000 U.S. troops are serving amid mounting      security threats in postwar Iraq. The death toll has now      equaled the number killed in the 1991 Gulf War.       Sgt. Filipe Vega said they had expected to return home soon      after the fall of Baghdad on April 9. ``We were told the      fastest way back home is through Baghdad and that's what we      did. Now we are still here,'' he complained.       The 3rd Infantry Division was the first U.S. unit to enter      Baghdad after driving through southern Iraq through Kuwait.       Sgt. Terry Gilmore described a phone call with his wife      Stacey when he told her he would not be coming home soon.       ``When I told her she started crying and I almost started      crying. I just felt like my heart was broken. I could not      figure out . . . how they could keep us here after they told      us we were coming home.''       In Washington, a Pentagon spokeswoman said she understood      the frustration, but said morale was still high. ``It's      obviously a frustrating situation for some of them, but it      does not represent the entire 3rd Division.''       She added: ``When you get down to the individual soldier      level, you can clearly see the dedication.''       The wives of two of the soldiers appeared on the same show.      ``Just send my husband home--send all the soldiers home. They      have done the job they were supposed to do,'' said Rhonda      Vega from Hinesville, Georgia.       Stacey Gilmore said U.S. troops were ill-prepared for the      post-war phase. ``They were told after the fighting ended      they were coming home. All I know is that morale is low and      they are just hanging in there, sticking through it.''                                  ____                  [From Time Magazine, June 26, 2003]                       Iraq: When Can We Go Home?                            (By Tony Karon)       President Bush faced a call this week from a senior member      of his own party's foreign policy establishment to ``level''      with the American people about Iraq. Senate Foreign Relations      Committee Chairman Richard Lugar was not harping on the      whereabouts of Saddam Hussein's alleged weapons of mass      destruction; he was urging the president to give the      electorate a more realistic picture of the scale and duration      of the U.S. occupation mission in Iraq, and to impress on      them the importance of staying the course. Fresh from a visit      to Baghdad, Lugar warned: ``The idea that we will be in just      as long as we need to and not a day more--we've got to get      over that rhetoric. It is rubbish! We're going to be there a      long time.''       A similar warning came from Thomas Pickering, who had      served the first President Bush as UN ambassador and had      headed up a Council on Foreign Relations study on Iraq which      concluded that the U.S. mission had lacked ``vision and      strategy.'' Pickering, too, urged Bush to make clear that the      current U.S. deployment of some 200,000 troops in and around      Iraq would have to be maintained for a long time to come. Or,      as General John Abizaid, who will assume command of the Iraq      mission from the retiring General Tommy Franks next month,      put it in congressional testimony this week, ``for the      foreseeable future.''       For obvious domestic political reasons, the Bush      Administration going into the war had downplayed the scale      and duration of a post-war occupation mission. When then-Army      Chief of Staff General Eric Shinseki told legislators that      such a mission would require several hundred thousand U.S.      troops, his assessment had been immediately dismissed by      Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz as ``wildly off the      mark.'' Wolfowitz explained that ``I am reasonably certain      that (the Iraqi people) will greet us as liberators, and that      will help us to keep requirements down.'' Six weeks ago,      Defense Secretary Rumsfeld was still suggesting the U.S.      force in Iraq could be reduced to 30,000 by the end of the      year. But the prevailing assessment in Washington appears to      be shifting to the idea of a figure closer to Shinseki's.       The changing assessment in Washington is being spurred by      the realization that the security problem confronting U.S.      and British troops in Iraq is not simply maintaining order in      the face of looting and lawlessness, but instead that      coalition forces are facing what appears to be an escalating      guerrilla insurgency. And that means the occupation mission      is costing not only American treasure--currently an estimated      $3 billion a month--but also American lives. U.S. forces come      under attack every day in Iraq, and they have suffered combat      casualties at a rate upward of one death every other day. Six      British MPs were killed near Basra on Tuesday and eight were      wounded in a second incident; a U.S. Marine was killed en      route to help ambushed comrades Wednesday; two U.S. troops      were reported missing overnight Thursday in Baghdad, and      later in the day Centcom announced that a Special Operations      soldier had been killed and eight wounded by hostile fire      during an operation southwest of Baghdad. Two Iraqis employed      to help restore Baghdad's electricity supply were among those      killed in a rocket attack on a U.S. convoy Thursday, while      saboteurs blew up two important oil pipelines earlier in the      week, apparently recognizing their ability to disrupt power      supplies by targeting some of the country's 4,000 miles of      oil and gas pipelines.       The coalition body count is mounting steadily in the      postwar insurgency, despite two large sweep operations north      of Baghdad last weekend designed to eliminate resistance.      U.S. commanders have begun to acknowledge that they're facing      an organized insurgency, blaming remnants of the old regime      and jihadists from other Arab countries who had come to Iraq      to fight the U.S. More worrying are the attacks that have      occurred this week south of Baghdad, in predominantly Shiite      areas. An insurgency confined to the Sunni minority is more      easily contained than one whose base extends to the Shiite      majority.       Average daily temperatures in Baghdad now are upward of 110      degrees, and U.S. troops who had hoped to be home in time for      July 4th cookouts instead find themselves facing an enemy      indistinguishable from the (often hostile) civilian      population. And the enemy's strategy is to avoid ever      presenting himself as a visible target, hoping to sap      American morale and alienate the U.S. from the local      population through hit and run attacks, and sabotage of      reconstruction efforts.       Washington is hoping to lighten the load with an infusion      of some 20,000 troops slated to be sent--in small      contingents, mostly at U.S. expense--from those NATO      countries that supported the war. But the number that      actually arrive in Iraq may shrink somewhat if it turns out      they're headed into a counterinsurgency mission rather than a      more pedestrian peacekeeping affair. This week's British      casualties, in what had ostensibly been the most tranquil      part of Iraq, won't help Washington's recruitment efforts.      Britain's own force levels in Iraq had been reduced from      45,000 during the war to around 15,000, although following      the latest incident the government faces conflicting      pressures to both increase and reduce its exposure in Iraq.       More robust contributions have been asked of India and      Pakistan, but while the leaders of both countries are      inclined to comply, both face strong domestic opposition. The      U.S. is also embarking on a plan to train and equip a new      Iraqi national army comprising some 60,000 men, although that      project will likely take years to complete. In the short      term, despite local recruitment and the planned deployment of      more foreign troops, most, if not all of the heavy lifting      will remain the preserve of the U.S. and British forces.       Iraq, of course, is not the only peacekeeping mission      requiring the attention of the U.S. and its allies. Some      11,000 coalition troops remain deployed in Afghanistan      against the Taliban and al-Qaeda, while peacekeeping duties      are the preserve of the 4,800 foreign troops grouped under      the banner of the International Security Assistance Force,      whose small numbers confine its work to the capital, Kabul. A      number of U.S. legislators and South Asia experts are quietly      warning that the security situation there is in danger of      unraveling in the face of Taliban resurgence and internecine      warlord conflicts, and that turning the situation around      requires either expanding the terms of the U.S. deployment to      stabilizing Afghanistan, or else significantly expanding      ISAF. (ISAF has one advantage in that it has drawn on major      troop contributions from NATO members that had opposed the      Iraq war--Turkey, France and Germany.)       The U.S. exit strategy from Iraq has always been to install      a stable, friendly Iraqi government whose oil revenues would      give it financial independence and withdraw the bulk of the      force that had overthrown Saddam's regime. But the scale of      the challenge of remaking Iraq forced Washington to adapt its      plans. When U.S. viceroy Paul Bremer arrived to take the      reins from the hapless Jay Garner he chose to keep political      authority in U.S. hands rather than betting prematurely on      any Iraqi group. To the chagrin of most of Iraq's many      political factions, Bremer has put talk of a transitional      government in the deep freeze, and instead plans to draw      Iraqis into a much slower process of consultation over a new      constitution. That, of course, leaves the occupation      authority without an Iraqi face, which further inflames      nationalist passions--but managing an occupation mission such      as Iraq invariably throws up mostly lesser-evil choices.       It was clear from the moment Bremer took over that the      process of achieving the Bush administration's political      objectives in post-Saddam Iraq might take years of patient      nation-building. But what has become equally clear, in recent      weeks, is that it may also require winning a second war, of      counterinsurgency.                          ____________________
