It is my understanding what we are trying to do is provide additional money for public health agencies across America to protect our families and communities against the threat of bioterrorism. That is part of our economic stimulus package, which the Democrats support, which the Republicans stopped with their point of order.  I heard a statistic which I think really tells the story about priorities. It is my understanding the Bush administration has asked for $300 million nationwide to help local and State public health agencies, while the House Republican stimulus bill has $1.4 billion in tax relief for one company, one corporation.
