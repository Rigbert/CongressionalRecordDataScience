President, if I might respond to the distinguished majority leader, my friend from Nevada, if somebody wants to vote against Mr. Holder, let him speak and vote against him. But I do not know, if there are only one or two people who want to hold him up, why should we have to hold it up? We do not have an Attorney General now. We aren't able to put in all the other spots. It is the premier law enforcement office in this country. I would hate to think, over the weekend, we had some major law enforcement crisis. I hope that with a person who has been endorsed by every single law enforcement agency across the spectrum in this country, we could go to him sooner. I am happy to be here Friday. I am happy to be here Saturday if that is what it takes to vote.
