We will never forget his good humor.  I would just ask for 10 seconds to say to my colleagues in terms of my neighbor, Paul Gillmor, with whom I served over 20 years in this body, we just happened to be flying over Ohio this past week to assess the flood damage in his district. My last memory of him is actually climbing out of the Apache helicopter we were both in. There were just the two of us with the Ohio National Guard, and he extended his hand to me to help me get out of the helicopter after a very long day in many communities, including Bucyrus and Findlay. I have many memories, but I shall never forget that. He was a gentleman of this House.  I thank my colleagues very much.                          ____________________
