 President, the Deepwater Port Act gives Governors the right of veto over an LNG port 3 miles or more offshore, but this bill prevents them from having any authority if there is a proposal for an LNG terminal right on State land, right in the heart of a metropolitan area, right where it presents a danger to citizens, right where it could present an environmental disaster. This is an idiosyncracy which is wrong. All we have done is replicate the Deepwater Port Act's authority.
