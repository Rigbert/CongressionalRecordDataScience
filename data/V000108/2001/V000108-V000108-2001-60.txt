Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  I would join the chairman in opposition to the amendment. I appreciate what the gentleman wants to do; but as I pointed out in my opening remarks, the Chair, myself, as well as members of the subcommittee and the full Committee on Appropriations, have added $100 million to the renewable accounts.  Secondly, while the gentleman pointed out that our figure is $33 million over the President's budget request for general investigations for the Army Corps, I would also point out the President's request of $600 million was under this year's funding level, and we are still $32 million under this current funding year level. The Army Corps cannot take that hit. I am adamantly opposed to the gentleman's amendment.
