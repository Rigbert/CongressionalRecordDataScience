Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Hall] for yielding this time to me, and I rise in strong opposition to this rule. This rule does not allow a point of order to be raised against the language that would now allow direct payments to be made to the Government of Azerbaijan that continues to create a blockade against the country of Armenia. Section 907 that has been mentioned before is a provision that was signed into law by President George Bush, indicates that, as soon as that blockade is lifted, direct payments can be made to the government. So, as the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Porter] mentioned earlier in his remarks, the key to this issue lies with the actions of the Government of Azerbaijan.  Originally the House bill contained language that overrode 907 and would allow those direct payments to this government that continues the blockade of the Armenian people. That was stripped by this House by voice vote on the evening of June 29. The House has spoken on this issue, the Senate did not take this issue up, and there was no contention in conference, although language clearly has now been added back in that would allow these payments to be make directly to the Government of Azerbaijan without them having to lift the blockade.  There is a lot of talk and discussion about the plight of the refugees. We all share that concern. But in their heart of hearts, if that Government of Azerbaijan was so concerned, they can lift the blockade, and that is the point of 907 that today, by passing this bill and being prohibited from raising a point of order, we are now in a moment going to overturn.  I again emphasize my strong opposition to this rule because we are not provided an opportunity to strike the provision.
