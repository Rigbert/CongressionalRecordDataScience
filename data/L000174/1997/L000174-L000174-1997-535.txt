President, there have been a number of articles in various papers over the last couple of years about groups that tried to block Justice Clarence Thomas from speaking at various schools. I abhor this kind of activity.  Justice Thomas was nominated by the President of the United States, went through his hearing, we had a vote on it up or down, and he was confirmed. That is the major trial that he should have to go through. He has the same rights, first amendment rights, as every one of us to speak. I am proud of the fact I come from a family that made the first amendment a hallmark, in bringing up the three Leahy children. I have been in this body for 22 years, defending the first amendment from attacks from any side, and I am proud of the achievements that has brought about. But I would say that those who try to block anyone from speaking disregard the first amendment.  McCarthyism of the left is as bad as McCarthyism of the right. If some disagree with what Justice Thomas says, then let them seek their own forum to express that disagreement. Do not block the statements from being made in the first place. That is wrong. We, in this country, ought to understand that those who try to block speech, from the right or from the left, do a disservice to our Constitution, do a disservice to our country, and, most important,they do a disservice to the diversity that makes up the greatest democracy in history.  I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1              [From the Wall Street Journal Jan. 31, 1997]         Black Leaders Try to Deny Thomas Status as Role Model                         (By Edward Felsenthal)       WASHINGTON.--When Benjamin Carson, a prominent African-     American surgeon, was helping organizers find an inspiring      speaker to close a weeklong ``Festival for Youth'' in      Delaware this month, he pushed for Supreme Court Justice      Clarence Thomas.       It wasn't only Justice Thomas's exalted title and status as      one of the country's highest-ranking public servants that      attracted Dr. Carson. It also was his remarkable rise from      poverty. The two men were acquainted through their membership      in the Horatio Alger Society, a group whose members have      overcome significant odds to achieve success.       But when the Baltimore surgeon issued the invitation, he      never dreamed that he would set off a political firestorm.      After an organized protest from a regional chapter of the      National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,      which threatened to picket the talk, Justice Thomas backed      out.       Normally, ethnic organizations are only too eager to have      top elected or appointed officials visit and speak to      community groups, especially young people. But the Delaware      protest was the latest incident in an unusual drive against a      public official by some black leaders to deny the      conservative, 48-year-old justice a position as a role model      within the African-American community.                       unflattering cover stories       Last year, after a school-board member and local parents      threatened to protest, a Maryland school temporarily      retracted an invitation for Justice Thomas to speak at an      awards ceremony for eighth graders. Emerge, an influential      magazine among the black intelligentsia, has run two      unflatering cover stories on the justice, one portraying him      wearing an Aunt Jemima-style kerchief, the other portraying      him as a lawn jockey. His judicial decisions also have      attracted unusual personal attacks, including a stinging open      letter from former U.S. Judge Leon Higginbotham.       Justice Thomas, whose bitter 1991 confirmation hearings      became a national spectacle because of Anita Hill's      allegations of sexual harassment, is certainly no stranger to      controversy. But the recent protests are extraordinary      because they have little or nothing to do with the highly      charged issues raised during his difficult confirmation.      Instead, they have to do almost entirely with Justice      Thomas's conservative views and decisions criticizing      policies such as affirmative action.       While feminist groups took the lead in fighting against his      Supreme Court nomination, this time the criticisms of Justice      Thomas are being leveled almost entirely by other blacks.      Various civil-rights leaders claim--sometimes in terms that      are astonishingly abusive even by Washington standards--that      Justice Thomas has betrayed his race by opposing the      affirmative-action policies that his critics say helped get      him where he is, and by voting with the court's conservatives      on other civil-rights issues.       ``If white folks want to have Justice Thomas serve as a      role model for their kids, that's their business,'' says      Hanley Norment, president of the NAACP's Maryland branch. Mr.      Norment, who helped plan the protest against Justice Thomas      at the Delaware festival, dismisses him as a ``colored lawn      jockey for conservative white interests.''                           dissenting voices       A number of black leaders, including national NAACP      President Kweisi Mfume, have raised concerns about the      campaign against Justice Thomas, and some say African-     Americans should take pride in his accomplishments. ``This is      an embarrassment,'' says Michael Meyers, executive director      of the New York Civil Rights Coalition. Justice Thomas      ``doesn't hold my views on affirmative action. He doesn't      hold my views on race. But he is on the United States Supreme      Court, and he's entitled to . . . respect.''       That sentiment is echoed even in some seemingly unlikely      places. ``Of course, he's a role model,'' says Charles      Ogletree, the Harvard Law School professor who was Anita      Hill's lawyer during the confirmation hearings. His success      proves ``that you can come up from poverty and have a huge      impact in our society.''       Justice Thomas's career has engendered conflicted feelings      in black America from the moment he hit the national scene as      chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in      the Reagan administration. Although mainstream black groups      such as the NAACP were worried that he was hostile to many      civil-rights laws, they opted not to fight his 1989 selection      to the federal appeals court in Washington. And although many      of those same groups later decided to oppose his elevation to      the Supreme Court, some believed that his humble origins      might ultimately make him more sympathetic to their civil-     rights agenda.       That hasn't happened. He has joined the court's      conservative wing in ruling that it's unconstitutional to      draw up voting districts primarily on the basis of race. He      concurred in a 1995 ruling that put strict limits on federal      affirmative action, saying such programs ``stamp minorities      with a badge of inferiority and may cause them to develop      dependencies.'' He also concurred that year in a decision      that curbed school desegregation, expressing astonishment      that ``courts are so willing to assume that anything that is      predominantly black must be inferior.''       Other justices participated in these decisions, too, of      course. But Justice Thomas's African-American critics seem to      view his role as uniquely unforgivable, and that sentiment in      turn has provoked the concern about his influence on black      youth.                         it doesn't affect him       Justice Thomas won't comment on the Delaware incident, but      friends insist he isn't ruffled. ``He's been around long      enough dealing with the so-called civil-rights community      [that] it doesn't affect him,'' says Stephen Smith, a      Washington lawyer and former law clerk for Justice Thomas.       After the area NAACP leaders threatened their protest,      Justice Thomas wrote festival organizers to say that, while      he doesn't object to ``peaceful demonstrations,'' he didn't      want to distract from the event's focus on children. Finally,      says a gleeful Mr. Morment, the Maryland NAACP official,      ``the guy made some decision that we agree with.''       Other black leaders say they too would object if the      justice were invited to speak to kids in their area. It is a      way of ``getting his attention'' to communicate that ``we're      disappointed with the actions that you've taken, and so      therefore we can't hold you up as a role model,'' says Hazel      Dukes, president of the New York conference of the NAACP.       It is in one sense ironic that Justice Thomas has provoked      such criticism: On a court whose members are more likely to      be found speaking at high-brow judicial conferences than      obscure local convention halls, Justice Thomas has shown a      special interest in talking with ordinary people,      particularly the young. His message is ``inspiring and      uplifting,'' says Norman Hatton, a vice principal at the      Thomas G. Pullen School in Landover, Md., where the justice      spoke at the awards ceremony last summer.       Indeed, even some NAACP leaders are adopting a more      conciliatory approach. In a recent speech, Mr. Mfume, the      national president, criticized the Maryland chapter, saying      protests against Justice Thomas shouldn't rise to such a      level that they impede his right to speak. ``We must never      rush to silence free speech,'' he said. ``It doesn't matter      how we feel about Justice Thomas.''       Dr. Carson, the surgeon, adds: ``Children shouldn't be      forced to watch ``a bunch of silly adults . . . put people      into corners and castigate them. . . . If anything is a bad      role model, that is.''
