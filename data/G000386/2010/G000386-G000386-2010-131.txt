 President, last Thursday, I wrote Secretary Geithner asking why the Treasury Department allowed General Motors to use TARP money from a Treasury escrow account to repay its multibillion-dollar TARP taxpayer loan. This afternoon, I received a response from Treasury. I would like to say a few words about the reply and the questions that remain unanswered.  Last week, Treasury and GM announced with press releases and nationwide TV commercials that GM had repaid its TARP loans ``in full, with interest, ahead of schedule, because more customers are buying [GM vehicles].''  However, the hype does not match the reality. Taxpayers have not been repaid in full--far from it. Many billions of TARP dollars remain invested by Treasury in GM, and much of it will never be repaid. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that taxpayers will lose around $30 billion on GM.  In addition, the payment that occurred last week did not come from revenue GM earned by selling cars, despite what was claimed. Instead, Treasury allowed GM to use funds in a separate escrow account to pay its TARP debt. The Treasury Department's response to me today makes a point of saying that GM ``owns'' the money in the escrow account, as if that somehow justifies all the hoopla about GM's so-called ``repayment.''  Well, let's look at how GM came to ``own'' those escrow funds in the first place. The escrow funds were part of the TARP money Treasury paid for GM stock coming out of the bankruptcy. The money was supposed to be used by GM for expenses, as Treasury concedes. Treasury had the power to approve or disapprove GM's use of the money to repay the TARP taxpayer loan. Treasury approved, and GM pretended it was paying the loan back from revenue because business had improved.  Business may have improved, but that is not how they paid the loan. Taking TARP money out of one account to pay back TARP loans in another account is not at all the same as paying off a loan with earnings, as GM's TV commercials imply they have done. That is why I called it ``an elaborate TARP money shuffle'' and nothing in Treasury's reply today changes that.  The public would know nothing about the TARP escrow money being the source of the supposed repayment from simply watching GM's TV commercials or reading Treasury's press release. Treasury's letter today says all these details are public knowledge and nothing new. Well, that may be technically correct, but it wasn't clearly communicated that way to the average citizen. Most Americans don't pore through SEC filings and special inspectors general reports.  The GM commercial also did not mention that GM could have used the TARP escrow funds to repay a $2.5 billion 9 percent loan it received from its union health plan as part of the bankruptcy process. The union loan runs until 2017. The TARP loan was at 7 percent and ran until 2015. What sort of money manager would advise you to pay off a lower interest loan before a higher interest loan? GM and Treasury have still not explained that, and I have asked the TARP watchdog, Special Inspector Neil Barofsky, to get to the bottom of it. And to make matters worse, Treasury has admitted that it let GM take an additional 6.6 billion of TARP dollars out of the escrow fund last week with no strings attached. That money, too, could have been used to repay the high interest union loan.  There are reports that GM also applied to the Department of Energy for a $10 billion 5 percent loan to retool its plants to meet fuel economy standards. GM seems to be using government money to pay back government money, and then asking for more government money at a lower interest rate. It sounds like a plan to refinance GM's government debt with more taxpayer money--not pay it back.  GM had to ask permission from Treasury to use the taxpayers' stock investment to pay off the taxpayers' loan. Treasury's response to my letter says that ``Treasury retained approval rights over GM's use of funds from the escrow account in order to protect the taxpayer.'' Well, why didn't they protect the taxpayer then?  Why would Treasury allow GM to use its equity investment to pay off the loan when it means giving up the legal right to 7 percent rate of return for the taxpayers in exchange for essentially nothing? Since the taxpayer has an equity stake in the company, it's true that future growth of GM could theoretically make taxpayers whole, but taxpayers already had that equity interest before this latest transaction and didn't get any more equity as a result of the transaction.  Another key question is: Why would GM orchestrate a major media campaign to make the public think this all represents some big accomplishment by GM when the truth is that the taxpayers are still on the hook for billions that we may never recover?  Using the taxpayers' stock investment in GM to reduce its debt to the taxpayers is not the same as repaying that debt from money actually earned by selling cars. Treasury's reply today does not explain why it approved this transaction. Maybe it is a step in the right direction, maybe not. But instead of misleading the American people, we should be clear and up front about what happened here.                               Exhibit 1                                                      U.S. Senate,                                         Committee on Finance,                                   Washington, DC, April 22, 2010.     Hon. Timothy F. Geithner,     Secretary, U.S. Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC.       Dear Secretary Geithner: General Motors (GM) yesterday      announced that it repaid its TARP loans. I am concerned,      however, that this announcement is not what it seems. In      fact, it appears to be nothing more than an elaborate TARP      money shuffle.       On Tuesday of this week, Mr. Neil Barofsky, the Special      Inspector General for TARP, testified before the Senate      Finance Committee. During his testimony Mr. Barofsky      addressed GM's recent debt repayment activity, and stated      that the funds GM is using to repay its TARP debt are not      coming from GM earnings. Instead, GM seems to be using TARP      funds from an escrow account at Treasury to make the debt      repayments. The most recent quarterly report from the Office      of the Special Inspector General for TARP says ``The source      of funds for these quarterly [debt] payments will be other      TARP funds currently held in an escrow account.'' See, Office      of the Special Inspector General for TARP, Quarterly Report      to Congress dated April 20, 2010, page 115.       Furthermore, Exhibit 99.1 of the Form 8K filed by GM with      the SEC on November 16, 2009, seems to confirm that the      source of funds for GM's debt repayments was a multi-billion      dollar escrow account at Treasury--not from earnings. In the      8K filing GM acknowledged:       Of the $42.6 billion in cash and marketable securities      available to GM as of September, 30, 2009, $17.4 billion came      from an escrow account with Treasury,       $6.7 billion of the escrow account available to GM was      allocable to the repayment of loans to Treasury,       $5.6 billion in cash would remain in the Treasury escrow      account following the repayment by GM of their loans, and       Upon repaying Treasury, any balance of escrow funds would      be released to GM.       Therefore, it is unclear how GM and the Administration      could have accurately announced yesterday that GM repaid its      TARP loans in any meaningful way. In reality, it looks like      GM merely used one source of TARP funds to repay another. The      taxpayers are still on the hook, and whether TARP funds are      ultimately recovered depends entirely on the government's      ability to sell GM stock in the future. Treasury has merely      exchanged a legal right to repayment for an uncertain hope of      sharing in the future growth of GM. A debt-for-equity swap is      not a repayment.       I am also troubled by the timing of this latest maneuver.      According to Mr. Barofsky, Treasury had supervisory authority      over GM's use of these TARP escrow funds. Since GM's exit      from bankruptcy court, Treasury had approved the use of the      escrow funds for costs such as GM's obligations to its parts      supplier Delphi. See, Office of the Special Inspector General      for TARP, Additional Insight on Use of Troubled Asset Relief      Program Fund (SIGTARP-10-004), dated December 10, 2009, at      page 6. According to the GM 8K, GM had planned to use the      TARP funds in escrow to pay back the TARP loans on a      quarterly basis beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009. But      following the April 20, 2010, hearing of the Senate Finance      Committee, where Treasury's decision to exempt GM from the      bank TARP excise tax was questioned and GM's refusal to      testify was noted, it is odd that GM suddenly drew down on      the TARP escrow and accelerated the repayment of the      remaining balance of GM's outstanding TARP loans.       The bottom line seems to be that the TARP loans were      ``repaid'' with other TARP funds in a Treasury escrow      account. The TARP loans were not repaid from money GM is      earning selling cars, as GM and the Administration have      claimed in their speeches, press releases and television      commercials. When these criticisms were put to GM's Vice      Chairman Stephen Girsky in a television interview yesterday,      he admitted that the criticisms were valid:       Question: Are you just paying the government back with      government money?       Mr. Girsky: Well listen, that is in effect true, but a year      ago nobody thought we'd be able to pay this back.       Mr. Girsky then said that GM originally planned to pay the      loan over the next five years. So the question is why--other      than a desire to justify excluding GM from the      administration's TARP tax proposal--would Treasury and GM      reduce GM's TARP debt with TARP equity and then      mischaracterize it as a repayment from earnings? Accordingly,      please explain:       Your department's justification for allowing GM to use      funds from the TARP escrow account to repay TARP loans,       The amount of funds remaining in the TARP escrow account at      Treasury that may be released to GM, and       The date that you anticipate that the remaining funds in      escrow will be released to GM.       Thank you in advance for your cooperation. Please provide      the requested information by April 30, 2010.

All formal      correspondence should be sent electronically in PDF format to      [email protected]           Sincerely,                                              Charles E. Grassley,     Ranking Member.                                  ____                                   Department of the Treasury,                                   Washington, DC, April 27, 2010.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: Thank you for your letter dated      April 22, 2010 to the Secretary regarding General Motors'      (GM) repayment of its loan from the Department of the      Treasury. He asked me to respond on his behalf.       Your letter states that the repayment of the loan was made      with funds from ``an escrow account at Treasury'' and that it      constituted a ``debt-for-equity'' swap. These statements are      not accurate.       On April 20, GM repaid the Treasury loan with cash in an      escrow account that it owns. The escrow account was created      last summer in connection with the restructuring of GM. The      money used to fund the escrow account came from a portion of      the proceeds of a loan made by both the Treasury and the      Canadian government. The escrowed funds were expected to be      used for extraordinary expenses, and a portion of the funds      were so used. Treasury retained approval rights over GM's use      of fluids from the escrow account in order to protect the      taxpayer, but the cash was still the property of GM.       In making its April 20 loan repayment, GM determined that      it did not need to retain the escrowed funds for expenses.      The fact that GM made that determination and repaid the      remaining $4.7 billion to the U.S. government now is good      news for the company, our investment, and the American      people. Consistent with Treasury's goal of recovering funds      for the taxpayer and exiting TARP investments as soon as      practicable, we approved GM's loan repayment.       It has long been public knowledge that GM would use these      specific funds to repay the Treasury and Canadian loans, if      it did not otherwise need them for expenses. Under GM's loan      agreement with Treasury, any funds in the escrow account on      June 30, 2010 had to be used to repay the Treasury and      Canadian loans. We have highlighted the repayment requirement      in our monthly Section 105(a) reports to Congress. During a      meeting last fall, we also informed the staff of the Special      Inspector General of TARP (SIGTARP), Neil Barofsky, that we      expected GM to use these funds to repay these loans. In fact,      according to the SIGTARP Report on the Use of Funds (released      on December 10, 2009), ``GM officials stated that it intends      to seek release of additional escrow funds to repay its      outstanding $6.7 billion loan to Treasury and $1.3 billion      loan to the Canadian Government.''       After the full repayment of the Treasury loan,      approximately $6.6 billion remained in GM's escrow account.      These funds became unrestricted on April 20 and available for      GM's general use.       In addition, it is not correct that the timing of the      repayment was motivated by concurrent Senate hearings. In      fact, GM's Board of Directors approved the loan repayment at      its monthly meeting on April 13, 2010.       As is widely known, Treasury continues to hold $2.1 billion      in preferred stock and 60.8% of the GM's common equity that      it received in the restructuring in July 2009. Treasury will      begin selling equity once GM makes an initial public      offering.       Thank you again for your attention to this important      matter.           Sincerely,                                          Herbert M. Allison, Jr.,     Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability.                                  ____                             Reserve Notice     U.S. Department of the Treasury,     1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW.,     Washington, DC.
