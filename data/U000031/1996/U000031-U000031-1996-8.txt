Chairman, I would remind my colleagues that this amendment is new. It applies only to new lands. What do you tell a small community that may have an Indian tribe reserve land in their community and tell those folks, the small business folks and others, whether they will sell gasoline or cigarettes, that I am sorry, they are exempt. You are not. That is not right.  What this amendment tries to do is to level the playing field between legitimate small businesses and businesses that Indians establish and, by the way, it applies only to the sales of non-Indians. It does not apply to within the reservation to their own people.  So I would ask my colleagues to support this. It is a step in the right direction to try and level the playing field for new lands that are so designated sothat those businesses, whether they sell cigarettes or gasoline or any other State and local taxes that they may have to comply with, they are on an equal footing with their new competitors. That is why I think that this amendment is a good one. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
