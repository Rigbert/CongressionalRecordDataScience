President, I rise to speak on an amendment that I submitted last week, amendment No. 3140, which is a tripartisan amendment to the Energy Policy Modernization Act, which is the pending legislation. I submitted the amendment last week with Senators Klobuchar and King as my lead cosponsors. Our amendment would support the key role that the forests in this country can play in helping to meet our country's energy needs.
