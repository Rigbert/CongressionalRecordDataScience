President, it is remarkable that in 29 years here in the Senate--several times the Senate under the control of Democrats, several times the Senate under the control of Republicans--I have never seen so little accomplished and I have never seen so much political posturing on the Senate floor which then gets put into fundraising letters and fundraising appeals. I have never seen so much special interest legislation. But the bottom line is I have never seen so little accomplished. Probably there is a corollary.  Instead of doing the people's business, we seem to be doing political action committee business. And that is why, of course, nothing gets done.  Let's talk about this. If there were ever a piece of legislation on which politics is being played, it is the medical malpractice bill. It is a one-size-fits-all bill for a problem that is really different from State to State. Basically we are telling the 50 State legislatures and Governors that the Members of the U.S. Senate know a lot more about their States' needs than they do and that the U.S. Senate will dictate a change. We will override their courts and their legislatures. We will override their laws and we will make life better for them. But when we do, of course, we yank away the rights of the States and the people there. Whenever we target the rights of the public and we try to figure out ways to run roughshod over a State, we ought to be pretty careful how we do it.  Normally you would think we would have committee hearings. We would try to have a bipartisan bill. We would have something that would demonstrate to the States, as we take away their rights, that such a move has been considered by all 100 Senators and there is a consensus. Instead, we have a piece of legislation written by lobbyists and special interests that is so bad nobody even dares send it to a committee--not even friendly committees. They send it right to the floor.  This is the third time the Republicans have taken this partisan approach. Last July they employed this partisan tactic and failed to pass legislation. Earlier this year, they tried to rush through the Senate a bill to limit the legal rights of the most vulnerable patients--mothers and infants--and they failed. Now they are again rushing an extreme bill overriding the laws of each of the 50 States. This time, however, the bill is not limited to obstetrical and gynecological care. Now they want to extend the restrictions on legal rights to trauma and emergency care. The third time for this partisan approach is no charm. Republicans' mad dash to push through this proposal in this election year under the guise of reducing health care costs is a blatant attempt not to reduce health care costs, which we would all support, but to exploit their own political agenda.  I remember the article last year in Washington Monthly, titled ``Malpractice Makes Perfect: How the GOP Milks a Phony Doctors' Insurance Crisis.'' This article was so good, it was nominated for a National Magazine Award. It shows how Republicans launched a sophisticated lobbying campaign with business interests to manipulate the medical malpractice debate and change it from one about medical errors and fair compensation, pitting one political constituency against another.  I commend to my colleagues the article to which I referred from the Washington Monthly of October 1, 2003, by Stephanie Mencimer.  Mr. President, the article points out clearly that even if we passed this legislation, insurance rates would not have come down. There is no one who with a straight face can say that if we pass this legislation, then insurance rates will come down. Insurance companies would not be spending so much money trying to get this passed if they thought so.  Once again, Republicans have proposed a plan that would cap non-economic damages across the Nation at $250,000--whether you live in California, Ohio, Vermont, or anywhere else; no matter what the injury, that is the cap.  The so-called medical malpractice reform debate too often ignores the men, women and children whose lives have been dramatically--and often permanently--altered by medical errors.  I will give you a real-life example in my State of Vermont. On April 7, 2000, Diana Winn Levine had a severe migraine headache. That is something that has probably happened to most of us at one time or another. She went to a health center in Plainfield, VT. She was a musician. She received a painkiller and an injection of a mild sedative, Phenergan. This combination was injected into her artery rather than her vein, and resulting circulatory problems led to this musician having to have two amputation surgeries on her right arm.  Ms. Levine sued the corporate giant, Wyeth, for improper instructions for using its drug, Phenergan. As she said:       I never expected to sue anyone in my life; I'm not the      suing type.  Sometimes it takes something like this to make it known when a drug is not being used right.  There was a full trial. I remember reading the account of the trial. When they went to swear Ms. Levine in for her testimony, the bailiff asked her to raise her right hand. Of course, she had no right hand. That jury in Vermont--and our juries are pretty careful--found that Ms. Levine deserved $2.4 million for her past and future medical expenses, and $5 million for the ``daily pain she does suffer and for the loss of enjoyment of her life.'' Of course, most of that would have been slashed by this legislation. Crowds of the children Ms. Levine had worked with on musical projects--children she'd brought joy to as a musician--sat in the courtroom of the Montpelier Superior Court. She said:       That was the day they actually showed pictures of my dead      hand . . . before amputation, with the gangrene. I worried      about how the kids would react to my disfigurement. I told      the mom to cover her eyes. But afterward she came up to me      and said, ``We just didn't know what you have been through.''  Now, Wyeth, of course, was well represented. They had a team of six lawyers--two from Vermont and four from Washington, DC. They did, after all, have 2003 revenues of $15.8 billion and keep a $1.3 billion reserve fund because of the ongoing litigation over their diet drugs.  Again I say: This musician would have been cut out entirely if the U.S. Senate were to overwrite the laws of our State.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article from the Burlington Free Press be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, Mar. 16, 2004]                      Vt. Woman Wins $7.4M Lawsuit                          (By Stephen Klernan)       A Marshfield musician who lost an arm to a medical error      has won one of the largest lawsuit awards in Vermont history.       Diana Winn Levine, owner and creative director of Rebop      Records, had sued the multinational health products company      Wyeth for having improper guidelines for the drug that      damaged her hand and forearm and led to amputation.       A Montpelier jury on Friday awarded Levine $7.4 million.       ``Sometimes it takes something like this to make it known,      when a drug is not being used right,'' Levine said Monday.       The weeklong trial, pitting a central Vermont bass player      and guitarist against one of the world's largest health      products companies, featured testimony by family     members and well-known Vermont musicians, as well as gallery      crowds of children involved in Rebop recordings.                           not the suing type       Levine was suffering from a migraine April 7, 2000, when      she went to the Health Center in Plainfield. She received a      painkiller, and an injection of a mild sedative, Phenergan.       In what she called ``a medical blunder,'' the drug entered      her artery rather than her vein. Resulting circulatory      problems led to two amputation surgeries on her right arm.       The case against Wyeth pertained to the company's      instructions for using the drug, Levine said.       ``I never expected to sue anybody in my life; I'm not the      suing type,'' she said. Then she learned that ``Phenergan,      which is toxic, can be given in three ways. The other two are      fine. What happened to me can happen, it is foreseeable.''       The trial, in which she was represented by Richard Rubin,      David Kidney and Kerry DeWolfe, featured considerable drama.                          importance of music       ``We played a lot of music for the jury,'' Rubin said, ``We      showed videotapes of her performing.''       Folksinger Jonathan Gailmor testified on Levine's behalf.       ``Jon expressed it so amazingly, how important music is in      life, and how he couldn't even imagine losing the ability to      play,'' she said.       Crowds of the children Levine has worked with on musical      projects, such as Rebop's latest CD ``Even Kids Get the      Blues,'' sat in the courtroom in Monptelier Superior Court.       ``That was the day they actually showed pictures of my dead      hand,'' before amputation, with the gangrene,'' Levine said.      ``I worried about how the kids would react to my      disfigurement. I told the mom to cover her eyes. But      afterward she came up to me and said, `We just didn't know      what you have been through.' ''                             public airing       Rubin said one powerful moment in the trial came      accidentally.       ``We'd spent all this time establishing what it is like to      lose your right hand, even if you're not a musician. When      someone offers to shake your hand, what do you do? When      someone is handing you change at the cash register, what do      you do?''       Then Levine's turn on the witness stand arrived. The baliff      came to swear her in, asking her to raise her right hand.       ``We looked at each other, and it hit me first,'' Levine      said. ``Then we cracked up. There's my prosthesis, so I said,      ``You mean this?''       ``She laughed,'' Rubin said, ``but it was a poignant      moment.''       She was afraid to testify, Levine said, and publicly relive      the experience of losing her arm, ``but once you get up      there, it just comes out.''       Levine became comfortable enough, Rubin said, she showed      the jury how her prosthesis works.       Levine said the ``ultimate'' was when her 21-year-old      daughter testified. ``What mother gets a chance to have her      daughter up there, basically saying all these things about      how much she appreciated me, and her upbringing in a house      full of music?''                           david vs. goliath       Wyeth had a team of six lawyers, Rubin said, two from      Vermont and four from Washington, D.C. The company, with 2003      revenues of $15.8 billion, makes Robitussin, Advil, Centrum      and many other health products. The company also has a $1.3      billion reserve fund for ongoing litigation over its diet      drugs.       Attorneys for Wyeth did not return calls seeking comment.       ``But we did not make this case anti-drug company, or anti-     out-of-state company,'' Rubin said. ``This case was really      about Diana's loss of her ability to play and write music.''       ``Music is my way of healing and processing everything that      happens to me,'' Levine said. ``The right hand is just the      core of your playing. And so much of writing comes not from      your head but from what your hands do.''       Rubin said the suit sought $2.4 million for Levine's past      and foreseeable medical expenses, plus $5 million ``for the      daily pain she does suffer and for the lost employment of her      life.''       The amount of money seems large, he said, but is actually      based on ``an hourly rate. We asked the jury to award $25 per      hour for her pain and suffering, 16 hours a day, for the next      20 years.''       The jury deliberated about four hours before awarding her      the entire $7.4 million.       ``The jury came in, and I'm like, `Prop me up,' my knees      were so weak,'' Levine said.       State Court Administrator Lee Suskin, said he could only      recall one larger financial result from a suit. ``We don't      keep track of these things, but it seems an usually large      award.''       ``That's just on paper,'' Levine said. ``It's almost      certain that they will appeal. My bank account is no fuller      than it was a month ago.''       Wyeth did make one strategic error, Rubin said.       ``There was nobody here from Wyeth who knew about the drug      and was prepared to defend it from the corporate      perspective,'' he said. ``The jury never saw anyone from      Wyeth but their lawyers.''       Even if there is an appeal, Levine said, ``There's      something about retelling that helps you to finish it. And to      move on.''                             cracking eggs       Levine said phantom pain, in which her mind thinks she      still has an arm, remains a daily problem. ``You look down      there and you see, there is no arm there, kiddo. But the      brain thinks there is a giant Mickey Mouse hand that always      feels like pins and needles, and as the day goes on it gets      worse.''       Her salvation is the children she works with, she said,      ``They take my mind off it; they have become my healing      partners.''       Otherwise her life continues to be ``an improvisation. I      rode a bike the other day. . . .  It was like being six years      old all over again, I've gone from feeling like I was      battling one-handed, to feeling like I'm conducting one-     handed. . . .        ``It has become pretty easy to crack an egg one-handed even      if I do wind up with little bits of shell in my eggs.''
