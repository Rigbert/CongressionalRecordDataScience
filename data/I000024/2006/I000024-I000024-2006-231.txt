President, I rise today to pay tribute to Senator Bob Dole, a person who is often thought of as one of the most prominent political figures of our time. Perhaps former Secretary of State Colin Powell described Senator Dole best when he said he is, ``A plain-spoken man of strength, maturity and integrity.''  This ``plain-spoken'' man from Oklahoma's neighboring State of Kansas is legendary for his brave sacrifice to our great country in World War II. In the war, he was a platoon leader in the distinguished Tenth Mountain Division in Italy. He was awarded two Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star after being seriously injured in battle, but his service and sacrifice did not end there. After a long, determined road to recovery, a renewed faith in God, and loving support from family and friends, he began his political career.  After earning his law degree, Senator Dole served in the Kansas Legislature from 1951 to 1953. He came to Washington to serve in the House of Representatives in 1960. He was then elected to the Senate in 1968. His leadership skills gained swift recognition as he became chairman of the National Republican Committee in 1971 and Senate majority leader in 1984.  After Republicans lost control of the Senate in 1986, Senator Dole continued serving his party as Senate minority leader. In this capacity, he became known for his ``watch-dog'' tactics fighting against Democrat tax-and-spend, big-government policies. Thanks to his help in exposing the unrestrained behavior of the Democrats, the American people voted to put Republicans back in control of both Houses of Congress in 1994. After this overwhelming victory, Senator Dole was once again voted to the post of majority leader, making him the longest serving Senate leader in the history of the Republican Party.  I was privileged to serve with Bob Dole in this body from 1994 to 1996 and work on different issues with him. I supported him in 1996 when he was fighting tax increases and other excessive governmental policies.  After leaving the Senate to run for an unsuccessful Presidential bid in 1996, Senator Dole continued his public service by becoming chairman of the National World War II Memorial to erect a memorial on The National Mall to honor the sacrifice of the brave men and woman who served in the largest and deadliest war in history. He also served as cochair of the Families of Freedom Scholarship Fund to assist the educational needs of the families of victims of the September 11 attacks.  Through media appearances, speeches, two best-selling books, ``Great Presidential Wit, I Wish I Was In The Book'' and ``Great Political Wit, Laughing (Almost) All the Way to the White House,'' and his personal World War II memoirs, ``One Soldier's Story,'' Senator Dole continues to leave a legacy of the values and principles that have made this great country what it is today.  Bob Dole is a man of character and integrity, and I am proud to honor him with this deserving tribute today.                          ____________________[Page S6057]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR BOB DOLE
