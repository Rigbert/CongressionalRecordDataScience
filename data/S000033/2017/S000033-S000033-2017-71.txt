 President, this is an exciting day. After years and years, some of my Republican colleagues have begun to understand that we cannot continue a dysfunctional healthcare system which allows 28 million Americans to have no health insurance, which forces us to pay the highest prices in the world, by far, for healthcare and even higher prices--outrageously high prices--for prescription drugs.  I understand that Senator Daines has offered a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system, and I congratulate him. It sounds to me as though the Republicans are beginning to catch on about the need to transform our healthcare system and join the rest of the industrialized world.  So I say to Senator Daines, if he is prepared to vote for this legislation and if he can get maybe five, six more Republicans to vote for this legislation, I think we can win it, and I think the United States can join the rest of the industrialized world and finally guarantee healthcare to all people.  So if Senator Daines and five or six other Republicans vote for this, count me in. And we are going to work together, finally, to provide healthcare to all people. But if Senator Daines is just playing a political trick--I ask unanimous consent for 30 more seconds.
