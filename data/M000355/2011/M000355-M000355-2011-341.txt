 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a Kentuckian who for much of his life wascontent to remain an unsung hero. But let there be no doubt now that Mr. Vernard Hughes Webb, who passed away last year, leaves behind a legacy of great accomplishment and service to his Nation. You see, for many years, Mr. Webb was a pioneer in secret reconnaissance and satellite technology that was crucial to America's efforts in the Cold War. He was one of the developers on the top secret CORONA project, a spy satellite effort, and was awarded a medal of achievement for his life's work by the Vice President of the United States.  Mr. Webb was born and raised in Letcher County, KY, and became the first in his family to go to college, graduating from Berea College in 1940. The day after the Pearl Harbor attack, he joined the Army Air Corps. Becoming a bombardier on a B-17, he flew 30 combat missions over Europe during World War II.  Later in the war, Mr. Webb developed the crucial idea that would change the course of not only his career, but perhaps his country as well. Assigned to a combat mapping squadron that was tasked with taking reconnaissance pictures over the Philippines, he came up with an idea to greatly increase the accuracy and efficiency of the cameras.  Mr. Webb ran his idea past his Air Force superiors, and in their infinite wisdom, they said no. So Mr. Webb did it anyway. He spent his own money to create a new camera. And when Vernard's superiors finally realized the worth of his invention, they asked him to implement it across the Air Force.  Vernard Webb eventually rose to the rank of major and became one of this country's leading developers of cameras and aircraft for surveillance purposes. He and his colleagues were in a race with the Soviets. By the 1950s, Vernard realized that his technology could be used not just in airplanes, but in satellites.  In 1958, Mr. Webb was assigned to the CORONA project, America's first efforts to develop a spy satellite. In 1960 the project accomplished its first success, gaining valuable intelligence on the Soviet Union and China. But for all those years Mr. Webb could only tell his friends and even his wife that he was an unimportant bureaucrat or engineer.  In 1995 the CIA declassified many documents pertaining to the CORONA project, and only then were Mr. Webb's accomplishments made clear. Around that same time, Vice President Al Gore declared that ``the CORONA project represents a crucial development in aiding the national security efforts of the United States.''  Vernard Webb passed away last Veterans Day. I extend my greatest condolences to his wife Katie Louis Webb, their children and grandchildren, other members of the Webb family and friends for their loss.  It is only fitting that after a lifetime of service to his country, most of it under a cloak of secrecy that preventing him from receiving the gratitude that he so richly deserved, that Mr. Vernard Webb will be interred at Arlington National Cemetery later this month with full military honors.  And I know my colleagues will join me in extending to the Webb family this Senate's thanks and appreciation for Vernard Webb's sacrifice and service.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article illustrating Mr. Webb's heroic life and career be printed in today's Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Berea College Magazine, Summer 1996]               The Secret's Out: Webb was a Space Pioneer       A year ago, Vernard Webb could have gone to prison for      telling you about his coffee table.       The piece of furniture, which resembles a kettle drum with      a glass top, is made of gold-plated titanium.       Thirty years ago, during the height of the Cold War, the      table was the shell for a spy satellite used by the Air Force      and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to peek behind the      Iron Curtain. It is one of four such satellite ``buckets''      still in existence. The other three are in the Smithsonian      institution.       For decades, Webb, a member of Berea's Class of 1940, could      only pass himself off as a pencil-pusher for the Air Force,      or an engineer with the Environmental Protection Agency. But      by no means was Webb telling the whole truth and nothing but      the truth.       Webb's wife, Katie Lou Chambers Webb, class of 1942, had      her suspicions. After three decades of relocation from one      Air Force Base to another and her husband's extended official      trips to places he wouldn't identify, she was certain that      whatever the government had him working on was very      important.       Then, in late 1995, the CIA declassified tens of thousands      of documents and it was evident. Webb was a major player in      the top secret CORONA project, America's first spy satellite      program, from 1957 until 1972. Webb, in fact, is a pioneer in      reconnaissance and satellite technology.       Before the CIA's declassification of CORONA documents in      August 1995, Webb and other members of the CORONA team were      called to the Pentagon for a medal presentation ceremony      which itself was classified. He was awarded a medal of      achievement by Vice President Al Gore and CIA officials.      However, no citation accompanies the medal, since the mission      for which he was being honored was still top secret at the      time.       ``We were not allowed to even speak with our spouses about      the classified projects,'' Webb said. ``It was for their own      protection, if anything else.''       Joining the Army the day after Pearl Harbor (Dec. 8, 1941),      Webb went into what was then the Army Air Corps. Because he      had been a photographer for the Berea College student      newspaper and listed ``photography'' as one of his skills on      a military questionnaire, it was assumed that Webb would be      capable with any sort of optical instrument, such as bomb      sights and some navigational equipment. He was assigned as a      bombardier on a B-17 and flew 30 combat missions over Europe,      bombing Axis petroleum sites, mostly in Germany, and dropping      supplies to the French Resistance.       Late in the war, Webb was assigned to a combat mapping      squadron flying reconnaissance missions from the Philippines.      While stationed there, he came up with an innovation that      would help shape the remainder of his career.       ``We used large cameras mounted in planes that were once      used as bombers,'' he said. ``On a typical mission, somewhere      between 30 and 40 percent of the film that was used on these      cameras would be useless, because we had failed to photograph      the target correctly.       ``It occurred to me that if one of our cameras were mounted      to a Norden bomb sight, it would greatly increase the      accuracy of the camera and the efficiency of the equipment.      There was a great similarity between the bomb sight and the      control of aerial cameras. They both operated on the same      principles. The variable on the operation of both was the      ratio between the velocity of the airplane and its height      above the ground. I thought it would be convenient to combine      the two.''       Webb's proposal was found unorthodox by Air Force officials      and permission to make the camera-bomb sight combination was      denied. Still, Webb was convinced it was a good idea.       ``I circumvented the red tape by buying a Norden bombsight      with my own money,'' he said. ``The U.S. government had given      the Philippine government some Norden sights, and I was able      to purchase one of them from the Philippine Air Force. I then      mounted the camera on the sight, and we started flying      missions with this device. The combination proved to be a      `natural.' ''       While the average reconnaissance mission had an accuracy of      photographing a specific site ``on target'' only 60 to 70      percent at that time, an inspector general took notice of the      consistent 100 percent success rate of the flights using      Webb's camera-bomb sight combination.       ``The Air Force officials were always looking at air crew      effectiveness,'' he recalled. ``When they saw that we had no      rejected aerial photography for a period of months, they      began to look into the reasons why. I showed them how we had      used the camera and they earmarked me to introduce that      technology to the rest of the Air Force.       ``I was then transferred to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base      in Dayton, Ohio, where a team of engineers had been working      for almost a year to come up with something like the camera-     bomb sight combination I had put together. They ended up      scrapping their entire project as a result.''       The official testing of Webb's invention was conducted at      Rainey Air Force Base near Wichita, Kan. The Air Force's top      test pilot, Chuck Yeager, was assigned to try out the camera      system in an RB-50 observation plane and the results were,      according to Webb, outstanding. And the die was cast for his      career.       ``For the next 40 years or so of my career, I would be      associated with the reconnaissance efforts of the U.S. Air      Force and the Central Intelligence Agency,'' he said.       The following years saw Webb on various projects      surrounding the development of cameras and aircraft for      surveillance purposes. The RB-36, U-2 and SR-171 spy planes      used by the Air Force were fitted with cameras designed by      Webb and his team, who were headquartered at Wright-Patterson      Air Force Base until the late 1950s.       ``The U.S. Air Force continued to develop faster, higher-     flying aircraft, which was in response to the development of      faster and more accurate anti-aircraft weapons and fighter      aircraft developed by the Soviets. It was in the early 1950s      that we began to consider certain theories on using orbiting      satellites as a platform for reconnaissance work,'' Webb      said.       ``But we had some big hurdles to jump before we got that      far.''       ``There were four Air Force officers, Lt. Col. Charles Hoy,      Capt. Bernard Quinn, Capt. Louis E. Watson and I [Webb was a      major], stationed at Wright-Patterson, who met to analyze      what would be the future of our efforts. I had been flying      the high-altitude tests on the RB-36, up to 55,000 feet, and      we knew that we would have to fly higher and higher altitudes      due to the increased capability of Soviet lighter aircraft.       ``We knew the answer to our problem would be the altitude      of the aircraft or source of observation. We analyzed what      problems would result if we could attain an observation point      above the atmosphere. These, we narrowed down to three key      areas.       ``First, we knew that we needed to build better cameras.      Our ground resolution couldn't be accurate if we took the      cameras we were using then to a much higher altitude. Next,      we needed better film with a much higher resolution. Third,      we needed a better means to process the film. The      administration at Wright-Pat in those days was dominated by      civilian engineers, who didn't take kindly to such      suggestions from Air Force officers.''       In a historic move, Webb and the three officers maneuvered      themselves toward reassignment at the Air Force's Air      Research Development Command in Baltimore. The office was      administered by Gen. Marvin Dent, who supervised contracted      development of reconnaissance systems for the Air Force and      was a much more sympathetic listener to Webb and his      associates.       ``We were able to write the specifications for photographic      systems the Air Force required of the industrial contractors      then managing the projects at Wright-Pat,'' Webb recalled.      ``A meeting was called by the Air Force to speak with      industry representatives in Cincinnati regarding the Air      Force's needs. Gen. Dent gave the keynote speech. He      basically told industry representatives that the current      technology being used for reconnaissance was becoming quickly      outmoded and he strongly suggested that they work with our      group of officers in developing future reconnaissance      projects.''       The speech by Dent, made in 1955, led to the development by      Air Force-contracted private industry of the first      spacecraft-based cameras.       ``Within a week of the General's speech, we were visited by      representatives of three different contractors,'' Webb said.      ``One was a representative of Fairchild Camera and Instrument      Corporation, another was from Eastman Kodak and the third was      one of the most brilliant optical designers this country has      ever produced, Dr. James Baker. Fairchild said they could      build the camera, Kodak would handle the processing and Baker      would design the lenses required.       ``These individuals had done their homework and told us      they were confident that they could build a photographic      system that could meet our specifications. We had the camera      system from them in a year.''       The photographic equipment, which was originally designed      for the U-2 spy plane, was meant to operate at an altitude of      approximately 84,000 feet. The camera system designed by the      Fairchild-Kodak-Baker partnership had a 24-inch lens and a      better resolution than any other visual reconnaissance system      used at that time. However, the Soviet development of      satellite technology would change the nature of Webb's work      forever.       ``When we originally had the Fairchild camera developed, we      were still thinking airplanes,'' Webb recalled. ``But, the      development of Sputnik forced us to take the resulting      technology into space. When the Soviets successfully orbited      Sputnik, the first satellite in 1957, most of America was      horrified that we no longer had a technological edge in the      Cold War. With my team, we were exhilarated that it had been      proven a satellite could be successfully orbited. It gave us      an additional step toward our research goals.''       Webb and his co-workers already had an interest in      utilizing a space-based camera system for observation. Using      some foresight, Webb was able to get transferred to a unit      dedicated to guided missile research and incorporated what he      learned there into the great body of reconnaissance knowledge      he already possessed.       ``I was no longer influenced by people who knew only      airplanes,'' he said. ``We were now looking at using a camera      system that needed to produce high-quality photos from an      orbit of 100 miles, instead of 85,000 feet. But the      development of the Fairchild camera laid the groundwork for      what we would be using later on. The lens we used with the      CORONA system was a slight variation of Dr. Baker's 24-inch      lens used on the U-2.''       The CORONA program began in 1955 with numerous experiments      at a classified site near Palo Alto, California. Webb was      assigned to the program, the United States' first efforts at      using a spy satellite, in the fall of 1958. ``Our program's      cover name, which was operated under scientific pretenses,      was Discoverer,'' Webb said. ``We already had a lot of      ballistic information that had been done by the guided      missile people at Lockheed, the primary contractor of the      program.''       The early months of the CORONA program were frustrating for      Webb and the Lockheed team. Rocket failures, camera problems      and film difficulties all combined to serve as an expensive      tutor for the group. The CORONA system consisted of a large      orbiting camera, which would be linked to a ``bucket''      containing approximately 4,000 feet of film. After receiving      radio commands from Webb and his associates, the satellite      was designed to photograph designated areas with the film      spooling back into the bucket. The bucket would then detach      from the camera and plunge back through Earth's atmosphere      where it would be recovered by aircraft upon a parachute      reentry.       On August 18, 1960, the first fully successful CORONA      mission was accomplished, with the satellite photographing      areas in the Soviet Union and China. An American flag, stowed      in the satellite's bucket, was presented to President Dwight      D. Eisenhower in a secret White House ceremony later that      month.       The White House, however, was even more pleased with the      photographs obtained by CORONA. ``That single mission      obtained more photos from behind the Iron Curtain than all      the combined U-2 missions flown up to that time,'' Webb said.      ``It was considered an outstanding success, and we were in      business.''       The CORONA project was utilized successfully during the      Cuban Missile Crisis, most of the Vietnam War and an      important period of the Cold War. Portions of the project's      development and results are still classified, but many of the      spy photos have been made available to the public on the      Internet by the CIA and Air Force.       ``The CORONA project represents a crucial development in      aiding the national security efforts of the United States,''      said Vice President Gore in a ceremony held at the Pentagon      last year.       Originally from Letcher County, Ky., Webb credits Berea for      getting him on track for what he considers a fascinating      career. ``At Berea they taught me to work. They gave me the      discipline I needed to do well,'' Webb said.       Oh, and just how did Webb get his ``coffee table,'' anyway?      ``When they changed the design of the satellite and no longer      needed these, a crate arrived at my office,'' Webb      remembered.       ``When I saw what was in it, I called my supervisor and      asked why it had been sent to me. He said, `We have been      given an order from the highest possible authority that the      bucket is yours to keep. Your efforts have been appreciated.      Now, don`t ask any more questions.' And he hung up.''                          ____________________
