President, if the Senator from Alaska will yield, I say for my colleagues one of the joys of the Appropriations Committee is that there are a lot of senior Members on both sides of the aisle who are used to working with each other to build the kind of personal relationships that are necessary. I cherish my own friendship with the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from Kentucky. We have worked together on a lot of different pieces of legislation, not just this one but a lot of others, and I think we understand there are certain things that can be done and certain things that cannot be done, and we go for the possible.  I note that this is a record, and I commend the Senator from Kentucky for getting it through so rapidly. But it is a case, again, I would say to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who sat down with us and tried to give us leeway, a realistic schedule, of the ability to work out many things even before they got to the floor.  I have been both a manager and the ranking member of a lot of pieces of legislation. What has been happening with the appropriations bills is a model of the way it should be done--move them, move them quickly. People have an issue; vote on it and move on to the next thing. The Senate is better served. The country is better served.  I commend my two colleagues for their help.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I, too, thank my good friend, Pat Leahy, for his marvelous cooperation and also extend my thanks to Steve Cortese, director of the full committee, who has been a joy to work with, and Tim Rieser of Senator Leahy's staff and, of course, long-time foreign policy adviser, now staff director of the subcommittee, Robin Cleveland, and Billy Piper and Will Smith, who have done yeoman service and outstanding work on this. I thank them.  I yield the floor.
