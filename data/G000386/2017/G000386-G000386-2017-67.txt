 President, once again, thanks to Senator Whitehouse for his cooperation and working so hard over the course of the last two Congresses to get this done.  I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. 860 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.
