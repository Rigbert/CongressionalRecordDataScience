Speaker, I had hoped to restrict this debate to the failings of the Republican Bush administration in protecting the safety of the American traveling public and the jobs of American truckers. Unfortunately, the gentlelady before us apparently has amnesia because she forgets that the Republicans controlled the House, the Senate, and the White House for 6 years. And during those 6 years, Vice President Cheney wrote an energy policy in secret with the big oil companies.                              {time}  1745  George Bush walked hand-in-hand with the King of Saudi Arabia, and they designed a policy. That policy that was actually designed to make us more dependent on foreign oil rather than less, and many of us who opposed it then in the minority said this is not a solution to America's energy problems. You are going to make us more dependent on foreign oil, and we are, exactly as was designed by Vice President Cheney, endorsed by President Bush and passed by the Republican House and the Republican Senate. That's the energy policy we're living under, that.  Now, today, they're born again as defenders of the American consumers, and they pocket hundreds of millions--sorry, hundreds of thousands, millions of dollars in contributions from Big Oil. They want to rush forward yet again with a shortsighted policy while giving lip service to a long-term solution to our energy needs.  We will have a comprehensive bill on the floor later this week, and we will see where the Republicans really stand on this issues. Do they stand with the American people, with American consumers? Will they look forward to the future and finally freeing us from the trial and enslavement to the OPEC nations? We will see later this week.  With that, I reserve the balance of my time.
