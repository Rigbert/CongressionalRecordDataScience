  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, Members who do not want to be treated like mushrooms will come to the floor now to speak and vote in favor of House Resolution 57.  This is a critical question: What are the terms, the amounts, the conditions and, more to point, the constitutional authority to extend unlimited full faith and credit of the United States Treasury--that is, the funds of the taxpayers of this country--to a foreign power, Mexico? Do the elected Representatives of the people have a right to disclosure?  A vote for this resolution is a vote to carry out our constitutional responsibilities, our fiduciary responsibilities as caretakers of the public purse; a vote ``no'' is a vote to be treated like a mushroom kept in the dark and fed unsavory substances.                          ____________________
