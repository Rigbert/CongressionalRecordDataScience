President, in the early 20th century, hundreds of emigrants left the Palestinian town of Beitunia to come to Chicago for a better life. Many could not read or write in English. Still, they set about succeeding in America and fitting into society, overcoming obstacles in a new land, becoming salesmen, shopkeepers, and factory workers. Miriam Zayed grew up in this community outside of Chicago.  Khalil Gibran once wrote, ``I slept, and I dreamed that life is all joy. I woke, and I saw that life is all service. I served, and I saw that service was joy.'' The call to service isn't an easy path, and not nearly enough answer this call, but there are times when you meet someone who embodies the joy of service. This was Miriam Zayed.  Miriam passed away last fall in October after a lifetime of leadership. She spent her life fighting for Arabs and Muslims in the Chicagoland area and the rights of everyone.  Born and raised in Chicago, Miriam always had a love of politics and education. She convinced her parents to let her go to Chicago State University, becoming among the first in her family to attend college. But there was one stipulation. Her mother had to go with her every day. Miriam's thirst for knowledge would not be deterred by having her mom take her to and from school and wait outside her classes. She went on to receive her master's degree from National Louis University in curriculum education.  Miriam was one of the first Arab Americans in the Chicagoland area to run for public office when she ran for District 230 School Board in the 1990s.  As treasurer of the Arab-American Democrat Club, Miriam brought all local politicians and candidates to attend the annual candidate's forum brunch and encouraged the Arab-American Community to attend and be recognized as voting constituents. I have attended the AADC forums, and promise you, it was always a full house, and Miriam was always working. She never sat for the entire event.  Those that attended AADC brunches, events at the United Holy Land Fund, or the Beitunia Club events knew the tireless work of Miriam Zayed. She never sought the limelight, but all who knew her respected her.  When she wasn't building her community, Miriam was teaching in the Chicago Public School system in the Englewood neighborhood in Chicago. For decades, she taught at the Earle Elementary School. She took her classes to the Art Institute in Chicago, and for some students, it was the first time they ever went downtown. She educated her students about State government and introduced them to public officials. Miriam purchased school supplies and clothing for her students too. Miriam also somehow found time to run her own business as a certified public accountant, helping people in the community with their tax preparation and planning needs. She treated everyone as family.  The week before she passed away, a candidates' forum and brunch that she helped organize took place to celebrate politics and the 2018 election. By then, she was too ill to attend as she had done so many times before. The brunch's keynote speaker, Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan, reported that April would be designated Arab Heritage Month by the State of Illinois. There wasn't a better place to make that declaration.  In May of this year, Miriam will be awarded the 2019 Najeeb Halaby Award for Public Service posthumously by the Arab American Institute Foundation at the Kahlil Gibran Spirit of Humanity Awards. This award is given to those who promote greater understanding and appreciation of diversity and inclusion. Her decades of work for her students, the greater Chicago area, and the many communities of which she was a member make her more than worthy of the award.  Miriam's joy in service and love for her family and community will be missed. She is survived by her husband Refat Zayed; her children Hythem Zayed, Belal Zayed, Holly (Zayed) Murad, and Lena Hussien; and by her brothers and sisters, Nancy, Zayid, Adele, Heyam, Hanan, Cindy, and Dena.                          ____________________
