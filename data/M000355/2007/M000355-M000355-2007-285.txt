 President, let me suggest, I do need to consult with the ranking member. I am sure that won't be a problem, but to do it on the spur of the moment without consulting with the ranking member, it would probably not be acceptable to my side. But I can't imagine this would be a problem, and we will get back to the majority leader shortly.
