Speaker, it is with great honor and enthusiasm that I wish to commend two distinguished members of the Northwest Indiana community for their dedicated service and compassion for their fellow citizens. St. Catherine Hospital honored Mr. Donald S. Powers and Mayor Robert Pastrick with the Pillar of the Community Award on Saturday, February 22, 2003 for their outstanding service on behalf of the hospital and the surrounding community.  Donald Powers has demonstrated tremendous vision and leadership in his on-going relationship with Community Health Care System and its affiliates, Community Hospital, St. Catherine Hospital, and St. Mary Medical Center. As President of the Board, Mr. Powers oversaw the creation and construction of Community Hospital, and assisted the staff and administration in developing the first freestanding hospital in Lake County that is ranked in the top two percent of hospitals surveyed nationally for standard of care.  Mr. Power's planning and foresight with respect to the hospital's investment program led to the construction of the Center for Visual and Performing Arts in Munster, Indiana. This center has served as a cultural epicenter, as it is the home for the Northwest Indiana Symphony Society and the Northern Indiana Arts Association.  Mr. Powers has donated much of his time and expertise to his community. He has served on many boards, including the American Red Cross, Calumet Council of Boy Scouts, and the YMCA. Additionally, Mr. Powers was appointed to the Board of Trustees of Purdue University by former Governor Otis Bowen, and was elected President of the Board in 1981.  Mayor Robert Pastrick has been a fixture of the East Chicago community since his election to the City Council in 1955. He has served the citizens of East Chicago as their mayor since 1973. During that time, he has shown a commitment to ensuring effective health care for his constituents by initiating a joint venture between the City of East Chicago and St. Catherine Hospital. Through this program, East Chicago residents have an opportunity to obtain affordable, quality health care for themselves and their children.  Mayor Pastrick has also shown a commitment to his community through his volunteer work, serving on the Indiana Association of Cities and Towns, the United States Conference of Mayors, the Northwest Indiana Regional Planning Commission, and the Northwest Indiana Forum Foundation. Through hisservice in these organizations, Mayor Pastrick has worked to improve the lives of the residents of East Chicago, as well as the lives of all Northwest Indiana residents.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Mr. Donald S. Powers and Mayor Robert Pastrick as they receive the Pillar of the Community Award for their work on behalf of St. Catherine Hospital. Through their dedication and hard work, the citizens of Northwest Indiana have access to the best medical facilities and services possible. I am proud to represent them in Congress.                          ____________________
