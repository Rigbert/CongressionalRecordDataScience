President, when Senator Grassley comes to the floor and speaks of the Midwestern need, he speaks of an issue of which I have intimate personal knowledge. In 1993, it was my district, my congressional district, inundated by these floods.  I spent countless hours and days working with the brave volunteers and the National Guard and others to try to save buildings and homes and farms, filling sandbags and doing everything we could to fight off the flooding of the Illinois River and the Mississippi River.  This flood, which was not supposed to occur 15 years later, matched the intensity of the 1993 flood, in some places it overwhelmed the intensity in others, particularly in the State of Iowa.
