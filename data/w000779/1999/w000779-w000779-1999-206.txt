I think there is one other important point that needs to be made. It seems to me that the legislation as it stands now makes it very clear that what is really going to govern the vast majority of cases is the written contractual terms between businesses.  If you look at page 11 of the subcommittee report, it makes it very clear that the act doesn't apply to personal injuries or to wrongful deaths. What is going to apply are the written contractual terms between businesses.  As I recall, the chairman of the Commerce Committee thought originally that in this and other major changes there ought to be a Federal standard in this area. There was a concern that was, again, writing new law and tort law. The chairman decided to make it clear that it was going to be written in contractual terms that were going to govern these agreements between businesses.  What is the chairman's understanding of how that came about, and why those written contractual terms were important in this reform?  Mr. McCAIN. I say to my friend from Oregon that he has pretty well pointed out that there were several standards which could be used for both legal as well as the sense of how the people who are involved in the Y2K situation are involved. To have one standard, I think, was clearly called for, although perhaps I would have liked to have seen a tougher standard. But the fact is that this was a process of how we develop legislation. We also wanted to respect the individual contracts, as the Senator from Oregon knows.  Mr. President, I just want to say again that my dear friend from South Carolina has been very patient, and I know that he wants to speak at some length. I appreciate both his compassion and commitment and knowledge of the issue.  We have tried to compromise. We will continue to try to compromise. Weare now reaching close to a point where the legislation would be meaningless.  I am all in favor of a process where amendments are proposed, where they are debated and voted on. I think that is the way we should do business.  If the Senator from South Carolina has a problem with this legislation, I hope he will propose an amendment to this legislation. I will be glad to debate it, and we will be glad to have votes.  It is important that we resolve this legislation. I would not like to see, nor do I think the people of this country deserve, a gridlock where blocking of any legislation to move forward on this issue takes place. I don't think that is fair. I don't think it is fair or appropriate on an issue of this magnitude of which time is of the essence. We can't have a blockage of this issue and take this legislation up several months from now.  I respect the views of others who oppose this legislation. But let's go through a legislative process. I am willing to stay here all day and all night to debate the amendments, whatever they may be. I don't want to introduce a cloture motion, because obviously that cuts off people's ability to debate this issue because of the timeframe and time limits involved in a cloture motion.  But I also urge my colleagues who oppose this legislation, let's not engage in extraneous amendments on minimum wage, or violence on TV, or guns, or anything else. That, frankly, in all due respect to my colleagues, is avoiding this issue. This issue needs to be addressed.  In the eyes of every American, there is a huge problem arising at 12:01, January 1 of the year 2000. We have an obligation to address that problem.  For us to now be sidetracked with other issues and extraneous amendments, or others, is doing a great disservice to those men and women, small businesses and large and medium size, which will be affected by this serious problem, of which, by the way, even with a select committee we really haven't gotten a good handle on the magnitude of the problem. It depends on what part of our economy, what part of government, et cetera.  But there is no one who alleges that there is no problem. It is our obligation to try to address this problem. Let's do it in an orderly fashion with debate, with amendments, and then vote on final passage.  I urge my colleagues to respect such a process.                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent when the Senate reconvenes at 2:15 it be in order for the Senate Chaplain to offer a prayer in honor of the moment of silence being observed in Colorado, and following the prayer the junior Senator from Colorado be recognized to speak, to be followed by the senior Senator from Colorado who, after some remarks, will offer a moment of silence.
