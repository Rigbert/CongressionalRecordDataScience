President, I know the Senator from Colorado is seeking recognition. I will not hold the floor, but I urge Senators who have, on our side--and I suspect the distinguished Senator from Kentucky will make the same request on his side--I urge Senators on our side, who have amendments that they intend to offer to this bill, to come and let us know.
