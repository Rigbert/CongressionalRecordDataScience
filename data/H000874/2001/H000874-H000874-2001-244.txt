Speaker, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) is one of the most eloquent Members we have in this body. When he was in the Maryland General Assembly, he was the Speaker Pro Tempore of our House of Delegates, the second highest leader in our House. The gentleman did an extraordinary job there. He is doing an extraordinary job here, and I thank him for his contribution.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the immediate past Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, whom I have known for almost 40 years. He and I started out in the Young Democrats together. We have gone through a lot of history ourselves.  He came to this Congress several years ago. He is a colleague on the Committee on Appropriations, a real leader on the steering committee, the managing committee of our party. He has done an extraordinary job in leading the Congressional Black Caucus and an extraordinary job in serving South Carolina and America.                              {time}  1445
