Speaker, I rise today to give special recognition to the Farley United Methodist Church in Richfield Township in Northwest Ohio. On October 18, 1998, the church will celebrate its 150th anniversary.  The Farley Society was founded in 1848. Later named the Farley Methodist Church, and then the Farley United Methodist Church, the church is a small rural congregation in the town of Berkey, Ohio. Strongly supported by its members, succeeding generations of the original founding families still attend the church. To quote one of its members, ``Although the church remains today as a small, country church, it has been part of the fabric and an influence in the Richfield Township community for generations.''  I am pleased to commemorate the church's 150th anniversary. This milestone is a testament to faith, to the strength of community, and to the values of family, tradition, and coming together. A church is only as strong as its members, and the 150 year long journey of the Farley United Methodist Church has only come about through the faith and perseverance of its congregants. Their lives have certainly been made richer through their faith, but our community has also been made richer by the church's presence. The simple white structure at the town crossroads has housed generations of souls uplifted by the strength of prayer and each other as God's Word was celebrated each Sunday for 150 years.  As those years are celebrated, I know that the spirit of the church's ancestors will be felt, and they will join today's membership in the commemoration. May all present find the day to be one of inspiration, reflection on the past, and vision for the future.                          ____________________
