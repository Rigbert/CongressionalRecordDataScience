 Speaker, it is with great pride that I salute the Essex High School Cheerleaders, from Essex Junction, Vermont, for winning third place in the National High School Cheerleading Championship on February 12 in Orlando, Florida.  The Hornet cheerleaders were competing for the first time. But they knew they had something going for them, despite their relative inexperience: They had already won the first place award at the New England Regional qualifier last fall. That victory, of course, put them on a collision course with the nation's very best cheerleading teams, all thirty-one of them. After a tough preliminary round, Essex was in fourth place, one spot out of the medals. But they bore down in the finals, and leaped into the medals with a third place, outpaced only by the three-time national champion, Sparkman High of Alabama, and a talented team from Archbishop Shaw High School in Louisiana.  These exceptional young athletes and their coaches at Essex High School have worked long and hard to achieve this national recognition. Combining grace with athleticism, they have shown the nation that with determination and the desire to excel, any door may be opened, even a door leading to a top place in national competition.  All of Essex High School, all of Essex and Essex Junction, all of Vermont, are proud of these young women and men. May this be the beginning of a proud new tradition.                          ____________________
