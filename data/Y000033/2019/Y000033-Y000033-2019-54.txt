 A 3-2 loss to the McKinney North Stars earlier in the Tournament could not discourage these young men from Anchorage. They qualified for the championship bracket, and advanced to the Championship game, where they once again faced the McKinney North Stars. With just 50 seconds left, Anchorage'sHayden Fox notched the winning goal off a Tucker Lien assist to come from behind to win the game. I have not seen a team from the State of Alaska win the boys' National Championship at the U16 age group in more than 20 years, and I can't begin to say how immensely proud I am of this team.  Victory in hockey is a team effort, and so I would like to recognize the players and staff of this team individually for their hard work and dedication this season. Our 2019 Anchorage North Stars U16 Championship players are Jarett Beckett, Peter Flannery Schutt, Colten Gerken Roberto, Jakub Hall, Tyler Huffer, Olin Kelliher, Tucker Lien, Spencer Lund, Revelin Mack, Cullen McCormick, Garret Miknich, Trevor Monahan, Logan Orr, Alexander Pavia, Teague Porter, Landen Reed, Drake Reid, Joshua Tyra, and the winning goal scorer, Hayden Fox. The 2019 Anchorage North Stars National Championship team is led by Head Coach Matt Thompson, Assistant Coaches Austin King, Graham McManamin, and Kory Roy, Team Manager Katie Hulse, and President Barrett Heisten.  Madam Speaker, it gives me great pride to celebrate the achievements of our young people in Alaska. Hockey teaches young Alaskans the value of practice and hard work, and there is no better reward for a season's worth of training than overcoming all obstacles in your way to secure a championship. The other teams in the 2019 USA Hockey U-16 National Championship deserve their recognition as well, especially the McKinney North Stars, who gave Anchorage as tough of a championship game as they could've asked for. I see it only fitting that these young men be recognized not only by their home state, but by this Congress, on their achievement. I think I speak for all of Alaska when I say congratulations on their victory.                          ____________________
