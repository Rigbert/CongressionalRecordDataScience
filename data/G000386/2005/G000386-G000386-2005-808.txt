  Mr. President, under current law, investment banks are not allowed to compete on the same playing field as other professionals. Right now, investment banks are precluded per se, in many circumstances, from representing a debtor in a business bankruptcy if the investment bank acted as the investment banker for the company before it filed for court protection.  I think this is a draconian rule. The bill would give the bankruptcy judge the ability to determine whether an investment banker is disinterested, just as the judge determines whether other professionals are disinterested. The provision in the bill, it seems to me, is not only fair, but it will also safeguard the proceedings from any conflict of interest. Do we trust our Federal judges, or don't we, to make this determination? After all, the environment for this is in the judiciary--before judges. We happen to trust them for all other professionals involved in the bankruptcy proceedings, whether there is any conflict of interest for anyone involved. So then the question becomes, why should it be different for investment banks?  I think the provision in the bill is fine as it is. It is part of the compromise. We should allow a judge to make this determination and, thus, protect the integrity of the bankruptcy process. So I ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
