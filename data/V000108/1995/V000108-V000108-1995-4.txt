Speaker, I add my congratulations to the gentleman from Alabama [Mr. Callahan] as well as the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Wilson] for crafting what I think is a good bill under very difficult circumstances.  However, I rise to continue to express my sharp opposition to a provision in the conference report that would rewrite current United States law by severely weakening section 907 of the Freedom Support Act, which prohibits direct United States Government assistance to the Government of Azerbaijan until that country lifts its blockade of Armenia.  Mr. Speaker, I successfully offered an amendment on this issue on June 29, and the House approved it after 2\1/2\ hours of debate. The Senate also refused to include any language on section 907. Unfortunately, the conference committee, acting without a mandate by either the House or the Senate, decided to reinsert this provision into the bill; and I am strongly opposed to their actions in this matter.  The gentleman from Texas [Mr. Wilson] has suggested, correctly, that his language is different, correctly, as a matter of form, not of substance. The substance of the issue is to prohibit direct payments to the Government of Azerbaijan until they remove the blockade. That is the essence of the issue.  Mr. Speaker, the sanctions on Azerbaijan were imposed because of that country's ongoing blockade. When the Azerbaijan blockade is lifted, the United States prohibition on direct Government assistance can also be lifted. Countries that violate the conditions that Congress attaches for receiving U.S. assistance should not be rewarded.                              {time}  1630  Any attempt to remove section 907 must be viewed as support for Azerbaijan's blockade of Armenia as a legitimate weapon of war as well as support for their hostile position in the ongoing peace negotiations.  In closing, if we allow American dollars to flow to the Government of Azerbaijan, we will be turning our backs on the people of Armenia at a time when they desperately need and deserve our support. The true facts of this case are simple. The Government of Azerbaijan should act in peace, lift the blockade, and everyone can be made whole.
