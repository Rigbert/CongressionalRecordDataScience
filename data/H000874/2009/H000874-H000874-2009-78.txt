We are and, as the gentleman knows, I am very concerned about the looming deficits that have been caused by the very substantial economic downturn and our necessity to respond to that under the previous administration and under this administration. We need to get a handle on that.  One of the things that we have pledged in our budget to do is to make sure that statutory PAYGO is put in place which will be an extrinsic constraint, if you will, a statutory constraint on the spending, whether it's spending in terms of entitlement spending, whether it's in terms of revenues or in terms of spending. Both have an adverse impact on deficit. So it is my expectation that when we deal with either the sustainable growth rate, the doc fix, or the estate tax or the AMT or middle class income tax reduction, we will include provisions for statutory PAYGO to be sent with that legislation to the Senate, as is consistent with the budget that we passed and that the Senate passed.
