 President, I rise today to speak about developing countries around the world that are dealing with population explosions. As we near the end of the year, we are trying to wrap things up before the Senate goes out of session. But we continue to ignore this important issue.  This topic does not get very much attention here on the Senate floor, but in the developing world, there is a population explosion. Some experts believe that the population of Earth may top 9 billion by 2050. Eighty-eight percent of Americans believe that international population growth is either a major problem right now or that it will become one in the future. Almost all of the growth is occurring in countries that are the least able to govern, ensure jobs for, and care for their citizens.  But this is also about safe access to health care for women. Even though these countries are experiencing huge population growths, hundreds of thousands of women are dying each year from complications from pregnancy. These women do not have access to the health care that they need, especially reproductive health care.  In many poor countries around the world, nongovernmental organizations and medical professionals are working to make things better. They have set up clinics and reached out to the women and families in poor communities. They are doing great work. But their hands are tied because the Bush administration has imposed a political ideology on the world.  When President Bush took office in 2001, he signed an Executive order known as the global gag rule. It denies U.S. funds to any overseas health clinic unless it agrees not to use its own private, non-U.S. funds for anything related to abortion. What that means, is that if you are a medical professional living in an impoverished country trying to help people and save their lives, you are gagged from even talking about certain reproductive health services. The gag rule places limits on women and doctors that we would never accept here in the United States.  Earlier this year, the Senate passed an amendment to the Foreign Affairs Authorization Act to reverse the President's policy and ensure that health care clinics for women and families receive this much-needed funding. Unfortunately, this legislation has not passed by the full Senate. I am pleased that the Foreign Operations appropriations bill contains $34 million for the United Nations Populations Fund, UNPA, for this purpose. But in order to ensure that this money goes toward funding health care clinics for women and families in poor countries, we must overturn this global gag rule.  In closing, I would like to share the following article, which ran on December 3, 2005, with my colleagues because I believe that it provides some important food for thought as we continue to work on this important issue.  I ask unanimous consent that my remarks and the following article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                Does Population Explosion Threaten U.S.?                           (By David Horsey)       Flying in or out of Mexico City, the traveler can look down      on the human sprawl metastasizing in every direction. The      Mexican megalopolis is now home to 25 million people and vies      for first place among the world's most gigantic cities. From      a bird's eye view, it's easy to conclude that the planet has      more than enough homo sapiens taking up space.       Having just flown back from a study tour in Mexico that      focused on issues of overpopulation, family planning and      development, I can report positive news on the population      front. In the developed world, population growth has been put      in check. Birth rates are roughly at replacement levels and      no higher.       An even better story is Mexico. Not that long ago, the      Mexican population was spiraling out of control with an      average seven children per family. The population doubled      between 1950 and 1970 and doubled again by the end of the      20th century. Today, though, thanks in large part to      government commitment and successful family-planning      measures, the fertility rate has dropped to about 2.1,      putting Mexico on track to see a leveling off of population      by 2015.       However, this good news is qualified by a disturbing      caveat. The successes of recent years have created      complacency. Some people think the population bomb has been      defused while in reality only the easier part of the job has      been done.       In the developing world, the numbers continue to explode.      Earth's current human population of 6.5 billion may top 9      billion by 2050 and 99 percent of the growth will be in the      least developed nations. If these countries fail to follow      Mexico's path, calamity may be just around the corner. In the      regions of the world that are the most poor and the least      able to care for, employ or govern their rapidly expanding      populations, widespread famine, environmental destruction and      social collapse are inevitable.       Most countries have reached agreement on what needs to be      done to avert such disaster, but, in recent years, the United      States has been a maverick on the population issue. The      politics of abortion and religion have given current leaders      reason to act as if it is not our problem.       Is this an area where self-interest and traditional values      dictate that we let less fortunate countries find a way to      cope on their own? Here's my Burning Question:       Is the developing world's population explosion a threat to      America?                          ____________________[Page S14176]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                          POPULATION EXPLOSION
