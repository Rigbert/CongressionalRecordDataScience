Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2341, the Class Action Fairness Act of 2002. Last August, The Washington Post Editorial Board wrote that ``no portion of the American civil justice system is more of a mess than the world of class actions. None is in more desperate need of policymakers' attention.''  Mr. Chairman, the Post almost got it right, except that the world of class action litigation is not a mess, it is a joke. The examples speak for themselves:  An airline price-fixing settlement produced $16 million in attorneys' fees that only provided a $25 credit for class members, if they purchased an additional airline ticket for more than $250.  The Bank of Boston accounting settlement, which resulted in $8.5 million in attorneys' fees but actually cost class members around $80 apiece. And if that was not bad enough, the plaintiffs' attorneys in this settlement actually sued the class members for an additional $25 million.  In Mississippi, an asbestos settlement rewarded class members from Mississippi as much as 18 times more than class members from other States. In another case, a class action settlement against Cheerios over food additives produced $2 million in attorneys' fees and class members only received coupons for more Cheerios.  While these settlements are a disgrace to the American legal system, H.R. 2341 takes important steps to restore its dignity. First, it would implement necessary safeguards against these and other unwieldy settlements that give lawyers millions of dollars in fees and individual class members a small fraction of any settlement or award. Secondly, it would expand Federal diversity jurisdiction over interstate class actions to help curb the serious abuses that continue to take an enormous toll on our society.  A quick examination of the class action world reveals that the scales of justice are unable to balance the interests of class action lawyers and their clients. Currently, attorneys lump thousands and sometimes millions of speculative claims into one class action and then race to any available State courthouse in the hopes of a rubber stamp settlement. Too often these settlements result in millions of dollars of attorneys' fees and a mere pittance or coupons for class members in exchange for an agreement not to sue in the future.  While these class actions serve no public policy or benefit to class members, they are an enormous windfall for their attorneys. In addition, because most State and Federal procedural rules require the class members affirmatively opt out of the lawsuit, there are many instances where people are dragged into class actions and do not know how to get out. The only available advice is supposedly contained in extremely complicated class action notices. Mr. Chairman, this system does not protect the interests of class members.  While case after case demonstrates how greedy attorneys use abusive class action settlements to game the system at the expense of their clients, this bill provides long-needed protections to prevent this from happening in the future. A consumer class action bill of rights would prohibit the payment of bounties to class representatives, bar the approval of unreasonable net-loss settlements, and establish a plain-English requirement for settlement notices which clarify class members' rights. Additionally, H.R. 2341 would require greater scrutiny of coupon settlements and settlements involving out-of-state class members.  With the filing of State court class actions having increased a thousand percent over the last 10 years, the current system has transformed certain State courts into the epicenter for class action abuse. It is widely known that there are a handful of State courts notorious for processing even the most speculative of class actions. These courts end up rendering judgments that make national law and bind people from all 50 States. This is exactly what diversity jurisdiction in our Federal courts was intended to prevent.  The bill would rectify this situation by updating antiquated Federal jurisdictional rules and providing our Federal courts with jurisdiction over large interstate class actions. Currently, the Federal Rules provide Federal court jurisdiction for disputes dealing with Federal laws and disputes based upon complete diversity. That means that all plaintiffs and defendants are residents of different States and that every plaintiff's claim is valued at $75,000 or more. As a result, Federal courts have jurisdiction over lawsuits between people from two different States for just over $75,000 but do not have jurisdiction for national class actions worth billions of dollars. Instead, these massive lawsuits are being processed in various county courts throughout the country.  The bill establishes a new minimal diversity standard for class actions, requiring that any plaintiff and any defendant are residents of differentStates and that the aggregate of all claims is at least $2 million. While the bill does not require that all interstate class actions be filed in Federal court, those that do satisfy this minimal diversity requirement may be removed to Federal court. However, the bill also excludes class actions dealing with one State, that are against a State, or consist of less than 100 class members, and all securities and corporate governance litigation.  Mr. Chairman, the Federal court is where these cases belong. The Federal courts are equipped and practiced in handling complex, interstate cases, unlike many of the county courts that have been the source of rampant class action abuse. In addition, Federal courts are trained to balance various State laws in similar complex legislation. This Congress has already endorsed this notion when it designated a single Federal district court to resolve all litigation relating to the September 11 attacks and possible future litigation under the terrorism reinsurance legislation.  Finally, Mr. Chairman, it is important to note that the cost of class action abuses are not limited to the parties of these settlements. They are shared by the American consumer. Because potential liability of a class action is so enormous and unpredictable under the current system, most defendants are willing to settle regardless of the merit. The cost is then passed off to the consumer in the form of higher prices for goods and services. This burdens the American economy and creates unneeded threats against America's ingenuity.  Also, Mr. Chairman, these lawsuits pose a threat to the security of America's retirement plans. While class action liability can be enormous, news of these lawsuits on Wall Street can drive down a particular stock by as much as 8 to 10 points in a day. For someone depending upon a steady return on their invested retirement plan, this drop should be extremely alarming.                              {time}  1230  The bottom line is that H.R. 2341 is a common-sense approach to promote national litigation efficiency and fairness to all potential plaintiffs. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
