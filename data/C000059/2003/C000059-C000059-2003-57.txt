Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Corona, California are exceptional. Corona has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Paula Montanez is one of these individuals. On September 30, 2003, Paula will be honored at the 2003 Distinguished Citizens Awards Dinner organized by the Boy Scouts of America.  Paula was born in Oklahoma, her mother's home state, but has lived most of her life in Southern California. She graduated from Corona High School in 1973 and attended college at the University of California, Riverside and Cal Poly Pomona. She received her Bachelor's Degree in Home Economics.  Paula and her husband Eugene, a Corona City Council Member, own and operate Zap Printing & Graphics, a successful printing company. In addition to her work she finds time for numerous organizations. She is a past president of Soroptimist International of Corona, a board member of the Corona Library Foundation and she has been involved in the Corona Reads projects for the past two years.  Paula has been a committee member of Cub Scouts Pack 121 and Boy Scouts Troop 121. She has also been a committee member of St. Edward School Development Commission, Santiago High School Soccer Boosters Board, Corona Regional Medical Center Foundation Board, and PrintImage International trade association. In 1998, Paula was awarded the ``Women Helping Women'' award by Soroptimist International of Corona. Her constant support and involvement has been an inspiration to fellow community members.  Paula's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Corona, California. She has been the heart and soul of many community organizations and events and I am proud to call her a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for her service and salute her as she receives the 2003 Boy Scouts of America Distinguished Citizen Award.                          ____________________
