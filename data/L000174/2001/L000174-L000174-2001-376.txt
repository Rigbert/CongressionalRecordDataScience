President, I rise today to introduce with Senator Hatch legislation that addresses the problems caused by housing juveniles who are prosecuted in the criminal justice system in adult correctional facilities. In addition, this legislation reauthorizes the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, to maintain the core protections afforded to juveniles who are adjudicated delinquent and detained in the juvenile court system. This two-pronged approach will help ensure that we treat juvenile offenders with appropriate severity, but also in a way that assists States in providing safe conditions for their confinement and appropriate access to educational, vocational, and health programs that address the needs of juveniles. Improving conditions for juveniles today will improve the public safety in the future, as juveniles who are not exposed to adult inmates have a lower likelihood of committing future crimes.  The Justice Department reported last fall that of the 50 States and the District of Columbia, 44 house juveniles in adult jails and prisons, and 26 of those do not maintain designated youthful offender housing units. As a nation, we are relying increasingly on adult facilities to house juveniles; for example, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics' survey of jails, there was a 35 percent increase in the number of juveniles held in adult jails between 1994 and 1997. I believe that there is a will in the States to improve conditions for these juveniles, but resources are often lacking. The Federal Government can play a useful role by providing funding to States that want to take account of the differences between juveniles and adults.  Although many juvenile offenders serving time in adult prisons have committed extraordinarily serious offenses, others are there because of relatively minor crimes and will be released at a young age. According to the1999 report of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, 22 percent of juveniles committed to State prisons were there because they had committed property crimes, 11 percent because they committed drug-related crimes, and only 25 percent because they had committed murder, kidnaping, sexual assault or assault. Certainly, many of those juveniles can be convinced not to commit further crimes. The social and moral cost of not making that attempt is simply incalculable.  There is stunning statistical evidence that something is deeply wrong with our current approach to incarcerating juveniles. According to the Justice Department, the suicide rate for juveniles held in adult jails is five times the rate in the general youth population and eight times the rate for adolescents in juvenile detention facilities. Juveniles in adult facilities are also more likely to be violently victimized. Sexual assault was five times more likely than in juvenile facilities, beatings by staff nearly twice as likely, and attacks with weapons almost 50 percent more common.  Moreover, many scholars have questioned whether housing juvenile offenders with adult inmates serves our long-term interest in public safety. Multiple studies have shown that youth transferred to the adult system recidivate at higher rates and with more serious offenses than youth who have committed similar offenses but are retained in the juvenile justice system. Some would suggest that we should not be transferring youth to the adult system at all, and I am sympathetic to that view. But that is a decision our States must make, and for now most of our States have taken the contrary position. At the very least, then, we must ensure that juveniles are treated humanely in the criminal justice system to reduce the risks that upon release they will commit additional and more serious crimes. One of the ways we can do that is by helping States improve confinement conditions.  The problem this bill is intended to address cannot be described simply through statistics or academic studies. The compelling stories of young people who have been part of the corrections system should command our attention. For example, United Press International and numerous newspapers have reported the story of 15-year-old Robert, who was held in a Kentucky adult jail for the minor infraction of truancy and petty theft. One night during his time there, Robert wrapped one end of his shirt around his neck, and one around the cell bars, and hanged himself. The county has now agreed not to house juveniles and adults together.  The New York Times magazine last year told the story of Jessica, who at 14 was the youngest female in the Florida correctional system and, within her first few weeks in prison, tried to commit suicide. Jessica was then transferred to a rougher Miami prison where she does not receive psychological counseling or attend class to get her GED. Jessica has found an extensive surrogate prison family whom she turns to for advice. The woman she refers to as ``Mommy'' is serving a life sentence for murder. Jessica will be released at age 22 with no education beyond the sixth grade, no job skills, and no life experience outside of prison after age 13. Now some will point out that Jessica committed a serious criminal offense she and two older teenagers robbed her grandparents and she deserves harsh punishment. And I agree that we must deal severely with such crimes. But the fact remains that when Jessica is released from prison she will be 22, with an entire adult life ahead of her. I believe it is critical for the public safety for her and others like her to have options besides a life of crime.  The Miami Herald reported the stories of Joseph Tejera and Rebekah Homerston. Tejera was sentenced as an adult for a burglary offense, and was placed in an adult prison instead of an intensive juvenile program where he would have received 24-hour supervision, had access to educational and other programs, and been surrounded by other juveniles. Instead, at the age of 16 and weighing 135 pounds, he was surrounded by adult inmates who constantly tried to beat him up. Despite a sterling disciplinary record, he was involved in five fights because of the aggressiveness of adult inmates. Homerston was the daughter of a father serving life in prison for sex crimes against minors and a mother arrested for theft and drunk driving. At the age of 13, she ran away from home, and lived on the streets of Fort Lauderdale. At 15, she too was prosecuted and sentenced to a two-year term as an adult after vandalizing the city's recreation center. Upon her release from that prison term, she was arrested at age 16 for shoplifting a shirt, and is now serving three and a half years in an adult facility for that offense. While in prison, she has witnessed numerous suicide attempts.  Housing juveniles with adult inmates creates problems not just for the juveniles involved. Such policies also create difficulties for corrections administrators, whose prisons and jails often lack the physical structure, programs, and trained personnel to manage a mixed juvenile-adult population. John Gorsik, the head of the Department of Corrections in my State of Vermont, has advised that corrections officials from around the nation dislike having juveniles in their facilities. These officials often become responsible for delivering those services to which juveniles are entitled, including special education services. As one report on Youth in the Criminal Justice System recently recommended: ``Administrative staff and people in policy making positions dealing with youth in the adult system should have education, training, and experience regarding the distinctive characteristics of children and adolescents.'' This bill would provide for such education and training to make the jobs of corrections officials around the nation easier. In addition, the presence of juveniles among adult inmates can lead to increased disciplinary problems and the inculcation of a criminal mentality in young, highly impressionable offenders like Jessica. Our prisons and jails are too often becoming schools for young lawbreakers.  I would like to explain how this bill addresses confinement conditions for juveniles.  Title I: The first title of this bill creates a new incentive grant program for State and local governments and Indian tribes. These grants can be used for the following purposes related to juveniles under the jurisdiction of an adult criminal court: (a) alter existing correctional facilities, or develop separate facilities, to provide segregated facilities for them, (b) provide orientation and ongoing training for correctional staff supervising them, (c) provide monitors who will report on their treatment, and (d) provide them with access to educational programs, vocational training, mental and physical health assessment and treatment, and drug treatment. Grants can also be used to seek alternatives to housing juveniles with adult inmates, including the expansion of juvenile facilities.  It is important to note that States that choose not to house juveniles who are convicted as adults with adult inmates are still eligible for grants under this bill. For example, they could use the money to train staff, or to provide educational or other programs for juveniles, or to improve juvenile facilities.  Applicants for these grants must provide a detailed plan explaining how they will improve conditions for juveniles in their adult corrections system. Let me be clear: the purpose of this grant program is not to fuel a prison-building boom, or to make it easier for States to prosecute juveniles as adults, but to improve conditions for juveniles. States will need to take this purpose into account in making their grant proposals. Moreover, to be eligible for a grant, States must have developed guidelines on the appropriate use of force against incarcerated juveniles, and must also have prohibited the use of electroshock devices, chemical restraints and punishment, and 4-point restraints. The use of such punishment is inconsistent with our commitments to treating juveniles humanely, and is at variance with the very purpose of this grant program. Every State that can meet the requirements of the grant program will receive funding under this title, and rural representation is guaranteed.  Title II: The second title of the bill authorizes States to use their Violent Offender Incarceration/Truth in Sentencing (VOI/TIS) grant money to improve the treatment of juveniles underthe jurisdiction of the adult criminal justice system. It also offers States an incentive to use a substantial percentage of their VOI/TIS money for that purpose. States that use 10 percent of their grant money to improve juvenile conditions will receive a bonus of 5 percent above the amount to which they are otherwise entitled under that program. The money can be used to alter existing facilities to provide separate space for juveniles under the jurisdiction of an adult criminal court, or to provide training and supervision of corrections officials and reporting on juvenile conditions. This title, in conjunction with Title I, allows us to make improving conditions for juveniles a national priority by working through the States. No State will be forced to use their money for this purpose or see their funding reduced if they choose not to. But those States that do make a serious effort in this regard will be rewarded.  Title III: The third title of this bill reauthorizes the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act. Under the JJDPA, States receiving federal funds must maintain core protections for detained juveniles. These protections include ``sight'' and ``sound'' separation between those in the juvenile detention system and adult offenders. Children cannot be put in adjoining cells with adults, or placed in circumstances that allow them to be subject to threats and verbal abuse from adults in dining halls, recreation areas, and other common spaces. In addition to establishing sight and sound separation, the JJDPA provides three additional core protections: (1) removal of juveniles from adult jails or lockups, with a 24-hour exception for rural areas and other exceptions for travel and weather-related conditions; (2) deinstitutionalization of status offenders; and (3) efforts toward reducing the disproportionate confinement of minority youth in the juvenile justice system.  I am very pleased that Senator Hatch has agreed with me that we need a straightforward reauthorization of the JJDPA. He and I both worked very hard in the last Congress to reauthorize that law, and our efforts were sidetracked by numerous factors.  Title IV: Finally, the fourth title of this bill contains a number of provisions that I would like to highlight today. First, it authorizes funding for rural States and economically distressed communities that lack the resources to provide secure custody for juvenile offenders. Second, this title calls for a study on the effect of sentencing juvenile drug offenders as adults. Many have raised concerns about the toll taken on some of our communities, especially those in poorer areas, by lengthy drug sentences. There is no question that the proliferation of illegal drugs over the last 20 years has presented a social crisis with particularly serious effects on poor and urban communities. But we need to take a systematic look at whether our approach to that crisis has been effective and fair, and the study in this bill should be part of that effort. Third, this bill instructs the General Accounting Office to prepare a report on the prevalence and effects of the use of electroshock weapons, 4-point restraints, chemical restraints, restraint chairs, and solitary confinement against juvenile offenders in both the Federal and State corrections systems. I am deeply concerned about the disciplinary methods being used against juvenile offenders in the U.S., and I believe it is important for Congress to receive an accounting of the problem so we can consider whether further legislation in this area is appropriate. Fourth, this title reauthorizes the Family Unity Demonstration Project, which provides funding for projects allowing eligible prisoners who are parents to live in structured, community-based centers with their young children. A study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that about two-thirds of incarcerated women were parents of children under 18 years old. According to the White House, on any given day, America is home to 1.5 million children of prisoners. And according to Prison Fellowship Industries, more than half of the juveniles in custody in the United States had an immediate family member behind bars. This is a serious problem, and reauthorizing the Family Unity Demonstration Project will help us address it.  I would like to thank numerous people who have worked with me and my staff on this proposal: Ken Schatz of the Vermont Children and Family Council, Marc Schindler and Mark Soler of the Youth Law Center, David Doi of the Coalition for Juvenile Justice, Jill Ward from the Children's Defense Fund, and John Gorsik and John Perry at the Vermont Department of Corrections. Without their help, I would not be able to introduce this bill today.  In conclusion, let me say that Congress must act to ensure that minimum standards are created in as many States as possible to ameliorate the problems resulting from sentencing juveniles as adults. I think this bipartisan bill accomplishes that goal, and I urge the Senate to give its full consideration, and its approval, to this proposal.                                 ______                                       By
