More importantly, however, I thank him for his very hard, focused, untiring work on making sure that, for the first time since 2004, we pass an authorization bill for intelligence.  I want to say that all of us have been engaged in this, but no one more than the chairman, and I thank him for his work. I also thank the staff, the staff director, and members of the staff who have done an extraordinary job as well. I know that the minority staff has worked hard on this as well, and Mr. Hoekstra, of course, who has been on the Intelligence Committee for many, many years.  I rise, Madam Speaker, in support of this intelligence authorization bill. The passage of this legislation, as I said earlier, is the first intelligence authorization bill to be passed since 2004. On something as critically important as our national security, national intelligence, it is unfortunate that we haven't been more successful in the past in passing a bill, for whatever reasons. This is a major step to strengthen our national security.  The bill continues policies that are working to help keep America safe from terrorist attack, policies which have been supported by two administrations. It also strengthens oversight of our intelligence community.                              {time}  1930  In a democracy, we have recognized in a bipartisan way that intelligence is critical, but in a free and open society it is also important that the people's representatives have meaningful oversight. While this community deserves the support of Congress, and it has always had mine, it also requires oversight by the Congress and direction from the Congress as to what policies the people's representatives believe ought to be followed. In my opinion, this bill does that.  The bill creates an independent inspector general with responsibility for the entire intelligence community. It reforms the briefing process for the bipartisan leadership of both Chambers and their Intelligence Committees, ensuring that the full membership of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees are informed when briefings occur and making the briefings available to all members of the committees 6 months after the initial briefings.  It is critically important that we keep secret those matters which are important to keep secret for our national security. On the other hand, we know from history, we know from experience, that it is critically important, as I have said in the past, that the people's representatives have knowledge and briefings as to those undertakings of this community.  This bill provides for the development of a framework that will enable the Government Accountability Office to conduct proper oversight of intelligence activities and reforms the intelligence community's acquisition process to avoid waste of taxpayer money.  This bill passed the Senate with unanimous support from both parties. This is not a partisan bill. This is a bill that the Senate Republicans and the Senate Democrats believed added to the security of our country.  In fact, I agree with Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Kit Bond, who formerly was, of course, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, with whom I worked very hard in a bipartisan fashion to pass the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, with the help of my friend the chairman and the support of President Bush.  Kit Bond said this about this bill: ``We can do more to protect Americans from attack, and passing the intelligence authorization bill,'' referring to the bill that is on the floor, ``passing the intelligence authorization bill and improving congressional oversight over our spy agencies is an important first step.''  That is what Senator Bond said, the Republican chair of the Intelligence Committee, and now the vice chair of the Intelligence Committee.  I want to thank the members of the House Intelligence Committee on both sides of the aisle, especially, as I have said, Chairman Silvestre Reyes and his staff, for their very hard work in writing and securing support for this legislation. It was not an easy road. There was disagreement.  The administration, this House, the Senate, had to come to an agreement. They have come to an agreement, an agreement which I think is, as Kit Bond said, a step in the right direction, an important step, and I hope that my colleagues will support it.  This is another contribution to strong and responsible leadership of our national security. I urge my colleagues to support it so that President Obama can sign it into law.  There is no higher responsibility than we have when we raise our hands in this Chamber to support and defend the Constitution of the United States and the laws thereof. Clearly, one of our major responsibilities is to protect America from adversaries, whether they be domestic or foreign, and in that process have an intelligence community that has the capability of ferreting out those who would harm this country and its people. But we also need to have an active, engaged, and responsible, as we do, Intelligence Committee, both in the House and in the Senate, to ensure that the values that make this country so special are honored even as we take every step that is necessary and proper to defend and protect America and Americans.  I urge the passage of this important piece of legislation.
