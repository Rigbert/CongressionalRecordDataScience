President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from the Campbell Soup Company.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From Campbell Soup Company, July 6, 2016]         Campbell Announces Support for Mandatory GMO Labeling       Camden, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 7, 2016--Campbell Soup      Company (NYSE: CPB) today announced its support for the      enactment of federal legislation to establish a single      mandatory labeling standard for foods derived from      genetically modified organisms (GMOs).       This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full      release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/ 20160107006458/en/.       Campbell believes it is necessary for the federal      government to provide a national standard for labeling      requirements to better inform consumers about this issue. The      company will advocate for federal legislation that would      require all foods and beverages regulated by the Food and      Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of      Agriculture (USDA) to be clearly and simply labeled for GMOs.      Campbell is also supportive of a national standard for non-     GMO claims made on food packaging.       As a result of its decision to support mandatory national      GMO labeling, Campbell will withdraw from all efforts led by      coalitions and groups opposing such measures.       The company continues to oppose a patchwork of state-by-     state labeling laws, which it believes are incomplete,      impractical and create unnecessary confusion for consumers.       Campbell is optimistic a federal solution can be      established in a reasonable amount of time if all the      interested stakeholders cooperate. However, if that is not      the case, Campbell is prepared to label all of its U.S.      products for the presence of ingredients that were derived      from GMOs, not just those required by pending legislation in      Vermont. The company would seek guidance from the FDA and      approval by USDA.       Campbell continues to recognize that GMOs are safe, as the      science indicates that foods derived from crops grown using      genetically modified seeds are not nutritionally different      from other foods. The company also believes technology will      play a crucial role in feeding the world.       Campbell has been engaged in the conversation about GMO      labeling for several years and has taken action to provide      consumers with more information about how its products are      made, including the presence of GMOs, through efforts like      its website www.whatsinmyfood.com. With 92 percent of      Americans supporting the labeling of GMO foods, Campbell      believes now is the time for the federal government to act      quickly to implement a federal solution.       More information about the rationale behind Campbell's      decision can be found on Campbell's newsroom.                                       ____       Campbell's--Why We Support Mandatory National GMO Labeling                           (By Campbell Team)       Today the New York Times (http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/08/business/a-new-fact-on-the-foodlabel.html) wrote about      Campbell's decision to support mandatory national labeling of      products that may contain genetically modified organisms      (GMOs).       Campbell's President and CEO Denise Morrison shared the      message below with our employees about the reasons behind our      decision.           Taking a Major Step Forward as We Live Our Purpose       At Campbell, we are unleashing the power of our Purpose,      Real food that matters for life's moments. Our Purpose calls      for us to acknowledge that consumers appreciate what goes      into our food, and why--so they can feel good about the      choices they make, for themselves and their loved ones.       Today, consistent with our Purpose, we announced our      support for mandatory national labeling of products that may      contain genetically modified organisms (GMO) and proposed      that the federal government provide a national standard for      non-GMO claims made on food packaging.       We are operating with a ``Consumer First'' mindset. We put      the consumer at the center of everything we do. That's how      we've built trust for nearly 150 years. We have always      believed that consumers have the right to know what's in      their food. GMO has evolved to be a top consumer food issue      reaching a critical mass of 92% of consumers in favor of      putting it on the label.       In addition, we have declared our intention to set the      standard for transparency in the food industry. We have been      openly discussing our ingredients, including those derived      from GMO crops, through our WhatsinmyFood.com website. We are      supporting digital disclosure through the Grocery      Manufacturers Association's (GMA) SmartLabelTM      program. We have announced the removal of artificial colors      and flavors from our products. However, our support of      mandatory federal GMO labeling sets a new bar for      transparency.       There is currently no federal regulation requiring labeling      that informs consumers about the presence of GMOs in their      food. In the absence of federal action, many states--from      California to Maine--have attempted to address this issue.      Campbell has opposed this state-by-state patchwork approach,      and has worked with GMA to defeat several state ballot      initiatives. Put simply, although we believe that consumers      have the right to know what's in their food, we also believe      that a state-by-state piecemeal approach is incomplete,      impractical and costly to implement for food makers. More      importantly, it's confusing to consumers.       Most recently, Vermont passed legislation that will require      food companies including Campbell to label products regulated      by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that may contain      ingredients made from GMO crops. However, this legislation      does not include products with meat or poultry, because they      are regulated by United States Department of Agriculture      (USDA). Under Vermont law, SpaghettiO's original variety,      guided by the FDA, will be labeled for the presence of GMOs,      but SpaghettiO's meatballs, guided by the USDA, will not. Yet      these two varieties sit next to each other on a store shelf,      which is bound to create consumer confusion.       Campbell has been actively involved in trying to resolve      this issue since 2011. We've worked with GMA, legislators and      regulators to forge a national voluntary solution. We've      engaged a variety of stakeholders, from lawmakers to      activists. I've personally made multiple trips to Capitol      Hill to meet with elected officials. Despite these efforts,      Congress has not been able to resolve this issue. We now      believe that proposing a mandatory national solution is      necessary. Printing a clear and simple statement on the label      is the best solution for consumers and for Campbell.       I want to stress that we're in no way disputing the science      behind GMOs or their safety. The overwhelming weight of      scientific evidence indicates that GMOs are safe and that      foods derived from crops using genetically modified seeds are      not nutritionally different from other foods. In America,      many farmers who grow canola, corn, soybean and sugar beets      choose to use genetically modified seeds and have done so for      nearly twenty years. More than 90% of these four crops in      America are currently grown using GMO seeds. It takes an      average of thirteen years to get a GMO seed approved by the      government for safety. Ingredients derived from these crops      are in many of our products. We also believe that GMOs and      other technologies will play a crucial role in feeding the      world.       We will continue to be a member of GMA and will participate      in food industry initiatives that align with our Purpose and      business goals. However, as a result of the change in our      position on GMO labeling, Campbell is withdrawing from all      efforts led by groups opposing mandatory GMO labeling      legislation, including those led by GMA.       The New York Times reported on our decision, and we issued      a press release. I encourage you to read both. We recognize      that this announcement may spark discussion. It's difficult      to predict the exact nature of the ensuing commentary, but I      suspect it will be a mixed bag. What I do know is that our      decision was guided by our Purpose; rooted in our consumer-     first mindset; and driven by our commitment to transparency--     to be open and honest about our food. I truly believe it is      the right thing to do for consumers and for our business.           Best,                                                  Denise Morrison,                                                President and CEO.
