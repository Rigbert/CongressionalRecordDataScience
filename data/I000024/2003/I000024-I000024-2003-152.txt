President, first of all, I thank the Senator from Arizona. I would suggest that this is exactly like the bill that came out of the Commerce Committee last year or the year before, the 107th Congress. I really believe it is time for us to do this. I know where the pressures are against it.  If there is no one else on the other side who wants to be heard, I will yield back.  Yes.
