. strategic stockpiles in Israel and provides Israel with additional weaponry as a first line of defense for the United States, as well as for Israel.  Furthermore, this bill extends loan guarantees for Israel and encourages an expanded Israeli role in NATO.  Mr. Speaker, it is so encouraging to see that even while we may divide on other matters, this House will pass the legislation before us with strong, overwhelming bipartisan support. Thatsends a message that hopefully cannot be missed, a clarity of purpose expressed by this Congress, the policymaking body of this Nation, that speaks for all the people of our Nation. Hopefully, those who would pose a threat and risk to us and to our allies would take note of that unanimity of purpose. Let us continue to ensure that close U.S.-Israel ties are an issue that unites us as Americans.  As I said, the House overwhelmingly passed this measure earlier this year, 411-2. Now the Senate has sent it back to us for final consideration. I congratulate my friend, Senator Boxer, and the Republican leadership of the Senate, as well.  I hope we can pass it again today. I know we will, and I hope it's with even greater support. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill--for America, for Israel, and for international security.                              {time}  1750
