 President, on Tuesday Iowa gymnast Shawn Johnson and her USA teammates won the gold at the Gymnastics World Championships in Germany.  Shawn is a native of West Des Moines, IA, where she has trained in gymnastics with Coach Liang Chow since the age of six. How did this young girl from Iowa become a world champion gymnast? I think it may have been said best by her coach in an interview with the Des Moines Register earlier this week. Coach Chow said Shawn, ``loved gymnastics. She loved to work out. She wanted to learn, and to get better.''  It is that love for what she does that carried Shawn to be crowned National Champion in San Jose, CA, two weeks ago, and carried her even higher to win the World Championship this week. I hope that Shawn's dedication to this sport will inspire many others to achieve greatness within their respective fields as well.  It is with great Iowa pride that I offer my sincere congratulations to Shawn Johnson for her accomplishments.                          ____________________
