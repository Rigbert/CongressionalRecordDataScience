Speaker, it is my honor to rise today to congratulate Father Joseph Niezgoda, pastor of St. Stanislaus Church in East Chicago, IN. On Sunday, November 12, 1995, the parish of St. Stanislaus held a testimonial dinner to honor Father Joe for 25 years of faithful dedication to their mission.  On August 16, 1971, Father Joe graciously accepted the appointment of pastor of St. Stanislaus Church. This church is celebrating its 95th year of existence and proudly boasts a membership of several thousand parishioners.  According to the parishioners, Father Joe's agreement with God and the bishop to take the responsibility of leading St. Stanislaus was a courageous step because his home parish was $700,000 in debt after rebuilding a school building, which was destroyed by fire. However, in Father Joe's 25 years of service to St. Stanislaus, he has worked exceptionally hard to pay off this enormous debt.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to applaud Father Joe for his extraordinary dedication to his calling. Indiana's First Congressional District is extremely blessed to have such a fine pastor in its presence.                          ____________________
