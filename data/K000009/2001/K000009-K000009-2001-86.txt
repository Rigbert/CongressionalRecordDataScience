Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Illinois for his eloquent statement. I thank him for giving us a snapshot of places in America where programs like this make an enormous difference. I thank him for his leadership, and I just wanted to place on the record the fact that HUD did do a study in 1999. In fact the inspector general of HUD did a study. They found no abuse in this program.  In fact, all HUD said, the inspector general, the inspection side of HUD merely said they ought to do some more studies around the country on how the program is working. They only asked for more paper reporting.  But on the ground, on the ground where people live every day, this is a successful program.  Mr. Chairman, I wanted to use this moment also to say to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Walsh), my good friend, who I really do not think his heart is in opposition on this program, but I want to say in my own town he said the money was not being spent. I would have to say that is not an accurate statement. In fact, over $700,000 of Federal and local money is being spent every year and is being spent according to the allocation formulas from HUD on schedule.
