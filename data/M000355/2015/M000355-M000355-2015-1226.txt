  The Senator from South Dakota has focused on the biggest drag on our economy, the single biggest thing holding this country back from reaching its potential, and I would say to my friend from South Dakota that he has picked the perfect subject and has laid out a good solution to it. I hope lots of colleagues on both sides of the aisle will rally around this excellent proposal as a good way forward in dealing with the single biggest domestic problem we have regarding the future growth of our country.  I yield the floor.
