 President, let me just say I do agree with the majority leader that we made some substantial progress today. First of all, on the principle that in order to extend tax relief to one set of Americans we don't have to raise taxes on another set of Americans, all but five Members of theSenate concurred in that approach to extension of the AMT relief. I think that is an extremely important principle to be established in the Senate.  With regard to the farm bill, there is widespread agreement on both sides of the aisle that we ought to pass a farm bill and we ought to pass it as soon as possible. I think getting the consent agreement to get the amendments down to 20 on each side is a significant step in that direction. I am pleased to hear the majority leader would like for us to stay on that bill, make progress on it, and finish it before Christmas. That is certainly my view as well.  With regard to the Energy bill, we understand there are two highly contentious, well-publicized provisions of tax increases that have been inserted by the House: At a time when oil is close to $100 a barrel, many of us think a tax increase is not a good idea, and the wind mandate, which is particularly onerous on those of us in the Southeast where there is not much wind, which basically means, in effect, a mandatory rate increase for utilities and for utility ratepayers all across the Southeast. I am hopeful we can get those two items out of that bill.  The President has indicated he will veto the bill, and I think there is a view on the other side of the aisle, as well as on our side, that we would like to have an energy bill actually enacted into law; that is, signed by the President. As the majority leader has indicated, hopefully we can get those problems removed from the Energy bill next week and move toward a Presidential signature.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
