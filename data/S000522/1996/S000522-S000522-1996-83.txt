Mr. Chairman, just to respond briefly to myfriend, the gentlelady from California. Ms. Pelosi's argument is that pro-lifers who assert that abortion is morally wrong are trying to set themselves up as being morally superior. Her argument has surface appeal, and is a very nice ploy and distraction, but it does not carry any weight and misses the mark completely.  I believe that our position, not me personally but our position, in favor of defending innocent lives from dismemberment, chemical poisoning and other brutal, violent methods employed by the abortionists is right and moral and I make absolutely no apologies for that.  I judge no one. I look at the deed--killing babies--and make judgments about the deed and whether this Congress should facilitate this unethical deed.
