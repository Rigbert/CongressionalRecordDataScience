Speaker, I rise today to introduce the ``Balancing Trade Act,'' an important bill that requires U.S. policy to take the trade deficit seriously.  This legislation provides actionable steps to re-balance our trade deficits with countries with which we have a deficit of $10 billion or more for three consecutive years. Following the Trump administration's recent Executive orders on U.S. trade policy, and recent letter to Congress to renegotiate NAFTA, this legislation offers actionable steps to the Administration.  Bad trade deals have contributed to a loss of nearly 4 million American jobs and a deficit of $43.6 billion. President Trump promised a trade deal that would get Americans back to work and reduce our deficit. By prioritizing our worst trade deals, we are ensuring that some of these promises are met.  An old adage reminds us: there are two kinds of failures: ``by those who think and don't do, and the other by those who don't think and do.'' Our ``free trade'' deals have been a major failure of the second order.  Persistent, massive trade deficits are a drag on the U.S. economy and impair job creation. Now more than ever we need a trade policy that grows the economy and creates jobs in the United States.                          ____________________
