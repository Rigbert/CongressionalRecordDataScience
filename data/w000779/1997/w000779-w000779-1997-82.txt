President, last month, I talked about the importance of the innovative ``Community Justice'' model for juvenile justice being developed in Deschutes County and Multnomah County, OR. Today, Senators Domenici and Ashcroft and I are introducing legislation that incorporates many important pieces of this Oregon model and also represents an effort to bring some new, bipartisan thinking to the issue of juvenile justice.  Oregon's idea is that the juvenile justice system should weave the community into the very fabric of juvenile justice. This entails treating the victim as a customer of the juvenile justice system and realizing that when a crime is committed the whole community is the victim. There is a reciprocal obligation in communities--first, to give children the values and tools to ensure that youth crime is prevented and second, to look for at-risk children and try to form a net of services to keep these children from getting into trouble. However, once a young person steps over the line and commits a crime, part of the reciprocity involves the youth making the community whole through restitution and community service.  I was pleased to work with Senators Domenici and Ashcroft to include some of these Oregon ideas into this bill. In particular, I think that the second tier of incentive grants will help encourage States to come up with ways to integrate the community into the juvenile justice process. In particular, the bill promotes consideration for victims and restitution for all crimes. It will also ensure that this restitution is collected. The legislation encourages States to look at mentorship programs, parent accountability, and ways to bring together service providers to form a network of information sharing to prevent juvenile crime.  One of the key aspects of the Deschutes County model that is so impressive is the coordination between schools, juvenile justice services, child protection services, police, district attorneys, judges, and others. Not only does this build a broad base of support for the juvenile justice system, but it allows these agencies to identify the most at-risk youth early, to see whether efforts to divert them from delinquency are effective and to concentrate resources on them.  When I began working on this issue in 1995, I laid out three principles for a new juvenile justice system: community protection, accountability, and restitution. We need to keep our streets safe, punish criminals, and make sure victims--including the community itself--are repaid. This legislation will encourage States to develop systems based on these principles and to add to the the important ingredient of community involvement in the juvenile justice system.  I thank the Senators from Missouri and New Mexico for their bipartisan effort to develop juvenile justice legislation that takes a balanced approach to juvenile justice.                                 ______                                       By
