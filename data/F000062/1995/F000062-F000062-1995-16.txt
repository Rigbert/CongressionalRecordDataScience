 President, I offer my strong support for the Victim Rights and Domestic Violence Prevention Act, which I am pleased to co-sponsor with Senators Kyl and Dewine. I also want to commend my colleague from Arizona the cooperative spirit he has shown in working with me on this and other efforts to help crime victims, and for addressing this important issue which is now so prominently, and tragically, in the news.  Nearly every American knows the plight of Nicole Brown Simpson. Who among us hasn't read of, or heard of, or discussed the tragic circumstances of her case?  But, Mr. President, what about the thousands of women who suffer the terrible physical and emotional effects of domestic violence in silent anonymity every day all across the Nation? And, what about the women who do stand up to domestic abusers and seek refuge from them from a justice system that seemingly doesn't care?  It is for those women that I rise today to offer my strong support for this much needed bill.  Last year, Congress acknowledged that action must be taken to stop domestic violence when it passed the Violence Against Women Act as part of the President's crime bill.  The Violence Against Women Act is designed to, among other things, provide funding for: Local programs for victims' services; battered women's shelters; rape education and community prevention programs; a national family violence hotline; and increased security in public places.  I strongly believe that this landmark legislation will go a long way toward reducing domestic abuse and helping its victims recover from their ordeals.  Today, we continue the work begun by the Violence Against Women Act.  Much more needs to be done to protect the rights of the victims of domestic and sexual violence and to stop these heinous crimes.  Let us not underestimate the magnitude of this problem: According to the National Coalition of Physicians Against Family Violence, domestic violence strikes one in four families in the United States; the FBI has reported that a women is beaten every 18 seconds in the United States; and the Senate Judiciary Committee reported in 1992 that three to four million women are battered each year.  In my own State, the attorney general has reported that there were 251,233 domestic violence-related calls for assistance from law enforcement last year. Of those cases, 155,944 calls involved a perpetrator attacking his victim with a personal weapon--such as his hands or feet.  According to the FBI, a women is raped every five minutes in this country; in 1994 alone, there were 102,296 rape or attempted rape cases reported to law enforcement; and in California, there were 10,960 cases of forcible rape that year.  Domestic violence touches too many woman. It must be stopped by making the court system more user-friendly to the victims of this crime, and those who inflict it must be more severely punished. This bill accomplishes those two important goals.                      equal protection for victims  This bill will make the court system more user-friendly in several ways:  First, it protects the right of victims to an impartial jury by equalizing the number of peremptory challenges afforded to the defense and the prosecution in jury selection.  Second, this bill provides that if a defendant in a criminal case presents negative evidence about the victim's character, the victim's defense lawyer can present character evidence concerning the defendant. Mr. President, too many women who take their abusers to court must suffer the double indignity of having their own characters attacked. It's time to level the playing field.  Third, it extends the right of victims to address the court concerning the sentence to all criminal cases.  Fourth, the bill establishes higher standards of professional conduct for lawyers in Federal cases to protect victims and other witnesses from abuse, and to promote the effective search for the truth. It does this by requiring hat lawyers in Federal cases: not engage in conduct for the purpose of increasing litigation expenses; not engage in conduct designed just to harass another person; not offer false evidence, or discredit true evidence; elicit a full account of the events from the lawyer's client; not necessarily delay litigation; must disclose information that the client intends to commit a crime of violence; and may disclose information that the client intends to commit other crimes.  Fifth, it removes the restriction that limits use of notices that violent Federal offenders will be released to law enforcement purposes. This will allow victims to be informed when their assailant is back in the community.  Finally, the bill requires that prosecutors have the same level of representation on committees that make court rules as defense attorneys do. This will ensure that fair, balanced rules are enacted, which do not favor criminals over prosecutors.                           domestic violence  I also strongly believe that swift, sure action must be taken to stop domestic violence, and that penalties must be increased for those who commit this heinous crime.  This bill includes a provision to authorize capital punishment, under Federal interstate domestic violence offenses, for cases in which the offender murders the victim.  That's tough punishment for perpetrators who think domestic violence is something that goes on behind closed doors, where it's OK for them to beat their wives, or girlfriends, or mothers or sisters because it's their prerogative. Well, Mr. President, domestic violence is no one's prerogative and this bill provides tough punishment for criminals who deserve it.  This bill also makes two changes in the rules of evidence, to help victims of domestic violence. First, it allows evidence of the defendant's past crimes or wrongful acts against the victim to be introduced, to establish a pattern of abuse.  Second, it allows evidence of battered women's syndrome to be introduced, to show why some women are driven to retaliate against their abusers.  Finally, the bill fights those who transmit HIV in sexual assaults, by requiring that: sentences be toughened if the offender knew he was infected; upon request of the victim, the offender must be tested for HIV before he is released; and follow-up testing be done on sexual assailants.                               conclusion  Mr. President, right now too many women fear for their safety and too many women suffer physically and emotionally from domestic violence. We can do something about it. I urge my colleagues to support the Victim Rights and Domestic Violence Prevention Act of 1995.                          ____________________
