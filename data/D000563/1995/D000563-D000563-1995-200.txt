Chairman, if the gentleman will yield under his reservation, I say to my friend and colleague from New Mexico, the difference here is that the Hall amendment has been printed in the Record and has been subject to review.  The Goodling amendment, I am sure offered in good faith, was first brought to us just a few minutes ago, and we have not had a chance and really need an opportunity to discuss it, I think, on the floor so that we understand it and its impact on the proposal by the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Hall].
