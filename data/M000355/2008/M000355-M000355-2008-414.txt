 President, I wish to commend the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee for his comments, which I first watched from my office and then came to the floor.  I can recall, and I believe the Senator from Pennsylvania mentioned this, the Berzon and Paez nominations at the end of the Clinton administration, where there was a lot of discontent on the Republican side of the aisle--strong feeling that these nominees were ideologically unacceptable. I remember then-majority leader in the Senate, Senator Lott, saying: We don't want to set the precedent that the ideological leanings of these nominees will deny them an up-or-down vote.  I, similar to Senator Specter and Senator Lott, voted for cloture on those nominations, not to kill them but to move them forward. It was a very important decision on the part of then-Majority Leader Lott to prevent, to the maximum extent possible, the kind of meltdown that seems to have occurred in this Congress to which Senator Specter was referring.  At the beginning of this Congress, the majority leader, Senator Reid, and I discussed the need for the Senate to have a fair, less-contentious confirmation process. To his credit, I think that is his view and his goal. We have made some progress on circuit court nominations last year. We didn't match President Clinton's number from the first session of his last Congress, but we came close. Now, we had one notable bump along the way and Senator Specter referred to that and that was the nomination of Judge Leslie Southwick. But we were able to get him through, thanks to, as Senator Specter pointed out, the courageous decision on the part of particularly one Senator on the other side. It was good for the institution that we did that.  Unfortunately, the prospect of turning the page on judicial nominations, a goal which I think all but the hardiest partisans share, has taken a wrong turn. Despite the best efforts of Senator Specter and others, progress has all but ground to a halt.
