I thank my good friend, Mrs. Foxx for yielding and thank her for her extraordinary Pro-life leadership.  Madam Speaker, in an unconscionable abuse of power, for almost 2 years, the State of California has forced all insurance plans under its purview and the people in institutions that pay the premiums--to subsidize abortion on demand. Numerous faith-based entities filed complaints pursuant to law with the HHS Office for Civil Rights seeking, and fully expecting, relief.  Effective June 21, however, the Obama administration flatly refused to enforce U.S. law--current law--protecting the civil right of conscience. Cardinal Timothy Dolan said, ``It is shocking that HHS has allowed the State of California to force all employers--even churches--to fund and facilitate elective abortions in their health insurance plans.''  I would note parenthetically to my colleagues, this isn't about ObamaCare and the massive taxpayer funding for abortion embedded--according to GAO's analysis--in over 1,000 insurance plans on the exchanges, which was contrary to what the President had promised right here in this Chamber, 30 feet away from me, in a joint session of Congress in 2009. No. This is about private health insurance plans of Catholic dioceses, religious schools, and others who have been ordered to violate their deeply held convictions and pay for the killing of unborn children by hideous dismemberment procedures, toxic compounds, or chemical poisoning.  The Weldon Federal conscience clause, authored by Congressman Dave Weldon of Florida and continuously in effect for well over a decade, is explicit and comprehensive, but it is not being enforced by the Obama Administration.  The Weldon amendment says, in pertinent part, that it is illegal for any ``discrimination'' against a healthcare entity ``on the basis that the healthcare entity does not provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions.'' The law's definition of healthcare entity explicitly includes ``a health insurance plan.''  Despite the absolute clarity of the Weldon language, injured parties, including the Catholic church, have been denied relief.  The Obama Administration's refusal to enforce the civil right of conscience is not only unfair and unjustified, it violates the rule of law, makes a mockery of the President's 2009 Notre Dame speech, mentioned by my colleague from Missouri, when Obama said: ``Let's honor the conscience of those who disagree with abortion.'' Mr. Obama's words don't match his deeds and he is not honoring the civil rights of conscience.  The Conscience Protection Act of 2016, authored by Congresswoman Diane Black, seeks to end discrimination against people, plans, and providers for refusing to be involved in the killing of unborn children. The bill says that the Federal Government or any State or local government that receives Federal assistance may not penalize, retaliate against, or otherwise discriminate against those who refuse to perform, refer for, pay for, or otherwise participate in abortion.                              {time}  1315  The linchpin of this legislation, of the Conscience Protection Act, protects people, insurance plans, and other entities from being forced to participate by providing a private right of action.  The HHS Office for Civil Rights has failed miserably. In this country, we need a remedy that is durable and that will provide the protection that people are demanding, especially today in California, but really the entire country.  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Let's be honest with one another. What this is all about here is that some of my friends on the other side believe that abortion should be illegal all across the country, that no woman should have the right to abortion services. They are upset with the Supreme Court decision of Roe v. Wade, and they are frustrated that they can't find a way around it. This is what this is about: trying to deny women access to these kinds of services through maneuvers that are in this bill.  It is absolutely true that what this legislation does is to leave in the hands of her boss the decision about whether or not a woman can have an abortion or not. That is what this does. I want to be clear about one thing so my colleagues understand this. No taxpayer money--that is the law--can be used to subsidize abortion. That is the law of the land: no taxpayer money.  What this does is allow an employer who doesn't agree that abortion should be legal the ability to provide health insurance that doesn't cover it. So, if you are a low-income woman, you are out of luck. You could try to pay for the services out-of-pocket that are affiliated with having an abortion, which is almost impossible, and there could be complications.  It is crazy that we are here, debating a bill like this that would basically remove a woman out of this equation. We have better things to do on this House floor than this bill.  Let's also be clear in that the reason we are doing it now is that the Republican National Convention is next week, and my colleagues are desperate to appeal to the hard-liners in their base. That is what this is all about. This will never become law, and we shouldn't be doing this on the floor.  I reserve the balance of my time.
