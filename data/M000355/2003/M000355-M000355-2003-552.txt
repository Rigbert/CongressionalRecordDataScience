 President, I listened with great interest to the majority leader's comments about Bob Hope. I remember the morning after he died his daughter was interviewed. She said as the children were coming in and saying goodbye to him, one of them asked, Dad, where do you want to be buried? He said, ``Surprise me.''  He had a one-liner right to the end.                          ____________________
