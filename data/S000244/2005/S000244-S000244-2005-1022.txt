Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I strongly oppose this resolution because it does not state what the facts are relative to the Judiciary Committee's consideration of the PATRIOT Act. I rise today to respond to false, misleading, and malicious allegations that have been made by Members of this House and reported in the media concerning the conduct of the Judiciary Committee's June 10 hearing on the reauthorization of the USA PATRIOT Act and my consideration of the PATRIOT Act as chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary.  Since becoming chairman of this committee in January 2001, I have consistently demonstrated a commitment to fair and equitable consideration of issues before the committee. Perhaps no other issue better demonstrates this commitment than the committee's response to the tragic events of September 11, 2001. Shortly following the attacks, I called a committee hearing to draft antiterrorism legislation at which the Attorney General and other top officials of the Justice Department testified. At that meeting, I pledged to work with the minority to draft bipartisan legislation to help detect, deter, and defeat terrorist threats to our Nation's security.  Since that time, the record clearly demonstrates that I have kept my word by conducting bipartisan and evenhanded consideration of this critical issue.  In October of 2001, the committee unanimously approved the PATRIOT Act by a vote of 36-0. I was enormously proud of this vote because it proved that a committee comprising sharply diverging viewpoints could speak in a clear and united voice on an issue of overwhelming importance to the security, safety, and liberty of all Americans. When drafting this legislation, I also insisted that provisions expanding the scope of Federal authority be subject to congressional reauthorization. I included sunsets in these provisions because I strongly believe that Congress must play an active and continuing role in ensuring that the PATRIOT Act protects the safety and security of all Americans while preserving the freedom and liberty that distinguish us as Americans.  To ensure that the PATRIOT Act is being implemented in a manner that reflects the priorities of Congress, on multiple occasions Ranking Member Conyers and I have sent detailed, extensive, and bipartisan inquiries to the Department of Justice concerning the implementation of the legislation.                              {time}  2115  When the Justice Department did not fully respond to one set of detailed inquiries, I forcefully asserted the committee's prerogatives by raising the possibility of a committee subpoena to obtain the requested information.  The committee has conducted several hearings on matters related to the PATRIOT Act, at which senior administration officials have testified. At my request committee members have also received briefings on the implementation of the PATRIOT Act from senior law enforcement officials.  On March 28 of this year, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers), ranking member, and I jointly announced a series of hearings on the reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act. We made this announcement in the same spirit of bipartisanship that has typified the committee's consideration of this issue since the committee's first hearing on this subject following September 11. While the primary focus of this series of hearings has been to examine provisions in the PATRIOT Act that are set to expire at the end of this year, the scope of these hearings has been broadened to include provisions of the PATRIOT Act that will not sunset, and issues that are only tangentially related to PATRIOT Act have also received formal committee consideration at the request of the minority.  The record clearly proves that I have worked in a bipartisan manner to ensure that the committee has received testimony from an array of knowledgeable witnesses of diverging viewpoints, and that members had the opportunity to address questions to each of them. And at this time I include in the Record a listing of the oversight activities and a chronology of the hearing record that has been held since April before the Committee on the Judiciary and its subcommittees. OVERSIGHT: House Judiciary Committee Oversight of the USA PATRIOT Act         oversight through letters to the department of justice       House Judiciary Committee sent the Attorney General, John      Ashcroft, a letter on June 13, 2002, with 50 detailed      questions on the implementation of the USA PATRIOT Act. The      questions were a result of extensive consultation between the      majority and minority Committee counsel. Assistant Attorney      General, Daniel Bryant, responded to Chairman Sensenbrenner      and Ranking Member Mr. Conyers on July 26, 2002, providing      lengthy responses to 28 out of the 50 questions submitted. On      August 26, 2002, Mr. Bryant sent the responses to the      remaining questions, after sending responses to six of the      questions to the House Permanent Select Committee on      Intelligence. Then, on September 20, 2002, Mr. Bryant sent      the minority additional information regarding the Department      of Justice's responses to these questions.       On April 11, 2003, Chairman Sensenbrenner and Ranking      Member Mr. Conyers sent a second letter to the Department of      Justice with additional questions regarding the use of pre-     existing authorities and the new authorities conferred by the      USA PATRIOT Act. Once again, the questions were the product      of bipartisan coordination by Committee counsel. Acting      Assistant Attorney General, Jamie E. Brown, responded with a      May 13, 2003 letter that answered the questions she deemed      relevant to the Department of Justice and forwarded the      remaining questions to the appropriate officials at the      Department of Homeland Security on June 13, 2003, the      Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs at the Department      of Homeland Security, Pamela J. Turner, sent responses to the      forwarded questions.       On November 20, 2003, Chairman Sensenbrenner and      Congressman Hostettler, Chairman of the Subcommittee on      Immigration,     Border Security, and Claims, sent a letter to the Comptroller      General of the Government Accountability Office (GAO)      requesting a GAO study of the implementation of the USA      PATRIOT Act anti-money laundering provisions. This report was      released on June 6, 2005.                       oversight through hearings       On May 20, 2003, the Committee's Subcommittee on the      Constitution held an oversight hearing entitled, ``Anti-     Terrorism Investigations and the Fourth Amendment After      September 11th: Where and When Can Government Go to Prevent      Terrorist Attacks.'' On June 5, 2003, the Attorney General      testified before the full Committee on the Judiciary at an      oversight hearing on the United States Department of Justice.      Both the hearing on May 20 and the hearing on June 5      discussed oversight aspects of the USA PATRIOT Act.                       Ovrsight Through Briefings       The Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security      of this Committee requested that officials from the      Department of Justice appear and answer questions regarding      the implementation of the USA PATRIOT Act. In response to our      request, the Department of Justice gave two separate      briefings to Members, counsel, and staff:       During the briefing held on August 7, 2003, Department      officials covered the long-standing authority for law      enforcement to conduct delayed searches and collect business      records, as well as the effect of the USA PATRIOT Act on      those authorities.       During the second briefing, held on February 3, 2004, the      Department of Justice discussed its views of S. 1709, the      ``Security and Freedom Ensured (SAFE) Act of 2003'' and H.R.      3352, the House companion bill, as both bills proposed      changes to the USA PATRIOT Act.       The Department of Justice has also provided three      classified briefings on the use of the Foreign Intelligence      Surveillance Act (FISA) under the USA PATRIOT Act for Members      of the Judiciary Committee:       On June 10, 2003, October 29, 2003, and June 7, 2005 the      Justice Department provided these briefings.       The Department also provided a law enforcement sensitive      briefing on FISA to the House Judiciary Committee Members and      staff on March 22, 2005.HEARING CHRONOLOGY: House Judiciary Committee Consideration of the USA                               PATRIOT ACT                      Full Committee Consideration       June 10, 2005: Oversight Hearing on the Reauthorization of      the USA PATRIOT Act: Carlina Tapia-Ruano, First Vice-     President of the American Immigration Lawyers Association      (Minority witness); Dr. James J.

Mr. Speaker, by scheduling 12 hearings on the reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act during this Congress, in addition to the bipartisan record established in previous Congresses, I have proven my commitment to conducting rigorous and comprehensive oversight of the implementation of the PATRIOT Act. Since commencing this latest series of hearings in April, two top officials at the Justice Department, Attorney General Gonzales and his Deputy James Comey, have testified before the committee on separate occasions. In each of the nine additional recent hearings held on the subject, the minority was allowed to designate at least one and sometimes two of the customary four witnesses at committee hearings, thus providing a consistent platform for additional and often dissenting views.  The record clearly demonstrates that this committee has engaged in a thorough, comprehensive, and bipartisan review of the PATRIOT Act since its passage. Assertions to the contrary are not only unfounded, they are plainly false, misleading, and malicious.  On June 8, 2005, the committee held a hearing on the ``Reauthorization of thePATRIOT Act,'' at which Deputy Attorney General Comey testified. At the commencement of this hearing and without previous notice or consultation, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers), ranking member, and other minority members of the committee requested additional witnesses to testify before the committee on the ``Reauthorization of USA PATRIOT Act'' pursuant to House Rules.  House Rule XI(2)(j)(1) states: ``Whenever a hearing is conducted by a committee on a measure or matter, the minority members of the committee shall be entitled, upon request to the chairman by a majority of them before the completion of the hearing, to call witnesses selected by the minority to testify with respect to that measure or matter during at least 1 day of hearing thereon.'' I complied with that request and set the additional hearing on June 10.  At the outset of this hearing, I reminded members and witnesses of the permissible scope of the hearing requested by the minority under House Rule XI by stating: ``It is the Chair's intention to limit the scope of the hearing to the topic that was chosen by the Democratic minority that called this hearing and chose the witnesses, which is the reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act. Members and witnesses are advised that questions and testimony not falling within the subject matter of the hearing chosen by the Democrats will not be included in the hearing record pursuant to House Rule XI.'' After reviewing the testimony of the witnesses, I again expressed my concern stating that, ``I am disturbed that some of the testimony that has been presented in written form by the witnesses today are far outside the scope of the hearing, which the Democratic minority called and which they set in their letter.''  Notwithstanding repeated reminders and admonitions concerning the permissible scope of the hearing under House Rules, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers), ranking member, and members of the minority invited witnesses to provide testimony and make statements clearly outside of the scope of the reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act.  For example, in his opening remarks, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) stated: ``For many of us, this process of hearings is not merely about the extension of the 16 expiring provisions of the PATRIOT Act. It is about the manner in which our government uses its legal authority to prosecute the war against terror both domestically and abroad. As we hear from our witnesses today, I think we will demonstrate that much of this authority has been abused.''  My repeated reminders and admonitions about House Rules concerning the permissible scope of the hearing were ignored by witnesses and members of the committee.  In the face of this refusal by the witnesses and members to appropriately conform their testimony to the subject matter of the hearing requested by the minority, I exercised great patience in permitting witnesses and members to weigh in on issues totally unrelated to that subject. I recognized all four witnesses as well as each majority and minority member present at the hearing for 5 minutes. The record clearly shows that I evinced no favoritism in providing time either to witnesses or members.  At the conclusion of the hearing, when each witness and member had been provided equal time to raise questions, and the witnesses asked and received permission to submit their complete testimony into the hearing record, I expressed my great disappointment that opponents of the PATRIOT Act have used it as a vehicle to assert broad, sweeping, and sometimes wildly unsubstantiated allegations concerning matters totally unrelated to the legislation.  As I concluded my remarks, at least two minority members who had been accorded their time to speak again sought recognition, and I adjourned the hearing in a manner inconsistent with the spirit of comity that has and should continue to inform committee deliberations. While I concede this point without qualifications, Members should also be aware that the practice of the Democratic chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary under whom I have served, as well as the practice of the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers), ranking member, during his chairmanship of the Committee on Government Operations, was to adjourn hearings without motion and without expressly seeking the unanimous consent of committee members.  Since this hearing I have been unfairly criticized by several Members of this body. In a press release dated June 10, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), minority leader, said, ``Chairman Sensenbrenner proved again today that he is afraid of ideas, that Republicans will stop at nothing to silence Democrats and the voice of the minority, to deny millions of Americans a voice in Congress. Republicans are unwilling and unable to compete in the marketplace of ideas; so they have chosen to arbitrarily and capriciously abuse their power simply because they can.''  In a similar statement, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), minority whip, stated that the committee's June 10 hearing represented a ``quintessential example of shutting up, shutting down opposition, dissenting views, and democracy.''  Both these statements are a grossly unfair and distorted depiction of my conduct and demand correction. I am not afraid of diverse ideas. I welcome that, and the chronology of the hearing record shows that. I have never attempted to stifle democracy, and I never will.  This committee's bipartisan consideration of the PATRIOT Act under my leadership underscores the malice that motivates these accusations. There is a difference between spirited debate and partisan vitriol that transgresses the bounds of decency and maligns the integrity of a Member of this House.  Following the hearing, the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), who is the newest member of the committee, issued a press release stating that I had acted in an illegal manner under headlines stating: ``Democracy Thwarted at Judiciary Committee Hearing on the PATRIOT Act.'' In the course of this hearing, I did nothing that remotely resembles conduct that can be described as illegal. And as chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, I take particular umbrage at this mischaracterization.  The gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler) has also contended that I chaired the hearing in a manner that was ``with an attitude of total hostility.'' Based on these remarks, it has been inaccurately reported that I ``abruptly pulled the plug . . . when a hearing on the PATRIOT Act turned to prisoners and anti-immigration militia on the Mexican border.'' These statements are clearly false. I permitted each witness an opportunity to complete his or her oral remarks, and the hearing was only concluded after 2 hours' duration only when each member had been provided an equal opportunity to speak.  Following the hearing, I have met with the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers), ranking member, to discuss ways in which the committee could respond to concerns expressed by some members of the minority, and we reached a resolution that might have averted this impasse. However, some in the minority have preferred a political issue to a workable solution. I trust that by fully and fairly examining the record of the June 10 hearing, as well as my demonstrated longstanding record of bipartisan consideration of matters relating to the PATRIOT Act and other matters before the committee, Members of this House and the public at large will reject the false, malevolent, and derogatory allegations leveled against me by certain minority Members of this body.  Mr. Speaker, the American people expect and deserve Members of Congress to approach terrorism prevention in a thoughtful, factual, and responsible manner. All too often opponents of the PATRIOT Act have constructed unfounded and totally unrelated conspiracy theories, erected strawmen that bear no relation to reality, engaged in irresponsible and totally unfounded hyperbole, or unjustly impugned the law enforcement officials entrusted with protecting the security of America's citizens. While the PATRIOT Act was drafted and passed by both Houses with wide bipartisan majorities, it has been transformed by some into a political weapon of choice to allege a broad range of violations which have nothing to do with thatlegislation. These efforts coarsen public debate and undermine the responsible, substantive examination that must inform congressional and public consideration of this critical issue.  I will not be deterred by malicious attacks or minority obstructionism. In the coming months I will continue to energetically discharge my responsibilities as chairman to ensure thorough, bipartisan, and thoughtful consideration of issues relating to the PATRIOT Act and other legislation before the committee. This House and the American people who elect us to represent them expect and deserve no less.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
