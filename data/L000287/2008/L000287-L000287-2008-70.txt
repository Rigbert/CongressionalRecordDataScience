Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Madam Speaker, Tim Russert personified the best of America. He rose to the top of American journalism. He worked for a Governor, a United States Senator, and received a very good education, but he never ever lost the common touch. He never strayed from his Buffalo roots. He loved to talk about Buffalo. He knew that I had many relatives living in Buffalo.  On the ``Today Show,'' his son, Luke, called his father ``the questioner for the American people.'' He had a high calling, a mission, a mandate, to ask politicians and public officials the questions most Americans could not.  When we mourn for Tim Russert, we mourn for his wife, his son, and his father, ``Big Russ.'' We mourn for his colleagues at NBC and the community of journalists, but we also mourn for ourselves at a turning point in the history of our Nation. We mourn for his words, his insight, and his commitment to the people's right to know.  God bless Tim Russert. He will be deeply missed.                              {time}  1730
