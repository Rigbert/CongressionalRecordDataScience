President. There would be no objection to the passage of the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act, which I think the majority of Senators on both sides of the aisle would like to see passed and I think would be critical in the interest of the countries in the Middle East for peace, but also in our own national security interests.  The back to work provision was passed, as the distinguished majority leader knows, with the support of the Democratic leader and all Members on this side of the aisle and on his side by unanimous consent last Saturday. And the other body had decided to take off and, I guess, go home on the Christmas vacation and not take it up. So we would have no objection to that.  The last part is the part I object to, Mr. President, because what we are saying is we will change the Senate rules on the time of debate and all on a bill, which nobody--neither the distinguished majority leader nor myself--knows what is in it. We all know we have the same goal, and both he and I agree to have a balanced budget by 2002. But we do not know what is in it. I do not think I would be able to get consent of many Members to waive, basically, the Senate rules on a piece of legislation that we have not yet seen. But I certainly hope that some type of procedure can be put together, and I assume that at the time when the budget comes up, it will be under some form of expedited procedure.  So I object.
