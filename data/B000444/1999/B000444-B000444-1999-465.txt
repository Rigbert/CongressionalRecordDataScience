 There are no good guys in this sordid affair. Rightly or wrongly, the public has concluded that the President is an adulterer and liar; that Ken Starr has abused his authority by unfair tactics born out of vindictiveness; that the House Managers have acted in a narrowly partisan way and are now desperately attempting to justify their actions for their own political reputation. Finally, they have concluded that Monica Lewinsky was both used and a user, while Linda Tripp, Lucianne Goldberg, Paula Jones and her official and unofficial legal team are part of a larger political plot to ``get the President''.  All of that is beyond our ability to effect. Our job is not to dissect the motives or even the tactics of Ken Starr, the trial lawyers, Linda Tripp, and others. Our only job is to determine whether the President of the United States by his conduct committed the specific acts alleged in the two Articles of Impeachment. Not generally, but specifically: Did he do what is alleged? And if he did, do these actions rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors necessary to justify the most obviously anti-democratic act the Senate can engage in--overturning an election by convicting the President.  It is very important--both for history's sake and for fairness' sake--that we keep our eye on the ball. When I tried cases, I learned from a man named Sid Balick--he used to say at the outset to the jury:       Keep your eye on the ball. The issue is not whether my      client is a man you would want your daughter to date--a man      you would invite home to dinner. The issue is did my client      kill Cock Robbin--period.  But if we listen to the oft-times confusing presentation of the House Managers--they would have us think that it is sufficient for us to conclude that we would not trust him with our daughters and not invite him home for dinner in order to convict.  Much more is required. The House set the standard we must repair to in the Articles--did he commit a criminal offense? That is what they allege; that is what they must prove.  The Managers keep saying that this case is about what standards we want our President to meet. We hear Flanders Fields intoned--the honor of our most decorated heroes. How incredibly self-serving and autocratic such a plea is.  The American people are fully capable--without our guidance or advice--to determine what standards they want our President to meet. That is an appropriate question to ask ourselves when we enter the voting booth to vote--it is not when we rise on this floor to vote.  Spare me from those who would tell the American people what standard they must apply when voting for President. Ours is an Impeachment standard and our oath to do justice under that standard.  Impeachment is about what standard to use in deciding whether or not to remove a President duly elected by the people.  These are two very different questions and we must not, we cannot, get them confused. You and I and the American people can apply any standard we want our President to meet when we go to the polls on election day.  Only the Constitution can supply the standards to use in deciding whether or not to remove the President--and--in my view, this case does not meet that standard, for two reasons.  First, the facts do not sustain the House Managers' case. According to the House's own theory, we must find that the President has violated federal criminal statutes--not just that he did bad things. In all good conscience, I just cannot believe that any jury would convict the President of any of the criminal charges on these facts. I also believe that it is our constitutional duty to give the President the benefit of the doubt on the facts. To me, the allegations that the President violated Title 18 were left in a shambles on this floor.  But I do not have time to dwell on the facts. So let me turn to the second reason: the President's actions do not rise to the level required by the Constitution for the removal of a sitting President.  We have heard it argued repeatedly that the Constitution does not create different standards for Judges and the President. But that argument fails to comprehend the organizing principle of our constitutional system--the separation of powers. The framers divided the power of the federal government into three branches in order to safeguard liberty. This innovation--the envy of every nation on earth--can only serve its fundamental purpose if each branch remains strong and independent of the others.  We needed a President who was independent enough to spearhead and sign the Civil Rights Act. We needed a President who was independent enough to lead the nation and the world in the Persian Gulf War. We still need an independent President.  The constitutional scholarship overwhelmingly recognizes that the fundamental structural commitment to separation of powers requires us to view the President as different than a federal judge. Consider our power to discipline and even expel an individual Senator. In such a case, we do not remove the head of a separate branch and so do not threaten the constitutional balance of powers. To remove a President is to decapitate another branch and to undermine the independence necessary for it to fulfill its constitutional role.  Only a President is chosen by the people in a national election. No Senator, no Representative can make this claim. To remove a duly elected President clashes with democratic principles in a way that simply has no constitutional parallel. By contrast, there is nothing anti-democratic in the Senate removing a judge, who was appointed and not elected by the people.  Another contention we continue to hear is that the Framers clearly thought that obstruction of justice of any kind by a President was a high crime and misdemeanor. For this they cite the colloquy between Colonel George Mason and James Madison, who argued that a President who abused his pardon power could be impeached. That colloquy illustrates that it is not any obstruction that would satisfy the Constitution--rather, that the framers were immediately concerned about abuses of official power, such as the pardon power.  The House Managers have relied repeatedly on Alexander Hamilton's explanation of impeachment found in Federalist No. 65. But careful reading demonstrates that these articles of impeachment are a constitutionally insufficient ground for removing the President from office. Federalist No. 65 states:       The subjects of [the impeachment court's] jurisdiction are      those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public      men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some      public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar      propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to      injuries done immediately to the society itself.  Hamilton had the word ``political'' typed in all capital letters to emphasize that this is the central, defining element of any impeachable offense. Having emphasized its meaning, he did not leave its definition to chance. While all crimes by definition harm society, impeachable offenses involve a specific category of offenses. Using Hamilton's terms, these are offenses committed when ``public men'' who ``violat[e] some public trust'' cause ``injuries done immediately to the society itself.'' The public trust that resides in, to use Hamilton's hoary phrase, ``public men'' is what we would call today official power.  What other construction can be given these words? Hamilton did not define an impeachable offense to be any offense committed by public men. He did not define an impeachable offense to be any reprehensible act committed by a bad man. Only those acts that abuse public office and so harm the public directly and politically are impeachable.  While I would like to take credit for this insight into Hamilton's meaning, I actually stand in a line of interpretation that stretches back to the founding era. William Rawle wrote the first distinguished commentary on the Constitution, ``A View of the Constitution of the United States of America.'' In this treatise, he came to precisely the same interpretation I have described. He said, ``The causes of impeachment can only have reference to public character and official duty. . . . In general those which may be committed equally by a private person as a public officer are not the subject of impeachment.''  Joseph Story was not only a long-serving and important Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, he was a preeminent constitutional scholar and author of a treatise that remains an important source for understanding the Constitution's meaning. He too emphasized that ``it is not every offense that by the constitution is . . . impeachable.'' Which offenses did he regard to be impeachable? ``Such kinds of misdeeds . . . as peculiarly injure the commonwealth by the abuse of high offices of trust.'' Justice Story tied the definition of impeachable offenses to the purpose that underlies the separation of powers--safeguarding the liberty of the people against abusive exercise of governmental power. He observed that impeachment ``is not so much designed to punish an offender as to secure the state against gross official misdemeanors.''  There is no question that the Constitution sets the bar for impeachment very high--especially where the President is involved. Federalist 65 bears this out, as do numerous other commentaries.  But Federalist 65 also sounds a warning--again, it is a warning that has been invoked over and over again--that impeachments inevitably risk being hijacked by partisan political forces.  Federalist 65 worried that the ``animosities, partialities, influence, and interest on one side or the other'' would enable partisans to find a way to interpret words such as high crimes and misdemeanors to match the outcome they otherwise wished to reach--not necessarily out of any malevolence, but simply because of the great capacity that we all have to rationalize.  Here the rationalization is pretty easy--the President is a disgrace to the office, I honor and revere the office of the Presidency, so there must be some way to get this man out of that office. Therefore, his actions must rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors.  It is tempting to go down that road --but this is precisely the temptation that the Framers urged us to avoid.  In Federalist 65, Hamilton defended the United States Senate as the only body that could possibly hear a presidential impeachment. ``Where else than in the Senate could have been found a tribunal sufficiently dignified, or sufficiently independent? What other body would be likely to feel confidence enough in its own situation to preserve, unawed and uninfluenced the necessary impartiality between an individual accused and . . . his accusers?''  Hamilton was placing the responsibility to be impartial squarely upon us--a responsibility that has become embodied in the oath we took when the trial began.  Charles Black, the renowned constitutional law professor from Yale, boiled down the attitude that we as Senators must adopt in order to achieve an impartiality and independence sufficient to the responsibilities of impeachment. He said we must act with a ``principled political neutrality.''  That is a tough standard to meet. In the Johnson impeachment, for example, James Blaine originally voted for the impeachment of the President in the House. Years later he admitted his mistake, saying that `the sober reflection of after years has persuaded many who favored Impeachment that it was not justifiable on the charges made,and that its success would have resulted in greater injury to free institutions than Andrew Johnson in his utmost endeavor was able to inflict.''  And in our contemporary situation, former President Ford and our distinguished colleague and former majority leader, Robert Dole, have both urged us not to go down the road to impeachment, but to seek other means to express our displeasure.  Charles Black knew that principled political neutrality was hard to achieve, so he suggested one approach. He suggested that prior to voting, a Senator should ask:       Would I have answered the same question the same way if it      came up with respect to a President towards whom I felt      oppositely from the way I feel toward the President      threatened with removal?  In reaching a final decision, the question I wish to pose to my colleagues is this: Can you legitimately conclude that you would vote to remove a sitting President if he were a person towards whom you felt oppositely than you do toward Bill Clinton?  Given the essentially anti-democratic nature of impeachment and the great dangers inherent in the too ready exercise of that power, impeachment has no place in our system of constitutional democracy except as an extreme measure--reserved for breaches of the public trust by a President who so violates his official duties, misuses his official powers or places our system of government at such risk that our constitutional government is put in immediate danger by his continuing to serve out the term to which the people of the United States elected him.  In my judgment, trying to assume a perspective of principled political neutrality, the case before us falls far, far short on the facts and on the law.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of a more comprehensive statement be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:   Senator Joseph R. Biden's Comprehensive Statement On Impeachment                              Deliberations       There are no good guys in this sordid affair. Rightly or      wrongly, the public has concluded that the President is an      adulterer and liar. Ken Starr has abused his authority by      unfair tactics born out of vindictiveness. The House Managers      have acted in a narrowly partisan way and are now desperately      attempting to justify their actions for their own political      reputation and that Monica Lewinsky was both used and a user,      while Linda Tripp, Lucianne Goldberg, Paula Jones and her      official and unofficial legal team are part of a larger      political plot to ``get the President''.       At this point, all that occurred before this is beyond my      ability to affect. My job as a United States Senator hearing      an impeachment trial is not to dissect the motives or even      the tactics of Ken Starr, the trial lawyers, Linda Tripp and      others. My only job is to determine whether the President of      the United States, by his conduct committed the acts alleged      in the two Articles of Impeachment before us. Not generally,      but specifically, did he do what is alleged--and if he did,      do these actions rise to the level of high crimes and      misdemeanors necessary to justify the most obviously anti-     democratic act the Senate can engage in overturning an      election.                      The Articles of Impeachment       When the Framers designed our elected branches of      government, they established a system of separate but equal      branches. The independence of the President from the      Congress, and vice versa, is constitutionally anchored in the      fact that each answers directly to the people through the      ballot box. The people determine who will serve in either      branch.       As I said in a speech last September at Syracuse Law School      and in another on the floor of the United State Senate, the      independence of the President from the Congress was no minor      detail in the constitutional design. The single major goal      and idea that best explains how the Framers constructed the      office of the Presidency was to make the presidency as      politically independent of the Congress as they could. They      believed his independence vital to the protection of our      liberties.       It takes a strong and independent President to sign the      Emancipation Proclamation in the face of congressional      opposition, as Abraham Lincoln did. It takes a strong and      independent President to sign the executive order integrating      the Armed Services in the face of congressional resistance,      as Harry Truman did. It takes a strong and independent      president to veto legislation in the face of strong      majorities, as Ronald Reagan, George Bush and all of our      Presidents have done.       We can, and we do, disagree about the wisdom of any      particular presidential decision, but none of us can doubt      that the institution of a strong and independent presidency      has enhanced our freedoms and made us a stronger nation.       For us to remove a duly elected president will unavoidably      harm our constitutional structure.       Accordingly, for this Senator, the starting point in my      thinking about the articles of impeachment must begin with      giving the President the benefit of the doubt, and to err on      the side of sustaining the independence of that office so      vital to the Framers and to the constitutional system they      designed. Impeachment must be used against a President only      as an extreme measure, when the President has so breached the      public trust that our system of government is put in danger      by his continuing to serve out the term to which the people      of the United States elected him.       Have the House Managers presented a case of sufficient      severity, and have they proved it with sufficient clarity, to      justify the drastic and awesome, step of convicting a duly      elected President?       On January 12, when the House Managers walked across the      rotunda to the Senate and presented their case against the      President, the country moved from the realm of sound bites      and political attacks to a serious and sober consideration of      the precise nature of the House's allegations against the      President, and of the full extent of the record evidence      against him.       The House Managers have told us that in their judgment two      dangers to our system of government justify taking this      unprecedented and awesome step.       First, they said that failing to remove the President will      undermine the rule of law and the administration of justice.      Permitting a serial perjurer and obstructor of justice to      escape punishment will bring disgrace on the oath ``to tell      the truth.'' It will mean that we can no longer with good      conscience punish other people who have committed perjury or      obstructed justice. The ultimate effects would be felt      throughout the judicial system. Like a pebble dropped into a      pond, they said, it will send out ripples to all corners of      our judicial system.       Second, they said that failing to remove the President will      also condone his plot or scheme to deny a specific civil      rights plaintiff--Paula Jones--of a full opportunity to      litigate her civil rights claims against the President.      Regardless of the ripple effects of his actions, the acts      themselves were violations of law that amounted to a failure      of the President to ``take care that the laws be faithfully      executed,'' in violation of his oath of office.           Multiple Violations of the Criminal Law Necessary       As I have said in earlier speeches on the impeachment      power, not all crimes are impeachable, and an impeachable      offense does not have to be a crime.       In this case, however, the House Managers have made it      quite clear that their case against the President depends      entirely on proving that he has committed crimes, and not      just a few crimes, but an elaborate scheme that included      ``lots and lots of perjury'' and ``many obstructions of      justice,'' to quote Mr. McCollum. The dangers the President      supposedly poses flow not from the President's reprehensible      conduct, or from the fact that he misled his family, his      aides, his cabinet and the nation about that conduct. This      impeachment is not about sex, they have insisted.       I asked Mr. Barr about this during the trial, and he said      ``What brings us here . . . is the belief by the House of      Representatives in lawful public vote that this President      violated, in numerous respects, his oath of office and the      Criminal Code of the United States of America--in particular,      that he committed perjury and obstruction of justice.'' Mr.      McCollum made the same point in his opening presentation,      when he said, ``The first thing you have to determine is      whether or not the president committed crimes. It's only if      you determine he committed the crimes of perjury, obstruction      of justice and witness tampering, that you ever move on to      the question of whether he is removed from office. . . . None      of us would argue to you that the president should be removed      from office unless you conclude he committed the crimes that      he is alleged to have committed.''           The Burden of Proof in Assessing the House's Case       So the question before the Senate is whether the President      is a serial perjurer and a massive obstructor of justice.       What standard of proof should a Senator apply in deciding      whether the record supports the accusations contained in the      articles of impeachment--the accusations that the President      violated the federal criminal law? The House Managers quite      correctly pointed out that the Senate has never sought to      determine for the entire body what the burden of proof should      be in an impeachment. In effect, we have left it to the good      judgment of each Senator to decide whether or not they are      convinced by the evidence presented to us.       For this Senator, fundamental fairness as well as the      nature of the House's case dictate that I ought to be      convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the President      violated the laws that the House alleges. Proof beyond a      reasonable doubt is the same standard applied in criminal      cases--it is the standard that would apply if the President      were     tried in a criminal court for perjury or obstruction of      justice.       It seems to me that fundamental fairness counsels that I      apply the same standard as a criminal court precisely because      the House asserts that what makes his actions impeachable is      that he has violated federal criminal statutes regarding      perjury and obstruction of justice. It strikes me as absurd      that the Senate would have the arrogance to throw out a duly      elected President on these grounds unless it was convinced      that he would be convicted of those charges. Otherwise, we      would be saying in effect that even though the President      would not be convicted on these crimes, we are nevertheless      throwing him out of office because he committed those crimes.      That would clearly be giving the President less protection      than we provide any other citizen when charged with a crime.       Someone else can try to explain the logic of that decision,      but not me.       In addition, the standard of proof beyond a reasonable      doubt seems to me compelled by the fact that in the House's      explanation of the harm to our system of government if the      President is not thrown out, their entire explanation rises      and falls depending upon whether or not the President would      be convicted in a court of law for the crimes alleged. If he      could not be convicted in a court of law, then the Senate is      not ``condoning'' perjury or obstruction of justice any more      than a criminal court is condoning those crimes when someone      is acquitted on such charges. But if the Senate is not      condoning those crimes, there is no conceivable basis for      concluding that the public will be harmed by the President's      remaining in office.       Furthermore, in applying the standard of proof beyond a      reasonable doubt, the Senate simply must pay attention to the      precise legal definitions of the crimes. What the pundits      have condemned as legal hair splitting, and what the public      rightly condemns in the president's penchant for evasive      answers when responding to questions in a public setting,      must now necessarily occupy our attention with regard to the      President's answers under oath, such as a deposition or a      grand jury proceeding because the claim made by the House is      that the President violated specific criminal laws. If your      aim is to respect the rule of law, you must also respect the      rules of law--the precise legal definitions of the crimes, as      found in 18 U.S.C. Sec.  1623, the federal perjury statute,      and in 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  1503 and 1512, the applicable      federal obstruction of justice statutes.       I have now studied the record sent to us by the House,      listened to the presentations and arguments of the House      Managers and the President's counsel, reviewed the videotape      testimony of Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and Sidney      Blumenthal, and listened to the views of my colleagues.       On that basis, I have reached the conclusion that the House      has not presented evidence that could persuade a criminal      jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the President has      violated the applicable federal criminal statutes. There are      too many holes, too many conclusions reached only by drawing      negative inferences against the President, and too much      evidence that apparently contradicts or is inconsistent with      the House's case.       Now, let me be frank with you. I do not know for sure what      actually occurred. Notwithstanding that, I am forced to make      a judgment. In order to preserve the constitutional      separation of powers, the independence of the presidency and      the sovereignty of democratic elections, the President      deserves the benefit of the doubt. This record falls well      short of the certainty required to remove a President from      office.           the constitutional balance the senate must strike       While I believe that I must apply a standard of proof      beyond a reasonable doubt because of the nature of the      charges that the House has brought to us, it is also quite      true--and I have said as much on prior occasions--that the      Senate does not sit as a court of law when it tries an      impeachment. As Alexander Hamilton stated in Federalist 65,      impeachment is a political process.       ``Political'' in Hamilton's usage had two meanings as it      relates to impeachments. The first I have mentioned already,      and I have spoken about in this chamber before: impeachable      offenses are offenses against the body politic. In the words      of James Wilson, ``in the United States . . . impeachments      are confined to political characters, to political crimes and      misdemeanors, and to political punishments.''       The Senate's judgment in an impeachment trial is ultimately      political in a second sense, too. It is political in the      sense that the Senate has the responsibility to weigh the all      the consequences to the body politic in making its decision--     the consequences that might flow from removing the President      as well as the consequences that might flow from failing to      remove him.       That is what I mean, and what Hamilton meant, by the      ultimate judgment being a political one. As Senator Bumpers      reminded us, the consequences of the decision we make will      live on long after Bill Clinton has left office and long      after each of us has left office. We must hand our      constitutional structure on to our children and to future      generations with its foundation as solid as it was when it      was handed to us. It is our responsibility as Senators to      make a judgment as to how best to accomplish that objective.       The obligation to evaluate the competing costs of retention      and removal, incidentally, is what clearly distinguishes      judicial impeachments and presidential impeachments--very      different institutional and long term consequences weigh in      the balance in these two cases.       Removing the President from office without compelling      evidence would be historically anti-democratic. Never in our      history has the Senate overturned the results of an election      and removed a President from office. History could not more      plainly demonstrate what a dramatic step removing an elected      President would be. The founding of our republic was the most      dramatic assertion of the sovereignty of the people that the      world had ever known. Abraham Lincoln dedicated the      battlefield at Gettysburg to this proposition recalling that      our union stands for ``government of the people, for the      people, and by the people.''       The sovereignty of the people is exercised through national      elections. All citizens, but particularly those of us who      have had the honor to stand for election, have an instinctive      respect for the will of the people as expressed through      national elections. Thomas Jefferson, in his first inaugural      address, aptly called this democratic instinct a ``sacred      principle.'' Reversing the people's sovereign decision would      be in radical conflict with the principle on which our nation      is founded as understood and applied throughout our history.       For one branch to remove the head of a co-equal branch      unavoidably harms our constitutional structure. The framers      intentionally chose not to create a parliamentary system of      government. They meant for the President and Congress to be      independent of and co-equal with one another. Maintaining      each of those branches as strong and independent is      fundamental to the Constitution's very structure--a structure      they designed to safeguard the liberty of the governed      against abuses of power by those who govern.       It is true that impeachment is part of this structure.      Removing a president from office for sufficient reasons and      upon sufficient proof is therefore consistent with that      structure. At the same time, the great dangers inherent in      the too ready exercise of that power mean that impeachment      should be seen as an extreme measure.       The framers were accomplished, practical statesmen. They      recognized that impeachment could be misapplied to undermine      the primary structural guarantee of liberty--the separation      of powers. They worried that Congress would be tempted to use      the impeachment power to make the President ``less equal.''      As Charles Pinckney warned his colleagues at the Philadelphia      Convention, Congress could hold impeachment ``as a rod over      the Executive and by that means effectively destroy his      independence.''       How are we to keep the impeachment power within its      constitutional boundaries, so that it stands ready to be used      appropriately but does not become a ``rod'' in the hands of a      partisan Congress, threatening the independence of the      Presidency, as Charles Pinckney worried during the      Constitutional convention?       The solution to this problem must lie in approaching the      Senate's ultimate decision from as much of a position of      bipartisanship as we can possibly achieve. This is the only      way in which we can possibly focus primarily on the      institutional consequences of our actions to see them in      terms of their long term consequences instead of their short      term partisan ones.       Nonpartisan faithfulness to the Constitution's structure,      which protects the liberty of the governed must determine our      action today.       This was my view of our role in 1974, when I rose on the      floor of the United States Senate and made a ``plea . . . for      restraint on the part of all parties involved in the      affair.'' That was in the case of the possible impeachment of      Richard Nixon. And it was my view last year, when I urged      restraint and bipartisanship as the attitude I hoped my      colleagues would adopt. And it remains my view.       Viewed from that perspective, it is hard for me to see how      the harms flowing from keeping Bill Clinton in office      outweigh the harms to our constitutional democracy that would      result from removing him.                   harmful consequences reconsidered       I have listened attentively to the House Managers' case. In      all honesty, I can sympathize with their sense of outrage at      the President's actions and his unwillingness to be fully      accountable for those actions for so many months.      Notwithstanding that, from the vantage point of a restrained      view, and as nonpartisan a view as I can muster, the dangers      they see from keeping President Clinton in office seem less      dire than they claim. At the same time the harms to our      system of government from removing him seem to me to be quite      serious.       The House Managers warn that failure to remove the      President would destroy or undermine the sound administration      of justice and threaten the rule of law. If true, that would      be a big deal.       But we need to step back a moment and cool down the      rhetoric. Manager Graham suggested as much when he reminded      us all of the resiliency of the American system of      government. ``So when we talk about the consequences of this      case,'' he said, ``no matter what you decide, in my opinion,      this country will survive. If you acquit the President, we      will survive. If you convict him, it will be traumatic, and      if you remove him, it will be traumatic, but we will      survive.''       That same calmer judgment ought to apply to the      administration of justice and the rule of law. The House      Managers presented no evidence whatsoever of the dire      consequences they predict. And there is no evidence of such      dire consequences that they could present--because their      evaluation of the consequences is nothing but speculation.       I would submit to you that the consequences of failing to      remove the President will most likely be very different from      those described by the House. This is one pebble whose      ripples will in all likelihood simply wash up harmlessly on      the shores and be forgotten forever. I, frankly, do not see      how failing to remove the President will alter the conduct of      the next prosecutor having to decide whether to bring a      perjury indictment, nor do I think that juries will be      persuaded by a lawyer's argument that because the President      ``got away with it'' the jury should acquit his client. The      fact of the matter is, lots of perjury trials result in      acquittals without impacting the ability of the criminal      justice system to bring such charges where appropriate.       The House Managers' cry of alarm ignores the fact that we      are in an impeachment trial. This is not a criminal      proceeding and thus the manner in which the Senate deals with      the question has no implications at all for how a court of      law would deal with it.       The Constitution is very clear about this. In Article I,      Sec. 3, cl. 7, the Constitution provides that whether or not      a person is removed from office through impeachment that      party ``shall nevertheless be liable and subject to      Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to      Law.'' If the evidence is as overwhelming as the Managers      say, the President can be prosecuted for perjury and      obstruction after he leaves office.       The American people have a very robust understanding that      impeachment is a political process--and a particularly clear      understanding that this impeachment has been thoroughly      politicized until it got to the Senate--I don't think anyone      is confusing it with a legal process. No one, therefore, will      take any solace from the President's acquittal in terms of      their ability to commit perjury or obstruct justice and      thereby avoid criminal charges.       Now don't misunderstand me--I am not suggesting that      letting a guilty person off from a crime he or she has      committed is OK. I am saying, first, that the President has      not been charged with a crime in a criminal court, so that      failing to acquit him is not at all letting him off from a      crime, and second, that our decision will not have the kind      of ``sky is falling'' consequences described by the House in      any event. In my judgment, the rule of law and the sound      administration of justice in this country will be unaffected      by the action we take in the Senate, one way or the other.       The House Managers have also warned that failing to remove      the President will also condone his plot or scheme to deny a      specific civil rights plaintiff--Paula Jones--her day in      court, by withholding from her, through acts of perjury and      obstruction, full information about the ``nature and      details'' of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Just how      accurate and complete a description is this one? In order to      answer that question, we need a fuller picture of the      ``nature and details'' of the Jones litigation itself.       If you listened just to the House Managers, you would think      that the Jones lawsuit was just a run-of-the-mine typical      sexual harassment civil rights case.       It was not. From the very beginning, that lawsuit had been      politically motivated. All the facts we know about this case,      even taking Paula Jones at her word that the incident in the      Excelsior Hotel actually occurred, demonstrate that the      lawsuit was also without merit. She had never been harmed in      any way in her job, and the President had never repeated      anything remotely resembling an unwanted sexual advance on      her again. She had received merit pay raises in her state      employment and she had received good job performance reviews.      She was unable to prove that she had been damaged in any way      by the President's actions.       Actually, what damages she did assert--what caused her to      file the lawsuit, according to her testimony--was the result      of the publication of a hatchet-job article against President      Clinton run in the American Spectator. The article was one      salvo in an on going right wing probe into Clinton's life in      Arkansas, aimed simply at digging up anything that could be      politically damaging to the President. When the American      Spectator ran a story making an unflattering reference to a      ``Paula,'' Jones found a lawyer to file suit in order to      ``reclaim her good name.''       The lawyers Paula Jones eventually found were also      underwritten by right wing conservative Republican money. In      fact, investigative reporters as recently as this past Sunday      continue to reveal more and more details of the tightly knit      web of conservative lawyers and conservative financial      backers who have hounded this President relentlessly since      the day he took the office.       Now the President knew that the lawsuit was without merit--     he might have behaved obnoxiously with Paula Jones, but he      did not commit sexual harassment. He also knew that the real      motivation of the lawsuit, the motivation that funded it and      kept it going, was a political assault on him, not a legal      assault. The law suit and its powers of discovery were being      used to engage in a fishing expedition throughout Arkansas in      search of political dirt. Leaks from that discovery appeared      regularly in the Washington press.       The President knew something else, as well. He knew that      his illicit relationship with Monica Lewinsky had nothing to      do with the merits of the Jones litigation. On this matter,      you do not have to rely on the President's assessment or      mine, because the court independently concluded the same      thing. In the order denying the plaintiff's discovery into      the Lewinsky facts, Judge Wright said that the Lewinsky      facts, even if the allegations concerning them were true, had      nothing to do with the essential or core elements of Paula      Jones lawsuit.       So keeping Lewinsky out of the politically motivated Jones      case did not jeopardize Paula Jones' chances of prevailing,      which were non-existent in any event. What it did do was to      prevent the president's political enemies from using the      Jones discovery procedures to pry open that secret      relationship and expose it, all to the political damage of      the President.       In this context, it is understandable that the President      wanted to frustrate the Jones litigation. What is more, the      President can hardly be said to have prevented Paula Jones      from presenting a case, because there was no meritorious case      to present.       That doesn't justify perjury or obstruction, of course, but      it does provide an accurate context for appraising the House      Managers' second claim. If they are permitted to convert a      meritless and politically motivated lawsuit into a      presidential conviction for impeachable offenses, the Senate      will be rewarding behavior that we ought to condemn. We need      to think more than once about rewarding this kind of      political witch hunt.       All of what I have just said informs this Senator's      judgment concerning the harms to the country that would be      caused by failing to convict a President who had committed      the acts alleged by the House.       In fact, if the rule of law and the fair administration of      justice will not be destroyed--contrary to the House      Managers' assertions--and if the American people understand      that the President's actions were in the context of a      politically-motivated lawsuit and involved concealing an      embarrassing improper relationship that was irrelevant to      that lawsuit--then it is very hard for this Senator to see      how the President's continuing in office poses the sort of      grave danger to our system of government that the Framers had      in mind when they gave the Congress the awesome power to      impeach and remove an elected President.       In weighing the competing consequences of removal and      retention in office, we must honor the constitutional      obligation we undertook when we swore to do ``impartial      justice.''       To that end, I think we all could benefit from the wisdom      on several participants in the impeachment of Andrew Johnson,      131 years ago.       Two of them--Chief Justice Salmon Chase and Congressman      James G. Blaine--both of whom historians record as being      highly critical of Johnson and initially favoring his      removal--were nevertheless able to step back from the      partisanship of that moment and weigh the competing harms in      the way I have suggested is proper.       Chief Justice Salmon Chase, who himself had political      presidential ambitions, wrote to a friend on the day the      trial ended, saying, ``What possible harm can result in the      country from continuance of Andrew Johnson months longer in      the presidential chair, compared with that which must arise      if impeachment becomes a mere mode of getting rid of an      obnoxious President?''       And years later, James G. Blaine, who had voted for      impeachment in the House, said, ``The sober reflection of      after years has persuaded many who favored Impeachment that      it was not justifiable on the charges made, and that its      success would have resulted in greater injury to free      institutions that Andrew Johnson in his utmost endeavor was      able to inflict.''       And in our contemporary situation, former President Ford      and our distinguished colleague and former majority leader,      Robert Dole, have both urged us not to go down the road to      impeachment, but to seek other means to express our      displeasure.       We ought to follow these lessons, and to be attentive to      the damage that removing a duly elected President on these      charges will inflict on our system of government.       A decision to remove Bill Clinton will not destroy our      system of government. But it will stand as a precedent--the      very first time the United States Senate has removed any      president from office. If we vote to convict and remove the      President after a highly partisan impeachment for conduct      that appears to be private and non-official, we will create      an opportunity for impeachments to become a tool of partisan      politics by other means.                               conclusion       Engaging in the balance that the Constitution requires, I      cannot vote to convict the President. The evidence of proof      beyond a reasonable doubt that the President violated federal      criminal statutes has not been presented. Even were the      evidence stronger, the Constitution demands that we weigh the      competing considerations in a nonpartisan manner.       The President deserves our condemnation. He has brought      shame to himself.       But we have not reached this point due to his failings      alone. It has taken the volatile combination of his      blameworthiness and the unalloyed animosity of others toward      him that have brought us to the brink of a profound      constitutional moment.       Given the essentially anti-democratic nature of impeachment      and the great dangers inherent in the too ready exercise of      that power, impeachment has no place in our system of      constitutional democracy except as an extreme measure--     reserved for breaches of the public trust by a President who      so violates his official duties, misuses his official powers      or places our system of government at such risk that our      constitutional government is put in immediate danger by his      continuing to serve out the term to which the people of the      United States elected him.       I urge my colleagues to remain faithful to the      constitutional design and to our obligation to do impartial      justice.       Below are significant issues of constitutional law,      positive law, or Senate procedure that have arisen during the      impeachment trial of President Clinton. As the impeachment      process moved forward in the House to the point where its      arriving in the Senate appeared likely, I began an intensive      study of the Constitution, the Framers' understanding, and      our historical constitutional practices in the Senate to      prepare for a possible impeachment trial, which I continued      once the Senate assumed jurisdiction over the matter. Over      the past several months, I have shared some of my conclusions      with my colleagues and the public in speeches and memoranda,      portions of which are below. (Bracketed comments are      additions to the original text, inserted to assist in      comprehension.)                             Bipartisanship       Mr. President, during the past twenty-six years as a United      States Senator, I have been confronted with some of the most      significant issues facing our nation. Issues ranging from who      sits on the highest court in the land to whether we should go      to war. These are weighty issues. But none of these decisions      has been more awesome, more daunting, more compelling, than      the issue confronting us at the present time.       The issue of whether to impeach a sitting President is a      monumental responsibility. A responsibility that no Senator      will take lightly.       And as imposing as this undertaking is, I am sad to say      that I have had to contemplate this issue twice during my      service in the Senate; once during President Nixon's term and      now.       And while the circumstances surrounding these two events      are starkly different, the consequences are starkly the same.      The gravity of removing a sitting President from office is      the same today as it was twenty-five years ago. Listen to      what I said on the floor of the United States Senate on April      10, 1974 during the Watergate crisis:       ``In the case of an impeachment trial, the emotions of the      American people would be strummed, as a guitar, with every      newscast and each edition of the daily paper in communities      throughout the country. The incessant demand for news or      rumors of news--whatever its basis of legitimacy--would be      overwhelming. The consequential impact on the federal      institutions of government would be intense--and not      necessarily beneficial. This is why my plea today is for      restraint on the part of all parties involved in the      affair.''       I could have said these same words today. It is uncanny how      much things stay the same.       Furthermore, in 1974 I urged my colleagues in the United      States Senate to learn from the story of Alice in Wonderland.      Then I cautioned that we remember Alice's plight when the      Queen declared ``sentence first, verdict afterwards.''       But the need for restraint is even greater today than it      was in 1974. In 1974, the impeachment question was not as      politically charged as it is today. In 1974 we were willing      to hear all the evidence before making a decision. Today, I      hope, for our nation's sake, that we do not follow the      Queen's directive in Alice in Wonderland and that we will      make a wise judgment after deliberate consideration.       My legal training combined with more than a quarter century      of experience in the United States Senate has taught me      several important lessons. Two of these lessons are      appropriate now.       First, an ordered society must first care about justice.       Second, all that is constitutionally permissible may not be      just or wise.       And it is with these two very important lessons guiding me,      that I embark upon a very important decision regarding our      country, our Constitution, and our President.       The power to overturn and undo a popular election of the      people, for the first time in our nation's history, must be      exercised with great care and sober deliberation.       We should not forget that 47.4 million Americans voted for      our President in 1996, 8.2 million more than voted for the      President's opponent.--[Speech, 10/2/98]                           *   *   *   *   *       Let me now stand back from the issues of substance and      procedure, and look at the impeachment mechanism as it has      actually functioned in our country's history. The proof of      the framers' design, after all, will be in how the mechanism      has worked in practice.       As we have seen, the framers worried that impeaching a      sitting president would most likely be highly charged with      partisan politics and pre-existing factions, enlisting all      the ``animosities, partialities, and influence and interest''      that inevitably swirl around a sitting president. History      shows that they had a right to be worried.       Prior to the case of President Nixon, presidential      impeachment had only been used for partisan reasons.       History tells us that John Tyler was an enormously      unpopular president, facing a hostile Congress dominated by      his arch political enemy, Henry Clay. After several years of      continual clashes, numerous presidential vetoes and divisive      conflicts with the senate over appointments, a select      committee of the House issued a report recommending a formal      impeachment inquiry.       President Tyler reached out to his political enemies: he      signed an important bill raising tariffs which he had      formerly opposed--and he found other means of cooperating      with the Congress. In the end, even Henry Clay, speaking from      the Senate, urged a slowdown in the impeachment proceedings,      suggesting instead the lesser action of a ``want of      confidence'' vote rather than formal impeachment proceedings.      In early 1843, the resolution to proceed with an impeachment      inquiry was defeated on the House floor, 127 to 83.       In 1868, Andrew Johnson came much closer to conviction on      charges of serious misconduct. Although Johnson's impeachment      proceedings ostensibly focused on his disregarding the tenure      in office act, historians uniformly agree that the true      sources of opposition to president Johnson were policy      disagreements and personal animosity. [Text note: The      conflict this time was between Johnson's moderate post Civil      War policies toward the Southern states and the overwhelming      Radical Republican majorities in both chambers. One      especially volatile division was over whether Southern      Senators and Representatives ought to be admitted to Congress      prior to the enactment of Constitutional amendments expressly      denying the right of state succession. The Republicans feared      dilution of their voting strength if the southerners were      seated, especially since on effect of President Lincoln's      Emancipation Proclamation would be to increase House      representation for the Southern states, by virtue of the fact      that each freed slave would count as a whole person, instead      of the abandoned constitutional formula of three-fifths.       The Tenure in Office Act had been enacted over his veto to      restrict his ability to remove the Secretary of War --who was      allied with the Radical Republicans--from that office without      the Senate's consent. Johnson fired Edwin M. Stanton anyway,      claiming that the restriction on his removal authority was      unconstitutional.]       The conflict this time was between Johnson's moderate post-     Civil War policies toward the southern states and the      overwhelming Republican majorities in both chambers. The      Republicans feared dilution of their voting strength if the      southerners were seated.       Johnson's defenders in the Senate were eventually able to      hold on to barely enough votes to prevent his conviction. In      professor Raoul Berger's view, ``Johnson's trial serves as a      frightening reminder that in the hands of a passion-driven      congress, the process may bring down the very pillars of our      constitutional system.''       Yet, if the cases of Tyler and Johnson substantiate the      framers' fears, the Nixon situation vindicates the utility of      the impeachment procedures. Notice how different the Nixon      proceedings were from Tyler's and Johnson's. As the Nixon      impeachment process unfolded, there was broad bipartisan      consensus each step of the way.       While it would be foolish to believe that Members of      Congress did not worry about the partisan political      repercussions of their actions, such factional considerations      did not dominate decision making.       Political friends and foes of the president agreed that the      charges against the president were serious, that they      warranted further inquiry and, once there was definitive      evidence of serious complicity and wrongdoing, a consensus      emerged that impeachment should be invoked. The president      resigned after the House Judiciary Committee voted out      articles of impeachment by a 28-10 vote.       For me, several lessons stand out from our constitutional      understanding of the impeachment process and our historical      experience with it. Furthermore, I believe that a consensus      has developed on several important points.       While the founders included impeachment powers in the      Constitution, they were concerned by the potential partisan      abuse. We should be no less aware of the dangers of      partisanship. As we have seen, the process functions best      when there is a broad bipartisan consensus behind moving      ahead. The country is not well served when either policy      disagreements or personal animosities drive the process.       Many scholars who have studied the Constitution have      concluded that it should be reserved for offenses that are      abuses of the public trust or abuses that relate to the      public nature of the President's duties. Remember, what is      impeachable is not necessarily criminal and what is criminal      is not necessarily impeachable.--[Speech, 10/2/98]                           *   *   *   *   *       I am here today to call for bipartisanship in the      impeachment process. It is a concept many will say they agree      with. But actions speak louder than words.       The framers of the Constitution knew that the greatest      danger associated with impeachment was the presence of      partisan factions that could dictate the outcome.       It is clear from the debates and from the commentaries on      the Constitutional Convention that the framers were concerned      that     anything less than bipartisanship could, and would, do great      damage to our form of government. They knew that to      contemplate an action as profound as undoing a popular      election requires at a minimum that members of both parties      find that the alleged wrong is grave enough to overturn      the will of the majority of the American people.       The framers also understood the sentiment expressed nearly      200 years later by Congresswoman Barbara Jordan during the      impeachment proceedings of Richard Nixon.       She said, ``it is reason, and not passion, which must guide      our deliberations, guide our debate, and guide our      decision.''       But the current debate is guided by faction, not reason.      One example: The House Judiciary Committee this month heard a      battery of witnesses address the question of what is an      impeachable offense. Democrats called legal experts who      testified that the President's acts are not impeachable      offenses, and Republicans called witnesses who were just as      certain they were. By the end of the hearing, anyone      listening would have the overwhelming impression that there      was no consensus in the legal community on the issue, that it      was an open question.       Yet the vast majority of historians and legal scholars have      concluded--and stated publicly--that nothing that President      Clinton has been accused of rises to the level of an      impeachable offense. The hearing was a political charade. We      are told that ultimately, this is a political process.      Ultimately, it is. The question is whether it is going to be      a fair process. I argue that it can, and must be fair.       In his marvelous book on the impeachment process, published      while the country was in the throes of President Nixon's      Watergate troubles, Professor Charles Black alerted us to the      danger of partisanship.       Because the constitution and its history provide us with      more questions about impeachment than answers, he said, ``it      is always tempting to resolve such questions in favor of the      immediate political result that is palatable to us, for one      can never definitely be proved wrong, and so one is free to      allow one's prejudices to assume the guise of reason.''       Black was echoing Alexander Hamilton, who warned in      Federalist 65 that impeachments:       ``will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole      community, and to divide it into parties, more or less      friendly or inimical, to the accused. In many cases, it will      connect itself with the pre-existing factions, and will      enlist all their animosities, partialities, influence and      interest on the one side, or on the other; and in such cases      there will always be the greatest danger, that the decision      will be regulated more by the comparative strength of parties      than by the real demonstrations of guilt or innocence.''       I don't think I am being partisan myself in warning about      the risks of partisan excess. As a 32 year-old Senator, I      expressed this same concern about the fate of a Republican      President. On April 10, 1974, I rose on the floor of the      United States Senate and said:       ``In the case of an impeachment trial, the emotions of the      American people would be strummed, as a guitar, with every      newscast and each edition of the daily paper in communities      throughout the country.       The incessant demand for news or rumors of news--whatever      its basis of legitimacy--would be overwhelming. The      consequential impact on the federal institutions of      government would be intense--and not necessarily beneficial.      This is why my plea today is for restraint on the part of all      parties involved in the affair.''       I make the same plea for restraint today. And while the      circumstances surrounding these two events are starkly      different, the consequences for our Nation are the same. The      gravity of removing a sitting president from office is the      same today as it was twenty-four years ago.       The American people understand that the consequences of      impeaching a sitting President are grave and, thus far, they      have shown a remarkable restraint--more than some of the      pundits and experts. But I believe they have reached two      clear conclusions: Congress should resolve the matter      expeditiously and resolve the matter in a fair and non-     partisan manner.       These conclusions have great significance to the      impeachment process. I believe the American people will      ultimately make their judgment about the proceedings and the      outcome based in part, on whether the House Judiciary      Committee votes along strict party lines and whether the      House of Representatives acts in a similar manner.       That may not be fair, but I believe that is how they will      judge it. Therefore, it seems clear to me that for history's      sake, and with the Committee's legacy in mind, Chairman Hyde      and the Republican majority in the House must bend over      backwards to demonstrate that they have conducted this      proceeding based on principle, not politics.       There is yet another issue where public opinion comes into      play. That is the question of whether the President's      transgressions warrant impeachment. We know from survey after      survey that the American people believe the President's      actions do not justify impeaching him.       Should that have any bearing on the outcome? Many of my      colleagues say they will ignore public opinion. In most      cases, this is a sound position for a member of Congress to      take. When we are elected to the House and the Senate, we are      sent here to exercise judgment, not simply to be weathervanes      that shift with the political winds. The fact that this is an      impeachment proceeding doesn't change that--it makes it even      more important that we exercise our best judgment.       But I believe it is a serious mistake to take the position      that public opinion should have no bearing on how we act and      what we do. Let me explain. Many people--and many legal      scholars--have said that impeachment should be reserved for      grave breaches of the public trust. Surely, if we are trying      to decide whether an offense is a breach of the public trust,      it is important to know what the public thinks. If the      American people think the President's actions do not warrant      impeachment, we should listen to their views, and take them      seriously.       It would be a serious mistake to ignore public opinion for      another, more fundamental reason. This is their President we      are talking about. The President of the United States doesn't      serve at the pleasure of the legislature, as a prime minister      does in a parliamentary system. He is elected directly by the      people of the United States.       The election of a President is the only nationwide vote      that the American people ever cast. That is a big deal. If      the American people don't think they have made a mistake in      electing Bill Clinton, we in the Congress had better be very      careful before we upset their decision.       This was brought home to me several weeks before the      elections at a filling station in Wilmington. The woman      working the cash register looked up at me with something of a      scowl on her face. I assumed--incorrectly, it turned out--     that she had voted against me the last time I ran. She said,      ``You're Joe Biden, aren't you?'' I nodded. She said, ``What      are you going to do to President Clinton on this Lewinsky      thing?'' I started to give her a noncommital answer about the      process needing to go forward, but she brought me up short.      ``Don't you or anyone else take my vote away, Joe. He's my      President! If you remove him, I will never vote again.''       This woman--and the American people--understand the genius      of the American system in their bones. They know that the      Congress and the President are separate branches of      government. They understand that each branch is responsible      to them, not to the other branch of government. Just as they      know that the Senators from their state are theirs, and the      Representative from their district is theirs, they know that      the President is theirs, too.       Anyone who wants to impeach Bill Clinton needs to keep in      mind what the American people think about it, because he is      their President.       Let me be absolutely clear. This does not mean just doing      what the opinion polls say. It means proceeding in a manner      that the American people understand to be fair. In the case      of an impeachment, fair means bipartisan. It means putting      aside the disagreements that stem from partisan factions. The      time for partisan factions to play a role is in the process      of elections, where candidates advance competing policies and      platforms and the people vote. Once the election is held, our      leaders hold office until the next election. It is simply      antithetical to our constitutional democracy to use      impeachment to overturn an election on partisan grounds. It      violates the independence of the Presidency and it usurps the      people's voice.       The Framers saw this danger when they wrote the impeachment      power into the Constitution. Hamilton warned that an      impeachment would ``connect itself with pre-existing      factions,'' just as Black much later saw that impeachment was      an occasion for ``prejudices to assume the guise of reason.''       So those who wish to proceed with impeachment in the face      of the public's contrary opinion bear a special obligation      and confront a special risk. The obligation they face is that      they must proceed in a bipartisan manner, so that we can      defend the Congress's actions as fair and consistent with the      constitutional framework--so that if impeachment goes      forward, those who support it can look my constituent, or      their constituent, straight in the eyes and defend the      process as fair and just.       Should they fail to do this, the risk they face is the      chance that they will inflict more damage on our system of      government and induce more cynicism and disgust with politics      than anything the President has done so far.       So we must be prudent. Otherwise we will succumb to the      danger the Framers warned against. We will subject the      President to what amounts to a vote of no confidence. If you      disapprove of his presidency and its policies, or if you do      not like the man, vote to impeach. If, on the other hand, you      support his presidency and his policies, or if you do like      the man, vote to acquit. But that is not our system of      government.       When Benjamin Netanyahu returned home after signing the Wye      accords, he faced a vote of no confidence. If he had lost, he      would have been out of office and another government would      have to be formed.       That is simply not our system of government. Ours is not a      parliamentary system. That is not how impeachment is supposed      to operate.       Reflect for just a moment on how different our government      is. Here, the President and the Congress are separate      branches of government. Each is elected directly by the      people. The President and Vice President are the only      officials elected by ALL the people. Through the electoral      process, they answer to all the people. In such a system, a      vote of no confidence, as a means of removing the     head of government when the Congress disapproves of his      leadership, contradicts the theory of separated powers. It      would trample on the choice made by the people through the      electoral process.       This is no small matter. It goes to the heart of the      constitutional design. As Jack Rakove, the Stanford      historian, noted during the recently held House hearings on      the standard for impeachment, the prevailing principle that      guided the Framers in shaping the institution of the      Presidency during the Philadelphia Convention, the one major      goal and idea that best explains how that office took shape      over the summer of 1787, was their intention on ``making the      presidency as politically independent of the Congress as they      could.''       The Framers saw the system of separated powers and checks      and balances as a bulwark in support of individual liberty      and against government tyranny. The separation of powers      prevents government power from being concentrated in any      single branch of government. Permit one branch of government      to subjugate another to its partisan wishes, and you permit      the kind of concentration of power that can lead to tyranny.       So the system the Framers established is utterly      incompatible with the idea that sharp partisan divisions      could be sufficient to impeach. Preserving our system, with      its checks and balances and separation of powers, ought to be      part of our consideration as we attempt to resolve the      current controversy.       How do we ensure that impeachments do not become the      partisan showdowns that the Framer's warned about? The answer      is both simple and elusive. The only thing that prevents the      impeachment power from being abused is the good faith of      Members of Congress.       Professor Black proposed a simple test. He said that for      the purposes of impeachment, members take off their party's      hat--shed their partisan identity--and then try to take on      the identity of a member of the other party. In other words,      Republicans who favor Clinton's impeachment should try to      pretend they are Democrats, and see if they still hold that      same conclusion. Democrats who scoff at impeachment in the      present instance should try to see it from the Republican's      point of view.       It is very difficult to perform this test, especially in      the highly charged partisan atmosphere in which we live, but      you get the point. Before we undertake such a solemn act as      impeachment, we should examine our reasoning very carefully      to be sure we are not simply following partisan instincts.       Impeachment can be legitimate if and only if it emanates      from a bipartisan conviction that the president has committed      high crimes and misdemeanors--when people of opposing      viewpoints can come together in agreement over the      seriousness of the offense and the appropriateness of the      sanction.       Partisanship need not disappear entirely--that would be      impossible. It simply must be held in check for a time--a few      weeks, perhaps a month--and by a relatively small number of      people, so that a bipartisan consensus can take shape.       Look back at the Nixon impeachment. It took on legitimacy      when a core of Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee      were moved by the nature of President Nixon's offenses to      break party ranks and vote for articles of impeachment. In      the Senate, it was the stark reality of eroding Republican      support that prompted President Nixon to resign. There was      bipartisan consensus that what Nixon did was impeachable.       Partisanship did not evaporate entirely during the      impeachment trial of Andrew Johnson. In fact, the entire      episode was riddled with partisanship, and overall it stands      as an excellent example of how not to conduct an impeachment.       Still, seven Republican Senators did vote with the      Democrats for acquittal, shedding their partisan preferences,      to prevent that impeachment from succeeding. It took only      that amount of bipartisanship to save the country from an      impeachment that most people--in retrospect--have concluded      would have been a terrible mistake. The fact that a      conviction in the Senate requires a two-thirds majority      guarantees a measure of necessary bipartisanship except in      all but the most lopsided Senates.       But bipartisanship should not wait until the matter reaches      the Senate chamber. In previous impeachments the votes in      both the House and the Senate have been by overwhelming      majorities. In the past, except for the Johnson impeachment,      the only times articles of impeachment reached the floor were      in cases of tremendous bipartisan consensus that the offenses      satisfy the constitutional standard and that the officer      ought to be removed.       As for the Johnson impeachment itself, according to James      Blaine, one of the Republican House members who voted for      impeachment, he and others came in time to regret the effort.      In private correspondence, Blaine wrote that, ``the sober      reflection of after years has persuaded many who favored      impeachment that it was not justifiable on the charges made,      and that its success would have resulted in greater injury to      free institutions than Andrew Johnson in his utmost endeavor      was able to inflict.''       The conclusion I reach is this. The burden is, as it always      has been, on those who seek to impeach and convict a      President. To overturn a popular election, they must convince      the American people and at least some in the President's      party that the President's actions meet the high standard for      impeachment settled upon by our founders in the Constitution.       This is what I mean by bipartisanship.       The standard is ``principled political neutrality.''       And one measure of whether a member has met that principle      is to ask in Professor Black's words: ``Would they have      answered the same question the same way if it came up with      respect to a president towards whom [they] felt oppositely      from the way [they] feel toward the President threatened with      removal.''       The American people will know whether each member met that      test. They will not demand unanimity, but they will demand      consensus.       Thus far, the House Judiciary Committee has proceeded      without dignity, causing the American people to lose respect      for the Committee.       As a result, the burden of demonstrating that they are      proceeding with a standard of ``principled political      neutrality'' will be politically difficult to meet.       Ken Starr will make his case, the President should be      allowed to make his. Then let them decide if the President's      conduct meets the test of what the framers had in mind by      ``high crimes and misdemeanors.''       The choice is not whether the President's self-evidently      shameful and possibly criminal conduct must be punished by      impeachment or be condoned. The choice is whether the process      for dealing with his conduct is removal from office or some      other means--censure, or perhaps even a criminal trial after      he has left office.       To those who say that failure to bring articles of      impeachment against the President would amount to condoning      his immoral behavior or overlooking a criminal act,      notwithstanding the fact it does not meet the test of an      impeachable offense, I say they do not understand our system      of government. For the Constitution contemplates and the law      provides for such a circumstance--it is called a criminal      trial after his term is served. It is a way to punish the      President without doing damage to the system of separated      powers or overruling the judgment of the American people.       Failure to impeach, even failure to proceed with a criminal      action, does not mean that the President has not paid for his      immoral behavior--he has already been sentenced to a hundred      years of shame in the history books, which is not an      insignificant penalty.       So I say to my colleagues in the House, do your duty.      Proceed with principled political neutrality. For if you do,      history will judge you kindly. And if you do not, it will      judge you harshly.       And for those of us who hold high public office and the      public trust, history is a judge.--[Speech, 11/18/98]                            Burden of Proof       What is the standard of proof? The Constitution does not      set forth an express standard of proof that the evidence must      meet in order to allow the Senate to convict the president.      Practice has left to each Senator to determine for him or      herself what standard to apply.       From the judicial setting there are three major standards      from which to choose. Most civil trials require a plaintiff      to prove his or her case by a preponderance of the evidence.      This means that the plaintiff must prove that it is more      likely than not that the plaintiff's assertions are true.      Criminal trials require the most exacting degree of proof.      The prosecution must prove the defendant's guilt beyond a      reasonable doubt. A third, middle course is applied in some      cases. This standard, clear and convincing evidence, requires      proof that substantially exceeds a mere preponderance but      that does not eliminate all reasonable doubt. There must be a      very high degree of probability that the evidence proves what      the plaintiff asserts, but the proof may fall short of      certainty.       Many Senators, analogizing to a criminal trial, have      expressed that they would require the House Managers to prove      their case ``beyond a reasonable doubt.'' In anticipation of      an impeachment trial of President Richard Nixon, Senators Sam      Ervin, Strom Thurmond, and John Stennis all declared that      they would apply the beyond a reasonable doubt standard. But      it is clear that individual Senators may opt for a civil      standard.       This issue may not have more than rhetorical significance      for the impeachment trial of President Clinton. These      standards are meant to guide juries in their fact-finding      capacity. Insofar as the trial focuses on the question      whether the President's conduct justifies conviction and      removal from office, the proceedings will call on the Senate      in its judicial character. Resolving that question requires      the Senate to exercise its legal and political judgment in      order to determine whether the constitutional punishment fits      the misconduct. It does not call upon the Senate to make a      factual determination about what conduct actually occurred.--     [Memorandum, 12/28/98]                           *   *   *   *   *           The Burden of Proof in Assessing the House's Case       But can the President rightly be charged with having      committed the massive number of crimes that the House      Managers allege? As Mr. McCollum said, if we cannot conclude      that the President has violated the law, even the House      Managers would agree that he should not be removed from      office. Even if     you accept their recitation of the dire consequences of      President Clinton remaining in office, if the President      cannot be shown to have been a serial perjurer and a massive      obstructor of justice, the Senate should acquit.       What standard of proof should a Senator apply in deciding      whether the record supports these charges? Both the House      Managers and the President's counsel addressed this      significant issue. The House Managers quite correctly pointed      out that the Senate has never sought to determine for the      entire body what that burden of proof should be in an      impeachment. In effect, we have left it to the good judgment      of each Senator to decide whether or not they are convinced      by the evidence presented to us.       For this Senator, fundamental fairness as well as the      nature of the House's case indicate that I ought to be      convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the President      violated the laws that the House alleges. Proof beyond a      reasonable doubt is the same standard applied in criminal      cases--it is the standard that would apply if the President      were tried in a criminal court for perjury or obstruction of      justice.       It seems to me that fundamental fairness counsels that I      apply the same standard a criminal court would apply      precisely because the House asserts that what makes his      actions impeachable is that he has violated the criminal      statutes regarding perjury and obstruction of justice. It      strikes me as absurd that the Senate would have the arrogance      to throw out a duly elected President on these grounds unless      it was convinced that he would be convicted of those charges.      Otherwise, we would be saying in effect that even though the      President would not be convicted on these crimes, we are      nevertheless throwing him out of office because he committed      those crimes. Someone else can try to explain the logic of      that decision to the voters, but not me.       In addition, the standard of proof beyond a reasonable      doubt seems to me compelled by the fact that in the House's      explanation of the harm to our system of government if the      President is not thrown out, their entire argument rises and      falls depending upon whether or not the President would be      convicted in a court of law for the crimes alleged. If he      could not be convicted in a court of law, then the Senate is      not ``condoning'' perjury or obstruction of justice any more      than a criminal court is condoning those crimes when someone      is acquitted on such charges. The Senate, like a court, is      simply saying, ``not proven.'' But if the Senate is not      condoning those crimes, there is no conceivable basis for      concluding that the public will be harmed by the President's      remaining in office.       [There is another way to look at this: In any impeachment,      a Senator must simply be convinced to his or her satisfaction      that the defendant committed the acts alleged. That standard      never changes. However, when the articles of impeachment      allege that offenses rise to an impeachable level because      these actions violate the law and have harmful consequences      to the country because the defendant has violated the law and      would not be punished, in that case a Senator must be      convinced that a defendant would in fact be punished by a      criminal court. In other words, the Senator must simply be      convinced that a court would find that there is proof beyond      a reasonable doubt.       In contrast, if the charges were that the president had      lied to the American people, the Congress or foreign leaders,      and that the harmful consequences flowed from being unable to      rely upon his word, then a Senator must simply be convinced      that the President lied, relying upon whatever level of proof      is sufficient to convince him or her of that fact.]--     [Memorandum, 1/21/98]                                Censure       In recent days, some have suggested that because the Starr      report provides prima facie evidence of what are arguably      impeachable offenses, the House and the Senate have a      constitutional responsibility to see the impeachment process      through to its conclusion. In my view, the constitutional      history that I have sketched here this evening shows this      position to be entirely mistaken. Indeed, if anything,      history shows a thoroughly understandable reluctance to have      the procedure invoked.       Stopping short of impeachment would not be reaching a      solution ``outside the Constitution,'' as some suggest--it      would be entirely compatible and consistent with the      Constitution.       The 28th Congress [which contemplated but then terminated      impeachment proceedings against President Tyler] hardly      violated its constitutional duty when the House decided that,      all things considered, terminating impeachment proceedings      after cooperation between the Congress and the President      improved was a better course of action than proceeding with      impeachment based on his past actions, even though it      apparently did so for reasons no more laudable than those      that initiated the process.       Impeachment was and remains an inherently political      process, with all the pitfalls and promises that are thus put      into play. Nothing in the document precludes the Congress      from seeking means to resolve this or any other putative      breach of duty short of removing him from office. In fact,      the risky and potentially divisive nature of the impeachment      process may counsel in favor of utilizing it only as a last      resort.       Of course, impeachment ought to be used if the breach of      duty is serious enough--what the Congress was prepared to do      in the case of Richard Nixon was the correct course of      action. However, nothing in the Constitution precludes the      congress from resolving this conflict in a manner short of      impeachment.       The crucial question--the question with which the country      is currently struggling--is whether the President's breaches      of conduct--which are now well-known and which have been      universally condemned--warrant the ultimate political      sanction. Are they serious enough to warrant removal?       In answering that, we need to ask ourselves, what is in the      best interest for the country?       And while I have not decided what ultimately should happen,      I do want to suggest that it is certainly constitutionally      permissible to consider a middle ground as a resolution of      this matter. Such an approach might bring together those of      the President's detractors who believe there needs to be some      sanction, but are willing to stop short of impeachment, as      well as those of the President's supporters who reject      impeachment, but are willing to concede that some sanction      ought to be implemented.       As a country, we have not often faced decisions as stark      and potentially momentous as the impeachment of a president.      On the other hand, we would be wise not to overstate such      claims--surely we have faced some moments just as stark and      serious as this one. We have survived those moments, and we      will survive this one.       Whatever the outcome of the present situation, I am      confident that our form of government and the strength of our      country present us not with any constitutional crisis, but      rather with the constitutional framework and flexibility to      deal responsibly with the decisions we face in the coming      months.--[Speech, 10/2/98]                     Crimes and Misdemeanors, High       Let me say at the outset, that what President Clinton did      was reprehensible. It was a horrible lapse in judgment and it      has brought shame to him personally and to the office of the      president. His actions have hurt his family, his friends, his      supporters and the country as a whole. President Clinton has      said this himself.       Let me also say that I have not made any decision as to      what I think should happen. I have not come to any conclusion      as to what consequences the President should face for his      shameful behavior. I believe the oath I have taken precludes      me and other Senators from prejudging, as I may be required      to serve as a judge and juror in the trial of the century.       I can only make an assessment after hearing all of the      evidence: evidence against the President, and evidence in      support of the President.       No one knows how this will turn out. However, I have given      the topic some thought and would like to explore some of the      issues that surely will confront responsible Members of      Congress and all Americans as we enter this difficult period      in our history.       The framers of the Constitution who met in Philadelphia in      the summer 1787 considered offering the country a      constitution that did not include the power to impeach the      president. After all, any wrongs against the public could be      dealt with by turning the president out in the next election.       One delegate to the constitutional convention, Charles      Pinckney of South Carolina, worried that the threat of      impeachment would place the president under the thumb of a      hostile congress, thereby weakening the independence of the      office and threatening the separation of powers. According to      James Madison's notes, Pinckney called impeachment a ``rod''      that congress would hold over the president.       In being reluctant to include an impeachment power, the      framers were not trying to create an imperial presidency. In      fact, what they were worried about was protecting all      American citizens against the tyranny of a select group.       In their view, the separation of powers constituted one of      the most powerful means for protecting individual liberty,      because it prevented government power from being concentrated      in any single branch of government. To make the separation of      powers work properly, each branch must be sufficiently strong      and independent from the others.       The framers were concerned that any process whereby the      legislative branch could sit in judgment of the president      would be vulnerable to abuse by partisan factions. Federalist      No. 65 begins its defense of the impeachment process by      warning of the dangers of abuse. It argues that impeachments:       ``Will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole      community, and to divide them into parties, more or less      friendly or inimical, to the accused. In many cases, it will      connect itself with the pre-existing factions, and will      enlist all their animosities, partialities, influence and      interest on one side, or on the other; and in such cases      there will always be the greatest danger, that the decision      will be regulated more by the comparative strength of the      parties than by the real demonstration of guilt or      innocence.''       So the framers were fully aware that impeachment      proceedings could become partisan attacks on the president--     charged with animosities generated by all manner of prior      struggles and disagreements, over executive branch decisions,      over policy disputes, over resentment at losing the prior      election. Federalist No. 65 expresses the view that the use      of impeachment to vindicate these animosities would actually      be an abuse of that power.       This sentiment is as true today as it was when the      constitution was being written. It     was also true when Richard Nixon faced impeachment in 1974.      In fact, it would have been wrong for Richard Nixon to have      been removed from office based upon a purely partisan vote.      No president should be removed from office merely because one      party enjoys a commanding lead in either house of the      congress.       Yet while the framers knew that impeachment proceedings      could become partisan, they needed to deal with strong anti-     federalist factions.       The anti-federalists strenuously argued that the federal      government would quickly get out of step with the sentiments      of the people and become vulnerable to corruption and      intrigue, arrogance and tyranny. This charge proved close to      fatal as the ratifying conventions in the states took up the      proposed constitution.       The framers of the Constitution knew that the Constitution      would have been even more vulnerable to charges of      establishing a government remote from the people if the      president were not subject to removal except at the time of      re-election.       James Madison's notes of the Philadelphia constitutional      convention record his observations of the debate. He:       ``Thought it indispensable that some provision should be      made for defending the community against the incapacity,      negligence or perfidy of the chief magistrate [that is, the      president]. The limitation of the period of his service was      not a sufficient security. He might lose his capacity after      his appointment. He might pervert his administration into a      scheme of speculation or oppression. He might betray his      trust to foreign powers.''       So in the end, the framers of the Constitution risked the      abuse of power by the congress to gain the advantages of      impeachment.       Once the decision to include the power of impeachment had      been made, the remainder of debate on the impeachment clauses      focused on two issues:       1. What was to constitute an impeachable offense or what      were the standards to be?       2. How was impeachment to work or what were the procedures      to be?       As we shall see, the framers proved unable to separate      these two issues entirely. Understanding how they are      intertwined, however, helps us to understand the full      implications of the power.       The Constitution provides that ``the House of      Representatives shall. . . have the power of impeachment.''      (Article I, Section 2, Clause 5).       The framers decision that the House of Representatives      would initiate the charges of impeachment follows the pattern      of the English Parliament--where the House of Commons      initiates charges of impeachment. Beyond this, the choice      must have seemed fairly compelled by two related      considerations.       The first, already mentioned, was the need to provide the      people as a whole with assurances that the government they      were being asked to create would be responsive to the      interests and concerns of the people themselves.       The second was the framer's substantive understanding of      the impeachment power. It was a power to hold accountable      government officers who had, in Hamilton's terms, committed      ``an abuse or violation of some public trust'' thereby      committing an injury ``done immediately to the society      itself.''       If the gravamen of an impeachment is the breach of the      public's trust, no branch of the federal government could      have seemed more appropriate to initiate such a proceeding      than the House, which was conceived and defended as the      chamber most in tune with the people's sympathies and hence      most appropriate to reflect the people's views.       The Constitution further provides that the president shall      be ``removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction      of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and      misdemeanors.'' (Article II, Section 4).       This language went through several changes during that      summer of 1787. In initial drafts, the grounds for      impeachment were restricted to treason and bribery alone.      When the matter was brought up on September 8, 1787, George      Mason of Virginia inquired as to why the grounds should be      restricted to these two provisions.       He argued that ``attempts to subvert the constitution may      not be treason as above defined.'' Accordingly, he moved to      add ``maladministration'' as a third ground.       James Madison objected to Mason's motion, contending that      to add ``so vague a term will be equivalent to a tenure      during the pleasure of the senate.'' Here again, we see the      worry that impeachment would be misused by the congress to      reduce the independence of the president, allowing partisan      factions to interfere at the expense of the larger public      good.       The objection apparently proved effective because mason      subsequently withdrew the motion and substituted the phrase      ``or other high crimes and misdemeanors.''       What does the phrase mean? It is clear the framers thought      it to be limited in scope. But beyond this, constitutional      scholars have been debating the meaning of this phrase from      the very early days of the republic.       Yet despite this on-going dialogue, I believe there are two      important points of agreement as to the original      understanding of the phrase, and a third issue where the      weight of history suggests a settled practice.       First, as we have already seen, the framers did not intend      that the president could be impeached for      ``maladministration" alone.       Second, a great deal of evidence from outside the      convention shows that both the framers and ratifiers saw      ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' as pointing to offenses that      are serious, not petty, and offenses that are public or      political, not private or personal.       In 1829, William Rawle authored one of the early      commentaries on the Constitution of the United States. In it,      Rawle states that ``the legitimate causes of impeachment. . .      can only have reference to public character and official      duty.''       He went on to say, ``in general, those offences which may      be committed equally by a private person as a public officer      are not the subjects of impeachment.''       In addition, more than one hundred fifty years ago, Joseph      Story, in his influential Commentaries on the Constitution,      stated that impeachment is:       ``Ordinarily'' a remedy for offenses ``of a political      character,'' ``growing out of personal misconduct, or gross      neglect, or usurpation, or habitual disregard of the public      interests, in the discharge of the duties of political      office.''       The public character of the impeachment offense is further      reinforced by the limited nature of the remedy for the      offense. In the English tradition, impeachments were      punishable by fines, imprisonment and even death. In      contrast, the American constitution completely separates the      issue of criminal sanctions from the issue of removal from      office.       The Constitution states that ``judgment in cases of      impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from      office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of      honor, trust or profit under the United States.'' (Article I,      Section 3, Clause 7).       The remedy for violations of the public's trust in the      performance of one's official duties, in other words, is      limited to removal from that office and disqualification from      holding future offices. Remedies that I might add, correspond      nicely to the public nature of the offenses in the first      instance.       Additional support comes from yet another commentator,      James Wilson, a delegate to the convention from Pennsylvania.      In his lectures on the Constitution, Wilson wrote that ``in      the United States and Pennsylvania, impeachments are confined      to political characters, to political crimes and      misdemeanors, and to political punishments.''       All in all, the evidence is quite strong that impeachment      was understood as a remedy for abuse of official power,      breaches of public trust, or other derelictions of the duties      of office.       The third point to make about the scope of the impeachment      power is this: to be impeachable, an offense does not have to      be a breach of the criminal law.       The renowned constitutional scholar and personal friend and      advisor, the late Phillip Kurland, wrote that ``at both the      convention that framed the constitution and at the      conventions that ratified it, the essence of an impeachable      offense was thought to be breach of trust and not violation      of the criminal law. And this was in keeping with the primary      function of impeachment, removal from office.''       If you put the notion that an impeachable offense must be a      serious breach of an official trust or duty, together with      the point that it does not have to be a criminal violation,      you reach the conclusion that not all crimes are impeachable,      and not every impeachable offense is a crime. [Speech, 10/2/     98]                           *   *   *   *   *       Reference has been made to an exchange between George Mason      and James Madison at the Virginia Ratifying Convention. Mason      is reported to have worried that a president might ``stop      [an] inquiry'' into wrongdoing involving the president.      Madison is reported to have replied that this concern was not      substantial because the House of Representatives could      impeach the president if he did so. The exchange, it has been      argued, proves that the Framers viewed obstruction of justice      as clearly an impeachable offense.       A more extended look at the colloquy shows that Mason's      precise concern was that the President would use his pardon      power to pardon people whose investigations might reveal      presidential involvement in criminal activities. Mason used      this concern as the basis for arguing that the pardon power      should be placed in the House, and not with the President. To      this concern, Madison replied that if the President so abused      the pardon power, he could be impeached. So it was an action      that abused an official power of the President that Madison      thought was impeachable.       Here is a condensed version of the exchange as reported in      Eliot's Debates.
