The point I am making to the Senator from Kansas is--and I think probably Senator Frist, even as a medical doctor, would say that we struggle to figure out at what moment this is life. When we are dealing with the sperm and semen and the ovum, are they live cells? Certainly, they are live cells. There is life in those cells. If they were not, they would have no value in this process.  So to say there is life in the cells does not necessarily say we are dealing with a person. At what point does this become a person? This has been debated for as long as humans have been on Earth.  The point I am trying to make is I believe we should protect life, but we better be careful that in protecting life we are not avoiding our responsibility to protect the living. What Senator Frist is suggesting--I do not want to put words in his mouth. What I believe is that stem cell research helps us to protect the living.  I yield to the Senator from North Dakota for a question.
