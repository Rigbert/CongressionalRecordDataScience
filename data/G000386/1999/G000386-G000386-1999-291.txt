 President, on behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous consent that the only amendments in order be the pending Smith of New Hampshire amendment and the pending Landrieu amendment, that they both be separate first-degree amendments, and the votes occur in relation to these amendments at 5:30 in the order listed, with 3 minutes prior to each vote for explanation.  I further ask unanimous consent that following the votes described above, the bill be immediately advanced to third reading and passage occur, all without any intervening action or debate.
