  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, a new Federal policy brokered in secret, adopted without a single hearing, a single open public meeting and no vote.  A policy that will:  Increase this year's deficit by $2.5 billion?  Increase the cost of a mortgage on a $100,000 house by more than $500 a year--that makes a mockery of the puny income tax cuts we are talking about here.  Drive up the cost of everything bought on credit--from automobiles to winter clothes for the kids.  This is a policy specifically intended to drive up the rate of unemployment toward a target of 6 percent--that means 3\1/2\ million more Americans out of work than under the old target of 4 percent.  Is this a new abuse heaped upon the American people by an insulated and arrogant Congress? No, this policy will be foisted on the American public by the secretive, arrogant, and insulated Federal Reserve Board, a small group of powerful bankers and economists who believe their control over our money supply is to be used to serve their friends and masters from Wall Street, not Main Street America.  Mr. Speaker, it is time to stop Alan Greenspan and his cronies before they kill the economy again.                          ____________________
