President, one of our most important constitutional responsibilities is to provide advice and consent on the scores of judicial nominations sent to us to fill the vacancies on the federal courts around the country. Today we made some progress. We confirmed 16 new judges. For that I thank the Democratic leader and the majority leader, my counterpart on the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, and all those who worked with us to achieve Senate action on these judicial nominees.  The Senate has finally begun to consider the judges needed to serve the American people in our federal courts. But before any Senator thinks that our work is done for the year, let us take stock: We are only one-third of the way to the number of judges nominated by a Republican President and confirmed by a Democratic majority in 1992, and only half way to the levels of confirmations achieved in 1984 and 1988. Today we finally passed the level of 17 confirmations achieved in 1996, the year before I became the Ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. That low water mark is no measure of success, however.  Today we face more judicial vacancies than when the Senate adjourned in 1994. That means there are more vacancies across the country than when the Republican majority took controlling responsibility for the Senate in January 1995. Over the last six years we have gained no ground in our efforts to fill longstanding judicial vacancies that are plaguing the federal courts.  In addition, recall that this is the first action that the Senate has taken on judicial nominees since March 9, when the Senate ended 4-years of delay and finally voted to confirm Judge Richard Paez to the Ninth Circuit. For more than two months, for more than 10 weeks, the Senate has not acted to confirm a single judge, not one. That stall accounts for the backlog in judicial nominations that results in there being 16 judicial nominations on the Senate calendar today. On the other hand, since March 9, seven additional vacancies have arisen and the Senate has received 17 additional nominations.  There remain 36 judicial nominations pending in the Judiciary Committee, plus new nominations that the President is sending us every week. I have challenged the Senate to regain the pace it met in 1998 when the Committee held 13 hearing and the Senate confirmed 65 judges. That would still be one less than the number of judges confirmed by a Democratic Senate majority in the last year of the Bush Administration in 1992. Indeed, in the last two years of the Bush Administration, a Democratic Senate majority confirmed 124 judges. It would take an additional 67 confirmations this year for this Senate to equal that total.  Over the last five years the Republican-controlled Senate confirmed the following: 58 federal judges in the 1995 session; 17 in 1996; 36 in 1997; 65 in 1998; and 34 in 1999. By contrast, in one year, 1994, with a Democratic majority in the Senate, we confirmed 101 judges. With commitment and hard work many things are achievable.  Of the confirmations achieved this year, seven were nominations that were reported last year and should have been confirmed last year. That would have made last year's total slightly more respectable. Instead, they were held over and inflate this year's numbers. In addition, Tim Dyk, one of the nominees finally being considered today, was nominated in 1998 and has been held over two years.  Moreover, the Republican Congress has refused to consider the authorization of the additional judges needed by the federal judiciary to deal with their ever increasing workload. In 1984, and again in 1990, Congress responded to requests by the Chief Justice and the Judiciary Conference for needed judicial resources. Indeed, in 1990, a Democratic majority in the Congress created scores of needed new judgeships during a Republican Administration.  Three years ago the Judicial Conference of the United States requested that an additional 53 judgeships be authorized around the country. Last year the Judicial Conference renewed its request but increased it to 72 judgeships needing to be authorized around the country. Instead, the only federal judgeships created since 1990 were the nine District Court judgeships authorized in the omnibus appropriations bill at the end of last year.  If Congress had timely considered and passed the Federal Judgeship Act of 1999, S.1145, as it should have, the federal judiciary would have nearly 130 vacancies today. That is the more accurate measure of the needs of the federal judiciary that have been ignored by the Congress over the past several years and places the vacancy rate for the federal judiciary at 14 percent (128 out of 915). As it is, the vacancy rate is almost 10 percent (65 out of 852) and has remained too high throughout the five years that the Republican majority has controlled the Senate.  Especially troubling is the vacancy rate on the courts of appeals, which continues at over 11 percent (20 out of 179) without the creation of any of the additional judgeships that those courts need to handle their increased workloads.  Most troubling is the circuit emergency that had to be declared more than seven months ago by the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. I recall when the Second Circuit had such an emergency two years ago. Along with the other Senators representing States from the Circuit, I worked hard to fill the five vacancies then plaguing my circuit. The situation in the Fifth Circuit is not one that we should tolerate; it is a situation that I wished we had confronted by expediting consideration of the nominations of Alston Johnson and Enrique Moreno last year. I still hope that the Senate will consider both this year.  I deeply regret that the Senate adjourned last November and left the Fifth Circuit to deal with the crisis in the federal administration of justice in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi without the resources that it desperately needs. I look forward to our resolving this difficult situation. I will work with the Majority Leader and the Democratic Leader to resolve that emergency at the earliest possible time.  With 20 vacancies on the Federal appellate courts across the country and nearly half of the total judicial emergency vacancies in the Federal courts system in our appellate courts, our courts of appeals are being denied the resources that they need, and their ability to administer justice for the American people is being hurt. There continue to be multiple vacancies on the Ninth Circuit. Three vacancies is too many and perpetuating these four judicial emergency vacancies, as the Senate has in this one circuit, is irresponsible. We should act on these nominations promptly and provide the Ninth Circuit with the judicial resources it needs and to which it is entitled.  I am likewise concerned that the Fourth, Sixth and District of Columbia Circuits are suffering from multiple vacancies.  I continue to urge the Senate to meet our responsibilities to all nominees, including women and minorities, and look forward to action on the nominations of Judge James Wynn, Jr. to the Fourth Circuit, Enrique Moreno to the Fifth Circuit, Kathleen McCree Lewis to the Sixth Circuit and Judge Johnnie Rawlinson to the Ninth Circuit. Working together the Senate can join with the President to confirm well-qualified, diverse and fair-minded judges to fulfill the needs of the federal courts around the country.  Having begun so slowly in the first five months of this year, we have much more to do before the Senate takes its final action on judicial nominees this year. We should be considering 20 to 40 more judges this year. Having begun so slowly, we cannot afford to follow the ``Thurmond rule'' and stop acting on these nominees at the end of the summer in anticipation of the presidential election. We must use all the time until adjournment to remedy the vacancies that have been perpetuated onthe courts to the detriment of the American people and the administration of justice. I urge all Senators to make the federal administration of justice a top priority for the Senate for the rest of this year.                          ____________________
