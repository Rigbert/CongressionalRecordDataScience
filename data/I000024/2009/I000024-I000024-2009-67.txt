Rush on his retirement from the Oklahoma State Chamber of Commerce.  Dick will be leaving the State chamber next spring after serving as its president and chief executive officer for 24 years. Dick has made a positive contribution to the State of Oklahoma and has been characterized as ``the State's leading pro-business advocate.''Dick's success is evident in both his internal administration of the State chamber and his work leading key probusiness campaigns which have made a positive impact on Oklahoma creating jobs and increasing business development.  Due to Dick's work, the State chamber now operates debt free. During his tenure, Dick has built the State chamber to over 2,000 members. He has been named Executive of the Year by the Oklahoma Chamber of Commerce Executives and is already a member of the Oklahoma Chamber of Commerce Hall of Fame.  Through leading key campaigns advocating new business opportunities and job creation such as Right-to-Work and tort reform, Dick has been credited with saving the business community in Oklahoma over $2 billion. In fact, the State chamber recently earned the Nation's highest honor from the American Tort Reform Association and the U.S. Chamber's Institute for Legal Reform. Just this year, the State chamber was awarded the ``The State Legislative Achievement Award'' by the U.S. Chamber's Institute for Legal Reform and the first annual ``Gold Medal for the Best State Civil Justice Legislation'' by the American Tort Reform Association. Dick has also led international outreach serving as Executive in Charge of sister chamber work between the Oklahoma State Chamber and both the Gansu, China Provincial Chamber and the Liaoning, China Provincial Chamber. Dick was a presenter at the VI Hemispheric Sister Cities Forum in Iquique, Chile, and he is the recipient of the ``The George Nigh Global Trade Award.'' Dick's involvement in Oklahoma business development has been extensive.  Dick's success is due in part to his long history in chamber management. Before coming to Oklahoma, Dick worked in chambers throughout the country from California to Texas before coming to Oklahoma in 1986. His experience also extends internationally as Dick worked as a project adviser for the U.S. Chamber's Center for International Private Enterprise serving as a consultant to the National Chamber of Commerce of Zimbabwe, Africa.  Oklahomans can appreciate Dick's service to the Oklahoma State Chamber and the entire State of Oklahoma, and we wish him the very best in his retirement and all future endeavors.                          ____________________
