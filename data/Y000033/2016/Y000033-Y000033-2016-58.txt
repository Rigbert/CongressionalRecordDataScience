Mr. Chairman, I want to compliment Mr. Newhouse on introducing this amendment.  These roads were built with taxpayer dollars, yet the Forest Service arbitrarily goes in and shuts those roads down so people don't have access to them.  We have the same problem in our forests in Alaska: no notification, and then they will spend millions of dollars closing down a road that the public had access to. Their excuse is: well, it is our land. We don't have to worry about other people using this road now, so we will just isolate everybody from it.  So I compliment the gentleman for the introduction of his amendment.
