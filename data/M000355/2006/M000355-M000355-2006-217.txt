 I thank the bill managers for their great work in processing this important measure.  Tomorrow, we will be in session, but we will not have any rollcall votes. We do plan to turn, as indicated earlier, to the United States-Oman Free Trade Agreement under the agreement just entered into. I remind all of our colleagues we passed the Senate bill in June by a vote of 60 to 34. Under this unanimous consent agreement, we will vote on passage of the House bill on Tuesday of next week.  Again, for the information of all Senators, we will not have any rollcall votes during Friday's session of the Senate.                          ____________________
