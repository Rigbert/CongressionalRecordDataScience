 President, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator Hutchinson in sponsoring this resolution. We have been working closely together to find a solution to this growing problem. Unfortunately it seems the White House fails to grasp the urgency.  Mr. President, the DEA, who has for several years reimbursed state and local law enforcement agencies for the costs they have incurred in cleaning up drug laboratories, has run out of clean-up money. This has happened at a time when the number of these labs are growing rapidly, and springing up in towns and counties where there has never been a problem in the past. Iowa alone has a stack of over $83,000 in outstanding lab cleanup bills, and this amount continues to grow. Last year, Iowa received over $1.3 million in reimbursement, and at the current pace this total is expected to be higher this year.  Four weeks ago, Mr. President, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Kyl, and I wrote the appropriations committee to alert them to this problem. Our offices were aware of this impending problem, and wanted to insure that no one was taken by surprise so there could be a quick resolution. Two weeks ago, we were joined by Mr. Craig and Mr. Ashcroft in a letter to the Attorney General, encouraging her to work with the Appropriators in reprogramming funds to cover this shortfall.  I am pleased to say that within days we had been informed that a reprogramming request had been sent to the White House Budget Office for their approval. The request would allow for the use of returned COPS funds--money that was not going to be spent otherwise--to be used to clean up these environmental hazzards. I want to emphasize that this source was identified by the Justice Department, not by Congress. And I want to applaud their swift action to solve the problem, and not play politics.  But then, OMB happened. It did nothing. The problem mounts, and OMB sits. That is why Senator Hutchinson and I are offering this Sense of the Senate. We hope to encourage timely action--not more sitting on bureaucratic thumbs. I urge my colleagues to join us.                          ____________________
