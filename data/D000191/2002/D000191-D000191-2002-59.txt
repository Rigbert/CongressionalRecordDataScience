Speaker, well before the Republican majority forced passage of the 1996 ``Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act'' (PRWORA)---the so-called welfare reform package--Oregon pioneered several welfare and poverty alleviation initiatives and landmark education and training programs. The 1996 welfare bill allowed states, like Oregon, a waiver to continue their successful social assistance programs with minimal federal interference.  Oregon was able to offer such programs as the JOBS welfare-to-work program and the JOBS Plus program that assists in job placements in fields with opportunities for real career advancement and makes an impact not just in the caseloads, but in poverty alleviation. Oregon was also one of the first states to include innovations like incentives for employers to train and hire welfare recipients.  There are a number of proposed changes to the Temporary Assistance to Need Families (TANF) reauthorization that will end up costing Oregon more and reduce its flexibility in delivering innovative, individualized programs.  Under current law, adults have two years to find a job before losing their welfare benefits. One of the most important factors in finding a stable job at a living wage is education. That's why I've advocated that any reforms allow recipients to enroll in two-year college or four-year university programs, job training or professional development programs, or rehabilitation programs for mental health, substance abuse, or domestic violence, without hurting their eligibility for benefits. Over 50 percent of the poor in Oregon have, for one reason or another, not completed high school. Over 35 percent of the poor in Oregon have only an eighth-grade education or less. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, of the 30 fastest growing, well-compensated occupations, only five can be accomplished with short-term training.  With Oregon suffering from the highest unemployment rate in the nation at nearly 8 percent, and many Oregon counties at double-digit unemployment, education becomes even more important during these tough economic times to ensure living wage jobs. The facts are shocking. A single mom with two children willonly earn $13,520 a year before taxes working a full-time minimum wage job and not receive TANF benefits because the minimum wage--$6.50/hour in Oregon--is too high to qualify. This is nowhere near the federal estimate of a living wage for a family of three of $34,429 (or $16.55/h). The Republican proposal doesn't even address how Oregon can resolve this disparity. Instead, they leave it to each state to address. Oregon is drastically cutting social service programs in order to deal with a near billion dollar deficit. I can't imagine the state will find resources to deal with this issue.  Equally important is the amount of time TANF recipients spend at work activities and the quality of these activities. I'm concerned about proposals advocating 40 work hours per week, either implicitly or explicitly stated, that will push recipients into ``workfare'' programs that fail to increase earnings or opportunity. Forty hours of direct work is unrealistic for most TANF recipients because of the other support programs--like training, job search assistance, counseling--that recipients need to participate in.  Education, training and ensuring a living wage are only part of a successful plan to allow recipients to become more self-sufficient. Many working mothers depend on child care. I've always supported significantly increasing funding for the Child Care Development Block Grant (CCDBG). The CCDBG is currently funded at $2.21 billion nationally, which means $2.5 million for Oregon. This funding doesn't come close to meeting demand. A 2000 Radcliffe Public Policy Center study found that for families under 200 percent of the poverty level, the most likely reason parents lose jobs is because of a lack of child care. The Republicans claim that the TANF bill commits $6 billion towards child care but looking at the fine print, the Republicans have made mandatory only $2.9 billion and merely authorized another $3.1 billion. A good press hit in an election year, but given the disastrous federal budget situation, it's unlikely that child care funding will ever reach its full authorized level.  Like many of my colleagues, I want make sure states have some degree of flexibility in implementing TANF and allow a measure of program coordination with other social assistance initiatives. But I'm also concerned that the Republicans have included a completely unnecessary provision in this legislation that would override, at a governor's request, Congressional authorization and appropriations laws related to a range of social assistance programs. This so-called ``superwaiver,'' would allow the diversion of funds from some programs to others and trump Congressional funding decisions. The superwaiver allows states to circumvent the legislative intent and programmatic standards in the name of state flexibility. Significant amounts of money are involved, too. Programs--like TANF, food stamps, job training under the Workforce Investment Act--slated for superwaiver authority are going to receive $65 billion in FY2002 and, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates, will receive nearly $669 billion over the next ten years. This puts an enormous amount of money outside normal Congressional oversight.  Finally, I'm concerned that the TANF block grant of $16.5 billion to states has not even increased with the rate of inflation since it was instituted in 1997. By 2007, the block grant will lose nearly 22 percent of its value. This needs to change.  I urge my colleagues--especially those across the aisle--to pursue responsible reforms that offer a hand up, rather than a hand out; that offer a real chance of reducing poverty, not just caseloads.                          ____________________
