 President, as part of the unanimous consent agreement entered into this morning by the leader, a managers' package of amendments to the Interior bill is in order.  I would like to proceed to that business now because of yesterday's filing deadline for all first-degree amendments. Each of these amendments which constitute the managers' package have been filed at the desk.  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside, and that the following amendments be called up and considered en bloc, and where modifications are noted, that those modifications be agreed to: Bingaman amendment No. 2492; Risch amendment No. 2501; Carper amendment No. 2505; Roberts amendment No. 2509; Feinstein amendment No. 2518; Feinstein amendment No. 2519; Feingold amendment No. 2522; Whitehouse amendment No. 2534, as modified; Bingaman amendment No. 2491, as modified; Schumer/Durbin amendment No. 2495; Tester/Crapo amendment No. 2507; and, Bingaman amendment No. 2493, as modified.  Let me make one note with respect to Carper amendment No. 2505. The amendment being included in the managers' package is very similar to pending Carper amendment No. 2456. But the version we are adopting now is the version that has been agreed to by bothsides. At the proper time, then, I believe we will be in a position to withdraw the pending Carper amendment No. 2456.  In order to comply with Senate rule XLIV, which requires Members to certify that they have no financial interest in congressionally designated spending items, I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record financial disclosure letters associated with amendments Nos. 2501 and 2518.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                               Washington, DC, September 16, 2009.

Dianne Feinstein,     Chairman, Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior,          Environment, and Related Agencies, Dirksen Senate Office          Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Lamar Alexander,     Ranking Member, Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior,          Environment, and Related Agencies, Dirksen Senate Office          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairmen and Ranking Members: I am writing to request      your assistance in making a technical correction to the below      projects in House Report 107-272, House Report 108-10, and      House Report 108-401 so that the funds referenced may be made      available to the City of Thomasville, Alabama. The awards in      question are:       $2,500,000 STAG award to the Southwest AL/Rural Municipal      Water System in FY02; $1,000,000 STAG award to the Southeast      Alabama Regional Water Authority in FY02; $450,000 STAG award      to the Southwest Alabama Regional Water Authority in FY03;      $450,000 STAG award to the Southwest Alabama Regional Water      Supply District in FY04.       I certify that neither I nor my immediate family has a      pecuniary interest in the congressionally directed spending      item(s) that I have requested for Fiscal Year 2010,      consistent with the requirements of paragraph 9 of Rule XLIV      of the Standing Rules of the Senate.           Very Truly Yours,                                                    Jeff Sessions,     United States Senator.                                  ____     Hon. Diane Feinstein,     Chairwoman, Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and          Related Agencies, Dirksen Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Madam Chairman: I am writing to seek your assistance      in a technical correction for the City of Thomasville in the      Fiscal Year 2010 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies      Appropriations bill.       The City of Thomasville is constructing a water treatment      facility. The project began under the auspices of the      Southwest Regional Water Authority and was composed of the      City of Thomasville and the City of Jackson. Therefore, funds      were appropriated in 2002, 2003, and 2004 under this name.       2002--AL Regional Water Authority for AAL/Rural Municipal      Water System, $2.425M; 2002--Southeast Alabama Regional Water      Authority, $970,000; 2003--Southwest Alabama Regional Water      Authority, $433,700; 2004--Southwest Alabama Regional Water      Supply District, $433,900.       Since that time, the City of Jackson has withdrawn from the      authority and the City of Thomasville remains the only active      partner. To meet eligibility qualifications of USDA/Rural      Development and EPA to proceed with the development of the      Thomasville water supply project, we were told that the      earmarks from 2002-2004 would need to be amendment and      replaced with the name ``City of Thomasville.''       Finally, I certify that neither I nor my immediate family      has a pecuniary interest, consistent with the requirements of      Paragraph 9 of Rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate,      in any congressionally directed spending item I requested      that is contained in the Fiscal Year 2010 Interior,      Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill or      accompanying report. I further certify that I have posted a      description of the items requested on my official website,      along with the accompanying justification.       I greatly appreciate your assistance in this matter. As      always, please do not hesitate to contact me or Laura Friedel      in my office should you or your staff have any questions.           Sincerely,     Richard Shelby.                                  ____                                                  U.S. Senate,                               Washington, DC, September 17, 2009.

Amendment  (Purpose: To provide for the use of certain funds for water system                   upgrades in Fayette County, Alabama)       On page 190, line 10, insert before the period at the end      the following: ``: Provided further, That, notwithstanding      House Report 108-401, the amount of $2,000,000 made available      to the Tom Bevill Reservoir Management Area Authority for      construction of a drinking water reservoir in Fayette County,      Alabama, shall be made available to Fayette County, Alabama,      for water system upgrades''.                                  ____                                                  U.S. Senate,                               Washington, DC, September 16, 2009.

Lamar Alexander,     Subcommittee on Interior, Committee on Appropriations, U.S.          Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairmen and Ranking Members, I am offering three      amendments regarding congressionally directed spending items      on the Senate floor to the Fiscal Year 2010 Interior,      Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill.       Consistent with the requirements of paragraph 9 of Rule      XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I certify that      neither I nor my immediate family has a pecuniary interest in      the congressionally directed spending items that I have      requested for Fiscal Year 2010. I further certify that I have      posted a description of the items requested on my official      website, along with the accompanying justification.     Project Title: Lake County, California, for wastewater system          improvements     Recipient: Lake County, CA     Location: 230 A Main Street, Lakeport, CA 95453     Amount Requested: $500,000       Lake County is upgrading the Kelseyville wastewater system      to eliminate effluent and high nutrient pollution from      entering Clear Lake. The facility, which is located on the      south shore of Clear Lake, is under cease and desist orders      to meet clean water standards, and requires expansion      overflows into Clear Lake. This important project will      improve sanitation and water quality for County residents by      limiting sewage overflow.     Project Title: Tahoe Basin Vessel Inspection Station     Recipient: U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service     Location: Lake Tahoe, California and Nevada     Amount Requested: $800,000       The requested funding will be used for study, construction,      staffing, and other expenses necessary to conduct water      vessel inspection and decontamination at stations located      away from boat and vessel ramps at Lake Tahoe and Echo Lake      and Fallen Leaf Lake in California. The Tahoe Basin is under      threat of Quagga and zebra mussel infestations because of its      high-use by recreational boaters. An infestation could have      devastating impacts on the regional economy, including      recreation, tourism, property values, and other      infrastructure equaling approximately $22 million a year. If      introduced, Quagga and zebra mussels could destroy the      region's fisheries, alter the food web and ecosystem,      jeopardize the public drinking supply, and ruin the shoreline      and public access points. An infestation would also      jeopardize more than $1.43 billion that has already been      invested in environmental restoration and water clarity      improvements in Lake Tahoe, including $424 million from the      Federal government.     Project Title: Inland Empire Alternative Water Supply     Recipient: City of San Bernardino Municipal Water Department     Location: 300 North ``D'' Street, San Bernardino, CA 92418     Amount Requested: Technical Correction       The Rialto-Colton Basin is seriously contaminated by      perchlorate, and the cities and water districts in the area      have had to abandon wells or install wellhead treatment     equipment to use their groundwater. Local water providers      have found a temporary source of 20,000-30,000 acre-feet in      the Bunker Hill Basin, within the incorporated limits of the      City of San Bernardino, which will use this water source in      the long-term. I secured $500,000 in the Fiscal Year 2009      Omnibus Appropriations Act, but the San Bernardino Municipal      Water Department has been unable to access these funds and      this technical correction will clarify that the city is the      recipient of this funding.       Thank you for your consideration of my requests. If you      have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me, or      have your staff contact Ryan Hunt in my office.

AMENDMENT  (Purpose: To provide for the use of certain funds for the Pemiscot    Consolidated Public Water Supply District #1 for a drinking water                source protection infrastructure project)       On page 190, line 10, insert before the period at the end      the following: ``: Providing further, That, notwithstanding      the joint explanatory statement of the Committee on      Appropriations of the House of Representatives accompanying      Public Law 110-161 (121 Stat. 1844), the amount of $150,000      made available to the City of Hayti, Pemiscot Consolidated      Public Water Supply District #1 for a water storage tank (as      described in the section entitled `STAG Infrastructure      Grants/Congressionally Priorities' on page 1264 of the joint      explanatory statement) shall be made available to Pemiscot      Consolidated Public Water Supply District #1 for a drinking      water source protection infrastructure project''.                                  ____                                                  U.S. Senate,                               Washington, DC, September 16, 2009.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     Chairman, Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related          Agencies, Senate Committee on Appropriations, Washington,          DC.     Senator Lamar Alexander,     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and          Related Agencies, Senate Committee on Appropriations,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Feinstein and Ranking Member Alexander: I am      writing to request your assistance in making a technical      correction to the Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying      the Interior portion of the Omnibus Appropriations Act for      Fiscal Year 2009. The Joint Explanatory Statement mistakenly      directs $400,000 from the Environmental Protection Agency's      (EPA) State and Tribal Assistance Grants (STAG) account to      the City of Lake Norden in South Dakota for wastewater      infrastructure improvements. I request your assistance in      correcting this description to reflect the fact that the Lake      Norden project involves drinking water infrastructure.       I certify that neither I nor my immediate family has a      pecuniary interest, consistent with the requirements of      Paragraph 9 of Rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate,      in any congressionally directed spending item that I      requested from the Committee on Appropriations for Fiscal      Year 2009.       Thank you for consideration of this request, and please      contact me if you require any additional information.           Sincerely,                                                      Tim Johnson,     United States Senate.                                  ____                                                  U.S. Senate,                               Washington, DC, September 24, 2009.

Lamar Alexander,     Ranking Member, Appropriations Subcommittee on The Interior,          Environment and Related Agencies, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Feinstein and Ranking Member Alexander: I      certify that neither I nor my immediate family has a      pecuniary interest in any of the congressionally directed      spending items that I have requested, including Senate      Amendment # 2501, consistent with the requirements of      paragraph 9 of Rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate      for the FY 2010 Department of Interior, Environment, and      Related Agencies Appropriations bill.
