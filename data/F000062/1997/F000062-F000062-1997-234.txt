 President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support this simple but strong legislation to protect our children.  This bill, sponsored by myself, Senator Boxer, and Senator Snowe, would provide three simple protections:  First, the bill would prohibit list brokers from selling personal information about children under 16 to anyone, without first getting the parent's consent.  All kinds of information about our children--more facts than most of us might think or hope for--is rapidly becoming available through these list brokers. It is only a matter of time before this information begins to fall into the wrong hands.  Last year, a reporter in Los Angeles was easily able to purchase parents' names, birth months and addresses for 5,500 children aged 1-12 in a particular neighborhood. The reporter used the name of a fictitious company, gave a non-working telephone number, had no credit card or check, and identified herself as Richard Allen Davis, the notorious murderer of Polly Klaas. When ordering the list, the company representative simply told her ``Oh, you have a famous name,'' and sent her the information C.O.D. This is simply unacceptable.  Second, the bill would give parents the authority to demand information from the list brokers who traffic in the personal data of their children--brokers will be required to provide parents with a list of all those to whom they sold information about the child, and must also tell the parent precisely what kind of information was sold.  If this personal information is out there, and brokers are buying and selling it back and forth, it is only reasonable that we allow parents to find out what information has been sold and to whom that information has been given.  Finally, this bill would prohibit list brokers from using prison labor to input personal information. This seems like common sense to most of us, but unfortunately the use of prison labor is not currently prohibited.  Last year when I introduced this bill, I spoke of the plight of Beverly Dennis, an Ohio grandmother who filled out a detailed marketing questionnaire about her buying habits for a mail in survey. She filled out the questionnaire when she was told that she might receive free product samples and helpful information. Rather than receiving product information, however, she soon began to receive sexually explicit, fact-specific letters from a convicted rapist serving time.  The rapist, writing from his prison cell, had learned the very private, intimate details about her life because he was keypunching her personal questionnaire data into a computer for a subcontractor. Ms. Dennis received letters with elaborate sexual fantasies, weaved around personal facts provided by her in the questionnaire. This bill would have prevented the situation from ever occurring.  Finally, Mr. President, this year I have included in the bill exemptions for sales to law enforcement organizations, the Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and to accredited colleges and universities. We received a great deal of input since we introduced the bill last June, and I believe we have addressed most of the concerns about our bill with these exemptions.  Schools will be able to get information about prospective students, law enforcement will be able to get the lists to help them find missing kids, and the Center for Missing and Exploited Children will be able to do likewise.  This bill is really very simple. Some marketing companies may be unhappy that the government is trying to legislate how they do business, but we have to weigh the safety and well-being of our children against the small inconvenience of requiring parental consent in these cases. Given the rapidly changing nature of the marketing business and the ways in which child molesters and other criminals operate, this bill is an important step in protecting our kids from those who would do them harm.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 504       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
