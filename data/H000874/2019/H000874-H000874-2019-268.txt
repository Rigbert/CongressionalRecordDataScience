 First of all, of course, there was no budget last year. There was a budget that was passed in the latter part of the year before, but that was for reconciliation purposes so that Republicans could pass their tax bill with less than 60 votes in the United States Senate. So I wouldn't go too far on the budget.  Republicans were in charge for 8 years, and they never had a budget. That doesn't mean we didn't pass one through the House, but there was never a budget. There was never a budget that was implemented, that I can remember, in the long term.                              {time}  1045  But that aside, as the gentleman probably knows, I, in January, started talking with his leadership, with Ranking Member Granger, with Senator McConnell, with Senator Shelby, with Senator Leahy, with Mrs. Lowey, and with our leadership about the necessity to reach an agreement on the level of discretionary spending, which we call the caps.  Clearly, as Senator McConnell pointed out in our discussions, the White House was a critical component of that because, as the gentleman knows, in order to change the sequester, which I think is one of the stupidest policies that we put in place, but in order to change the sequester, we would have to have a bill signed by the President. So, clearly, the President would have to be involved.  Unfortunately, sometime thereafter, Mr. Vought and Mr. Mulvaney suggested that we ought to go to sequester, that we ought to just march to the sequester numbers.  For the Members who may not know exactly what that means, that means a $54 billion cut in defense spending. I don't really think anybody in this House thinks that is an appropriate step for us to take, but that is what Mr. Mulvaney and Mr. Vought of OMB suggested, except, by the way, they crossed their fingers to say we will use $180 billion of additional deficit spending out of the overseas contingency operations to fund defense.  In other words, yes, we will do the sequester, but it will really only have an effect on the nondefense, education, healthcare, medical research, law enforcement, et cetera. It would only have an effect on that side of the budget.  I didn't think that made much sense. And, very frankly, I think all of the people that I just mentioned that I had talked to didn't think it made sense either.  Obviously, Paul Ryan, when he was Speaker, didn't think it made sense, because he led a deal with Senator Murray to give us numbers that we thought were reasonable, and we came to an agreement.  I would hope that we could do that now. I know there are some negotiations at the top four level and in the White House that have not reached agreement yet. I think that is unfortunate.  Now, the gentleman observed that we haven't passed a budget. He is correct. But we did pass the exact same number that the Budget Committee reported out for discretionary spending, and we adopted it in the rule.  He is right; we did not adopt it in the budget as it was offered, but that wasn't necessary, because in either event, that wouldn't have solved the problem.  But we adopted the same exact number, the Democrats voted for that number, to which the committee marked its bills. As the gentleman knows, that was $733 billion on defense and $639 billion on nondefense. There was some argument on our side as to whether those numbers ought to be closer together, but that aside, that is what those bills have been.  So there is a number, and it was a number that was used by the Appropriations Committee, and it is a number that is reflected in the bills that we will be bringing to the floor.  Now, of course we could wait, as I think, frankly, the White House wants us to wait, until September, maybe September 27, 28, or 29, and then they would say: Well, we are going to do a CR at last year's numbers.  Now, that would be a little more than sequester, no doubt about that, but it would not be a number that I think the Members of this House on either side of the aisle would be happy with--maybe for different reasons but, nevertheless, not happy with.  So I am in agreement that we need to reach a number. We need to pass a bill, because, if we do not, under the law that we passed some years ago, 15 days after the first session of this Congress adjourns, sequester will automatically go into effect.  Nobody would be happy. America will not be happy. Our security will suffer and our people will suffer under those numbers. So I am in full agreement that we ought to reach a number.  Now, with respect to the appropriations bills, I think we need to move them. Obviously, there is going to be a lot of negotiation back and forth, a lot of different steps will need to be taken. But this is a first step; it is an important step; and it sets a marker as to where we are going to start negotiations.  Hopefully, those negotiations will bear fruit with the Senate and with the White House, because I know the gentleman shares my view that shutting down the government is not an option that we ought to be pursuing. Hopefully, we, through these actions, can preclude that from happening, and I think that will be a positive result.
