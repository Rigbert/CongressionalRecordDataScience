President, I represent to Members of the Senate that my description of this amendment is very simple. Senator Grassley is on the floor, and I can say his hearings before the Select Committee on Aging regarding predatory lending have inspired us to offer this amendment. Some of the statements he made during the course of those hearings about the abuses of predatory lending and the victims across America have led us to offer an amendment on the floor of the Senate to the bankruptcy bill to say these people who are taking advantage of otherwise good citizens should not be allowed the protection of the bankruptcy court. If they violate the law in creating this debt, they shouldn't be able to hide behind the bankruptcy law when they go to court.  I hope even my friends in this Chamber who feel very strongly about the credit and financial industry, during the course of the consideration of this debate on this amendment, will at least find some sympathy and understanding for people such as those I have described--good, hard-working Americans living in retirement who have been victimized by people engaged in illegal practices. I hope we can adopt this amendment as part of the reform of our bankruptcy system to keep in mind some of the victims of the credit system from some of the worst perpetrators.  I yield the floor.
