 President, I am going to offer an amendment to this bill regarding the report of the independent counsel on Mr. Cisneros. I know there has been much talk about the need to bring to a close the independent counsel's work, and I agree.  I tell my colleagues, as a radio announcer would say, about the rest of the story.
