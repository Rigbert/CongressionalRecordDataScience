Speaker, I have said before that people sent us here to exercise common sense, fiscal responsibility.                              {time}  1430  I am one of those who has no problem standing because I have voted consistently for the objective that many of us in this body seek, and that is a balanced budget.  The objective that many seek, that is to balance the budget in 7 years and honestly score that balance so it is real or at least as real as we can make a 7-year projection.  This vote now, for the first time, is going to give us the opportunity of doing what it seems to me from a nonpartisan, bipartisan, nonpolitical perspective makes common sense, and that is to have Government work while we are in recess or adjourned, probably in recess until January 2.  There will be no greater pressure on the negotiators if Government is shut down. After 13 days of shutting down the Government, we ought to understand by now that the principles held by both parties are held strongly and are deemed to be in the best interests of America and our people. Those negotiators, who are the highest leaders of both our parties, I think are going to be working in good faith.  There are real differences, but I suggest to Members on both sides that it makes no common sense to hold hostage the operation of the people's Government. We are attempting to selectively reduce the adverse consequence of that irresponsible action for veterans, for those in need of AFDC health, for the District of Columbia government to run as every one of our governments expects to run, without us arbitrarily and capriciously telling them they cannot spend their own money.  But I would ask everybody on both sides of the aisle to vote for this motion to recommit, and I would tell my friends that I have thousands of non-Federal employees who have been laid off as a result of this action who are not going to be reimbursed. Look at the front page of the papers. There are contractors in every city in America, large and small, who have been told, ``Sorry, you better tell your employees to go home,'' and they are not Federal employees. And they are in Oklahoma, and they are in Florida, and California and New York, and, yes, they are in the Washington metropolitan region where, by the way, we only have 15 percent of the Federal employees. Eighty-five percent are throughout America.  Contractors are saying to me, ``What are you people doing? You have asked me to do a job. I have entered into a contract with you, and now you are telling me I cannot do the work that you have contracted me for.''  My colleagues, the American public expects us to make common sense. I ask all of my colleagues, not just for Federal employees, not just for those who have contracts with the Federal Government, but for every American who would like to believe that it can send us here to Washington to make policy rationally, reasonably, and with equity and openness with one another, to vote for this motion to recommit. Put the Government back to work, continue our negotiations. And I will come back here with you, as I have this year and in years past, and support policies to affect what all of us believe are important for our children and for our grandchildren, getting our fiscal house in order. But putting it out of order by this unwise policy ought to be rejected.  Vote for the motion to recommit. It makes common sense.
