The major players in the private nongovernment-backed student loan market: SLM let me translate--formerly known as Sallie Mae, Discover Financial Services, Wells Fargo, and PNC Financial Services. Even with the defaults, if there are defaults on these loans, these loans are protected because they continue forever.  I do not know if my colleagues will join me in this, but all I ask them to do is go home and please talk to some ofthe families in their States, and they will find this student loan crisis is not just something manufactured by politicians; it is real, and we are complicit in it. When we allow low-performing and worthless schools to receive Federal aid to education, students and their families are lured into believing these are real schools.  Go to the Internet and put in the words ``college'' or ``university,'' click the mouse and watch what happens. You will be inundated with ads from for-profit schools.

One of them ran a television ad here in Washington--I think they have taken it off the air now--that showed this lovely young girl who was in her bedroom in her pajamas with her laptop computer on the bed.
