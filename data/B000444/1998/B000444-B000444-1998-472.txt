  I agree fully, as the Senator knows from our many discussions on the United Nations and some disagreements relative to the United Nations, that I, like he, believe we do not get sufficient credit. He may remember the debate we had in the committee where I found myself at odds with some of my colleagues who share my view that we, in fact, owe a good deal of money and should pay it.  I take issue, for the record, with my friend from Minnesota about his characterization of what a terrible job the administration has done. I do not believe that is the case. I believe that Secretary Albright, when she was at the United Nations, and others have never failed to point out the extent of our involvement.  I do not think we should confuse apples and oranges here. The truth of the matter is there are certain things that are U.N. sanctioned and there are other things that are U.N. administered. When folks wear blue helmets, everybody gets repaid. When they are not wearing blue helmets, they do not get repaid unless it is a chapter 7 undertaking administered by the U.N. I will not bore my colleagues with the details that relates to, but let me say we are not the only country who has acted unilaterally under the cover of or with the sanction of a U.N. resolution. There are other countries who have done so and have not been reimbursed for their contributions, from France to Germany to Great Britain.  For example, in 1994 voluntary expenditures by France amounted to $747.5 million, for which they did not seek reimbursement; Italy, $347.7 million, et cetera. We by far and away are the biggest of the contributing noncredit-given countries in the United Nations, I acknowledge that. And I think we should be doing what the Senator from North Carolina is saying: We should make it clear, in part to our folks as well as the rest of the world, that we do a great deal more than we get credit for.  I further say that we could amend--and I am not going to --we could amend this resolution to ask the world body to understand that there are other tens of billions, hundreds of billions, we spend that are not under any U.N. auspices, that are done for the good of the world, that we get no credit for.  It is true we do not get sufficient credit. But I respectfully suggest that it should not be confused with whether or not we owe or do not owe what we agreed to under the deal we signed up to when we joined the United Nations. I make a distinction here. No state receives credit against assessments for unilateral activities in support of U.N. security council resolutions which represent a majority of the U.S. cost incurred during the period my friend from Minnesota is talking about.  Again, I will ask unanimous consent a written statement be printed in the Record to explain in more detail the points I know my colleagues understand but maybe the public at large, listening to the truncated debate on my part, may not understand.  For example, let me conclude with this. Italy just spent a lot of money on Albania under a U.N.-sanctioned resolution. Now, Italy did it because if Albania goes bad, Italy is in trouble. Italy has a real problem, a serious problem. It was in their overwhelming interest to see to it that things did not deteriorate more than they did in Albania. So the rest of the world did what they always do with us--they kind of stood by a little bit, and we held Italy's coat, in effect, and we said, ``OK, you go ahead, you go ahead and spend that money. We know basically it is in your interest. You would want to do it even if there were no U.N. resolution authorizing you to do that. You would still want to do it, because it is in your overwhelming interest and it is in the world's interest.''  The no-fly zone in Iraq. We have used an attenuated rationale--which I think we should have--to enforce the no-fly zone. We are paying for the bulk of that, the United States of America. It is not because the rest of the world is saying, go in and enforce the no-fly zone. Half the United Nations might say, don't enforce the no-fly zone. The reason they do not want to pay, the reason it is not a blue helmet operation, they could not get the United Nations to go along.  Here is a case where we believe it is in our overwhelming naked self-interest to enforce the no-fly zone, because oil in that region of the world is as big a deal to us as it is to the rest of the world. Granted, it benefits the whole world, but we are big boys. We have to grow up. We have to understand there are certain times when we do things and expend money that incidentally benefits other people but we would do even if the United Nations was not around.  So the technical distinction that is made in reimbursement is between--to overstate it in the interest of time--a blue helmet being worn and us going in and doing it with the sanction of the United Nations, saying, ``OK, we have a resolution that says it is OK to do that.'' There are two different deals.  So we should do what is being proposed. I am voting with my leader on this issue. He is correct. But let's not get carried away, as I respectfully suggest my friend from Minnesota maybe has in terms of how, (a), the administration has done nothing to make clear our contributions, and (b), that somehow this is the same as what is owed by us and we are trading apples for apples. They are apples and oranges. Maybe we should change the way the charter reads. Maybe we should change it to say, ``Anything done under the guise of''--or ``under the umbrella of a U.N.-sanctioned operation should be given credit for.'' Maybe we should say that. I am not sure we want to say that, because we may find a lot of folks involved in things we do not want to have to contribute to but maybe we should. But it does not say that now. That is not the way it works now.  Mr. President, I compliment my friend, and I do not disagree with the underlying thrust of what my friend from Minnesota is saying, that we do not get enough credit. We do not get enough credit. If we do not get up there and beat our chest a little bit about what we are doing, sure in the heck, no one else will give us credit for it. I think it should at least be done now in part, quite frankly, and you might consider this typically--my friend from North Carolina would be too polite to say this--kind of a typically Biden view of this thing in the following respect: I think it is important to do this now, because we haven't paid.  In other words, I am so upset about us not having met our obligations thatwe signed on to, coupled with the damage I think it is doing to our ability to get other things that are in our naked self-interest done in the United Nations, that at least this might, by advertising what we have done, sort of take the stinger out of the rhetoric that is going around up in the United Nations that we do not do anything, that we are the bad guys, we are the pariah, we are the total deadbeat. That is one of the reasons why I am glad we are doing it.  I do not think we should confuse what we have done in other areas, and I will list for the Record what they are. I am sure my colleagues already know how we get to the $2,972,938,000. They are: Former Yugoslavia and Iraq operations, including Able Sentry, Deny Flight, IFOR/SFOR operations, Southern Watch, Sentinel, and Provide Comfort. They basically relate to what was cited here, the former Yugoslavia and Iraq, and with the exception of Able Sentry, I think we would find that each of the things we have done in there that have not been compensated for are things we pushed to have done.  There is resistance at the United Nations and in NATO to do --we brought them around through, in effect, sanctioning us to do this.  I end by saying I think my colleagues would probably be apoplectic if everything we did in order to get reimbursed we had Americans with blue helmets on. I think you would all be up here going bananas if that were the case. Be careful what you wish for; you may get it.  In this case, I think it is worth making the case, I think you overstate the criticism of the administration.  I thank the chairman of the full committee for allowing me, and I thank my friend from North Carolina for allowing me to be part of this amendment.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the written material that I referred to earlier be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               The Under Secretary of Defense,                                Washington, DC, February 13, 1998.     Hon. Jesse Helms,     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: As required by Section 8091 of the      Department of Defense Appropriations Act for 1997, I enclose      a report on costs incurred by the Department of Defense ``in      implementing or supporting resolutions of the United Nations      Security Council.'' Specifically, the report provides      incremental costs for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1997      as well as cumulative costs for the 1997 fiscal year to the      end of the fourth quarter. The report also provides      information on efforts the Department has made to be      reimbursed for troop contributions and provision of services      and commodities to U.N. peacekeeping operations.       We take seriously our commitment to provide data to the      Congress regarding the costs incurred in support of U.N.      activities. I trust that you will find the enclosed report to      be a useful summary of the costs that the Department has      incurred in support of U.N. activities as well as the      Department's efforts to seek reimbursement for these      activities.           Sincerely yours,                                               Walter B. Slocombe.       Enclosure: as stated.  Report to the Congress for the Fourth Quarter, Fiscal Year 1997 in     Compliance With Section 8091, Defense Appropriations Act of 1997       The DoD Appropriations Act for 1997 (Act) requires the      Secretary of Defense to submit a report at the end of each      quarter indicating ``all costs (including incremental costs)      incurred by the Department of Defense (DoD) during the      preceding quarter in implementing or supporting resolutions      of the United Nations Security Council.'' The data included      herein are provided in response to section 8091.       The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) compiles      incremental costs associated with United States military      operations based on data provided by the military departments      and defense agencies. These data were modified, as necessary,      to properly reflect transfer actions and unreported costs      applicable to support to U.N. operations. Data are presented      below in both quarterly and cumulative (for the fiscal year)      format. It is important to note that DFAS cost reports      include information received during a particular quarter of      the fiscal year: comprehensive cost data are not available in      the immediately succeeding quarter. The Department collects      only incremental costs, which are defined as additional costs      to the DoD component appropriations that would not have been      incurred if a contingency operation had not been supported.      All incremental costs included below are current as of 30      September 1997, and are aggregated for FY97, and exclude      reimbursements received for troop contributions (section 2),      which are presented individually.------------------------------------------------------------------------                                        Reported for 4Q   Cumulative for           Operation/Region                   FY97       FY97 through 4Q------------------------------------------------------------------------Former Yugoslavia Operations:                                             ABLE SENTRY (FYROM).................       $2,950,000      $11,727,000  DENY FLIGHT/DECISIVE EDGE...........       30,101,000      183,266,000  IFOR/SFOR Operations................      779,316,000    2,087,518,000SOUTHERN WATCH/VIGILANT SENTINEL                                         (Iraq)...............................      185,499,000      597,312,000PROVIDE COMFORT/NORTHERN WATCH (Iraq).       20,627,000       93,115,000                                       ---------------------------------      Total...........................    1,018,493,000    2,972,938,000------------------------------------------------------------------------       The Act requires the Secretary of Defense to ``detail in      the quarterly reports all efforts made to seek credit against      past United Nations expenditures and all efforts made to seek      compensation from the United Nations for costs incurred by      the Department of Defense in implementing and supporting      United Nations activities.''       The Administration's policy is to seek reimbursement, or      compensation as the Act terms it, for all allowable costs of      participation in U.N. peacekeeping operations. There are two      instances in which costs are allowable: (1) costs related to      troop contributions to U.N. peacekeeping operations, and (2)      provision of services and commodities to United Nations      peacekeeping operations. The provision of services and      commodities occurs under a process known as the Letter of      Assist (LOA). The LOA process is similar to a contract      between the USG and the UN whereby the USG agrees to provide      support to the U.N. with the understanding that the U.N. will      provide reimbursement under established terms. Only      expenditures in support of a peacekeeping operation conducted      by the U.N. approved by the Security Council and authorized      by the General Assembly (through its annual budget approval      process) as a legitimate charge to the UN are eligible for      reimbursement. No state receives credit against assessments      for unilateral activities ``in support of'' UN Security      Council resolutions, which represent the majority of U.S.      costs incurred during this reporting period.       Information regarding billings and reimbursements for the      fourth quarter of fiscal year 1997 is provided below. Data on      reimbursable support are divided into two sections. The first      section accounts for the provision of defense articles and      services. The Department of Defense submits bills to the U.N.      for these articles and services on a monthly basis. The      second section identifies reimbursements to the United States      Government for troop contributions to a U.N.-mandated and      assessed peace operation. The United Nations reimburses troop      contributors for specific United Nations peacekeeping      operations on a periodic basis depending on the availability      of funds. No troop-contributing government submits bills for      troop reimbursements. Rather, the U.N. reimburses governments      on its own initiative when sufficient funds are available to      pay all contributors to a particular mission for at least a      one-month increment; all member states involved in a      particular mission are reimbursed for troop contributions      simultaneously. Reimbursements for incremental troop      contribution costs are made by the U.N. directly to the      Department of Defense. The Department of Defense has      determined that its incremental costs are $318 per soldier      per month.
