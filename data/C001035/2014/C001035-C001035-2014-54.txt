President, I rise in support of the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act, S. 2262. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this legislation, which would build on previous energy efficiency legislation and proposes cost-effective mechanisms to support the adoption of off-the-shelf efficiency technologies for buildings, manufacturers, and the Federal Government.  As honorary vice-chair of the Alliance to Save Energy, I have been a long-time proponent of efforts to improve energy efficiency. Encouraging the adoption of energy efficiency measures is one of the easiest yet most effective mechanisms for reducing energy consumption, lessening pollution, and ultimately saving families, businesses, and the Federal Government money.  Legislation to improve the Nation's energy policy is long overdue. I would like to congratulate the bill sponsors, Senators Shaheen and Portman, for crafting this bipartisan, commonsense bill and for their tireless efforts in working with the leadership of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to bring this bill to the Senate floor once again. This has not been an easy feat. After an earlier version of the bill was left unfinished last year, the bill sponsors did not give up and have continued to work diligently to build additional support by incorporating several previously filed amendments. While I share the general frustration expressed by some that Congress should be considering a more comprehensive energy policy, we must not use this as a reason to impede passage of this energy efficiency bill.  The provisions in S. 2262 will kick-start the use of energy efficiency technologies that are commercially available now and can be deployed by residential, commercial, and industrial energy users. The bill will also improve the energy efficiency of the Federal Government, which is the largest energy consumer in the country. Given today's challenging fiscal environment, it is notable that all authorizations included in S. 2262 are fully offset.  I am pleased to have co-authored two provisions that are incorporated into the base bill. First, I joined my colleague, the Senator from Colorado, Mr. Udall, in authoring a provision that would provide a streamlined, coordinating structure for schools to help them better navigate existing Federal energy efficiency programs and financing options. This would be particularly helpful for rural schools in States such as Maine and would help these institutions save money in the face of rising energy costs. Decisions about how best to meet the energy needs of their schools, however, would still appropriately be made by the States, school boards, and local officials.  The second provision that I am pleased to have authored with my colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Whitehouse, would authorize a pay-for-success pilot program allowing the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, to enter into agreements with private investors for energy and water efficiency improvements to project-based rental assistance and housing for the elderly and disabled. This budget-neutral approach would leverage private investment to finance energy efficiency retrofits for certain HUD-assisted properties and help cut utility costs for the Federal Government.  I would have liked an open amendment process. One amendment I am pleased to have worked on with my colleagues from Delaware, Senator Coons, and Rhode Island, Senator Reed, would reauthorize and extend the core Weatherization Assistance Program and State Energy Program activities at the Department of Energy through 2018, develop a competitive grant program for non-profits to carry out weatherization projects, and require minimum professional standards for weatherization contractors and workers. I am a long-time supporter of weatherization, which plays an important role in permanently reducing home energy costs for low-income families and seniors in all States, lessening our dependence on foreign oil, and training a skilled workforce. Weatherizing homes and reducing energy costs are particularly important for a State like Maine, which has the oldest housing stock in the Nation and a high dependence on home heating oil. Our amendment, had we been allowed to offer it, would have further increased the energy savings from this bill.  Nevertheless, the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy has released new analysis demonstrating that S. 2262 would save consumers and businesses and the government with a cumulative net savings of nearly $100 billion by 2030, support thousands of new jobs by cutting government and industrial energy waste and assisting homeowners in financing energy efficiency improvements, and reduce emissions significantly.  S. 2262 has the support of a broad coalition of stakeholders, including energy efficiency, business, and environmental organizations, small and large businesses, utilities, and public interest groups. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of S. 2262 and urge its swift passage.                          ____________________
