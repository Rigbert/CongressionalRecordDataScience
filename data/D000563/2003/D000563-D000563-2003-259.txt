 I would like to ask through the Chair, I certainly will be ready to yield whenever he would like to ask me a question because I think this is an important part of the debate, but I ask my colleague if he is aware of two things. First, the amendment I am going to offer will take the $13 million out of the school voucher program and divide it equally among the public and charter schools. The money goes back into public and charter schools, so they will end up with about $20 million each, instead of $13 million.  Mr. DeWINE. In response, I have not seen the amendment of my colleague.
