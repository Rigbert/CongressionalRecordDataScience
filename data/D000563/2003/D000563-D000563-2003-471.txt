KENNEDY. I also reference a really excellent article in U.S. News and World Report from June 30 that shows on a chart what has been happening with premiums going from $2.9 billion to $4.9 billion and, on the other hand, points out insurers' payments after the jury verdict was $147 billion in 1993 and in the year 2001, $172 billion--so basically a fairly flat line across almost a 10-year period, a dramatic increase in the premiums and virtually flat in terms of the payments.  I am glad to yield.
