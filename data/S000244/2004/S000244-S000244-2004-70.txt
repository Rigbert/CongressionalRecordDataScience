Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 10. On September 11, 2001, foreign terrorists attacked the United States without provocation in a failed effort to crush our spirit and our resolve.  In the last 3 years Congress has taken bold bipartisan steps to strengthen the ability of the law enforcement intelligence community to protect the American people against future terrorist attacks. The Committee on the Judiciary has played a central role in addressing vulnerabilities that the terrorists exploited on 9/11.  Bipartisan passage of the PATRIOT Act, the Barbara Jordan Immigration Reform and Accountability Act, the Homeland Security Act, and other legislation have made America safer; but there is still much more work to be done.  In November of 2002 President Bush created the bipartisan 9/11 Commission. I supported the President's creation of this independent commission, and I am pleased that this bill implements and addresses its recommendations and findings. H.R. 10 provides specific legislative substance to those recommendations. First, the creation of the National Intelligence Director, then the establishment of a National counterterrorism Center in title I are reforms that will ensure that the wall of separation between intelligence and law enforcement is never again exploited by terrorists. In addition, section 1112 codifies the laudable efforts of the FBI to better assist and thwart terrorist attacks before they occur.  The Judiciary sections in title II enhance penalties for terrorism hoaxes; increase penalties for supporting, financing, or cooperating with terrorist organizations; expand the scope of laws that prohibit the shipments or use of weapons of mass destruction; provide additional funding to combat terrorist financing; and enhance the use of biometrics to reduce terrorist threats against air travel.  Several 9/11 hijackers either should not have been admitted to the United States or violated the terms of their visas. Title III of the legislation contains important provisions to enhance border security and reduce opportunities for terrorists who enter and stay in the United States. As the 9/11 staff report on terrorist travel declared, ``The challenge for national security in an age of terrorism is to prevent the people who may pose overwhelming risk from entering the United States undetected.''  The Judiciary sections of title III require Americans returning from most parts of the Western Hemisphere to possess passports; require Canadians seeking entry into the United States to present a passport or other secure identification; authorize additional immigration agents and investigators; reduce the risk of identity and document fraud; provide for the expedited removal of illegal aliens; limit asylum abuse by terrorists; and streamline the removal of terrorists and other criminal aliens. These provisions reflect both commission recommendations andlegislation that was pending in the House.  Finally, I am pleased that this legislation safeguards the privacy and civil liberties of all Americans. These provisions establish a privacy officer in the office of the NID; require Federal agencies to prepare a privacy impact analysis during rulemaking process; and direct the head of each Federal agency with law enforcement or antiterrorism functions to appoint a chief privacy officer.                              {time}  1700  The bill reflects careful, thoughtful and principled consideration of the 9/11 Commission's bipartisan recommendations and staff report. Unlike some other proposals, this legislation does not merely transcribe sometimes vague proposals. Rather, it does the hard work of implementing the 9/11 Commission's recommendations with the legislative clarity and depth they deserve.  H.R. 10 also received the full committee deliberation that the House committee process provides. The committee process greatly enhanced the quality of this legislation.  America has so far been spared another large-scale attack within our border since 9/11. Yet the terror in Beslan, Russia, just weeks ago chillingly reminds us that the global threat of terrorism has not receded nor has the need for vigilance and foresight.  While much has already been done, much remains to be done. Passage of H.R. 10 will make America safer still, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  I am also happy to put in the Record, a letter dated October 7, 2004, from the 9/11 Families for a Secure America that states, ``we strongly support H.R. 10 and oppose all the alternatives that have been proposed. The reason is simple: H.R. 10 is the only bill that addresses the recommendations on pages 385-390 of the 9/11 Commission's report.'' I would include this letter in the Record at this point.                           9/11 Families for a Secure America,                              New York, New York, October 7, 2004.       Dear Members of the House of Representatives: Over the past      few weeks, several articles in the press and statements from      individuals have implied falsely that the families of victims      of the September 11, 2001, attacks support alternatives to      H.R. 10. Our organization, 9/11 Families for a Secure      America, represents hundreds of families of those murdered on      9/11, and we strongly support H.R. 10 and oppose all the      alternatives that have been proposed. The reason is simple:      H.R. 10 is the only bill that addresses the recommendations      on pages 385-90 of the 9/11 Commission's report.       Family members of 9/11 victims worked long and hard to have      an independent commission appointed to investigate the      attacks. Now that the Commission has completed its task and      presented Congress with its recommendations, we believe that      Congress must address all of the 41 recommendations,      including those relating to immigration policy. We will be      satisfied with nothing less.       All of the 9/11 family members with whom we have been in      contact agree that immigration reform is a key component of      the implementation of the Commission's recommendations.      Sadly, some of our elected officials have misled 9/11      families by convincing them that no legislation will pass      this year if we insist that immigration reform be part of it,      because immigration is simply ``too controversial.'' We are      appalled that any public official would suggest that national      security is ``too controversial'' to be addressed.       We applaud the House Leadership for making security their      top priority and we strongly urge all Members of the House to      support H.R. 10. We have read the immigration provisions in      H.R. 10, and we have compared them to the Commission's      recommendations. The provisions some have labeled      ``extraneous and unrelated'' are, in fact, clearly and      directly related to the Commission's findings and to      preventing terrorist attacks in this country. The simple fact      is that if the 9/11 terrorists have not been able to enter      the United States and operate freely in our country--to      obtain driver's licenses (over 60 licenses for 19 hijackers),      open bank accounts, rent homes and cars, and board      airplanes--they would not have been able to murder our loved      ones. To pretend otherwise is hypocritical; but more      importantly, it is an invitation to future terrorist attacks.       Members of Congress have promised us repeatedly over the      last three years that they would honor our loved ones who      were murdered by implementing the reforms needed to ensure      that Americans will never again face the same horror we live      with every day. We ask you to stand by your promise and pass      H.R. 10, rather than dishonoring us and our loved ones to      protect a status quo that aided the murderers who tore apart      our families on September 11, 2001.                      9/11 FSA Board of Directors       Peter & Jan Gadiel, Kent, CT, Parents of James, age 23.
