Chairman, our Nation needs bipartisan reform of Medicare, but instead today's bill will deliver a nationwide Medicare migraine. Instead of listening to our seniors, and our families, and to the inspector general, this is a cut first, ask questions later Medicare initiative, and the fraud section is a metaphor for the whole bill. Instead of legislation to protect seniors and taxpayers, it protects the crooks and the thieves. Instead of improving access to health care, it provides a freeway to fraud, and, my colleagues, think of the words of the nonpartisan fraud-buster at the Office of the Inspector General who said that this bill will cripple, it will cripple, efforts to bring justice.   Let me tell my colleagues it is possible to develop 21st century Medicare that works for seniors and taxpayers. Reject this bill and come with me to Oregon because I will show each of you programs that protect seniors, hold down costs, and insure that we have a path to the 21st century. We can do this job right. We can do it in a bipartisan way. But let us listen to our seniors and our taxpayers.
