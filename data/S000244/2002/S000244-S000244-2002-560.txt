 Madam Speaker, H.R. 1892, the Family Sponsor Immigration Act of 2001, was introduced by the two gentlemen from California (Mr. Calvert) and (Mr. Issa).  I want to thank them for bringing to our attention an unintended quirk in the Immigration and Nationality Act that needlessly keeps families separated. I also want to thank them as well for developing this bill, which corrects the problem.  Each year, the United States provides hundreds of thousands of immigrant visas for spouses and other family members of U.S. citizens and permanent residents. Tragically, each year a number of these U.S. citizens and permanent residents petitioning for their family members will die before the immigration process is complete.  Generally, INS regulations provide for automatic revocation of a petition when the petitioner dies. The consequences are severe for a beneficiary when his or her petitioner dies before the beneficiary has adjusted status or received an immigrant visa. If no other relative can qualify as a petitioner, then the beneficiary would lose the opportunity to become a permanent resident.  For instance, if a petition is revoked because a widowed citizen-father dies after petitioning for an adult unmarried daughter, the daughter would have no living mother to file a new petition. If another relative can file an immigrant visa petition for the beneficiary, that beneficiary would still go to the end of the line if the visa category was numerically limited.  For instance, if the daughter's mother was alive, she could file a new first family-preference petition. However, the daughter would lose her priority date based on the time her father's petition had been filed with the INS and would receive a later priority date based upon the filing date of her mother's petition.  Because of the severe consequences of the revocation of a visa petition, INS regulations do allow the Attorney General, in his or her discretion, to determine that, for humanitarian reasons, revocation would be inappropriate, and thus complete the unification of a family.  However, there is a complication. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 requires that when a family member petitions for a relative to receive an immigrant visa, the visa can only be granted if the petitioner signs a legally-binding affidavit of support promising to provide support of the immigrant.  If the petitioner has died, obviously he or she cannot sign the affidavit. Thus even in cases where the Attorney General feels a humanitarian waiver of the revocation of the visa petition is warranted, under current law a permanent resident visa cannot be granted because the affidavit requirement is unfulfilled.  H.R. 1892 solves this dilemma. It simply provides that in cases where the petitioner has died and the Attorney General has determined for humanitarian reasons that revocation of the petition would be inappropriate, a close family other than the petitioner would be allowed to sign the necessary affidavit of support.  Eligible family members in H.R. 1892, as it passed the House last July, would include spouses, parents, grandparents, mothers- and fathers-in-law, siblings, adult sons and daughters, adult sons and daughters-in-law, and grandchildren. Legal guardians would also be eligible.  The Senate passed a minor amendment to the bill to add brothers- and sisters-in-law, and this is the motion to concur in the amendment that is before the House today.                              {time}  1415  H.R. 1892 is humanitarian and pro-family. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
