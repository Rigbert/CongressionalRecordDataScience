Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to our country are exceptional. This country has been fortunate to have dedicated individuals who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make this country a safer and better place to live. Lieutenant General James E. Sherrard III is one of these individuals. Today, May 11, 2004, we should pause to honor him on the occasion of his retirement from the U.S. Air Force on May 31, 2004, after nearly 39 years of service.  Lieutenant General Sherrard was a distinguished graduate of the University of Mississippi's Reserve Officer Training Corps program and entered active duty in July of 1965. After flight school at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia, he became an instructor pilot at Sheppard Air Force Base in Texas and Eglin Auxiliary Field 3 in Florida. In September 1977, Lieutenant General Sherrard became the operations squadron for a C-130E squadron at Willow Grove Air Reserve Facility in Pennsylvania. Following this tour, he became the Assistant Deputy Commander, later, Deputy Commander for Operations of the 459th Tactical Airlift Wing at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland.  Since 1981, Lieutenant General Sherrard has commanded at the Group, Wing, and Air Force level including the 910th Tactical Airlift Group in Youngstown, Ohio, the 440th Tactical Airlift Wing at Billy Mitchell Field, Wisconsin, the 433rd Military Airlift Wing at Kelly Air Force Base, Texas, the 4th Air Force at McClellan Air Force Base, California, the 22nd Air Force at Dobbins Reserve Base in Georgia, and currently as the Chief of Air Force Reserve and Commander of the Air Force Reserve Command. He has accumulated more than 5,000 hours of flight time and has flown numerous aircraft including the T-41, T-37, T-38, C-130A/B/E/H, AC-130A, C-141B, and C-5A/B.

In addition to his dedication to his military career, Lieutenant General Sherrard is a member of the Air Force Association, the Reserve Officer Association, the Order of the Daedalians and the Airlift and Tanker Association.  Lieutenant General Sherrard's tireless passion for service to country and community has contributed immensely to the betterment of our nation's military and to the security of this nation. I am honored and proud to call him a fellow American and friend. I know that speaking for citizens across this country, I am grateful for his service and salute him as he moves on to the next chapter of his life.                          ____________________
