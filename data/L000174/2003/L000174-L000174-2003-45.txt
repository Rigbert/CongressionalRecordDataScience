President, over these past 24 hours, the American public has heard a lot of what one could generously describe as wishful thinking from the other side of the aisle about the history of the Senate in considering nominations, especially recent history of Republican obstruction when a Democrat was in the White House. Their efforts to re-write American history and the history of this Senate remind me of the old Soviet Union, re-writing its history books to suit the ruling party and erasing photos that would reveal inconvenient facts. Their misleading and wrong assertions have been made over and over and over again, perhaps in the hope that repetition would turn those falsehoods into fact. I think it is important for posterity to set the record straight.  Last night, echoing Republican press conference, Republicans took to the floor to claim that no judicial nominee had ever been filibustered or blocked from getting a confirmation vote in the history of the Senate. They made these assertions repeatedly while pointing to signs with the number zero printed on them. They refused to acknowledge that any judicial nominee has ever been filibustered, that any has ever been denied a confirmation vote, that any nominee for even a short-term position has ever been filibustered on the floor or filibustered in Committee. The repeated the party line from GOPUSA that ``no federal judicial nominee by the past 42 presidents has been filibustered in the history of the U.S. Senate dating back to 1784.'' I ask unanimous consent to place the following excerpt from the New York Times from 1968 into the Record about the filibuster in the Senate over the nomination of Justice Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, a letter signed by more than 60 law professors from across the country in support of the use of the filibuster of judicial nominees, and an important and outstanding letter from Professor Michael Gerhardt which thoroughly addresses the specious arguments being made about the use of the filibuster under our Constitution. I hope that this evidence would cause some of my colleagues to reconsider some of the false and misleading statements made by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. One can always hope.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the New York Times, Sept. 25, 1968]                   Precedent for Judicial Filibusters        Critics of Fortas Begin Filibuster, Citing ``Propriety''   Griffin Attack Lasts 3 Hours--Mansfield Backs Justice, but Scores Lecture Fee.                                  ____                                                     May 16, 2003.     Hon. Bill Frist and Tom Daschle,     U.S. Capitol,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Frist and Daschle: As law professors, we      write to express our opinion that the Senate's use of the      filibuster with respect to both legislation and nominations      is constitutional. Both the text of the Constitution and      historical practices strongly support the constitutionality      of the filibuster. Article I, Section 5 expressly provides,      ``Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings.''      Article I, Section 5 plainly authorizes the Senate to make      procedural rules. It empowers the Senate as well to delegate      what is sometimes final authority over the fate of      legislation and nominations to committees and their chairs.      The textual authority for the filibuster is precisely the      same as those for these other measures. If these measures are      constitutional, then so too is the filibuster.       The Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized the relevance      of historical practices for determining constitutionality.      The filibuster, understood as protracted debate precluding      final Senate consideration of a legislative matter, began      early in the history of the Republic. It has been used      frequently by senators from both parties with respect to      nominations as well as legislation. In fact, it has been used      effectively to defeat presidential nominations, including the      nominations of Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice of the United      States in 1968, Sam Brown to be Ambassador in 1994, and Henry      Foster to be Surgeon General in 1995. This longstanding      historical practice weighs heavily in support of the      filibuster's constitutionality.       The filibuster reflects the Senate's longstanding respect      for minority views and underscores the unique role of the      Senate as a part of American democracy. It has the salutary      effect of giving an incentive to all sides to seek compromise      on issues where points of view are sharply divided. With      regard to nominations to an independent branch of government      such as the judiciary, the filibuster encourages the      President to find common ground with the Senate by nominating      individuals who can garner consensus.       For these and other reasons, we conclude the filibuster is      constitutional.           Very truly yours,           (Signed by 60 Law Professors).                                  ____                                      University of North Carolina                                                School of Law,                                                November 10, 2003.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Dirksen Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: I understand that this week the      Republican leadership will be coordinating thirty hours of      debate about the legitimacy of the recent filibusters against      three of President Bush's judicial nominees. To assist you      (and the Senate) in this debate, I have taken the liberty of      providing below a revised version of my testimony earlier      this summer on behalf of the filibuster. The revised      testimony reflects my thinking and research on the subject      since my testimony in May and June. My continued thinking and      research on the filibuster     have clarified further the solid constitutional foundations      for filibustering judicial nominations. My hope is that this      revised testimony may help to set the record straight on the      Senate's longstanding commitments to allowing the filibuster      (against all kinds of nominations) and to amending its rules      in accordance with its rules.                           executive summary       The filibuster derives its authority from the Senate's      express power to design its own procedural rules to govern      its internal affairs and the Senate's consistent support for      its legitimacy. It is also one of many counter-majoritarian      features of the Senate, including the committee system and      unanimous consent requirements. If these practices are      constitutional, then so too is the filibuster.       While there have been many criticisms directed against the      filibuster in recent months, none has merit, in my opinion.      First, the most popular arguments against the filibuster are      circular, i.e., they simply assume their conclusion. The      arguments presume that some constitutional principle, such as      majority rule or anti-entrenchment, trumps the filibuster.      Then, operating from this premise, they set out to      demonstrate flaws in the arguments of the defenders of the      filibuster. Yet, exposing flaws in the other side's arguments      does not make an affirmative case for a constitutional      principle of majority rule or anti-entrenchment; it merely      shows imperfections in the defense of the filibuster. The      absence of support for the other side does not establish the      legitimacy of the case against the filibuster. Those      maintaining that the filibuster is illegitimate must show the      constitutional foundations for the principles on which they      are relying. Second, the arguments against the filibuster--     e.g., it violates majority rule--cannot be squared with the      constitutional structure as it was designed or has evolved.      Third, Article I of the Constitution contains no explicit or      implicit anti-entrenchment principle that would preclude the      Senate from adopting, for the sake of institutional      stability and order, certain procedural rules that carry      over from one session to the next and may only be altered      with super-majority approval. In fact, entrenchment is far      more consistent with our constitutional structure than      anti-entrenchment is. Entrenchment is much more the rule      rather than the exception in the legislative process. Even      legislative bodies such as the House that formally      reconstitute themselves as the outset of each new session      have pre-set agendas in place prior to any vote as to how      they should proceed to reconstitute themselves, what they      should do once they have formally reconstituted      themselves, the committees to which members need to be      assigned, how those assignments may take place, the      jurisdictions of those committees, and even the rules they      may select under which to operate. Moreover, given that      only a third of the Senate is up for re-election at any      one time, there is no ``new'' majority that comes into      power at the outset of a session who can credibly claim      any entitlement to vote on the rules under which it would      be operating throughout the session.       The filibuster is best understood as a classic example of a      non-reviewable, legislative constitutional judgment. It is a      practice that has the same claim to legitimacy as many      countermajoritarian practices within the Senate, including      the committee structure and unanimous consent requirements.      The Constitution permits all of these practices, but it does      not mandate any of them. These practices define the Senate's      uniqueness as a political institution, particularly its      historic commitments to various objectives--respecting the      equality of its membership and to minority viewpoints;      encouraging compromise on especially divisive matters; and      facilitating stability, order, and collegiality in the long      run. The principal checks on these practices, including the      filibuster, are political. They include the Senate Rules, the      need to maintain collegiality within the institution, and the      political accountability of senators for their support for,      or opposition to, filibusters.                                   I.       Neither the Constitution nor the Senate Rules expressly      mention, or mandate, the filibuster. Nevertheless, the best      starting place for understanding the authority for the      filibuster is Article I of the Constitution, which governs      and defines the powers of the Congress. In Article I, section      5, the Constitution provides, ``Each House [of the Congress]      may determine the Rules of its Proceedings.'' This section      plainly authorizes the Senate to make procedural rules,      including but not limited to the length of debate in the      Senate. This section further authorizes the Senate to      delegate official responsibility to smaller units (and even      individual members) within the Senate. Many of these      delegations allow committees and their Chairs to have what is      sometimes final say over the fates of legislation and      nominations. This same authority provides the support for      many informal senatorial practices such as senatorial      courtesy--in which individual senators may make      recommendations to the President on the people whom he should      nominate to federal offices in their respective states--as      well as the blue-slip process that has traditionally allowed      individual senators with the means by which to nullify      nominations to judgeships within their respective states. In      addition, a single senator may place a ``hold'' on      legislation or a nomination, postponing consideration to a      later date. The filibuster derives its legitimacy from the      same authority that allows for each of these other      legislative practices--Article I, Section 5, which empowers      the Senate to implement procedural rules, including the      specific rule governing the procedure for cloture, Rule XXII.      If these practices are constitutional, then so too is the      filibuster.       The other, possible authority for the filibuster is      historical practices. The filibuster has been employed, in      one form or another, as extended debate in the Senate      throughout the history of the Senate. In fact, ``the      strategic use of delay in debate is as old as the Senate      itself. The first recorded episode of dilatory debate      occurred in 1790, when senators from Virginia and South      Carolina filibustered to prevent the location of the first      Congress in Philadelphia.'' While the First Congress allowed      a so-called motion for the previous question which could      not be debated, its name was misleading. In practice,      ``the previous question motion was seldom used before the      Senate abolished it in 1806;'' and it rarely succeeded in      silencing those senators determined to continue the      debate. Instead, the motion tended, once made, to end      debate by requiring the removal of the matter being      debated from the Senate agenda. Thus, it did not force a      vote but rather forced the Senate to move onto other      business. Moreover, the availability of this motion did      not prevent the Senate from continuing to permit      protracted debate to delay floor votes. The eminent      biographer Robert Caro explains the history of the      filibuster subsequent to the abolition of the previous      question motion:       ``For many years after 1806--for 111 years, to be precise--     the only way a senator could be made to stop talking so that      a vote could be taken on a proposed measure was if there were      unanimous consent that he do so, an obvious impossibility.      And there took place therefore so many `extended discussions'      of measures to keep them from coming to a vote that the      device got a name, `filibuster,' from the Dutch vrijbuiter,      which means `freebooter' or `pirate,' and which passed into      the Spanish as filibustero, because the sleek, swift ship      used by the Caribbean pirates was called filibote, and into      legislative parlance because the device was, after all, a      pirating, or highjacking, of the very heart of the      legislative process.''       In other words, the practice in the Senate from 1806 until      1917 allowed the smallest minority possible with the Senate--     a single senator--to bar a floor vote on any legislative      matter by engaging in an extended speech. During this period,      every floor vote required unanimous consent.       The Senate first, formally curbed the practice of endless      debate in 1917, after eleven senators had successfully      filibustered President Woodrow Wilson's proposal to arm      American merchantmen against German submarine attacks. At      President Wilson's urging, the Senate passed Rule XXII, which      allows debate upon a ``pending'' matter to be terminated      when, after a petition for such ``cloture'' was presented by      sixteen senators and approved by two-thirds of the senators      present and voting. In subsequent years, senators from both      parties have used the filibuster to block a floor vote on a      wide range of legislation. From 1917 until 2000, cloture was      invoked 193 times out of the 545 times it was attempted.      During the period from 1927 through 1962, the Senate did not      invoke cloture once. In this period, conservative senators      repeatedly used the filibuster to block civil rights      legislation, provoking liberal senators to denounce the      filibuster as illegitimate and conservative senators to      defend it. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, conservatives      and liberals switched positions on the filibuster: Liberal      senators used the filibuster to block centerpieces of      President Nixon's social and economic agenda while many      conservative senators questioned its legitimacy. After Bill      Clinton became president, a series of Republican filibusters      blocked by aspects of his legislative agenda, including a      comprehensive bill providing for national health care reform.      Nevertheless, the filibuster has endured, with the most      recent reform occurring in 985 when a super-majority within      the Senate approved an amendment to Rule XXII requiring only      three-fifths, rather than two-thirds, of the Senate as the      requisite number to invoke cloture.       Throughout the long history of its deployment in the      Senate, the filibuster has not been restricted to delaying      floor votes only on legislation. It has been often used to      thwart presidential nominations. The first, recorded instance      in which it was clearly and unambiguously employed to defeat      a judicial nomination occurred in 1881. At the time,      Republicans held a majority of the seats in the Senate but      were unable to end the filibuster, which had been employed      near the end of the legislative session, the preclude a floor      vote on President Rutherford B. Hayes' nomination of Stanley      Matthews to the Supreme Court. Though Matthews eventually      served as an Associate Justice, it was only because Hayes'      Republican successor, President James Garfield, re-nominated      Matthews in the next legislative session. (There were also      nine other occasions in the nineteenth century when the      Senate held no floor votes on Supreme Court nominations.) A      recent Congressional Research Service study shows that from      1949 through 2002, senators have employed the filibuster      against 35 presidential nominations, on 21 of which senators      had sought and invoked cloture. 17 of the 35 nominations      filibustered were to Article III     courts. All 21 nominations on which cloture was invoked were      eventually confirmed. Of the 14 nominations on which cloture      was sought but not invoked, 11 were eventually confirmed. For      instance, Republican senators filibustered President      Clinton's nominations of Walter Dellinger to head the Office      of Legal Counsel in the Justice Department and Janet      Napolitano to be U.S. Attorney for Arizona, but eventually      the Senate confirmed both nominees--Dellinger after      Republican senators relinquished their opposition to his      nomination and Napolitano after the Senate voted 72-26 on a      cloture motion to end the filibuster against her nomination.      Four of the 35 filibustered nominations failed altogether--     then-Associate Justice Abe Fortas to be Chief Justice and      Judge Homer Thornberry to be an Associate Justice in 1968,      Sam Brown to be Ambassador in 1994, and Dr. Henry Foster to      be Surgeon General in 1995. Other nominations have failed      without having been formally filibustered, as Senator Jesse      Helms' threat of a filibuster nullified President Clinton's      intention to nominate then-Assistant Attorney General Walter      Dellinger as Solicitor General. Another dramatic use of the      filibuster occurred when Republican senators filibustered      five of President Clinton's nominations to the State      Department in order to gain leverage in a dispute over      whether the State Department adequately investigated      allegations that a former Clinton campaign worker who later      served in the department had improperly searched the records      of 160 former political appointees and publicly disclosed the      contents of two of the files. As John McGinnis and Michael      Rappaport concluded in their extended study of the      Constitution's super-majority voting requirements, ``the      continuous use of filibusters since the early Republic      provides compelling support for their constitutionality.
