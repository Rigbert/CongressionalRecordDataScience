President, there is an issue that needs to be addressed in WRDA that is not addressed by this bill. On June 12, 2000, the Administration sent us a report on the management of the Corps of Engineers' hopper dredge fleet. It says that efforts initiated by Congress in WRDA 96 have been successful. That legislation moved more of the routine maintenance dredging to the private sector and increased the Corps emergency response capability. In their report, the Corps recommended a plan that would move a little more work to the private sector while rehabilitating the oldest federal hopper dredge for emergency response purposes. While it may be questionable whether or not the benefit of this federal investment is worth the cost, I am willing to implement the Corps recommendations in order to get the management and emergency response improvements that are described in the report to Congress. After receiving the report, I requested legislative language from the Corps that they provided to me. I have been attempting to work with interested members to get this language, or possibly other compromise language, adopted in this legislation. I do not understand why the Corps recommendation is not considered a victory by the supporters of this federal dredge. The Corps strongly believes that their recommendation is a win-win for the nation's ports and the ports along the Delaware River as well as the nation's taxpayers. While I am not offering an amendment here today, I want my colleagues to know that this is an issue that I am going to pursue. I hope that we will be able to work something out in the conference committee. Thank you very much. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important national issue.
