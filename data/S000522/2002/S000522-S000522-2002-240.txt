Mr. Speaker, in a ceremony on Wednesday, September 18, 2002, in the Committee on Veterans' Affairs hearing room, Dr. Douglas Noffsinger, Chief, Office of Audiology and Speech Pathology, VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, Los Angeles, California, and Dr. Rory Cooper, Director, Rehabilitation Research and Development Center, VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, Pittsburgh, PA, each received an Olin E. Teague Award for their efforts on behalf of disabled veterans.  The Teague Award is presented annually to a VA employee (or employees) whose achievements have been of extraordinary benefit to veterans with service-connected disabilities, and is the highest honor presented by VA in the field of rehabilitation.  Dr. Noffsinger was selected to receive this prestigious award in honor of his significant contributions to the rehabilitation of veterans with hearing loss, one of the most common disabilities resulting from military service. His efforts have been multi-faceted and include cutting-edge research, establishing national practice algorithms for selecting and fitting hearing aids, and developing guidelines to assure that all veterans needing hearing aids have equal access to treatment. Dr. Noffsinger is commended for his leadership role in formulating national clinical practice guidelines for selecting and fitting hearing aids that have been accepted as official policy by the professional associations that represent all private and public sector audiologists.  Rory A. Cooper, Ph.D., was recognized with a Teague Award for his major contributions tothe rehabilitation of paralyzed individuals, in the design of the modern wheelchairs, for his promotion of the understanding of secondary disabilities among wheelchair users, and for his persistent efforts to improve the availability of high quality products and services to veterans who use wheelchairs. Dr. Cooper's work has affected thousands of veterans by elevating the quality of the wheelchair produced by manufacturers and provided by the VA and other third party payers. Dr. Cooper is one of the world's foremost authorities in wheelchair design and technology. His impact on the lives of people with disabilities has been, and will continue to be, truly profound.  Mr. Speaker, the name Olin E. ``Tiger'' Teague is synonymous with exemplary service to the Nation's veterans. The late Congressman Teague served on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs for 32 years, 18 of those years as its distinguished chairman. No one who worked with him on veterans' issues ever had to ask why he was called ``Tiger.'' He set the standards by which we can best serve all veterans. I know my colleagues join me in offering our deep appreciation to Dr. Noffsinger and Dr. Cooper for their concern, dedication, and innovation in meeting the special rehabilitation needs of veterans. We congratulate Dr. Noffsinger and Dr. Cooper for the excellence of their work and for the distinguished award they received.                          ____________________
