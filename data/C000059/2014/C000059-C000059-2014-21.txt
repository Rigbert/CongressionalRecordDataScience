Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to a dear friend of mine, Walter Ehlers. Walter passed away on Thursday, February 20, 2014. A long time resident of California, he was a pillar of the community and he will be deeply missed.  Walter was born May 7, 1921, in Junction City, Kansas, and was raised from humble beginnings. While growing up, Walter spent many long, but rewarding days on the farm. This quickly changed when news of World War II broke and both Walter and his brother, Roland, decided that they wanted to join the Army and serve their country. The fact that Walter was underage at the time of his decision proved difficult, but after receiving special permission from his parents, the Ehlers brothers set out in 1940 to serve in the same unit. Their duty spanned from Sicily to North Africa, and became more intense as the war moved along. As what would become known as ``D-Day'' approached, Walter, 23, and his brother were split up into different units in an effort to better chances that at least one of them would survive the bloody attack.  The morning of June 6, 1944, Walter, a squad leader and staff sergeant, was tasked with getting his 12 men safely through the danger zone on Normandy Beach and move inland in order to fulfill their mission of collecting data on German troop activities. He and his squad survived several rounds of heavy fire as they moved along and Walter's guidance to ``run for cover'' proved successful time and time again. On June 10, 1944, Walter's squad came under such extreme fire that the company commander ordered a withdrawal. Walter knew that in order to get hissquad out of trouble, he would have to distract the enemy. He and another soldier began shooting at opposition forces as to draw fire onto themselves while the rest of the squad snuck away. An enemy sniper managed to shoot Walter in the back that fateful morning, but he still found a way to ensure that he and his fellow soldier, who had been more seriously injured, made it to safety. Because of his efforts and quick thinking, countless Allied soldiers' lives were saved that day. D-Day became a day that would live on as a costly success for all Americans, and especially for Walter, when he found that his brother had not survived.  After the war, Walter returned to Kansas for a short time before permanently moving out west to California. He had always dreamed of making it big in Hollywood and acting in movies. Though he did earn one movie credit staring as West Point Cadet Mike Shannon in the 1955 film, ``The Long Gray Line,'' his desire to serve within the community quickly became his top priority. Walter accepted a job as a benefits counselor at the Veterans Administration soon after and went on to help his fellow veterans in any way that he could for many years to come.  It is no surprise that Walter became very decorated over the years considering the immense service he committed to the United States. He was the recipient of a Silver Star, two Bronze Stars, a Purple Heart for the injuries he sustained in combat, and the nation's highest military award, a Medal of Honor. Throughout his life Walter was highly sought after to attend speaking engagements, and also spoke to President Clinton and Queen Elizabeth II of England during the 50th Anniversary of D-Day in France. He even found himself with an invitation to every presidential inauguration since Dwight D. Eisenhower's. Walter's legacy will live on in the form of the Walter D. Ehlers Community Center in Buena Park, an action figure made in his likeness, and the street named after him in Manhattan, Kansas.  Walter is survived by his loving wife, Dorothy; daughters, Cathy Metcalf and Tracy Kilpatrick; son, Walter Jr.; sisters, Leona Porter, Marjorie Justin and Gloria Salberg; 11 grandchildren and two great grandchildren.  On Saturday, March 8, 2014, a memorial service honoring Walter's life will be held. Walter will always be remembered for his incredible leadership, service to our country, fearlessness, contributions to the community and love of family. His dedication to everything he did is truly a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will continue. I extend my condolences to Walter's family and friends; although Walter may be gone, the light and goodness he brought to the world remain and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
