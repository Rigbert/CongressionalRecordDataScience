earlier this year, Vermonters who are expanding and elevating one of Vermont's most honored products--cheese--were recognized with a record number of ribbons at the American Cheese Society's 36th Annual Awards competition in Richmond, VA. I am delighted, though not surprised, that a total of 44 Vermont cheeses won awards, including 5 that were finalists for Best of Show. Many of these cheeses are featured every year at our annual Taste of Vermont, held here on Capitol Hill each May.  Vermont's talented Vermont cheesemakers have brought home top awards from this competition each year, but never before has the State been a winner across so many categories. Despite its small size, Vermont was in the top three States for the number of awards earned--a significant accomplishment for this bedrock sector in our State.  The winners came from every corner of Vermont, every scale of production, and for many varieties of cheese. Large producers, like the Cabot Creamery Cooperative, which represents hundreds of farm families, came home as winners. So, too, did small operations like Barn First Creamery, which is home to just 32 goats and 2 farmer-cheesemakers. This contrast and diverse success is a fitting illustration of Vermont's agricultural landscape.  The Vermont Cheese Council helped to support the Vermont cheesemakers involved in the American Cheese Society's competition by providing technical assistance and marketing support. This council's foundational role is to help produce and advance Vermont-made cheese. The success of Vermont cheesemakers at this year's American Cheese Society's Annual Awards is just the latest testament to its effectiveness. Similar to the American Cheese Society, the Vermont Cheese Council provides the public and food professionals with educational events to learn more about cheese and cheese making throughout the State.  Cheese is a staple for Vermont agriculture and value added production, with over 45 cheesemakers--the most per capita of any State--throughout Vermont working with sheep, goats, and multiple cow breeds, to produce world-class artisanal cheese. The State's Department of Tourism andMarketing provides visitors with a map of the Vermont Cheese Trail created by the Vermont Cheese Council. It features locations where visitors can experience over 150 varieties of cheeses. Great cheese requires great dairy farmers, and both are fundamental to our State's economy and tradition.  I am proud to celebrate the success of all the cheese producers throughout my home State of Vermont and want now to recognize the Vermont cheesemakers receiving awards from this year's American Cheese Council. They include Barn First Creamery, Westfield; Boston Post Dairy, Enosburg Falls; Cabot Creamery Cooperative, Cabot; Fairy Tale Farm, Bridport; Grafton Village Cheese Company, Grafton; Jasper Hill Farm, Greensboro; Maplebrook Farm, Bennington; Mt.
