 President, on behalf of all the citizens of Washington State, I am delighted to congratulate the Washington State Labor Council on the 100th anniversary of its original formation. Washington State has a rich labor tradition.  On January 17, 1902, 120 delegates representing 114 local unions and five central labor councils from around Washington State gathered in Tacoma and voted to affiliate with the American Federation of Labor. This local organization eventually merged with the Washington State Congress of Industrial Organizations in 1957, the same time the national AFL and CIO merged, to form the Washington State Labor Council, AFL-CIO.  There have been many challenges faced during their first one hundred years, yet each challenge was faced with dignity and courage, knowing that the struggles faced would build a better life for working men and women. Union members throughout Washington State have risked their ownlivelihoods to stand up for decent wages, safe working conditions, and job security.  I have enormous respect for the past and present leadership of the Washington State Labor Council. We stand together in the ongoing battle to give working families the strongest possible voice.  For the past 100 years, Washington State's labor community has been a powerful force for progress. Their tireless efforts are indispensable in the daily battles for worker's rights. Countless families across Washington State are better off today because of their commitment.  The Washington State Labor Council has also been at the forefront of the effort to pass fair increases in the state minimum wage, setting standards for the rest of the country to follow. Simply put, the Washington State Labor Council has been there in the trenches, making progress happen.  I look forward to working closely with the Washington State Labor Council on all the great causes we share. Washington State has made real progress because of their work, and will continue to do so with their help now and in all the years ahead.                          ____________________
