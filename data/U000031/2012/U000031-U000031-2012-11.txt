Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.  I just want to again thank Mrs. Capps. As we met these families, we really did not know about these diseases until we saw their courage and what they do as they confront this every day. It's marvelous for me, as I now have visited my family that has this disease 2 years in a row. It's great to see them grow and remember where they were and to really think that there's going to be hope with the legislation that we can see that is done.  With that, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlelady from Washington State, Cathy McMorris Rodgers, who has also been, as we look at a bipartisan leadership, a real trooper to move this legislation not only through our committee, but now on the House floor.  Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman. I thank my colleague and friend, Representative Lois Capps, and rise today in strong support of this legislation, H.R. 6163, the National Pediatric Research Network Act, which is going to build on America's commitment to pediatric medical research.  That commitment has already led to the prevention and treatment of terrible conditions such as polio, meningitis, childhood leukemia, congenital heart disease. With budgets being squeezed like no time in recent memory, it has never been more important to support projects which leverage every single dollar.  Research networks have a proven track record in their ability to ensure collaboration and the sharing of resources which, in turn, have led to medical discoveries that have improved lives.                              {time}  2100  For example, the National Cancer Institute-funded Children's Oncology Group has advanced our understanding and treatment of childhood cancers, and this group has resulted in a cure for some types of childhood leukemia. The Pediatric Heart Network has improved the outcome for children born with congenital heart disease.  I am proud to have introduced this legislation with my colleague, Representative Capps. This legislation is going to authorize NIH to establish up to 20 pediatric research networks across this country, and each network will be selected by NIH through a competitive review process. These networks will allow multiple institutions to work together in a ``hub and spoke'' fashion to encourage collaboration.  Some of those networks will focus on rare diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy. Other networks will focus on the genetic diseases that have their onset in childhood, including Fragile X and Down Syndrome.  It's important to develop a framework for these rare and genetic diseases for a number of reasons. First of all, researchers in these areas are often working in isolation, and this legislation is going to help overcome that barrier. Secondly, there are not many children with these disorders in one place, so it makes it difficult to connect the researchers to those that want to participate in the studies.  Finally, the study of these rare and genetic diseases may lead to treatments that will help many people. For example, we've learned that there is a specific biological link between Down Syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. It's conceivable that the research that can result in the improvement in cognition in Down Syndrome could also prevent the loss of cognition that is seen in Alzheimer's.  These pediatric networks will improve health outcomes for children and adults by encouraging teamwork among the researchers, the patients, and NIH. This is important and positive legislation. I'm proud to support it, and I urge my colleagues to support it.
