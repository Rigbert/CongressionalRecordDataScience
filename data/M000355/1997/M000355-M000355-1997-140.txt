 President, I too want to thank the distinguished majority leader for working with others who are interested in this legislation to create an atmosphere in which we can have an important debate on an issue of enormous significance to our country. I think it is a sensible and orderly way to give everyone an opportunity to have his or her say. I commend the majority leader and Senator McCain as well for their good work to bring us to this point.
