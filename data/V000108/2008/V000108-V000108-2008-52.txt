On Friday, May 30, 2008, the Lake County Electricians Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee, JATC, will honor the class of 2008 at their annual Apprentice Completion Banquet, which will be held at the Avalon Manor Banquet Hall in Merrillville, Indiana.  This year, the Lake County Electricians JATC will be recognizing and honoring twenty-four graduates who have completed the apprentice training. This year's inside wireman graduates are: Donald Bullock, Vincent Catalano, Sean Clark, Dustin Greenya, Nicholas Kozlowski, John Lucas, Daniel Marlowe, Kevin Troy Nuss, Christopher Ortell, Jordan Pierson, Christopher Porter, Brian Robbins, Caleb Smith, Timothy Soderquist, Anthony Thames, Brandon Tomassoni, David Turpin, Jr., and John Wajvoda. This year's teledata technician graduates are: Victor Alvear, Scott Davis, John Hill, Corey Joiner, Randy Mohrs, and Jason Stanley.  Northwest Indiana has a rich history of excellence in its craftsmanship and loyalty by its tradesmen. These outstanding graduates all exemplify these traits. They have mastered their trade and have demonstrated their loyalty to both the union and the community through their commitment, hard work, and selfless sacrifice.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating these committed, hardworking individuals. Along with the other extraordinary men and women of Northwest Indiana's unions, these individuals have contributed in many ways to the growth and development of the economy in Indiana's First Congressional District, and I am very proud to represent them in Washington, DC.
