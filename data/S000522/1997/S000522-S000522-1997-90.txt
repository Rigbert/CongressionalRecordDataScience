Mr. Speaker, for the 17 years that I have been a Member of Congress, abortion advocates have often let the Republican abortion advocates offer pro-abortion amendments. It has played well with the press, it is contrarient, 80 percent of our caucus is pro-life, and the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Greenwood], the gentleman from California [Mr. Campbell] and the gentleman from New York [Mr. Gilman] certainly have pro-abortion credentials. They were among 7 members of our caucus who voted against the partial-birth abortion ban.  Let me just make it very clear that when the gentlewoman from California [Ms. Pelosi] appeared before the Committee on Rules, and I listened intently to every word she said, she said that either she or someone else would be allowed to offer a perfecting amendment. That someone else is the so-called pro-choice Republicans.  Their perfecting amendment, let it be very clear, absolutely guts the Smith-Hyde-Oberstar-Barcia amendment. It is a totally gutting amendment. So they get their opportunity, which makes me wonder about this whole proceeding that we are watching.  I also wanted to make the point that the gentleman from Alabama [Mr. Callahan] said he does not want to deal with legislative policy language on an appropriations bill. Then do not authorize the appropriation itself. At some point there will have to be a waiver. Let there be no waiver; let the authorizing committees do both, the funding and the policy.                              {time}  1830
