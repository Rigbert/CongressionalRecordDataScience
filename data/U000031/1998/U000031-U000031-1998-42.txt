Speaker, I rise today in support of legislation that I am introducing with my colleague and friend Rep. Ed Towns to provide a stable source of funding for our nation's poison control centers, create a national toll-free number to provide ready access to these centers, and increase public education about poison prevention and the availability of poison control resources.  Poison control centers provide vital, very cost-effective services to the American public. Each year, more than 2 million poisonings are reported to poison control centers throughout the United States. More than 90 percent of these poisonings occur in the home, and over 50 percent of poisoning victims are children under the age of 6. For every dollar spent on poison control center services, seven dollars in medical costs are saved.  In spite of their obvious value, poison control centers are in jeopardy. They are currently financed through unstable arrangements of various public and private sources. Over the last two decades, the number of centers has steadily declined, jeopardizing access to services.  The legislation I am introducing today will provide up to $27.6 million per year over the next five years to provide a stable source of funding for these centers, establish a national toll-free poison control hotline, and improve public education on poisoning prevention and services. The legislation is designed to ensure that these funds supplement--not supplant--other funding that the centers may be receiving and provides the Secretary of Health and Human Services with the authority to impose a matching requirement.  I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of this very cost-effective investment in the safety and health of the American public, especially our children.                          ____________________
