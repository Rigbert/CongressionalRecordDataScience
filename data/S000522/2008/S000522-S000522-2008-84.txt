Mr. Speaker, today, 35 years after the infamous Supreme Court decisions legalizing abortion on demand throughout pregnancy, we mourn the estimated 50 million innocent girls and boys whose lives were cut off by abortion, a staggering loss of children's lives, equal to six times the total number of all people, young and old, living in my home State of New Jersey.  Someday, Mr. Speaker, future generations of Americans will look back on us and wonder how and why such a rich and seemingly enlightened society, so blessed and endowed with the capacity to protect and enhance vulnerable human life, could have instead so aggressively promoted death to children and the exploitation of women by abortion. They will note with keen sadness that some of our most prominent politicians and media icons often spoke of human and civil rights, while precluding virtually all protection to the most persecuted minority in the world today: unborn children.  On Sunday, Senator Barak Obama criticized Americans for both our moral deficit and what he called our ``empathy deficit'' and called upon us to be our brothers' and sisters' keepers.                              {time}  1945  Can Senator Obama not see, appreciate or understand that the abortion culture that he and others so assiduously promote lacks all empathy for unborn children, be they black, white, Latino or Asian, and is at best profoundly misguided when it comes to their mothers? Why does dismembering a child with sharp knives, pulverizing a child with powerful suction devices more powerful than 20 to 30 times the average cleaning machine, vacuum machine, or chemically poisoning a baby with any number of toxic chemicals fail to elicit so much as a scintilla of empathy, moral outrage, mercy or compassion by America's liberal elite?  Abortion destroys the very life of our ``brothers and sisters,'' and the proabortion movement is the quintessential example of an ``empathy deficit.''  Mr. Speaker, we need to be blunt. Abortion is violence against children. It is extreme child abuse. To strip away the euphemism, it is cruelty to children. Sadly, abortion is not only legal until birth, but the daily perpetrators of this terrible injustice are massively subsidized by liberal politicians who enrich the abortion industry with taxpayer funds.  In 2008, the largest abortion provider in the Nation, Planned Parenthood, continued to receive huge amounts of taxpayer funds. Some time ago on the floor, Mr. Speaker, I asked Americans, I asked my colleagues, and suggested it was time to take a second look at Planned Parenthood, ``Child Abuse, Incorporated.'' Every year they abort over 265,000 children in their clinics, a huge and staggering, stunning number of child deaths. And yet they get massive amounts of Federal funds and local funds.  Mr. Speaker, there are at least two victims in every abortion. It is time to recognize and accept the inconvenient truth that abortion exploits women.  Dr. Alveda King, niece of the late Dr. Martin Luther King, has had two abortions. Today she has joined the growing coalition of women who deeply regret their abortions and are part of a group called Silent No More. Out of deep personal pain and compassion for others, they challenge us to respect, protect and tangibly love both mother and the child. The women of Silent No More give post-abortive women a safe place to grieve and a road map to reconciliation. And to society at large, these brave women compel us to rethink and reassess the chief sophistry of the abortion culture. Reflecting on their famous uncle's speech, the ``I Have a Dream'' speech, Dr. Alveda King asks us, ``How can the `Dream' survive if we murder the children?''  Finally, 35 years after Roe, the pro-life ranks today have swelled with abortion survivors, women who tell their stories with great bravery and candor. I remember hearing a woman right outside of the Supreme Court who, while she was actually getting the abortion, said to the doctor, she was only partially sedated, said, ``It is trying to move.'' She said she wanted to get up off of that table and run out the door, and the nurses practically screamed at her and said, ``It is too late. The abortion is already underway.'' So many others who have actually seen the child after being aborted, very often they whisk the baby away so that there is no contact made, who then tell the story of the nightmares. Again, the Silent No More campaign helps these women reconnect and find reconciliation and hope for their shattered lives.  Today, at the March for Life, the ranks of the pro-life movement was filled with young people. I have gone to that march each year for 35 years. I have never seen more young people speaking out passionately, all ethnicities represented, young boys and young girls, teenagers and young adults, who say we are going to be, and are, the pro-life generation. And they have certainly reason to react that way. Every third member of their generation has died from abortion.  Mr. Speaker, finally, I hope this Congress takes a long and hard second look at the glib euphemisms that are used to promote abortion, the marketing strategies, the polls that have driven this terrible issue forward, and strip it all away. Look at the deed itself: chemical poisoning, dismemberment, partial-birth abortion awakened at least some Members to the cruelty of abortion. Connect the dots. Every method is an act of violence. And again, there are two victims in every abortion, mother and child.  I truly believe that united in prayer, united in fasting, and with a lot of hard work, just like the abolitionists of old, who said that you cannot discount the humanity of people because of the color of their skin, well, the dependency or the immaturity of a child also should not become a disqualifier. America's dark night of child slaughter will some day, and some day soon, Mr. Speaker, come to an end.  I yield back to Mr. Franks and thank him for his extraordinary leadership on this human rights issue.
