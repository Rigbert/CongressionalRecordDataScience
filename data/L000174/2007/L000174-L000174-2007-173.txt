President, I am pleased to take this opportunity to commend longtime friends, Harold and Anne Howrigan and their sons of Fairfield, VT, whose farm was recently named 2007 Vermont Dairy Farm of the Year.  Harold, his wife Anne and their sons operate two farms comprised of more than 500 head of holstein cattle and some 1,800 acres of cropland and forest, including a significant maple sugaring operation. The Howrigan farm was selected by University of Vermont Extension and the Vermont Dairy Industry Association, who described it as an excellent, well managed dairy operation which consistently produces high-quality milk. With some of the farm acreage in the family since the mid 19th Century, the Howrigan family indeed exemplifies a long-term commitment to agriculture.  As much as he loves the home farm, over the years Harold has spent considerable time away from the farm serving Vermont agriculture. He has served as president of the Green Mountain Dairy Farmers Federation of Cooperatives and as a director with both the Vermont Maple Sugar Makers Association and the Vermont Dairy Promotion Council. Harold has served on the St. Albans Cooperative board of directors since 1981 and as president from 1988 until stepping down in 2005.  At one time or another, Harold was chairperson of the Vermont Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact Commission, chair of the Council of Northeast Farmer Cooperatives and chair of the National Dairy Promotion and Research Board. He also served on the U.S. Dairy Export Council and the National Milk Producers Federation.  With this level of engagement in the interest of dairy farmers and their industry, it is a tribute to Harold, Anne and their sons to earn this distinguished award. I join my fellow Vermonters in recognizing a Vermont dairy farm--and family--with its tradition of hard work, common sense and love of agriculture as the 2007 Vermont Dairy Farm of the Year.                          ____________________
