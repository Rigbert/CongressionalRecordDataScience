President, I know the Senator from Arizona is in the Chamber to offer his amendment so I will speak only very briefly. Senator Lautenberg's amendment is an improvement over the amendment offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania because it is a shorter term and it does allow the President to remove the NID without specifying a cause, but I still find it problematic.  We are talking about the individual who is going to be the principal adviser to the President. The witnesses were virtually unanimous in advising us that that individual has to have the trust and confidence of the President and that it would be a mistake to set a term.  I argue further against this amendment in the context of the Specter amendment. In light of the fact that the Senator from Arizona is waiting, I will not repeat those arguments at this time.
