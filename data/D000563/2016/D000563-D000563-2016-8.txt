President, in recent years, we have seen a troubling trend of democratic backsliding in several parts of the world, including Russia, Thailand, Uganda, Turkey, and Venezuela.  Even some parts of Europe and the United States have seen long established democratic norms challenged in deeply upsetting ways.  So imagine my great surprise late last week when the people of The Gambia peacefully voted for a new democratic government.  Many probably don't know much about The Gambia--a small West African nation whose uniquely odd colonial borders have it straddling the meandering Gambia River almost completely surrounded by Senegal.  Gambia is English speaking--Senegal speaks French--with several local languages shared between the unusual borders.  Some of you may remember The Gambia was the ancestral home in the novel and then-television miniseries ``Roots.''  Because of its strong ties to the U.S. and geographic location, for some time The Gambia also had a unique distinction of being an emergency landing spot for the Space Shuttle should one need to abort its mission early in the launch phase.  And until 1994, it had the proud distinction of being the longest postcolonial democracy on the African continent.  You see, for the last 22 years, The Gambia was ruled by a regime that took power in a coup, with troubling arrests and disappearances of journalists, activists, and opposition members.  I and several of my Senate colleagues raised a number of these cases over the years, most notably the 2007 disappearance of journalist Ebrima Manneh--for which I now hope there will finally be a fair and healing accounting.  And yet, last Thursday night, the people of The Gambia, voting with colored marbles placed in different containers to make it easier for illiterate voters, chose a new leader in a peaceful and democratic process.  And outgoing President Yahya Jammeh honorably conceded the election and agreed to a peaceful transfer of power.  He offered to help President-Elect Adama Barrow.  While we have had our differences, I want to acknowledge this important act of leadership and love of country by outgoing President Jammeh.  And not only has there been this notable peaceful transfer of power, but in just the few short days since the election, at least 18 political prisoners have been released from jail, including a key opposition figure.  So to the Gambian people, let me say congratulations on your important demonstration of democracy--a model for the African continent and the world.  I look forward to significantly improved relations between our two nations and working together on a host of shared concerns.                          ____________________
