President, I rise today to introduce legislation, the Savings for Scholars Act, to help familiessave for college expenses. This bill would make education IRAs and State tuition plans more effective vehicles for families to use in saving for postsecondary education. I want to thank Senator Roth and his staff on the Finance Committee for working with me and my staff in drafting this legislation. In the 3 years that he has chaired the Finance Committee, Senator Roth has been a true champion for all of us who place a tremendous value on educating our nation's children and young adults.  When Congress created the education IRA 2 years ago, we took an important first step in the direction of encouraging families to save for their children's education. But, the law contains a very significant limitation--families cannot contribute more than $500 a year to these accounts. This restriction makes it difficult for a family to accumulate savings sufficient to pay the cost of a college degree. Even if parents start saving from the time their child is born, an investment in an education IRA of $500 a year, assuming an average annual return of 8 percent, will only yield about $19,000 when that child begins higher education. Today, the average cost of 4 years of higher education is about $30,000 at a public institution and about $75,000 at a private school. In short, the current limits are not nearly high enough to finance even today's college costs, much less the cost 18 years from now.  Raising the maximum contribution to $2,000 will allow a family to accumulate at least as much as the current average cost of attending a private school. This is money that many middle-class families and their children otherwise would need to borrow; it is tens of thousands of dollars in student loans that would burden graduates with a mountain of debt. Most important, raising the education IRA contribution limit would make a 4-year college education more accessible and less of a financial challenge for middle-income families.  In addition to increasing the education IRA contribution limit, this bill would make a technical change to remove a confusing inconsistently between the education IRA and the traditional IRA. The last date on which a contribution to an education IRA can be made is December 31 of any year. Traditional IRAs may receive contributions until April 15 of the year following the tax year. This bill changes the deadline for contributions to education IRAs to coincide with that of the traditional IRA. This modest change would eliminate a source of confusion that might cause a family planning to contribute to a child's IRA to inadvertently miss the deadline.  The second part of my bill deals with qualified State tuition plans. These are tax-deferred plans, administered by the individual states, that allow families to prepay college tuition or to accumulate tax-deferred savings for postsecondary education expenses. My bill makes two changes in the requirements of these plans that should make them more flexible and useful to families. The first is to require that all qualified State tuition plans allow at least three rollovers without any change in beneficiary. This change would guarantee that participants in one state's plan can transfer their assets to another state's plan. The need for this could be the result of a family moving from one state to another or of a change in a child's education plans. My bill will give greater flexibility in the choice of postsecondary education institutions to the beneficiaries of these plans.  The bill also proposes one additional change to the qualified tuition programs--a change that will make the plans more attractive to families. Under current law, the assets of a plan can be rolled over to specified members of a beneficiary's family. This allows the plan's assets to be used by a sibling if the original beneficiary cannot or does not use the plan. However, the definition of a family member does not include first cousins. Thus, a parent of a single child could not transfer the benefits to a niece or nephew if his or her child did not use the plan. Perhaps more significantly, this change would make the qualified state tuition plan more desirable for grandparents. They could be assured that a plan established for the benefit of one grandchild could be transferred to any of their grandchildren.  The final part of this bill corrects an unfair consequence of the interaction between the HOPE tax credits and the education IRA. Currently, a taxpayer is prohibited from claiming the HOPE tax credit in any year in which a withdrawal from an education IRA is made--regardless of the total amount the taxpayer spends on education. This bill allows the HOPE tax credit to be claimed to the extent that the cost of education exceeds the amount withdrawn from the IRA. It does not allow a double benefit, but it does prevent one benefit--the IRA withdrawal--from canceling another benefit. It also eliminates a potential trap for the unwary taxpayer who may accidentally claim both benefits and, as a result, incur a penalty.  Mr. President, investing in education is the surest way for us to build our country's assets for the future. We need to ensure that postsecondary education is affordable and that graduates do not accumulate crippling debts while attending school. Adopting this bill will help us to accomplish both of these goals. I urge my colleagues to support these efforts.                                 ______                                       By
