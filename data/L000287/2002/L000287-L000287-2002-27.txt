Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my friend and colleague for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, the Republican budget is irresponsible, irrational, and just plain wrong. It is a sham, it is a shame, and it is a disgrace.  The Republican budget buries us in a pile of debt and puts us in a much deeper financial hole; and it is the obligation of the Republicans, the majority party, to dig us out.  The Republicans have destroyed the lock box and thrown away the key. Mr. Chairman, Social Security is a sacred trust, a covenant with the American people. It is a promise that should never, ever be broken. But the Republican budget spends $225 billion of the Social Security trust fund on other government programs.  Social Security is a safety net for many Americans, allowing them to live with dignity. But the Republican budget takes away that safety net. Republicans are stealing the Social Security trust fund. The Republicans are taking the security out of Social Security.  Mr. Chairman, I urge all of my colleagues tonight to vote for the people, vote for the old folks, vote for the disabled, and vote against the Republican budget.
