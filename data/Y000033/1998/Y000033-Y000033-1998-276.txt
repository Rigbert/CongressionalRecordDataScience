Mr. Speaker, since July 17, 1998, Congressman John Dingell, W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, Richard Baker, Chris John, and I have been circulating a discussion draft and asking for comments to help further this legislative proposal. Our proposal is based on the idea that funds derived from outer continental shelf or OCS activities should be shared with coastal states impacted by the development, as well as reinvested into conservation. Today, we, along with several of our colleagues, will be introducing H.R. 4717.  To set the stage we must digress to the topic of oil and gas revenues paid to the Federal Treasury by companies involved in producing the federal mineral estate. Currently, would-be oil and gas operators on our public lands, and in federal waters, must bid for alease at auction, pay rent on this tract if successful with their bid, and pay a royalty on each cubic foot of natural gas and barrel of oil produced. The receipts from oil and gas development onshore, in states like New Mexico and Wyoming, are shared with the state which hosts the federal lease. Generally, half of the revenues the federal government receives from mineral development is shared with these public and land states.  However, oil and gas produced in the federal waters of the OCS is not shared in this manner with adjacent states. There have been numerous attempts to address this inequity. Most have failed at the hands of large states like California and Florida with the help of the environmental community opposed to OCS revenue-sharing because they perceived it as incentive for new oil and gas production. One of the first negotiations took place between Louisiana Governor Earl Long and President Truman. Governor Long has a long history of quotable and embellished stories, but this one is told as follows: Governor Long approached President Truman regarding the issue of revenue from offshore drilling with his state of Louisiana. President Truman, sympathetic, came back with an offer of 50% of the revenues to be shared with impacted adjacent states, such as Louisiana. Governor Long, in typical Earl Long style replied that if Louisiana could not get its due of 100%, it wanted nothing at all. And since that day Louisiana and the other coastal states received just that.  Which brings us to where we are today. With more than 90% of the offshore federal production occurring off the coast of Louisiana, no state is more energized when this issue of revenue sharing is brought up. Past proposals had formulas which favored producing coastal states such as Louisiana and Texas, which have been supportive of responsible development of OCS oil and gas resources. Some previous proposals even penalized states like Florida and California who annually seek a moratorium on OCS leasing. Not so, this time. We all realize the necessity of keeping our large states supportive of in order to have major legislation passed into law.  It seems appropriate to thank those individuals and groups involved with this bill introduction. The proposal has been a process-driven, seeking input from a diverse array of individuals and groups. Countless meetings and information exchanges occurred throughout the summer and into the fall. Any success realized today, with this bill introduction, came from the diversity of the participants and our determination to stay true to an open process and dialogue. Today, you find Congressman that run the spectrum of ideology and geography together supporting this bill. You see the same with the groups who have come out to support this endeavor and I look forward to continuing this collaboration.  Since July, when Congressman Dingell, Tauzin, Baker and John  and I began circulating a discussion draft, posted it to the House Resources Committee website, we have been affirmatively seeking comments on the specifics of this idea. I can't stress enough our desire for critical input. Most of our discussion draft ideas were based upon existing reports or programs. Your input has been critical to making this proposal realize it's legislative potential. Today, we are moving into the next step in our process by introducing this bill. Yes, the 105th Congress is nearly finished, but we felt it worthwhile to formally introduce a legislation for thorough scrutiny until the 106th Congress meets. And the citizens of Alaska so willing, I intent to come back and re-introduce the Conservation and Reinvestment Act of 1999 early next year. Please understand, today's introduction does not signal the end our dialogue. I am committed to working with all interested individuals and groups to improve this bill next Congress, should compelling arguments for further amendments. I am dedicating myself to continue the dialogue begun four months ago into the 106th Congress, and working together, we can build a coalition sufficient to enact the ``Conservation and Reinvestment Act of 1999'' into law.***HD***Title I  The first title of the Conservation and Reinvestment Act will redistribute 27% of the total OCS receipts in a given year and is based on a Minerals Management Service's advisory committee's report. This report was prepared by the Administration and local government officials, and oil and gas industry representative, and conservation-community interests. The panel took a pragmatic approach, by suggesting only revenues from new oil and gas development be considered. While this reduces Budget Enforcement Act-induced concerns, it was troublesome to the environmental community because of the implementation that such revenue-sharing would be a strong incentive for new development. Hence, our bull utilizes all revenue, from both existing production and new leases. With this change not only will the funding levels increase to benefits the programs included in our bill, but we wanted to address the environmental community concerns from the outset.  Let's be candid about the perception that this bill includes incentives for oil and gas production. The only true incentive for a company to produce oil and gas, onshore or offshore, is the price of a barrel of oil or cubic foot of gas. A company examines the economics when making its development decisions. Companies will not decree to place a billion-dollar rig offshore based on a state or local government official's desire to increase their share of the fund our legislation would establish. They invest in the OCS if, and only if, they have reasonable expectations of making a profit. Obviously, even in today's oil & gas price environment, many companies have decided to compete in our OSC--especially in the Gulf of Mexico, but also in the Beaufort Sea, and even on existing leases off California.  Would they like to know their royalties are put to noble purposes for the good of taxpayers throughout the Nation? Well, of course, The Land and Water Conservation Fund primarily fueled by OCS receipts does just that, and has since 1965. But, no one believes LWCF has been an incentive for oil and gas drilling, rather its just been a good idea to reinvest some of our oil and gas dollars in the acquisition of lands and conservation of our renewable resources by both state and federal entities.  In addition, we have asked the Minerals Management Service to prepare data to show the amount of new production which would be necessary to increase a state's allocable share by 10%. Preliminary data shows that if all existing leases were to begin producing offshore California, there would be an increase in California's allocable share of only 1 percent, or about $1 million annually. I strongly doubt the people of California would abide new development off their coast simply to gain this revenue for coastal impact assistance.  I argue that this issue of incentives is a ``red herring.'' When a rational person examines the funding distribution, released today, they will see states like Florida and California as some of the largest recipients of impact assistance, despite the current and likely future leasing moratoria. Nevertheless we wish to address the perception of incentives. We are and have always been committed to keeping this bill free of drilling incentives as this is revenue-sharing legislation, pure and simple. To date, we have not received one comment which provides an adequate alternative to funding distribution to areas impacted by OCS development. But, we will work with individuals and groups in finding alternative which accomplishes the goal of providing funds to areas impacted by development which factors in the amount of development adjacent to a given state.***HD***Title II  The second title of the Conservation and Reinvestment Act reinvests 23% of the OCS funds into land-based conservation efforts, with a focus on the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). More than 30 years ago, the LWCF Act created a unique partnership between Federal, State and local governments by authorizing matching grants for the acquisition and development of recreation and conservation resources. Similarly, the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery Program (UPARR), created in 1978, provided Federal funds to distressed urban areas to rehabilitate and construct recreation areas. Together, these programs strived to develop a national system of parks that would, day-in and day-out, meet the recreation and open-space demands of the American public. Our proposal recognizes the noble potential within these programs and provides the stable funding they have been lacking.  LWCF monies have helped fund over 37,500 State and local projects including campgrounds, trails, playgrounds, and parks throughout the country. UPARR grants have been used to rehabilitate and develop nearly 1,500 urban recreation and park projects in more than 400 local jurisdictions. Yet, with the ever increasing demands of Americans for accessible recreation facilities, State and local governments have identified nearly $3 billion in capital investment needs nationally over the next five years for land acquisition and new construction. Nonetheless, despite the successes of the state-side LWCF matching grant and UPARR programs and the continuing demand for recreation and conservation resources, neither program has been funded over the past three years.  Title two of our bill would revitalize the LWCF and UPARR programs by providing matching grants to federal, state, local, and urban governments for the acquisition and development of conservation and recreation resources. Our bill provides annual funding which in many years provides funding at full $900 million levels. This bill will recommit Congress to the vision that revenues earned from the depletion of a nonrenewable resource should be invested in permanent assets that will serve the conservation and recreation needs of all Americans.  The 23% for land-based conservation would be distributed as follows:  42% to be utilized for Federal LWCF;  42% to State and local conservation and recreation projects; and  16% to fund UPARR programs.  It is important to point out that the funds allocated for State and local conservation and recreation projects only could fund one-half of the projects' costs and all expenditures would have to be consistent with the States' comprehensive outdoor recreation plans. Also the stated, territories, the District of Columbia, Indian tribes, and Alaska Native Village Corporations would all be eligible to receive matching grant funds.***HD***Title III  For over six years, some segments of the conservation community have advocated the creation of an excise tax to provide funding for non-game wildlife projects and conservation education. Included in this bill is funding for wildlife conservation and education. Conservation education is critical to ensuring that people understand the interdependence between man and the environment. We are losing the idea that people and the environment that surrounds them not only can coexist, but must coexist. As the urban sprawl envelops more of the public geography and ideology, we must work to educate with the principles of sustainable use. Hiking, biking, bird-watching, canoeing, mountain climbing, and hunting are all sustainable and acceptable uses of our lands and resources. Education by using sound scientific principles is the only way to ensure that our use of our resources will be sustainable for future generations.  Another void this legislation helps to fill, is the issue of game vs. non-game funding. This issue divides the sporting community who need unity to accomplish our common goals. The excise tax initiative, while well intentioned, was divisive as it created segmented funding for a particular species of wildlife. Our bill provides funding for both species of wildlife, game and non-game through the existing mechanism of Pittman-Robertson.  Pittman-Robertson currently allows for the flexibility to address the needs of non-game species, as well as game species. We all realize that Pittman-Robertson is currently focused on funding game species. However, our bill will create a new subaccount, named the ``Wildlife Conservation and Restoration'' subaccount. The conservation and Reinvestment Act of 1998 will provide funding at higher levels than any other federal source for wildlife. Above levels proposed by the excise tax initiative. This will provide wildlife funding to help move the conservation community beyond the debate of game versus non-game funding and provide for conservation education. This funding is provided with the knowledge that many states will utilize them for non-game and watchable species and these functions can take place with the bill as drafted. However, we allow the flexibility for individual states to maximize their digression.  I am very active in the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus and am currently the chairman of the Executive Council. The Sportsmen's Caucus is the largest Caucus in the Congress and sportsmen's champion. Far too often, our sportsmen and women are criticized for their outdoor recreation. The mass public does not understand our role in the economy or appreciate our heritage. The sporting community, represented by those who enjoy and utilize the outdoors are a huge segment to our Nation's economy. Members of the Caucus leadership, like Saxby Chambliss often incorporate our significance in their speeches. We should take a moment to realize how much our sportsmen contribute to the economy and environment.  If hunting and fishing were a corporation, it would rank 10th on the Fortune 500 list. This is ahead of giant corporations like AT  Sportsmen activities support more than twice the number of workers employed by Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart, incidently, Wal-Mart is the largest Fortune 500 employer.  Sportsmen's assets equal, $60 billion in retail sales, 1.9 million jobs supported, and $8.7 billion in state and federal tax revenues. Economists estimate that these factors create a $169 billion ripple effect in our country's economy.  Some additional facts related to the taxes the sporting community pays are also interesting:  Tax revenues generated by sportsmen are greater than the box office total of all United States movie theaters. Also, exceed the combined box office earnings of the all-time top ten grossing films.  Federal tax revenues generated by sportsmen could pay for the combined budgets of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Endangered Species appropriation, Bureau of Land Management, National Biological Service, and National Park Service. For two years!  Federal tax revenues from New York sportsmen alone could pay for the entire U.S. Forest Service fish and wildlife budget. Pennsylvania sportsmen could pick-up the same tab.  Sportsmen's sales tax revenues generated in North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and West Virginia could pay for their state's entire parks and recreation budgets.  All of you are well aware that the sporting community, especially those who engage in hunting and fishing, have been supporting the larger community of outdoor recreation for decades. Their generous contributions through the sportsmen trust accounts of Dingell-Johnson and Pittman-Robertson have immeasurably benefitted wildlife and their habitat. With that success in mind, I look forward to working with all individuals and groups to see this new subaccount passed into Law.                          ____________________
