  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, freight rail service in large parts of the Western United States is at the point of collapse. Shipments have been delayed for weeks, even lost for months. That is not uncommon. Rail car shortages are so bad that plants in my district and throughout the Northwest are laying off workers, curtailing production for which they have orders because they cannot ship the product and they have got no place to put it.  Union Pacific's response has been, we are a monopoly now. We really do not care very much about your problems because you have got no place else to turn. Shippers have turned to the Service Transportation Board of the Government in desperation and now Union Pacific has a response, a suggested form letter with a carbon copy to President Dick Davidson of UP saying, we do not want any help or intervention, things might get better. UP is going to fix things now. They are paying attention.  They are being coerced into signing these letters, they are telling me, for fear that the dribble of rail cars they are now getting will be totally shut off. The Government has to step in and get the attention of this monopoly and straighten this out.                          ____________________
