DeLAY. I want to be very careful here because I have not seen the bill as introduced. In fact, I am not sure the bill has been introduced as of yet. I am very careful as to what I can say is in it because I have not seen it. All I know is that discussions that I have been privy to, the last I was advised is that the AMT bill is for 1 year.
