 President, today I honor a renowned Vermont landmark and business, Thunder Road International SpeedBowl, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this season.  Thursday nights every summer, short track races take place on Thunder Road's uniquely configured quarter-mile paved track. Thunder Road has been recognized as one of the finest short tracks in the Nation. Built in 1959 on farm land in Barre, VT, by longtime network sports commentator Ken Squier and his partners, Thunder Road is an American institution of which Vermont is proud.  Thunder Road has offered inexpensive family entertainment for five decades. This revered race track has brought international racing stars to the Green Mountain State while also offering opportunities for Vermontersto compete in front of passionate and knowledgeable fans.  After World War II, there were more than 22 short tracks in the State of Vermont. With only three tracks remaining, Thunder Road stands out as the largest spectator sports venue in the State.  Today, some drivers at Thunder Road can recall watching their grandfathers drive the same track. ``Thunder Road is just about racing--there's no politics, no marketing--it's just racing and it's always been that way,'' said Steve Letarte, a Maine native and crew chief for NASCAR star Jeff Gordon.  Vermonters appreciate Thunder Road for its longtime contributions to its community. For 50 years, this short track has been an invaluable institution for the people of Vermont and throughout the Northeast.                          ____________________
