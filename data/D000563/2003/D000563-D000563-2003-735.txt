I would like to put the Senator from Vermont on the spot with a question.  If the White House will allow these writings that are in controversy here by Miguel Estrada to be released to the Congress for review, and if we are then given a chance to review them, to bring Mr. Estrada for a hearing, if necessary, so we can ask questions, some of which he has not answered completely before, at that point would the Senator from Vermont personally urge the Democrats in committee to allow this process to move forward in an orderly fashion to consideration in committee, to a vote in the committee, and to a vote on the floor?
