 Speaker, at a time when this country has the lowest voter turnout of any major country and millions of Americans are giving up on the political process, it is imperative that the presidential candidates in this election focus their attention on the real issues facing the middle class and the working families and not devote their energy to negative 30-second television ads.                              {time}  1030  This country has some terribly serious problems, and the American people want to hear those problems discussed. For example, why does this Nation have the most unfair distribution of wealth and income of all industrialized nations on Earth? Why is the gap between the rich and the poor growing wider while the middle class continues to shrink?  What do we do to reverse the trend by which real wages for working people continue to decline and today are 16 percent less than they were 20 years ago with workers now working longer and longer hours just to provide for their families?  What do we do about the reality that most of the new jobs that are being created are poverty level jobs? Let us talk about the real issues.                          ____________________
