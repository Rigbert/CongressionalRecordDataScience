Speaker, I rise today to honor a truly noble citizen from my district, Dr. Eva Shapiro.  Dr. Shapiro died this year at the age of 100. She was born in Toledo, OH on November, 1894, the daughter of Russian immigrants. She grew up in a downtown neighborhood, as part of Toledo's Jewish community. Her grandfather, by the way, was Toledo's first Orthodox rabbi. Her father owned a small grocery store, and eventually started the first auto parts company in Toledo.  Eva Shapiro initially wanted to be a physician, but couldn't afford 6 years of medical school. Instead, she applied for, and won, a generous scholarship from the local B'nai B'rith. They paid for 4 years of dental school at Western Reserve in Cleveland, where she earned her degree in 1918. She returned to Toledo and started her own practice.  In those days, women dentists were not common, and she struggled at first--even the people from her own neighborhood were unwilling to let a woman take care of their teeth. But word spread that she did excellent work, and her practice grew. She was eventually able to pay back every nickle of that scholarship, so someone else could receive it.  Dr. Shapiro was one of the founders of the Toledo Dental Dispensary (today the Dental Center of Northwest Ohio), a nonprofit clinic for needy children and adults. She served on the Board of Trustees of the Dispensary from 1923 to 1960. In her own words,       * * * we knew we had to have a dental dispensary, and a      free one, because there were many people in Toledo that just      could not afford to go to the dentist. * * * I even gave as      much money as I could, and so did the other [dentists], and      they started a dental dispensary. * * * we have dentists      there that are very fine dentists, and they do beautiful,      beautiful work.  Even with her practice and the time she spent as an active board member, Dr. Shapiro found time to be active in the Jewish Women's Council, Temple B'nai Israel, and the Toledo Museum of Art. She also gave energy and money to countless local charities.  In an interview 10 years ago, Dr. Shapiro said,       Yes, I have no complaints. I think I had the best life that      anybody could have. I had everything that I needed--the      education. In those days what girl got a college education?  Dr. Eva Shapiro's energy, her unhesitating willingness to help those in need, and her love of life should be an example to us all. Toledoans are privileged to have known her and have been inspired by her pioneering life. We will cherish her memory.                          ____________________
