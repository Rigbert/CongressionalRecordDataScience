Chairman, my amendment would essentially strike the provision related to the waters of the United States, section 108. Unfortunately, Republican insistence on the inclusion of poison pill riders like this one has derailed several important pieces of legislation over the last few years, especially clean water rural riders.  However, let me be plain. This rider is worse than any of those previous versions, and it will not gain the Democratic votes necessary to become law. It actually is a roadblock in the way of us moving our bills forward.  This rider would exempt the repeal of the clean water rule from laws that would otherwise apply, including the Administrative Procedure Act, essentially allowing the President to act unilaterally, the executive branch to act unilaterally without any input from the public. That doesn't sound like America to me.  The Administrative Procedure Act was a Republican idea to make sure that government is accountable to its citizens and that their input be considered. People have come to expect this in their own communities. Exempting this action on clean water is a very slippery slope toward government by fiat, by an administration which deserves more scrutiny, I might add, on that front than any in our history.  So I urge all my colleagues to support the Kaptur-Beyer amendment.  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
