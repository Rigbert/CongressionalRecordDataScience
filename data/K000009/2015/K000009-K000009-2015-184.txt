Speaker, I rise to remember the life of Fred Miller of Toledo, Ohio. Passing from this life at the age of 88, Fred lived life to the fullest.  Fred Miller was born on March 28, 1925 to Mattie and Roy Miller. A lifelong Toledoan, he graduated from DeVilbiss High School in 1943 and soon followed graduation with service in the U.S. Army Air Corps in Europe until after World War II. Upon his return home, he enrolled in the University of Toledo where he graduated in 1949 with a degree in electrical engineering. A few months later he married his wife Dorothy. Dorothy and Fred were married 64 years and together raised three sons.  Fred Miller built his career at the Toledo Edison Company, giving the company 38 years of service.  A man of faith and service to others, Fred was an active member of Aldersgate United Methodist Church where he served on the finance committee for many years. He also found time to serve as a Boy Scout leader.  Retirement saw Fred furthering his skills as an angler, fishing all over North America from Alaska to the Florida Keys. He and Dorothy were fortunate to travel the world. He was also able to indulge in his hobbies of photography and building model airplanes.  Fred Miller was a loving husband, father and grandfather. He was a man who gave fully to his family, his faith and his community. May those who loved him find peace in the memory of his spirit and the imprint he leaves on their lives.                          ____________________
