President, first, I thank my friend and colleague from Oklahoma for his usual courtesy.  Mr. President, I had spoken before about various Members of this body who are retiring. But last week, as I was sitting at my home in Vermont, looking back down through the list of those retiring Senators of both parties--many of whom, incidentally, visited Vermont at one time or another--I was struck by a common thread. Let me tell you, first, of the Senators who are retiring, and then I will speak of that thread.  Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee; Senator Pell of Rhode Island, the former chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and one of the most senior Members of this body--in fact, I believe the most senior one retiring this year; Senator Sam Nunn, former chairman of the Armed Services Committee and Senator Bennett Johnston, former chairman of the Energy Committee, both of whom came here a couple of years ahead of me; Senators David Pryor of Arkansas and Paul Simon of Illinois, and Alan Simpson of Wyoming; William Cohen of Maine. Senators Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas,Howell Heflin of Alabama, Jim Exon of Nebraska, Bill Bradley of New Jersey, and Hank Brown of Colorado.  All of these people served with distinction, each for different reasons, each for their own area of expertise. But when you look down through this list, if you are one of the people who handicaps political races, you would have to say, whether you were Republican or Democrat, the thing they each have in common is that each one of these Senators would have been reelected. The Democrats in this list would have easily been reelected. The Republicans in this list would have been easily reelected. A couple have literally run without opposition in the past.  Maybe it says something about this body. To me, it says two things. One is that we have fallen, both here and in the other body, fallen into the habit of allowing things to become too partisan, too personal, and, in many instances, mean. There is too much aiming for the special interest groups of the ultraright or the ultraleft, too often looking for legislation that is designed to be a slogan, rather than to be of substance for this country.  But the people I have mentioned here are the ones who have tried to stay away from that, who have tried to bring us back to the middle, back to the center, realizing at some point Republicans and Democrats have to come together.  I think of Mark Hatfield and what he has done, both as chairman and as ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, where if there is ever a committee where individual interests sometimes go way over any question of ideology, it is in that committee. How many times he has brought us all together so we could come out for the good of the country.  Senator Kassebaum, who in her work, her quiet work but her steady and honest and complete work for this country and for this body, both as chair of her committee and as representative of her State, earned the complete applause of every Member of this body. There is not a Member here who is happy to see her retire. We all wish she would stay. That is obviously the way the people of Kansas feel.  Senator Sam Nunn, who is recognized by Republicans and Democrats alike as one of the foremost voices in this body on defense matters, someone to whom both Republican and Democratic Presidents have gone, as have the leaders of both parties in here, time and time again, for advice and help and support--again, one who brought Republicans and Democrats together.  Bennett Johnston, who is probably as able a legislator as I have ever served with, again, as both chairman and ranking member, taking legislation through this body that would have stymied anybody else.  Alan Simpson, a person with whom I share a great friendship, as well as, I might say, the same barber. He has an ability and a very candid, some would say earthy style of bringing us together. He is also a person who has always kept his word to both sides of the aisle.  Bill Cohen is a man who brings a legislator's expertise but a poet's soul to this body. He has worked so often with me and with others on this side of the aisle to craft bipartisan solutions to some of the most difficult issues in this body, ranging from the use of our intelligence agencies to our worldwide power.  Howell Heflin, with whom I sat in both the Agriculture and Judiciary Committees, the wise judge who, when we are unable to reach a solution, somehow seems to come up with one--again, that brings us together.  Claiborne Pell, one of the most distinguished Members of this body, and most loved Members, a quiet man who, again, always seems to do what is right.  Paul Simon, historian, at the time when this body is losing so much of its sense of history, again, he will bring us back, over and over again, not only to what is right but also what is historically right.  You see Hank Brown, Bill Bradley, Jim Exon, people with whom I have either served on committees or committees of conference with them or as cosponsors of their legislation, again, understanding that at some point we have to come together.  I believe I mentioned all in this list, except for Senator David Pryor. It is no overstatement to say David Pryor is the friend of all of us. We all understand David's motivation in leaving, both for his health, and for his family--primarily for family. David Pryor would not have been contested this year. He would have won virtually by acclamation in Arkansas.  There is hardly a Member in this body who has not gone to David at some point and said, ``How do we get out of this impasse? How do we work it through?'' I must say, President Clinton, in good days and in bad days, has been fortunate to have David Pryor here, as one he could speak to and from whom he could get an honest assessment, and also one we could speak to, whether we had good news or bad news for the President.  All of these people will be missed, but I don't think we can overstate that what we have lost by these Senators leaving. They leave behind a body that grows increasingly polarized, and the country suffers, the Senate suffers. I have said so many times--it is a mantra almost to me--this body should be the conscience of the Nation. The conscience is one where we come together collectively and speak to the best instincts in the greatest democracy history has ever known. This requires men and women of good will in both parties to recognize the differences in each other's region of the country, in each other's philosophy, sometimes in each other's goals * * * but, through all that, to understand ultimately it is the United States' goals that must be met. It is this country's goals that must be met, but it is also the history and the integrity of this body that must be preserved.  We are making decisions for our children and for our grandchildren. They are going to live most of their lives in the next century. Our decisions should be for that next century, not just for this week's partisan gain or this election's partisan gain or this evening's news.  So I hope when we come back into session in January--and I will be one who will be here--that all of us, Democrats and Republicans alike, will pledge to follow the examples of so many of these Senators I have talked about, and work to come together, not to further polarize, both this body and the other body. In the end, neither party gains or loses an advantage by that polarization, but the country does lose--it loses badly.  Every one of us will say goodbye with fondness and affection to these Members of the Senate. Each one of us will miss these Members of the Senate, no matter which party we belong to. But I might add, if we want to honor their distinguished service in this body, let's do it by pledging, as we come into the 105th Congress, that we do it with more a sense of comity, of accommodation, of bipartisanship and upholding the Nation's interests and the responsibilities and respect and proud history of the U.S. Senate.                          ____________________
