 BAUCUS. On November 7 of this year the voters of Yellowstone County in my home State of Montana overwhelmingly approved a mill levy to provide $250,000 to the opening phase of the construction of the new Yellowstone County National Veterans Cemetery. However, the local mill levy only provides part of the funding needed and is to be used in conjunction with anticipated Federal funding as well asprivate donations because the first phase of the project has a preliminary cost estimate of over $1 million for roads, irrigation, and site improvements. Federal funds are needed for the project to begin. This funding is very important to Montana because we are out of burial space for our veterans. This new cemetery would provide burial spaces for our veterans for the next 20 to 30 years.
