 President, I am here today to remember the life of a dear friend, MG Charles Beach Jr., of Beattyville, KY. General Beach passed away this past Veterans Day, at the age of 90. He was a genuine servant to his country, his hometown, and the Commonwealth of Kentucky. While General Beach will be greatly missed, the contributions that he has made to Kentucky, and the sacrifices that he has made for this Nation, will surely live on as his legacy.  Charles Beach knew from a young age that he wanted to serve his country, and in 1940, he graduated from the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, VA. Shortly after graduation, he completed his special training and began his active service. While in Italy in 1944, Charles became severely wounded during battle. He spent the next 8 months recovering in a military hospital and was awarded the Purple Heart.  Charles Beach joined the Army Reserves after he was released from active duty. After a short time in the Reserves, Beach was recommissioned into the U.S. Army, this time with the rank of major. In 1976, he was promoted to major general after becoming the 18th Commander of the 100th Division, where he commanded the Kentucky Army Reserve Training Division.  General Beach's contributions extended beyond his military service; he was an active member of his beloved hometown of Beattyville. The general served his community through many organizations including, as chairman of People Exchange Bank and Insurance, president of the Beattyville/Lee County Chamber of Commerce, president of September Place Retirement Village, and cofounder of a scholarship program to aid eastern Kentucky students wanting to pursue careers in medicine.This scholarship has increased the number of doctors in eastern Kentucky.  For his service to the community, General Beach received several awards, including the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce Volunteer of the Year and the Community Bankers of Kentucky Outstanding Community Banker of the Year awards. The Beattyville/Lee County Chamber of Commerce recognized General Beach for his 58 consecutive years as president. And, Beattyville Mayor Joseph Kash described Beach as ``a true gentleman and a hero of this community. It is appropriate that his passing was on Veterans Day. He was a true patriot.''  The positive impact that General Beach has made on Kentucky and this Nation has certainly not ended with his passing. His legacy will continue to live on through the individuals and the communities he so lovingly helped lead. Known nationally for his leadership and service to our country, I know all Kentuckians join me in grieving the loss of Charles Beach.                          ____________________
