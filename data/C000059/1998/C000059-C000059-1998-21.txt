However, that is one of the reasons why I would accept a perfecting amendment that would waive the rule at a certain threshold and allow for dollars to be raised outside of a district if, in fact, that occurs.  But getting back to the point that I am trying to get at, that people within congressional districts expect their Members to represent their interests within their district. I would say that Members of Congress who raise 95 percent, 90 percent, 80 percent of their dollars outside of the congressional districts that they represent do not represent the districts as well as someone who raises at least 50 percent of their monies from their district.  I would hope that we would pass this amendment. I think the American public would be for it.
