 REID. I think that would be wrong, but we are not trying to get rid of the filibuster. We are changing a tiny aspect of what goes on around here so that people would have to do a couple of things: One is to not filibuster simply getting on a bill. And also, if they want to filibuster, they would have to stand and talk about it and not be in their office someplace.  Senator Durbin just reminded me of one Republican Senator who forced us to be here over the weekend and he then left and went back to a wedding in his State.  I repeat for the third time, the only people who think the Senate is working really well right now are the Republican leader and Republican Senators because it is not working well.
