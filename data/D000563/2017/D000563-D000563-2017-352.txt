President, the termination and removal of James Comey as Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation raises a critical question as to whether the FBI investigation of Russian interference in the last Presidential campaign will continue and whether the investigation into any collusion or involvement by the Trump campaign will be investigated by the FBI. Any attempt to stop or undermine this FBI investigation would raise grave constitutional issues.  We await clarification by the White House as soon as possible as to whether this investigation will continue and whether it will have a credible lead sothat we know it will have a just outcome.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
