 President, I rise to speak on the issue of the cloture vote that is upcoming. I also rise to speak on the amendment that is pending called the Murray-Shelby amendment, which is in violation of NAFTA.  As a person who believes very much in reducing barriers to trade between countries--and particularly for the benefit of America because other countries have much higher barriers than the United States--as we bring down barriers to trade and other countries, going to our level, it is obviously going to help the United States have a more level playing field in order to export our products and to be able to do it in a way that creates jobs in America. We all know export-related jobs are jobs that pay 15 percent above the national average.  While we have had a very big expansion in trade as a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement between the countries of Canada, the United States, and Mexico, we now have a rider on this bill providing an opportunity to put in place some restrictions which may in fact bring retaliatory action on the part of Mexico.  Obviously, when I hear a threat against American agricultural products as one form of retaliation, it gets my attention, being from an agricultural State, particularly when we work so hard to get lower barriers on trade in these international agreements. Quite frankly, barriers to trade are much greater on agriculture than they are for manufactured products and for services, because the worldwide tariff on agricultural products is 45 percent, whereas for most other products the average is about 10 percent to 12 percent.  U.S. tariffs and obstacles to trade are very low in agriculture compared to other countries.  As indicated in a letter, which I cosigned, to our colleagues for them to consider when voting on this provision of the bill, I am as concerned about safety of trucks from other countries using our highways. But I also understand that our Department of Transportation is also concerned about that and is going to put in place very shortly the very successful California system for inspection of trucks so we can make sure the trucks and drivers from other countries are using our highways safely.  But it was suggested yesterday by the Economic Minister of Mexico that if the Senate approves this provision and it becomes law, as the Reuters news article of yesterday indicated, ``It would leave us''--meaning the country of Mexico--``with no other recourse than to take measures against the United States.'' The Economic Minister of Mexico, according to this report, said one option would be to block imports of high-fructose corn syrup from the United States.  This issue has already been one source of friction between our two countries. Mexico has already been placing prohibitive tariffs on our sweeteners. The United States won a World Trade Organization decision against Mexico on this issue. We will be putting in jeopardy the compliance of that measure if they retaliate.  I don't know why any Member of the Senate from an agricultural State--a very important industry in their respective States--would want to vote in support of the Shelby-Murray provision if there were a chance of retaliation against agricultural products, particularly those from the Middle West where corn is such an important agricultural product, and put in jeopardy our exports to China along the lines of the threat of the Economic Minister of Mexico.  I call upon Members of both parties who understand the importance of agriculture and understand the importance of our ability to export our agricultural production. We produce 40 percent more than we consume domestically, and the profitability of agriculture is very much tied to exports. Why would they want to do anything that would bring retaliation against American agriculture, particularly in the Midwest with products such as corn?  I hope every Member in every state where agriculture is an important product, where they are concerned about profitability of agriculture, and where they are particularly concerned about the ability to export our products, will consider the threat of the Economic Minister of Mexico and what they might do in retaliation. We ought to abide by the spirit of the North American Free Trade Agreement and reject the provisions of the appropriations bill that would restrict some of the international obligations of the United States.  I hope every Member will make sure they see their vote as a vote that could negatively affect American agriculture, particularly as it affects corn farmers in America. Why would anybody want to hurt American agriculture by voting for this provision?  American agriculture has benefited from the North American Free TradeAgreement. We are exporting much more agricultural products to Mexico than we did 7 years ago when this agreement was put in place. We should respect the spirit of it. International trade is a two-way street. We cannot expect just to export everything to other countries and not import as well.  I want to make sure that people understand that this vote could be potentially negative to American agriculture. I ask them to consider that.  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a letter from Lee Klien, president of the National Corn Growers Association, and Charles F. Conner, president of the Corn Refiners Association, speaking to their concern about the Murray-Shelby amendment and asking us to take into consideration the position of the Mexican Government, that they might retaliate against American agriculture, particularly American corn and corn products exported to Mexico.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    July 26, 2001.       Dear Senator Lott: The National Corn Growers Association      and Corn Refiners Association, Inc. urge that the Senate not      permit unrelated trade actions to destroy the $90 million      market for U.S. high fructose corn syrup shipped to Mexico.       The Government of Mexico has clearly stated that if      legislation to restrict access of the Mexican trucking      industry to the U.S. becomes law, they will retaliate by      placing restrictions on U.S. exports of high fructose corn      syrup. These exports have already been dampened by trade      actions of the Mexican government and could be ended entirely      if the Mexican trucking measure passed by the House becomes      law. Exports of high fructose corn syrup to Mexico put over      $35 million in the hands of U.S. corn farmers and provide a      much needed market for U.S. grain.       The U.S. recently won a case in the World Trade      Organization contesting existing Mexican restrictions on high      fructose corn syrup exports. This case, and other      developments, could point to achieving a much larger market      for U.S. agriculture in the years to come. Our groups      strongly support measures and actions to open, not close,      trade between the U.S. and our NAFTA partners.       We urge that you protect this market for U.S. agriculture      and reject unwarranted protection that can damage U.S. trade      and violate the intent of NAFTA.           Sincerely,     Lee Kline,       President, National Corn Growers Associations.     Charles F. Conner,       President, Corn Refiners Association, Inc.  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. And I ask unanimous consent that the time during the quorum call be equally divided.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). Is there objection?  Without objection, it is so ordered.  The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
