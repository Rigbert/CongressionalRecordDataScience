COBURN. I only have 45 minutes to get through three other amendments. I don't want to put this into a political game. What I want to do is talk about what the American people ought to be getting from us. This language ought to be changed so that we accept the Appropriations Committee getting the reports early, but then the Department of Homeland Security making it available to the rest of the American public, provided it doesn't have a security implication within it. It is a very straightforward amendment. I hope the committee will accept it and keep it in in conference.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from New Hampshire.
