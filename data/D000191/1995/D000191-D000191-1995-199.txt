Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, today's young people think I am making a joke when I tell them about a river catching fire. That actually happened to the Cuyahoga in Ohio, it was so polluted with industrial wastes and inflammable solvents. In Oregon 3 million residents take for granted the fact they can swim, fish, and even drink Willamette River water. Well, the Willamette River was more like an open sewer in the mid 1960's than it was a pristine river.  They say you cannot turn back the clock. Who would want to turn back the clock to those bad old days? Who indeed? Well, watch for the votes on this bill. A vote for this bill is a vote to turn back the country to the days when our rivers were more like open sewers and industrial cesspools than they were precious resources.
