Mr. Speaker, there is a time when a politician must put politics aside. There is a time when we must stand up and meet our moral obligation as servants of the people.  Millions of Americans are struggling today. They work hard. They are just trying to make ends meet. They are trying to make a way out of no way, and they are looking to Congress for a little bit of light, a little bit of hope after a hard day's work.  They do not want a handout; they just want a fair shake. But with this tax bill, we have abandoned our responsibility to the people who elected us.                              {time}  1700  We have shut the door in their faces. We have told them there is no room in the inn.  In this bill, you cut off the orphaned, the old, the poor, the weak, and the sick. In this bill, you cut Medicaid, Medicare, veterans benefits and housing programs all in the name of financial discipline.  Then how can we in good conscience pass a tax bill that helps the rich get richer and drives millions of our citizens into financial despair? We are asking the poor and the middle class to sacrifice. Shouldn't the rich sacrifice, too?  Where is the mercy, where is the compassion, where is the fairness? Our tax policy should be fair.  I ask you, Mr. Speaker, is it right to have a tax bill that saves hardworking American families only $10 a year while millionaires save thousands and thousands? With $10 you cannot even fill a tank full of gas. You can't pay the light bill. You can't put food on the table or clothes on your children's backs.  Mr. Speaker, this bill is not right. It is not fair. It is not just. It demonstrates shameful disregard for the people of this Nation. As a Nation and as a people and as a Congress, we must do better and we can do better. I ask my colleagues to vote against this tax bill.
