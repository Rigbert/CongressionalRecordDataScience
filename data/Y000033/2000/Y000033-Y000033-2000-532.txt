Mr. Chairman, I submit the following into the Record in support of H.R. 3671.                                         Archery Manufacturers and                                       Merchants Organization,                                  Gainesville, FL, March 13, 2000.     Hon. Don Young,     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Don: We heartily support H.R. 3671, the Wildlife and      Sport Fish Restoration Programs Improvement Act of 2000. We      feel this measure will tighten-up the administration of these      programs and we are particularly supportive of Sec. 102,      Firearm and Bow Hunter Education and Safety Program Grants of      H.R. 3671. This will go a long way toward fulfilling the      commitment made to our sport and industry when we agreed to      be taxed under Pittman-Robertson some 30 years ago.       We also are greatly appreciative of having had the      opportunity to participate in discussions with staff leading      up to the writing of H.R. 3671. There was a refreshing      openness in this entire process.           Sincerely,                                                    Dick Lattimer,                                                    President/CEO.                                       ____         National Rifle Association of America, Institute for            Legislative Action,                                      Fairfax, VA, March 13, 2000.     Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, House Resources Committee, Longworth House Office          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Young: The NRA wholeheartedly supports your      bill, H.R. 3671, the Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration      Programs Improvement Act. We speak on behalf of every one of      our 3.2 million members who pay into the Pittman Robertson      trust fund whether they own firearms for self-defense,      recreational shooting, collecting or hunting.       Sportsmen and other firearm owners put their faith and      trust in the Federal Government when they elected to be taxed      to help fledgling state fish and wildlife agencies of the      1930's begin to launch what we take for granted today as      scientific wildlife management. For over six decades,      sportsmen have trusted the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to      manage their excise tax dollars for the benefit of state      wildlife restoration programs. However, alarmed over several      programs created with the use of administrative dollars, but      without legal authority, the NRA went on record in a      statement submitted for your 1996 oversight hearing on the      ``Teaming with Wildlife'' concept urging the Congress to      examine how the Service was spending trust fund      administrative dollars. Never did we imagine the extent of      waste, abuse and mismanagement that was uncovered through      your Committee's investigative efforts.       The NRA strongly believes that meaningful, long-lasting      reform can only be assured through legislative reform as      embraced by your legislation, H.R. 3671. What the Service can      implement administratively to strengthen internal controls      and management for Pittman-Robertson trust fund and its      counterpart, the Dingell-Johnson trust fund, should be      encouraged. But those efforts alone cannot restore the trust      of our members. Reform must be anchored in corrective      measures made as amendments to the underlying laws.       The NRA appreciates the opportunity that you accorded us to      participate in discussions regarding the shape the reform      language should take. Your bill reflects a very deliberative      process in assimilating a diverse array of recommendations      and views. There are two provisions of H.R. 3671 I would like      to comment on that are of particular importance to our      membership. First, the bill ensures that none of the      administrative funds will ever be used by any organization      that promotes or encourages opposition to hunting, fishing or      trapping or for any project that promotes such opposition.      This is language critical to a reform bill.       Second, on behalf of all our members that rely on shooting      ranges for firearm and hunter safety courses and recreational      and competitive shooting, we appreciate having language in      the bill that earmarks funds for shooting and archery range      purposes. These funds will supplement the discretionary funds      made available to states from one-half of the excise tax      revenue collected on the sale of handguns and archery      equipment. For years our recreational shooters have expressed      concern that states have not lived up to the bargain struck      with them in support of the extension of the excise tax in      the 1970's. We trust that the states will look to these funds      as additional support to assist them in meeting the needs of      the excise tax paying shooters, hunters and archers and will      not attempt to use these funds as an offset to the      discretionary funds.       We thank you for your leadership in overseeing the      examination of Service's management of the trust funds and      your commitment provide an avenue to restore health and      vitality to the programs. These trust funds are unprecedented      in the world and while the conservation dollars can be      counted in the billions, the conservation benefits are      inestimable. It is important for all of us who cherish our      fish and wildlife resources to see that the sportsmen and      women of this country are given a sound reason to be taxed      for the benefit of the conservation, restoration, and      enhancement of those same resources.           Sincerely,                                                  James Jay Baker,                                               Executive Director.                                       ____                                                 National Trappers                                            Association, Inc.,                             New Martinsville, WV, March 13, 2000.     Congressman Don Young.       Dear Congressman Young: This communication is to indicate      the support of the National Trappers Association for H.R.      3671.       NTA has worked hard to assure corrective actions are taken      to be sure the PR-DJ Funds from excise taxes are used for      wildlife and conservation efforts as originally intended.       Thank you so much for doing the right thing for sportsmen      in America, the true conservationists who put their money      where their mouth is.           Sincerely,                                                    Scott Hartman,                       Director, National & International Affairs.                                       ____                                National Wilderness Institute,                                    Washington, DC, April 5, 2000.     Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, House Resources Committee, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for introducing The Wildlife      and Sport Restoration and Improvement Act of 2000. This bill      will help stop the mismanagement by the current leadership of      the Fish and Wildlife Service of the Dingell-Johnson Act, the      Pittman-Robertson Act and other programs administered by the      Division of Federal Aid. These laws are based on the      remarkably straightforward idea of using an excise tax on      guns, ammunition and fishing gear to provide a secure funding      base for state fish and game departments. Most state fish and      wildlife agencies get their budgets almost entirely from the      sale of hunting and fishing licenses and P-R and D-J funds.       In much of the world, sport hunting and fishing are the      privilege of noblemen but America is different, and sportsmen      here are determined to preserve our country's outdoor      heritage and maintain hunting and fishing opportunities for      everyone. That is why sportsmen started these programs which      have been largely responsible for the development of      scientific wildlife management. Of course, the sound wildlife      conservation efforts underwritten by sportsmen also benefit      non-game species. When sportsmen create habitat for quail,      ducks or trout, they also provide habitat for woodpeckers,      eagles and all other species.       Sportsmen pay for conservation and the rest of us have      pretty much gotten a free ride. That is why it was so wrong      for the current leaders of the Fish and Wildlife Service to      loot this uniquely effective program to create slush funds      and use it as a cash cow to cover foreign travel and      unrelated administrative expenses. Their attempt to divert      these funds to anti-hunting groups is an even worse affront.      The mismanagement of these funds is cause for concern about      any new funding mechanism that do not require annual      appropriations. We greatly appreciate your leadership in      upholding our sportsmen-conservationist heritage and taking      steps to clean up the problems at the Fish and Wildlife      Service.           Sincerely,                                                       Rob Gordon,                                               Executive Director.                                       ____                                    Safari Club International,                                      Herndon, VA, March 10, 2000.     Representative Don Young,     Chairman, House Resources Committee, Rayburn HOB, Washington,          DC.     RE: H.R. 3671, the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration and          Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act       Dear Chairman Young: Safari Club International (SCI)      considers H.R. 3671, the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife      Restoration and Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act,      to be of utmost importance for the future of sportsmen and      wildlife in the 106th Congress.       This is a bipartisan reform legislative effort. The bill      has been introduced with a diverse and respected group of co-     sponsors, including yourself, Representative John Dingell (D-     MI), Representative Tom DeLay (R-TX), Representative Owen      Pickett (D-VA), Representative Richard Pombo (R-CA),      Representative Chris John (D-LA), Representative John      Peterson (R-PA), and others. The Congressional Sportsmen's      Caucus supports the legislation because of the positive      impact it will have on wildlife, habitat and sportsmen far      into the future.       H.R. 3671 will bring integrity and respect back into the      system. As you know, the original intent of the Pittman-     Robertson (P-R) excise tax was that it be used solely for the      purpose of wildlife restoration in the 50 states. GAO      investigations into the misuse of P-R funds revealed that      ``P-R funds were being administered like a big shell game.''      H.R. 3671 eliminates any ambiguity in the current statute by      explicitly delineating proper purposes for the fund. In      addition to setting clear guidelines for federal      administrators it will also emphasize to state wildlife      administrators the intent of the law when spending      sportsmen's dollars. H.R. 3671 will ensure accountability      when spending money that comes from sportsmen.       In many cases the past distribution and spending of      Pittman-Robertson funds did not follow the intent of the 1937      law. The areas badly neglected were hunter education,      firearms safety, archery ranges, archery training and      firearms ranges. Groups like SCI, AMO, NSSF, and NRA had to      privately fund hunter education. Seven thousand volunteers      had to step in and assume responsibility because this      intended use of P-R money was not fulfilled as it should have      been.       For example, in 1970, archers were promised that if they      came into the excise tax program, that 50% of the money      raised would be used for ranges and instruction. Since 1975,      $282,189,160.00 have been raised. Very little of the promised      $141 million has been used for ranges or instruction. Most of      it was diverted to other uses. A very important part of the      legislation is a restatement of the original intent.       The final, and perhaps the most important part of the      legislation is a provision that encourages NGO's to      participate in a matching grant program for hunter education,      shooting safety, and recruitment of young people into an      appreciation of the outdoors. This section involves those who      pay the tax by allowing them to have a voice in how their      money is spent.       For over 60 years, Pittman-Robertson funds have provided an      abundance of wildlife and habitat that is enjoyed by      sportsmen and the general public. Thank you for your support      of H.R. 3671, which insures that this work can continue far      into the future.           Sincerely,                                             Lawrence S. Katz,                                                        President.                                         Alfred S. Donau, III,                                      Government Affairs Chairman.                                            Hon. Ron Marlenee,                                                       Consultant.                                   Texas Wildlife Association,                                  San Antonio, TX, March 31, 2000.     Hon. Don Young,     Chair, House of Representatives, Committee on Resources,          RHOB, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Young: One of the great honors of my life has      been testifying before you and your committee describing the      problems that resulted in your filing H.R. 3671. Passing      without dissent out of your committee speaks volumes about      bringing justice to the folks who have been paying for      conservation since 1937, and before. Who are they? Hunters      and anglers have paid for conservation . . . period.       Not only has the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service forgotten      this fact, they have also ignored the central mission of      government: government should enable rather than require, let      alone try to do itself. Your H.R. 3671 reminds the USFWS that      their first duty is to empower the states to foster effort      from their citizens.       The thousands of members of the Texas Wildlife Association,      who hunt and fish and lovingly conserve many, many millions      of acres of private wildlife habitat, urge all members of      Congress to vote for H.R. 3671.           Very respectfully submitted,                                                David K. Langford,                                         Executive Vice President.                                       ____                             Trans Texas Heritage Association,                                       Alpine, TX, March 31, 2000.     Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, House Resources Committee, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Young: The Trans Texas Heritage Association      and regional associations, Davis Mountains Trans-Pecos and      Hill Country Heritage Associations, represent members who own      more than 15.5 million acres of private land in Texas. It is      on behalf of these members that we thank you for introducing      The Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration and Improvement Act      of 2000.       The Heritage Association members are land stewards,      sportsmen, and conservationists. We are outraged by the U.S.      Fish and Wildlife Service's (USFWS) mishandling of funds from      the Pittman-Robertson, Dingell-Johnson Act and other programs      which were specifically set aside to fund state fish and game      departments. Even more reprehensible is the USFWS's attempt      to divert these funds to anti-hunting groups. We are thankful      that The Wildlfie and Sport Fish Restoration and Improvement      Act of 2000 will help to stop these and other abuses.       Chairman Young, we sincerely appreciate your commitment and      efforts that will benefit the preservation and conservation      of our nation's sportsmen's and outdoor heritage.           Very truly yours,                                                    C.M. Van Eman,                                                        President.                                       ____                                     The Mule Deer Foundation,                                          Reno, NV, April 5, 2000.     Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, House Resources Committee, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC       Dear Mr. Chairman: Your leadership for The Wildlife and      Sport Fish Restoration and Improvement Act of 2000 is to be      commended. The Mule Deer Foundation (MDF) anticipates this      bill, when enacted, will assist the US Fish and Wildlife      Service to better manage Federal Aid funds. MDF is especially      supportive of good management of the funds from the Pittman-     Robertson Act and the Dingell-Johnson Act. These Acts are      central to the conservation funding in this country and are,      frankly, an unprecedented model for sustainable conservation      worldwide. Hunters and fishermen in our country historically      have been the first to step to the plate to support      conservation and these Acts provide a critical source of      funding for conservation to stated conservation agencies.      With the disparate pressures that come from varied interests,      it is of critical importance that we continue to safeguard      and improve the management of these funds.       The Mule Deer Foundation recognizes that this bill passed      out of the House Resources Committee with an amazing 36-0      vote. MDF     would like to voice its support for this bill and      congratulations to the Committee for its bi-partisan approach      to improving management of Federal Aid Funds.       The Mule Deer Foundation is a 501(c)(3) not for profit,      charitable organization whose Mission is to ensure the      conservation of mule and blacktailed deer and their habitats.       Chairman Young, on behalf of The Mule Deer Foundation, let      me thank you and your Committee on this effort in behalf of      American's conservation programs.           Very truly yours,                                               William I. Morrill,                                               President, and CEO.                                       ____                                    Gulf Lumber Company, Inc.,                                        Mobile, AL, April 5, 2000.     Hon. Don Young, Chairman, House Resources Committee, House of        Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: Since the founding of the Mobile County      Wildlife Association and the Alabama Wildlife Federation in      the mid 1930's, my family has been involved in the      innumerable conservation and wildlife organizations. We have      spent untold dollars and man-hours furthering the      conservation of wildlife and wildlife habitat.       I tell you this to say thank you for introducing The      Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration and Improvement Act of      2000. This bill will help stop the mismanagement by the      current leadership of the Fish and Wildlife Service of the      Dingell-Johnson Act, the Pittman-Robertson Act and other      programs administered by the Division of Federal Aid.       It is wrong for the current leaders of the Fish and      Wildlife Service to loot this uniquely effective program to      create slush funds and use it as a cash cow to cover foreign      travel and unrelated administrative expenses. Their attempt      to divert these funds to anti-hunting groups is an even worse      affront.       We greatly appreciate your leadership in upholding our      sportsmen-conservationist heritage and taking steps to clean      up the problems at the Fish and Wildlife Service.           Sincerely,                                            W.S. (Sandy) Stimpson,                                               Sr. Vice President.
