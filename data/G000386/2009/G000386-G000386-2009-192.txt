 President, I want to note for the record that I will object to any unanimous consent request relating to the nomination of Thomas A. Shannon Jr., to be Ambassador to Brazil. On July 28, I wrote a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk asking for a clarification of the President's position regarding the U.S. ethanol tariff in light of Mr. Shannon's stated view on the tariff. I will continue to object to any unanimous consent request proffered with respect to Mr. Shannon's nomination until such time as the administration responds to my letter and I have an opportunity to review such response.                          ____________________
