 President, reserving the right to object--and I will be objecting--let me just say to my good friend from Florida that regardless of the substantive arguments he is making, as a practical matter, if we were to repass the Senate bill, it would not pass the House, so it would not achieve the result we are looking for. So I guess who is playing political games is in the eye of the beholder.  If we want to get an outcome, if we want to get $1.1 billion appropriated to combat Zika and do it now, and if we want to fund the military construction bill, the proposal the Senator from Florida is asking for will not achieve that; therefore, I object.
