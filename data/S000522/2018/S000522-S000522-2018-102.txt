Mr. Speaker, on December 6, 2017, the Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations held a hearing entitled ``Advancing Human Rights to Combat Extremism.'' The hearing focused on ways soft power and human rights diplomacy could effectively combat extremist ideology and policies. I had the privilege to sit down with Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan recently and discuss this issue with him in the context of our ongoing dialogue with the Government of Sudan. Mr. Speaker, Deputy Secretary Sullivan gave a speech at the Al-Neelain Mosque in Sudan before a variety of faith leaders. In the speech, he makes the case for a values-based diplomacy, and holding countries accountable for violations of fundamental human rights, especially religious freedom. I am pleased to include in the Record the speech he gave with his permission:       Asalaam Alaikam. I am honored to join all of you here      today.       I would like to first thank the leaders of the Al-Neelain      Mosque for hosting us today and for their gracious      hospitality.       Many people from different faiths, backgrounds, and      cultures have joined us here today to talk about the      important work they are undertaking in Sudan to embrace      tolerance and further the goal of mutual respect among all      citizens.       It was a great privilege to spend time with many of you      earlier this morning and to learn about the many ways that      interfaith groups are working together to forge a new path      forward in Sudan and to move away from divisions based on      religion and culture. Our discussion was particularly      significant as we continue to build a new relationship      between the United States and Sudan. I want you to know that      the U.S. government and international community stand with      you in this important work.                          THE U.S. COMMITMENT       This is my first visit to your beautiful country. Secretary      Tillerson asked me to travel to Khartoum to speak with you      and your government about the growing importance of our      bilateral relationship. I am here today to underscore one key      aspect of that relationship: the shared values of mutual      respect, tolerance, and religious freedom.       I would like to share a bit of my own personal history on      these topics, as they are central to who I am. I am the      grandson of Irish-Catholic immigrants who arrived in Boston,      Massachusetts in the 1880s. At the time they arrived--and for      many decades that followed--Catholics in the United States      faced widespread prejudice based on their religion. When John      F. Kennedy--another Catholic from my home state--ran for      President of the United States in 1960, he even had to give a      prominent speech to reassure the nation that his faith was      compatible with the duties of the office of President.       In the United States today, recalling such history seems      quaint. But it was not easy, and it took many decades.      Eventually divisions were narrowed and mutual understanding      between Catholics and Protestants in the United States      improved substantially. Today, it is nearly unthinkable that      one's status as a Catholic in the United States would serve      as a disadvantage to one's ambitions for life.       The American experience in this regard underscores that      respect for the human dignity of every person--regardless of      religious belief or origin--is a key component of not only      protecting human rights, but also fostering a society that      can flourish, build upon each other's strengths, and move      forward together.       This brings me to one of the purposes of my visit: to make      clear that the United States remains deeply committed to      positive engagement with Sudan on a wide range of topics--     including the protection of religious freedom and the      promotion of other human rights throughout your country.       This path of closer engagement is new for both of us.       In 2015, after decades of strained bilateral relations, the      United States began a measured engagement with your      government to urge greater progress in various peace      processes and to seek positive changes for the people of      Sudan--regardless of religion, class, or ethnic background.       In June 2016, Sudan and the United States initiated a      historic framework for the path forward, the so-called Five      Track Engagement Plan.       This plan outlined five priority areas for constructive      engagement, and required the Sudanese government to:       (1) cease hostilities in conflict regions, including the      aerial bombardment in Darfur and the Two Areas of South      Kordofan and Blue Nile states;       (2) improve humanitarian access throughout Sudan so that      aid groups could provide vital resources and assistance      needed by the Sudanese people;       (3) refrain from interfering in South Sudan and instead      play a constructive role in regional peace efforts;       (4) cooperate with regional efforts to counter the Lord's      Resistance Army, and;       (5) build U.S.-Sudanese cooperation on counter terrorism,      and make both of our countries safer. In each of those five      areas, the Government of Sudan has made measureable progress.      As a result, last month, the United States formally revoked      certain U.S. sanctions on Sudan to open a new chapter in our      bilateral relationship.       We hope that these positive developments are emblematic of      a positive trajectory for the future of our bilateral      relationship. But, we also recognize that completion of the      Five Track Engagement Plan is only a first step on a longer      road toward fully normalizing our bilateral relations.       More hard work is required--from both of our countries.                     NEXT STEPS IN THE RELATIONSHIP       The United States is eager to see Sudan make progress in a      range of areas in the months and years ahead, as we work      towards a new framework for bilateral engagement. In short,      the closer our countries become, the higher our expectations      for Sudan will become.       This engagement will proceed on several fronts.       For Sudan to become a full partner of the United States, it      must seek peace within its borders and with its neighbors,      and cooperate reliably with the international community to      improve security and prosperity in the region and adhere to      long-standing international norms.       In addition, supporting human rights, including religious      freedom, has been, and will     continue to be, a critical part of the United States'      bilateral engagement with Sudan.       In the United States, the protection of the basic rights      and freedoms of our citizens is fundamental to who we are as      a nation. The Bill of Rights in the U.S. Constitution--our      foundational legal document--sets forth protections for      individual liberties and prohibitions on government power in      these realms, including freedom of religion, freedom of      speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of assembly. These      are among our most cherished rights as Americans, and the      protection of human rights and the dignity of the individual      has served as a key basis of U.S. foreign policy throughout      our history.       This history has shown that U.S. partnerships around the      world are strongest and most durable with countries that take      the necessary steps to protect the same basic human rights      and freedoms that are central in the United States.       In the years ahead, one measure of the strength of the U.S-     Sudanese relationship will be improvements in Sudan's respect      for human rights and, in particular, religious freedom.      Indeed, one of the reasons I am speaking to you today--at the      Al-Neelain Mosque, with Sudanese Muslim and Christian      leaders--is to emphasize that the United States cares deeply      about religious freedom in Sudan.       By taking steps to enhance protections for religious      freedom, the Government will make the entire country more      stable and secure.       Interfaith understanding, respect, and the protection of      religious freedom and other human rights are bulwarks against      extremism. Religious tolerance is a building block of peace      and security and is the mark of responsible governance. The      treatment of members of religious minorities is often the      ultimate indicator of a government's commitment to these      values.       When governments favor a specific religious, ethnic, or      sectarian group over others, violent radicalism thrives. We      also know that governments that sponsor or condone violence      against their own people are far more likely to see violent      extremism growing in their country.       But by protecting every person's human rights, society is      more just, more free, and more stable for everyone.       For these reasons, we urge the Government of Sudan to      protect basic freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly,      association, religion, and movement. The United States calls      on Sudan to protect political opposition members, human      rights defenders, civil society groups, and the media. We      also urge the government to hold accountable all who are      responsible for human rights abuses.       On the issue of religious freedom, the United States has      continued to designate Sudan as a `Country of Particular      Concern.'       The State Department's annual International Religious      Freedom Report noted instances of the arrest, detention, and      intimidation of religious leaders, and the denial of permits      for the construction of new churches; restrictions on non-     Muslim religious groups from entering the country; and the      censorship of religious material.       During my discussions with senior leaders over the last six      months, we have welcomed the Sudanese Government's expressed      desire to take steps to overcome its designation as a Country      of Particular Concern. However, for that to occur, we must      see concrete and demonstrable progress through better      policies and improved laws.       We have communicated these steps to the Sudanese Government      through a proposed `Action Plan,' which we hope Sudan will      approve and enact. As an immediate confidence-building      measure, we have suggested that the Government convene a      roundtable with members of religious minority groups about      property registration issues, as certain government officials      have cited registration issues as the rationale for the      demolitions of places of worship. The Government of Sudan,      including the Federal States, should also immediately suspend      demolitions of places of worship, including churches and      mosques.       President Trump, Vice President Pence, and Secretary      Tillerson have made clear that the protection and promotion      of religious freedom is a foreign policy priority of the      Administration. As we move forward in our relationship, the      United States will not ignore violations of human rights,      including the right to religious freedom.       The United States is ready and willing to assist in these      efforts.       To that end, we will explore opportunities to work with      religious leaders who build bridges through tolerance and      interfaith understanding to counter extremism--like those      leaders with me here today--while we bring in new voices to      further conversations about accountability and inclusive      governance.       The United States will also review our people-to-people      programs, such as the Young African Leaders Initiative and      International Visitor Leadership Program, to identify ways to      maximize partnerships and exchanges with the people of Sudan.      I am pleased to see so many alumni here this morning as a      testament to the success of these programs.       Indeed, we believe that any country-to-country relationship      begins on the individual level. We are committed to finding      more avenues for Sudanese religious and youth leaders to      advance interfaith efforts for peace.            OTHER PRIORITIES FOR THE U.S.-SUDAN RELATIONSHIP       Before I conclude, I also want to touch on a few other      important aspects of the U.S.-Sudan relationship.       We recognize that there are ongoing impediments, including      certain commercial and financial restrictions, on the      bilateral relationship between our countries and a lack of      normalized diplomatic relations. Further strengthening of our      bilateral relationship will require a renewed commitment by      the Government of Sudan on other policies beyond religious      freedom.       In particular, while restraint and a cessation of attacks      in conflict areas is a positive step forward, we now expect      the Sudanese government to move closer to a permanent      ceasefire that will create an opening for a truly inclusive      political dialogue in Darfur and the Two Areas.       The armed opposition must of course also denounce      hostilities and make a commitment to a negotiated peace. All      parties who have signed the African Union roadmap must live      up to their commitment to engage in dialogue toward a      resolution of the conflicts and a comprehensive and inclusive      political process, and those who have yet to join the process      must do so, as there is no other path to peace and improving      the conditions of the people living in the conflict areas. As      a first step, the opposition should accept the U.S. proposal      to facilitate humanitarian aid in conflict areas across lines      to help those who are suffering the most.       Moving forward, we also encourage the Government to improve      cooperation with UNAMID--the AU-UN Hybrid Mission in Darfur.      UNAMID protects civilians, facilitates humanitarian      assistance, and mediates conflict at the local and national      level in Darfur.       This mission--which the United States strongly supports--     will continue to be instrumental to Sudan's future and      greater collaboration with the UN is a win-win proposition      for the people of Sudan.       Violence, war, and ongoing instability are holding Sudan      back from a future with great potential. Conflict has      affected millions. Hundreds of thousands of Sudanese have      been displaced and killed. It is time for a path to      reconciliation and peace. Your country's prosperity and the      security of future generations depend on it.       The United States calls on all parties to take this      opportunity to define a way forward that will help all of      Sudan's people.       Finally, the United States is also looking for the Sudanese      Government to help counter international security threats. In      that regard, I very much appreciate and applaud Sudan's      public statements condemning North Korean provocations, and      Sudan's full commitment to compliance with the UN Security      Council Resolutions regarding North Korea. Finally, the      statements yesterday by the Government of Sudan affirming      that it will cut off all ties with North Korea is most      welcome.                               CONCLUSION       Let me conclude by noting that I am deeply encouraged by      the interactions I have had with the Government and with      civil society representatives during my visit here. The      religious leaders with whom I met earlier today are a deep      source of inspiration.       Indeed, there are challenges that lie ahead, but we should      all have reason for hope and optimism about the growing      engagement between our two countries.       Thank you for your hospitality and kindness. I look forward      to many more opportunities to further our goals of a more      peaceful and prosperous Sudan--a Sudan that respects the      rights of persons of every faith.                          ____________________
