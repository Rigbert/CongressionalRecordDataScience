Speaker, the American people believe that Federal support for education represents the most valuable investment we can make in our Nation's future. Yet, throughout this Congress, Republicans have repeatedly targeted programs that help our students reach their full potential. The Labor-HHS bill cuts an unprecedented $4 billion from education funding, taking Federal investment in education to its lowest level since 1989.  And, where have the Republicans begun their assault on education? They have begun the assault on our youngest, most vulnerable children. To benefit fully from schooling, all children need to come to school ready to learn. Perhaps more than any other program, Head Start is about our future. This legislation would deny 180,000 children access to Head Start over the next 7 years.  This legislation also targets poor and disadvantaged students who need help the most to improve their academic performance. I find it ironic that Republicans want to withdraw support for title I at the same time that they are attempting to abandon affirmative action programs. Democracy is conditioned on fairness and equal opportunity. Enacted in 1965, title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act was part of a powerful demand that American society live up to its ideals by extending equal opportunity to all. This program sends money to more than 1 million disadvantaged students who need help to achieve in school. If equal opportunity does not begin here, then were does it begin? Today, this program represents the largest Federal investment in elementary and secondary education and enables millions of children to receive the extra help they need in reading and math.  Learning is difficult in schools where students fear for their safety or drug use is widespread. I was proud to be a part of the last Congress that took a strong stand on violence in our public schools. The Safe-and-Drug Free Schools Program helps every one of Rhode Island's 37 school districts to create a safe learning environment. Nationally, this program has enabled 39 million students feel a little bit more secure as they walk the halls of their schools.  Republicans claim that they stand for an American where every individual has the opportunity to compete. This is not the America that the Republicans have shaped in this bill, however. If education is the springboard to opportunity, then this bill causes our Nation to fall farther and farther behind. This bill slams shut the door of opportunity on our youth and our future.  As Secretary of Education Riley has stated, ``The American people do not support efforts to close the budget deficit by widening the education deficit''. I urge my colleagues to reject this short-sighted bill. Let us not turn our back on our future. The cuts contained in this bill will devastate millions of children and families. I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.                          ____________________
