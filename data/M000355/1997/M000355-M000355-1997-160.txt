 1135. A bill to provide certain immunities from civil liability for trade and professional associations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.  THE TRADE AND PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION FREE FLOW OF INFORMATION ACT  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Trade and Professional Association Free Flow of Information Act, and ask my colleagues to join me by co-sponsoring this important legislation.  Our society is increasingly litigious, especially in the area of product liability. Unfortunately, complex product liability litigation ensnares trade and professional associations that do not manufacture, buy, or sell the product. America's litigation maze often traps associations who do nothing more than publish good-faith factual information for its members regarding various products.  This service is particularly helpful to small business owners who become involved in product litigation, but lack the funds to conduct expensive and time-consuming product research. Additionally, trade and professional associations help their members to avoid litigation by alerting them to critical characteristics of different products. This research and information service is clearly in the best interest of both consumers and small businesses.  My bill would acomplish three goals. First, it grants trade and professional associations limited protection from liability when acting in good faith to provide information to their members. The associations may still be held liable for fraudulently or recklessly distributing false information to their members.  Second, before information may be subpoenaed from an association, a clear case must be made that the information is vital to the case and is unavailable from any other source. Let me point out, however, that this provision does not prevent associations from being served with subpoenas. It merely ensures that the information requested is vital to a particular action and unavailable from any other source.  Finally, the bill establishes a qualified privilege between an association and its members to ensure that confidential materials can be provided for the benefit of association members. This privilege is not absolute--it may be overcome upon proof that the party seeking the materials has a compelling need for the information. This provision is based on a joint defense privilege currently recognized by state and federal courts.  Additionally, this bill includes an opt-out provision similar to the one we included in the Volunteer Protection Act, which the President recently signed into law. This provision permits a State to opt-out of the bill's coverage in any civil action in which all parties are citizens of the State.  Mr. President, the need for this bill was recently discussed in an article of the Legal Times. I ask unanimous consent that this article be published in the Record.  In closing, I would like to emphasize that this bill will allow associations to continue to actively disseminate valuable information to their members, while safeguarding current legal protections against fraud and abuse. The goal of the Free Flow of Information Act is one that I believe I share with a majority of my colleagues--a decrease in costly litigation coupled with an increase in the flow of information between associations and their members. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1135       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Trade and Professional      Association Free Flow of Information Act of 1997''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) trade and professional associations serve the public      interest by conducting research, collecting and distributing      information, and otherwise providing services to their      members with regard to products and materials purchased and      used by those members;       (2) in the decade preceding the date of enactment of this      Act, many large class action lawsuits have been filed against      manufacturers for allegedly defective products;       (3) as a result of the lawsuits referred to in paragraph      (2), many members of trade and professional associations who      are consumers of those products have relied increasingly on      trade and professional associations for information      concerning those products, including information concerning--       (A) the conditions under which such a product may be used      effectively;       (B) whether it is necessary to repair or replace such a      product, and if such a repair or replacement is necessary,      the appropriate means of accomplishing that repair or      replacement; and       (C) any litigation concerning such a product;       (4) trade and professional associations have, with an      increasing frequency, been served broad and burdensome third-     party subpoenas from litigants in product defect lawsuits,      including class action lawsuits;       (5) members of trade and professional associations are      seeking potentially beneficial information relating to      product defects, quality, or performance from the trade and      professional associations;       (6) trade and professional associations have been subject      to lawsuits concerning methods of collection and      dissemination of that information;       (7) the burden of responding to third-party subpoenas in      product defect lawsuits and the threat of litigation have had      a substantial chilling effect on the ability and willingness      of trade and professional associations to disseminate      information described in paragraph (5) to members, and the      threat that information provided on a confidential basis to      members could be subject to discovery in a civil action also      has a chilling effect;       (8) because of the national scope of the problems described      in paragraphs (1) through (7), it is not possible for States      to fully address the problems by enacting State laws; and       (9) the Federal Government has the authority under the      United States Constitution (including article I, section 8,      clause 3 of the Constitution and the 14th amendment to the      Constitution) to remove barriers to interstate commerce and      protect due process rights.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to promote the      free flow of goods and services and lessen burdens on      interstate commerce in accordance with the authorities      referred to in subsection (a)(9) by ensuring the free flow of      information concerning product defects, quality, or      performance among trade and professional associations and      their members.

SEC. 7. SPECIAL MOTION TO QUASH A SUBPOENA.       A trade or professional association may file a special      motion to quash a subpoena on the grounds that the trade or      professional association is exempt from any third-party      discovery request under section 6.     SEC. 8. REQUIRED PROCEDURES REGARDING SPECIAL MOTION TO                    QUASH.

(f) Costs.--If a trade or professional association prevails      in procuring the quashing of a subpoena as a result of a      motion made under section 7, the court shall award the trade      or professional association the costs incurred by that trade      or professional association in connection with making the      motion, including reasonable attorney and expert witness      fees.     SEC. 9. RIGHT TO OBJECT UNDER RULE 45 OF THE FEDERAL RULES OF                    CIVIL PROCEDURE.

Goldman)       In the fall of 1987, Kenneth Halpern dove into his backyard      swimming pool in Mobile, Ala., broke his neck on the pool      bottom, and set off a chain of litigation that would send      shock waves through the trade association community for      years.       Halpern was paralyzed in the dive and died less than a year      later. The suit seeking restitution for his death named the      pool's builder as a defendant. But Halpern's suit went one      step further, also naming as a defendant the pool builders'      trade group, the National Spa and Pool Institute.       Unfortunately for the trade group, the Alabama Supreme      Court in 1990 bought Halpern's argument, at least in part. By      disseminating standards for pool construction to its members,      the court reasoned, the trade group opened itself to      potential liability for injuries caused in a pool.       While the Pool Institute was not ultimately found liable      for Halpern's death, the group spent hundreds of thousands of      dollars proving that its standards were in fact sufficient to      prevent injury. And the case left behind a menacing state      precedent for trade groups of all stripes, leaving them      vulnerable to all manner of liability suits.       Earlier this year, with the Alabama pool case and others      like it in mind, the trade association world called on      Capitol Hill for a legislative fix.       Their savior, they hope, will be Rep. Sonny Bono, the Palm      Springs, Calif., Republican who in May introduced the Trade      and Professional Association Free Flow of Information Act.       Bono's bill would set a national standard shielding      associations from lawsuits when providing information and      technical advice to their members. It would also allow      associations to refuse to respond to subpoenas--unless the      information is available only from the trade group and      nowhere else.       The bill would also set up a type of privilege between a      trade association and its members so that the confidentiality      of documents flowing between the two would be assured.       That's vitally important, explains General Counsel Daniel      Durden of the National Association of Home Builders, because      the fear of litigation has a chilling effect on the      industrywide mediation efforts trade associations are often      ideally situated to oversee.       Take, for example, a widget installed in homes across the      country. Five years later, the widget fails, due to a design      flaw. ``The manufacturer of the widget gets sued, and the      people who put them in their homes--our members--get sued,''      Durden says. ``And if it's a widespread problem, our members      will call us and say, `What can you do for us?'       ``We can play a role in negotiating among the builders,      manufacturers, and potentially the insurance companies in      coming up with a stopgap measure, so the consumer of the      widget doesn't file suit,'' adds Durden, whose group is      actively supporting the Bono bill.       But if the association gets involved in trying to find a      settlement, any information shared with it may no longer be      privileged, Durden says. And that, in turn, can dissuade      members from sharing information.       ``The idea is that by acting in a fashion that forwards a      resolution, an association shouldn't get slammed,'' he says.       Trial lawyers, of course, are deeply offended by the notion      that certain potential defendants should be off-limits, and      are vigorously opposed to the Bono bill.       ``No association, corporation, or individual should be      immunized for responsibility for the injuries they cause,''      Howard Twiggs, outgoing president of the Association of Trial      Lawyers of America, said through a spokesman. ``No citizen      should be denied the opportunity to hold wrongdoers      responsible for their actions.''       Traditionally courts have held that a trade group was      obligated only to its members, not     to the general public, for the accuracy and quality of the      standards it promulgates for its members. After all, the      groups argued, they could not properly be held responsible if      a builder failed to follow their guidelines.       But the Alabama Supreme Court ruling changed all that, by      holding in King v. National Spa and Pool Institute that the      trade association did in fact have a ``duty'' to the public--     regardless of whether it had control over its members'      behavior. (The named plaintiff is Barbara King, the      administrator of Halpem's estate.)       ``What this case says is that if you put our standards and      somebody uses them, then you can be hauled into court and      made to show you used due care in producing them,'' complains      David Karmol, general counsel and chief lobbyist of the      Alexandria, Va.-based Spa and Pool Institute.       ``We did use due process. We got comments from outsiders,      from the Consumer Product Safety Commission,'' says Karmol,      adding that his group has been disseminating pool standards      for 40 years. ``The point is, we did all the right things.      But if you have to prove that in court that you did all the      right things, you've already lost. We spent half a million      dollars winning. I don't know how many associations can      afford to win many half-million dollar cases on a regular      basis.''       No shortage of groups have been called upon to try.       According to Gerard Jacobs, a co-managing partner in the      D.C. office of Chicago's Jenner & Block, trade associations      are increasingly being hauled into court as defendants. ``I      can tell you that Jenner & Block has a dozen such cases,''      says Jacobs. ``Higher than it's ever been.''       Adds James Clarke, chief lobbyist at the American Society      of Association Executives, which is actively supporting      Bono's legislation: ``Groups are more and more fearful that      litigation will tie them up like pretzels.''                               back pain       Among the hardest hit have been four trade associations      that deal with spinal surgery--and are implicated in hundreds      of tort claims against the so-called ``pedicle screw,'' an      orthopedic device officially approved by the Food and Drug      Administration only for use in arm and leg bone      operations, though it is widely used in the pedicles of      the vertebrae during back surgery as well.       According to hundreds of suits filed in recent years, the      Illinois-based North American Spine Society allegedly      conspired with pedicle screw manufacturers to help them      illegally promote their products for uses not approved by the      FDA.       ``Because we accepted money from exhibitors for exhibit      space, charged them with a registration fee, and got some      research funding from them--and then turned around and let      certain doctors whom [trial lawyers] call product promotors      give talks at our annual meeting . . . we allegedly defrauded      our own members into thinking these things were safe,''      complains Eric Muehlbauer, executive director of the Spine      Society.       ``That's ludicrous,'' he argues. ``Why would we defraud our      own members? We were a forum provider, that's all.''       Muehlbauer says more than 500 individuals have sued the      trade group for promoting the use of an ``unreasonably      dangerous'' product. ``Plaintiffs attorneys are giving each      other seminars on how to promote these lawsuits,'' he says,      adding that complaints have also been filed against the      American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, the American      Association of Neurological Surgeons, and the Scoliosis      Research Society.       But, counters plaintiffs attorney Arnold Levin, by      accepting money from pedicle screw vendors, the Spine Society      becomes a legitimate defendant. ``By hosting the      manufacturers, by giving comfort to them, aiding and      assisting them, they became part of the selling arm, they      became part of the manufacturer,'' says Levin, a partner      in Philadelphia's Levin, Fishbein, Sedran & Berman, which      is litigating the issue.       ``And they were trading in a product that hadn't been      approved for that use by the FDA,'' he adds.                           standard procedure       Down in Alabama, which has a reputation as one of the most      favorable places in America for the plaintiffs' bar, trial      lawyer Richard Cunningham of Mobile's Cunningham, Bounds,      Yance, Crowder & Brown says trade associations are not always      the neutral, consumer-friendly forces they often claim to be.       Earlier this month, Cunningham won a potentially      multibillion dollar class action in a Mobile County, Ala.,      circuit court against the Masonite Corp. for installing      faculty hard-board siding in more than four million homes. He      says many trade associations are not at all interested in      consumers, and have nothing more than their members'      interests at heart.       ``The real problem is when you have a trade association      controlled by an industry and they intentionally promulgate      minimal standards which do not impose any burden on the      industry and do not create a safe product,'' he says.       ``The state of the art standard for the industry could be      much higher than the minimal standards set, but it will cost      them much more money to meet that higher      standard,'' Cunningham continues.``But the industry can      use the minimal standards to say, `We were not negligent,      we met the existing standard of care.' In fact, there may      have been a collusive effort between industry on the whole      and the trade association to establish ineffective      standards.''       That wasn't necessarily the case in the Masonite decision,      which includes a minimum of $47.5 million in legal fees for      the dozen or so law firms that took part in the class action.      But during the course of litigation, a subpoena was issued to      the Palatine, Ill.-based American Hardboard Association for      information about the testing of certain hardboard products.       ``It is the practice of trial lawyers to go fishing at      trade association folks to see if there's anything negative      in the files, or whether the association ever warned about      this or that happening,'' says Karmol of the Spa and Pool      Institute, making the case for a legislative remedy.       ``There's an argument to be made that if associations are      to advance the public interest, and allow members to talk      about things to avoid similar situations in the future, there      ought to be some kind of protection.''       In fact, Karmol concedes, the number of times the institute      has been named in a lawsuit has not increased over time.      ``But I attribute that to our aggressive defense. Most trial      lawyers are looking for defendants who will role over and      kick in $100,000 to a settlement,'' he says.       While it appears that nothing short of legislation will      stop associations from being drawn into court, those who have      represented such groups in these cases say there are ways to      avoid worsening their plight once there, including      maintaining a judicious level of discretion.       If you don't want the court to construe that you have a      duty to the public, and hence can be targeted in a lawsuit,      don't brag to them about the information you disseminate,      says Jacobs, the Jenner & Block partner. And make sure your      standards are more than sufficient.       ``Do your due diligence,'' counsels Jacobs. ``and don't      crow to consumers about the value of your program if it is      designed to assist members. It's much more difficult [to      defend yourself] when you make pronouncements at large.''       Meanwhile, while the Bono legislation will undoubtedly face      stiff opposition in Congress--the trial lawyers remains a      formidable foe--supporters are cheered that at least the      issue is now getting some attention.       ``It's in its infancy,'' acknowledges the ASAE's Clarke,      referring to the proposed legislation. ``But there will be      lots of work and lots of efforts in this area. We don't want      it to be seen as open season on associations.''                                 ______                                       By
