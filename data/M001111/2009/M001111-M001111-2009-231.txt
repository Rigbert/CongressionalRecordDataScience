 The original authors      stated that they did not intend to exclude flight crews in      unique circumstances from the bill's protection simply      because of the airline industry's ``unusual time keeping      methods''. They believed that these workers--flight      attendants and pilots--were entitled to family and medical      leave under the law based upon the situation they      specifically faced.       This legislation received overwhelming bipartisan support      in the House of Representatives. I am pleased to present it      in the Senate with bipartisan support. This language was      drafted through a process that included representatives from      large and small airline carriers and carrier associations,      and organized labor. I need to recognize the work that      Senator Clinton did on this bill when she introduced its      precursor in the 110th Congress.
