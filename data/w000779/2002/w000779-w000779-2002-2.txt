President, recently I introduced with Senator Hatch health care legislation, the Health Care that Works for All Americans Act. I come to the floor today because I think many Senators are frustrated about the inability to make more progress on the health care issue in this session of the Senate. I want to take a few minutes and talk about what I think the key principles are for this country to make headway with respect to health care.  The three principles that I believe are central on this health care issue are, first and foremost, to make sure the public is involved from the ground floor. Again and again, what we have seen is health care legislation proposed that is attacked by special interest groups, and then it goes nowhere. The public gets understandably confused about the discussion, and the bill dies.  Under the Wyden-Hatch legislation, the public would get the first crack at looking at the key issues, which are: What are the essential services that people feel strongly about? How much would they cost? And who would pay for them?  The second feature of our legislation is that it establishes a process to ensure that Congress actually votes for meaningful and comprehensive health reform. The last time Congress took a crack at this, almost a decade ago, there were not even votes in Congress on the legislation.  The third principle we ought to zero in on with respect to health care for the future is that it has to be bipartisan. The Wyden-Hatch legislation is literally the first bipartisan effort in comprehensive health reform in a decade.  I come to the Chamber today to say those three principles--involving the public at the outset, ensuring there will be an actual vote by the Congress on comprehensive legislation, and that the bill be bipartisan--ought to be the core of the Senate's effort to reform the health care system.  Today I wish to take a couple of minutes to talk about a central part of our legislation, and that is what to do about rising health care costs in America.  Rising costs in American health care are a runaway train, and the American people have literally been tied to the track. Again and again, small businesses come up to us and say they have been subjected to 15-, 20-, 25-percent rate hikes year after year. This is all before the demographic tsunami comes in 2010 and 2011 when we will have millions of baby boomers, and right now millions of working families, some with insurance, some without, that cannot afford doctor visits and disease treatments and the drugs they need. So certainly at the center of any effort to reform health care has to be putting the brakes on those rising costs that are literally a runaway train in our society.  There are going to be tough choices. If resources are limited, we have to make some tough calls about how to allocate those resources and to focus on some of the ethical and moral questions that are inherent in rising costs. The tough moral and ethical considerations that will be necessary to contain them are stark realities, but they have to be faced if this country's health care system is going to work for all.  My colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, and I have proposed in our legislation, the Health Care that Works for All Americans Act, a specific plan so that citizens can face those realities and fashion a better health care system.  Under our proposal, the American people will have a chance--a chance they have not had in 57 years since health care reform was tackled by Harry Truman in the 81st Congress--the American people will have a chance, before the special interest groups have at it, to talk about the kind of health care system they believe makes sense for them.  Our legislation has two major components: A public participation process at the outset over a relatively short period of time, and a guaranteed vote in both Houses of the Congress on the people's recommendations.  When it comes to health care costs, there is a lot for the public to examine. We are now spending 15 percent of our gross domestic product on health care. The last time it was looked at, the country spent more than $1.4 trillion on medical care, a 10-percent increase from the previous year.  If you divide $1.4 trillion by the number of people in this country, it comes to almost $5,000 for every man, woman, and child. Tens of millions of our citizens, in addition, slip through the cracks every day, even as our Nation pours more and more money into health care.  We are going to have to take a look at where the money is going. A study that has now been published on the Web site of the journal Health Affairs attributes spending increases primarily to higher hospital costs and prescription drugs. Hospitals are raising prices to make up for declining insurance, Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement, and the money they lose treating patients with no insurance at all. Moreover, a backlash against the tight hospitalization controls of managed care has clearly contributed to rising costs.  There are a host of relentless forces converging on American health care. Technological innovations seem to be coming at us from every area, and each miracle cure comes with a high cost. More and more health information is available through the Internet through sites such as WebMD and health.gov. It shows up on the ticker on all the 24-hour news channels, and each new discovery drives up the demand for care. If CNN runs a story on a medical breakthrough at 9:30 in the morning, it seems that an hour or so later we will be getting calls at our offices asking if Medicare or Medicaid or various insurance plans will pick up that coverage.  We have an extraordinary appetite for health care, for new treatments, but sometimes when we order these, we are not sure we are getting what is medically effective. We are not sure we are getting services that are worth the money. And most importantly, there is no way to measure it.  This is all compounded by the baby boomer explosion. Already, elderly people make up 15 percent of the population and spend 40 percent of our health care dollars. Folks are not just getting older, they are living longer. Those additional lives and the care that is necessary is going to require more funding. Life expectancy has risen more in the last 50 years than it did in the preceding 5,000. In the last months of their longer lives, Americans are spending more money than ever on health care. But money does not always give the best results for a suffering individual.  As a direct result of health spending increases in 2001, the Health Affair Study that I noted said health insurance costs have risen sharply, but at the same time coverage is getting harder and harder for many to get. The costs have gone up two ways. The first is with simple premium increases. Insurance companies are asking purchasers to pay more for the policies. The second way is through something called buydown. Employers who subsidize insurance reduce available benefits and ask employees to pay a higher share of the subsidized premium. Employees often get lower wages, even as they pay more for health insurance, with no guarantee their insurance will meet their needs. When you combine that significant hike in premiums--12 percent has been one assessment by the Kaiser Foundation--with a 3-percent increase in the number of cases of the buydown, the total cost of insurance has risen about 15 percent this year.  Nationally, businesses are still paying three-quarters or more of employees' premium costs, but it is harder and harder for companies and individuals to absorb those cost increases year after year. Fully 60 percent of those who have no insurance work for small businesses. For the self-employed or for those who have to buy their own insurance, premium increases at this point have priced many plans out of reach.  If someone is listening today and saying, ``The health care system works fine for me,'' let's also reflect on the fact that while it may work for you, it is not working for tens of millions of others. The fact is, every single day in America those who have no coverage, those who are going without, in effect, get subsidized by those who do have coverage.  If an individual listens today and says, ``I am in pretty good shape; things are going well for me,'' I only point out for the millions who do not have coverage right now, those people are subsidized by those who think everything is fine.  The fact is, it is just not right to leave millions of Americans in this country with a feeling of helplessness and a sense that when they go to bed at night they can see that train, that runaway train of health care costs I have mentioned bearing down on them.  The legislation Senator Hatch and I have proposed gives Americans the power to put the brakes on rising costs. It offers regular citizens the opportunity to make tough choices about spiraling medical bills. We will be addressing, if our bill can pass, the tough questions of health care directly related to our families: The question of what kind of care do people believe is most essential; how much are people willing to pay; how do you contain the costs without sacrificing quality of care; what about the government or private business being required to pay part of the cost.  My bottom line is pretty simple. It is time, finally, after 57 years of trying the same thing--writing bills in Washington, DC, only to have them attacked by special interests--it is time to try something different, and that is to give the people of this country a chance to make the judgment on calls with respect to what kind of health services they want, how much those services are going to cost, and who is going to pay. The alternative is to continue to spend more and more on a system that, while scientifically prodigious, is flawed in many of the administrative ways in which it is carried out.  At a time when America is becoming a nation of health care haves and have-nots, this country can do better. We have many of our providers and businesses already making tough choices as they try to deal with growing costs. I know scores of small businesses in Oregon and across this country who are dying to offer their people good coverage, and they have had difficulty offering it without effective policies to contain those rising costs.  Senator Hatch and I believe with a different approach it will be possible to reign in the costs, but it all has to begin--and begin in a fashion that has not been tried for 57 years--with the American people being given the opportunity to make some of the tough calls. The fact is, the options in the cost containment area do involve hard calls. The Kaiser Commission, for example, on the uninsured, on Medicaid, recently laid out a number of cost containment measures currently employed by our public health programs. They range from some that I think are progressive to some that I think would make the problems that we have today in health care even more serious.  According to Kaiser, the main way public health programs are cutting costs is by cutting payments to providers. Private insurers then follow suit, paying less to providers for each patient seen and for each procedure performed or for each bed the hospital provides. Then, in effect, the Robin Hood approach kicks in in a dramatic way with those who do get payments, in effect, giving services to those who lack it. But when the cutbacks get severe, when the reimbursements continue to go down as we have seen in so many facilities, those providers, those health care facilities that have a great sense of community and caring, just cannot offer the services anymore. Instead of or even in addition to cutting provider payments, some insurers and public health programs are cutting back on what services they will cover, reducing the availability of some services. Unfortunately, services are often cut with no regard to their overall effectiveness--only for their cost.  Many types of health care programs are asking patients to pay more at the time of service--higher copayments. Higher copayments are also becoming a regular feature at the pharmacy, as prescription drugs are one of the biggest reasons behind rising costs. Options include those higher copays, requiring more prior authorization for prescriptions, requiring or covering only generics, or even limiting the number of covered prescriptions per month.  I want to pause to note a couple of issues here--first, that prescription drugs are on the table in the Wyden-Hatch legislation, just as long-term care and Medicare and Medicaid and private insurance are. Senator Hatch and I are placing no limits on what the American people can discuss and decide to change. And second, efforts to cut rising drug costs are perfect example of the range of choices that folks will face in this national discussion. Some of the choices for cutting costs seem good and fair. Some seem punitive and unfair. Senator Hatch and I just believe that Americans have enough sense to tell the difference.  People participating in the health care discussion prescribed in our bill will take a look at some of the toughest cost-cutters being employed today. In the case of private insurance, companies refuse to cover pre-existing conditions. They deny policies to people whose care is likely to be expensive. In the case of public insurance, States make last-ditch efforts to cut costs by limiting the number of people to whom coverage is available.  All across America today, mothers will tell their children that you don't always get everything you want in this life. That's the stark reality people are going to have to face when it comes to reforming the health care system. The key will be to find solutions that do the best job of splitting the difference, cutting costs and providing essential, effective health care services.  Cost containment is not enough. Our health care dollars must buy quality care, that not only treats disease but also prevents it whenever possible. That's the best cost containment. Failing that, care that manages diseases to slow or prevent their progression may be the next best thing. Disease management is a growing component of health care today. Instead of allowingmonths to go by between doctor visits, patients with chronic illnesses meet or speak regularly with nurses or other health care providers to monitor their specific condition. Doctors have concerns about their patients being treated or advised by others, and all the kinks aren't worked out of this system yet. But the result, in many cases, is a reduction in the number of expensive complications and hospital stays.  I want to see Americans educated about disease management, preventive care, and every other option available for reforming health care. That's why the Wyden-Hatch Act calls for the publication of a Citizens' Guide to the Health Care System. A panel that's a cross-section of Americans using and running the health care system today will produce it. It will be designed so folks can be fully informed when the public participation portion of the process begins.  To me, some of these cost containment methods seem fairer than others; some seem more sensible than others. The American people should have the change to decide--because what's being done now isn't working. Benefits are usually considered in terms of cost-benefit, which basically measures how much money you save for every dollar you spend. Another way of looking at procedures and practices is their cost-effectiveness, which is how much good you do with every dollar.  Let me explain why I believe it is folly to continue to address questions of health care and health coverage as purely economic considerations. The problem is, and families know this, it doesn't all boil down to money. You're not just dealing with a bottom line. You're talking about maintaining people's health and about the basic care they have a right to expect. Sometimes you're literally talking about life and death. It's time America started recognizing its ethical and moral responsibilities with respect to health care, and acting on them.  This is not the seismic shift it sounds to be. Just as individual insurers and state health administrators are making choices about how to contain costs, American citizens are making moral choices around their kitchen tables every day. People already have to answer questions like, it okay to put off the colorectal screening my insurance won't cover because I really need to pay for my mother's prescription medicines? If we pay for Jennifer's broken arm, does Bobby have to wait a year to get braces?  Doctors and hospitals are already making ethical choices about what care to get and give, or how much cost the hospital is willing to absorb before cutting services. The question that must be answered is still the same: do Americans want these choices made as they are now, in a back-door way? Or do they want a chance to discuss these issues at the front door, decide on them as a community, and then ask Congress to deliver a health care system based on the country's values?  A better way to make decisions is to look at what we are and are not able to do on a societal level, instead of deciding what we are and are not able to do for a give patient at a given time. If that sounds tough, it is. But Mr. President, I'm here to urge that America tackle these issues head on and turn them to the advantage of as many people as possible. That's far better plan then letting back-door decisions suck away more funds and resources and deny people decent care.  It's time to look at questions on a broader scale. Is $315,000 of public money better spent on one liver transplant and follow-up care for a 70-year old man with cirrhosis, or on 3,00 preventive well-baby visits costing about $100 each? Does a woman with known risk factors for breast cancer have a right to a mammogram every year even if I have to help pay for it?  Because these choices are so tough, a variety of think tanks and great minds have tackled these issues, including Arthur Kaplan at the University of Pennsylvania, Daniel Callahan at the Hastings Center and others. I admire their thoughtful work. Their conclusions and study have provided valuable direction on these issues.  I believe that at the end of the day, only the citizens of this country can make the fundamental choices that affect their health and their well-being--and health and well-being of the society in which they live.  Researchers shows that Americans believe that there are certain basic rights when it comes to health care and no one should be forced to go without. If it's been confirmed that the American people feel that way, the key is to find out what the basics are and go from there. This country won't get anywhere on health care reform until we do.  Let me explain a little further. Most Americans operate on the idea that they should have the latest tests and treatments on demand. That's possible--if America spends more of its dollars on health care and other budget items like educations take the hit. But spending more doesn't necessarily buy better health care. More and more people are being let without even the essential health care services, let alone the latest drugs and procedures.  Let me be clear. I'm not talking about keeping people from spending their own money on whatever kind of health care they want. If someone wants to rebuild himself limb by limb and has the money to pay for it, I say go for it. But when it comes to the health care system as a whole, we can't just spend money for the sake of spending money. Health care dollars must be used in better ways, or the people of this country must decide that it's okay to keep spending and keep leaving people out.  I don't believe that's the way America wants it to work. As Marcia Angell wrote in the New York Times, there are some essential services in which we all agree the public has stake, and health care should be one of them. For example, no one I know thinks of our country as a place where it's okay for babies to go untreated because Mom and Dad are in financial straits.  Postponing care sometimes places more strain on the health care system. If a baby doesn't get treated at the beginning of an ear infection, he may have to be treated as it goes further along, probably in the emergency room at a much higher cost than if he'd had a pediatrician to see in the first place. If he's not treated, and ends up with hearing damage, the costs will skyrocket not only in the health care system, but also in the educational system to meet his special needs.  More than a decade ago, the people in my home State of Oregon realized the interconnectedness of everyone in the health care system. Folks realized that no amount of money would ever be enough to pay for all the health care Oregonians wanted, and that too many people were doing without health care at all. So the people of my state took on the tough task of sitting down and deciding what the basics were, what health care no one should have to do without.  That may sound like an easy task; if you could just sit and make a list of all the things you'd like health care coverage to pay for, you would be able to do that without much trouble. But there's a flip side. The question Oregonians faced over and over again was, okay: if we want this fundamental service covered, what do we have to give up? What can't we afford to cover for anyone, if we want everyone to have at least some help? Those questions sometimes translated into heartbreaking real-life situations, where people using public health care couldn't get the latest and greatest innovations on demand. But lives were saved because people using public health care were able to get the basic when they needed them. That tradeoff, for the most part, made the tough choices worthwhile.  Now, Senator Hatch and I are not asking America to come up with a list of 880 health procedures in order of importance. But we are looking for a general idea of people's priorities--so that Congress can act on them when it's time for health care reform.  I believe there are some priorities our people already agree on. I think they agree that 18,000 Americans shouldn't have to die every year just because they can't get health insurance and health care. I believe 280 million people will agree they'd rather cover the cost of preventive services than get stuck with the much higher costs of preventable diseases that go unchecked. I think with some serious discussion, they can agree on some basic concepts of how and where our limited health care dollars should be spent to help the most people. I believe 280 million people can agree on a lot more than you think.  Some might say Americans aren't going to want to talk about this, that the idea of not paying for someone's liver transplant to take care of babies isn't fit talk for the public. But I believe Americans have a right to this discussion. These choices are going to get made, one way or the other, and I want them made in the open with the input of the people I'm here to represent. The stakes are just too high not to include the American people. And I believe they're up to the task.  To help Americans understand what's at stake, and make informed decisions, the dissemination of information will be key. I believe the Citizens' Health Guide will be a real eye-opener for most people--for instance, when they find out this: Medicare Part A will pay for prescription drugs when a patient is in the hospital. Part B will pay nothing for those same drugs on an outpatient basis. Some doctors are sticking patients in the hospital to the tune of thousands of dollars just to get their medicine to them. That money can't be spent, then, on preventive services or any other more beneficial health care concerns. Don't you think when people see the connection, they will insist on making a change?  Health care works like an ecosystem in this country. The consequence of every decision, and every reform effort, snakes through the system as a whole. Addressing health care properly, that, means addressing it as a system entire. Ad hoc is not going to work.  Just as a good doctor wouldn't prescribe a medicine that would treat one symptom but leave the disease to run rampant, it's time to stop with the piecemeal reforms that put a Band-Aid on the sucking chest wound of the health care system. To be most effective, you can't just make decisions on broken bones one day, organ transplants the next and something else the next day like they don't have any effect on each other. This country needs a way to consider the moral and ethical choices already being made that affect not just one person or one family, but the entire health care system. As hard as it's going to be, it must be done. The Wyden-Hatch bill provides a path to do that.  Yes, there are economic choices to be made about health care in this country. The runaway train of rising costs must be stopped somehow. And there are moral questions underlying every economic decision. The Wyden-Hatch proposal is built around the idea that these questions are simply too important to duck any longer. People deserve the chance to discuss their own moral and ethical priorities when it comes to health care, and to decide what's best for them and for our society as a whole. Only then can Congress deliver health care reform that truly works for all.  That's why our bill, the Health Care that Works for All Americans Act, centers on that public participation portion, and then guarantees the people a vote in both houses of Congress.  Perhaps the people of this country will choose one or more cost-containment measures being used today. Perhaps in examining their own ethics, they'll come up with new ideas. What Senator Hatch and I want to guarantee is that their voices will be heard--and that this Congress will act, with a mandatory vote in both houses--to make the people's vision for health care come to pass. I believe that if Congress chooses to put the people in charge, Americans will choose to fight rising costs, make tough moral choices, and direct this country toward better health care for everyone.  That is the point at which we have reached. That is why it is not right to leave so many underserved in so many communities without adequate health care.  I urge, finally, that as we leave and reflect on what is needed to reform the health care system in the next session, that the three principles in the Wyden-Hatch legislation of involving the money, forcing a vote in the Congress on the reforms that come from the people, and making it bipartisan guide our work in the next session.  I yield the floor.                           Order of Procedure
