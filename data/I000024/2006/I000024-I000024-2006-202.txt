President, let me comment.  I was asked the question by the Senator from Pennsylvania as to clarification on this Army Corps of Engineers report. It was the Energy and Water appropriations that made a request of the Corps of Engineers on June 3, 2005. The Corps report states:       From the above discussion, the most reasonable option would      be to retire the McFarland.  It goes on to state:       It is expected that sufficient industry hopper dredging      capability exists to perform the requirements that may occur      on the Delaware River.  Finally, it states:       McFarland would have to be rehabilitated and repowered at      the cost of approximately $20 million.  It says that on page 22 of the report.  I will go ahead.  I ask the Senator from Delaware to take his time and I will elaborate a little bit more on this on my time.
