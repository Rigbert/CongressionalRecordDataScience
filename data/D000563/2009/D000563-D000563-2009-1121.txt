President, 1.7 million is the number of families that we will either help stay in their homes or allow to lose their homes and be thrown on to the street.  Tomorrow the Senate will have the opportunity to vote for an amendment to the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act that would enable 1.7 million families to avoid foreclosure.  My amendment would make a small change to the bankruptcy code to give these families a little bit of leverage as they work with their lenders to create a modified mortgage that they can afford.  When we can avoid foreclosures and families can stay in their homes, everyone wins--the families, their neighbors, their lenders, and the government. We can save 1.7 million homes with one vote.  I have come to the floor each day this week to talk about the scale of the problem and what we believe we should do about it, in very general terms.  Now I would like to get specific.  Let me be clear: this is a very different amendment to the bankruptcy code than my colleagues have seen before.  This amendment would integrate assistance in bankruptcy to the two primary foreclosure prevention efforts already underway: the Obama administration's Homeowner Assistance and Stability Plan and the congressionally created Hope for Homeowners refinancing program which the other title of this bill will greatly improve.  Our objective is to keep as many families in their homes as we can. Ideally none of these families would have to go through the painful process of a chapter 13 bankruptcy.  So this amendment would help only troubled homeowners who could not find other assistance outside of bankruptcy first.  Let me put it another way: mortgage servicers would be given full veto power over which of their borrowers could go to bankruptcy--they would be given the keys to the courthouse door.  All a servicer would have to do to block a borrower from going to bankruptcy for a mortgage modification would be to offer the borrower a modification that conforms to the standards of the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan or Hope for Homeowners--regardless of whether the borrower accepts the offer or not.  For banks and credit unions that aggressively offer modifications to borrowers who are in trouble, the total number of their borrowers who will be eligible for bankruptcy assistance will be exactly zero.  Specifically if a servicer offers a loan modification that reduces the borrower's mortgage debt-to-income ratio to 31 percent--the same as the Housing Affordability and Stability Plan--or if a servicer offers Hope for Homeowners refinancing, then that borrower could not run to a judge looking for a better deal through a cramdown. For those borrowers that the servicer chooses not to modify voluntarily and that must file for bankruptcy, half of any cramdown would be returned to the servicer if the borrower resells the home while still in bankruptcy.  For these borrowers that the servicer chooses not to help, the courts would be constrained as follows: The judge could only reduce the loan principal to fair market value, which is much more than the lender would collect if the home were to be sold in foreclosure. The judge could only reduce the interest rate to the conventional rate plus a reasonable premium for risk, which at the moment would equal around 6.5 percent to 7 percent.  And the judge could only lengthen the term to the longer of 40 years, reduced by the period for which the mortgage has been outstanding or the remaining term of the mortgage.  There are many further restrictions. Loans originated after 2008 are not eligible for bankruptcy assistance.  Loans that are larger than the largest conforming loan limit are not eligible for bankruptcy assistance. Loans that are not 60 days delinquent are not eligible for bankruptcy assistance. Loans that are not in foreclosure are not eligible for bankruptcy. And the whole amendment would sunset at the end of 2012 when the Housing Affordability and Stability Plan expires.  The banks hold the keys to the courthouse. And, even those borrowers the banks refuse to help can only receive assistance that still makes the banks far more money than the only other alternative: foreclosure.  Yet even with all of these restrictions, Mark Zandi from Moody's Economy.com estimates that this changewould save 1.7 million families from foreclosure. Why? Because for most lenders, the Obama administration's foreclosure prevention plan is voluntary. This change to the bankruptcy code would encourage lenders to participate, because offering these modifications allows lenders to effectively veto a modification in bankruptcy. That is a large part of why the President supports this provision, and why he included it as a key element in his plan.  This amendment would prevent foreclosures, which would help us find the bottom in the housing market, which would help the housing markets turn around more quickly, which would help the entire economy start moving again. Perhaps best of all, this amendment wouldn't cost the taxpayers a penny.  Even though this new proposal is airtight in protecting lenders interests, the ideologues in the mortgage industry--outfits like the Mortgage Bankers Association, the Financial Services Roundtable, the American Bankers Association, the Independent Community Bankers Association, and the National Association of Federal Credit Unions--still oppose providing this help to troubled homeowners and the economy at large.  They continue to regurgitate the same tired talking points that have been refuted over and again by the facts.  They seem to repeat the same six myths. Myth No. 1: Allowing troubled homeowners to receive mortgage assistance in bankruptcy will lead to higher borrowing costs for future borrowers. Reality: Although the Mortgage Bankers Association has claimed in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee that ``if this legislation goes through, we will be putting a permanent tax on everybody that buys a house going forward of $295 per month,'' there are several reasons why this argument makes no sense.  First, future borrowers aren't eligible for this bankruptcy assistance, so there is no reason why future borrowers should have to pay more to compensate lenders for a risk that doesn't exist.  Second, only borrowers for which foreclosure is the only other alternative are eligible for this bankruptcy assistance. Foreclosures almost always cost banks more than loan modifications that keep families paying each month. No extra costs are being borne by the banks that they could justify passing on to other borrowers.  Third, a study by Adam Levitin of the Georgetown Law School proves definitively that the availability of bankruptcy assistance to some borrowers in the past led to no increase in borrowing costs for others.  There is no reason to think that the same logic wouldn't apply in today's market that supports record low interest rates.  Myth No. 2: Changing the bankruptcy code will cause uncertainty in the market. Reality: Although the American Bankers Association asserts that ``mortgage cramdowns would add significant risk and uncertainty to mortgage lending,'' it is in fact the rapidly rising foreclosure rate that is adding risk and uncertainty to mortgage lending.  If potential homeowners think housing prices will continue to fall they will be unlikely to buy a home.  Aggressively preventing foreclosures will keep unnecessary supply off of the market, which will stabilize prices and encourage buyers to return to the market.  Since changing the bankruptcy code would save 1.7 million homes from foreclosure, the Durbin amendment would return a sense certainty to mortgage lending, not undermine it.  Some of the loudest opponents of my amendment were the chief contributors to the most uncertainty in the credit markets since the Great Depression. They have no credibility to tell us what the markets may or may not judge to create uncertainty.  Myth No. 3: Bankruptcy judges shouldn't be able to break the sanctity of the contract. Reality: The Chamber of Commerce argues that ``Cram down provisions would improperly expand the bankruptcy code by granting new powers to bankruptcy judges to modify the terms of existing, legitimate mortgage contracts.''  Legitimate mortgage contracts? What is so legitimate about no-doc, interest only, negative amortizing loans that had almost no chance to succeed from the day they are underwritten?  The concept of bankruptcy is enshrined in the Constitution, and bankruptcy has always been a venue in which contracts are restructured.  The Chamber and the banking industry had no problem with applying the sweeping 2005 bankruptcy code changes to all contracts past, present, and future when those changes benefitted businesses. They have no standing to now argue that because of the sanctity of the contract the bankruptcy laws should not be changed.  Myth No. 4: Allowing borrowers to modify mortgages in bankruptcy would shield borrowers from the consequences of their poor decisions to buy houses they could not afford, thereby creating a moral hazard. Reality: The industry that claims we should worry about moral hazard for borrowers is the same industry that helped create the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression.  Bankruptcy is a painful process for the borrower, not one that is taken lightly. The intent of the legislation is to create the necessary incentives for more modifications to take place outside of bankruptcy.  And what about the families who have done everything right but have the misfortune of living next door to a foreclosure? If we save families from foreclosure we help their neighbors too. There's no moral hazard in that.  My amendment would save the neighbors of prevented foreclosures over $300 billion in preserved home equity. I will talk much more about that when I return to the floor tomorrow.  Finally, for many borrowers the problem isn't the home itself, but rather the high cost loan they are trapped in. Making the mortgage more affordable will make the home affordable for many families.  Myth No. 5: Restricting this amendment to only subprime and exotic loans is better policy than providing this option to borrowers with all types of loans. Reality: Although the National Association of Federal Credit Unions--which is the smaller of the two credit union associations--continues to argue that we should allow ``bankruptcy modification [to] apply to only to subprime or Alt-A (or nontraditional) mortgage loans,'' I disagree.  Last year I thought that this might be a reasonable compromise. But the foreclosure crisis has expanded far beyond subprime loans. The fastest-growing foreclosure rate by loan type is the traditional prime loan--once considered safe.  We are no longer just trying to solve for bad mortgage underwriting. We're trying to turn around the entire economy, and to do that we have to stabilize the housing markets.  Finally, how would we explain to our constituents that we're providing special assistance to borrowers who took out a riskier type of loan, but the families with a standard, conservative loan who may need a bit of help are out of luck?  Myth No. 6: Because community banks didn't create this crisis, it would be better policy to carve out their borrowers from having the option of bankruptcy assistance. Reality: Look at this picture again. If a community bank really cares about the community it serves, why should this foreclosure be allowed to take place just because the borrower took out a loan with a community bank rather than a big national bank?  Does that matter to the family who lost their home? Does that matter to the family living next door?  These banking associations have generated many myths of terror and destruction that this amendment would create, but the legislative language speaks for itself. And it refutes each of these myths.  Mr. President, 1.7 million families can be saved from foreclosure.  This is the Senate's chance to finally address the heart of our economic crisis, with no bailout money involved.  We may not have a better chance to help turn this crisis around.  Today the Senate will vote on my amendment to the housing bill that would give 1.7 million families a chance to save their homes.  I spoke earlier this week on the floor about the crushing impact to the broader economy that the foreclosure crisis has had.  Mortgages were bundled into mortgage-backed securities, which were sliced and diced into ``synthetic collateralized debt obligations'' and similar products, which were then sold to unsuspecting investors all over the world.  For a while there, they sold as if they were gold. Well, they are pretty tarnished now. They are now known as ``toxic assets.''  But I urge my colleagues not to forget that underlying these exotic ``toxic assets'' are things that we understand far more personally.  At the root of the crisis is the home. Mr. President, 8.1 million of them may be lost, according to Credit Suisse. My amendment will help save 1.7 million of them.  Also at the root of this crisis is the damage to the homeowners who live around these foreclosures, the neighbors who have made every mortgage payment on time. They stand to lose over $300 billion more, unless we pass my amendment.  I want to emphasize this point for a moment. There are millions of families all over America that have done everything right--they bought only as much house as they could afford, and they have made every mortgage payment on time.  Look at this picture. This house is well-kept, and appears to be the cherished home of a family that has acted responsibly. But this house next door, you can see what this house looks like.  Clearly, the well-kept home is worth much less than it would be if it were next to another well-kept home instead of this boarded-up eyesore.  Situations like this can be seen in each and every state that my colleagues and I represent. Families are in trouble, and their neighbors are suffering along with them.  By voting for my amendment we can save 1.7 million of these troubled families from foreclosure and can save their neighbors over $300 billion in home equity that would otherwise be lost.  In Florida, for example, we estimate that over 200,000 more families will lose their homes in the next few years if we don't pass my amendment.  Families like Derek and Kellyanne Baehr. As reported in local papers, Derek has been diagnosed with a rare neurological disorder that will eventually require him to use a wheelchair.  The couple has lived in their modest, single-story stucco home for four years, and they are now struggling to pay their mortgage.  After months of trying to work with their lender, they finally received a slight reduction in their interest rate, but ``it was like putting a Band-Aid on cancer,'' Derek said.  ``We can't continue to go on this way,'' said Kellyanne. ``I cry about every day.''  If my amendment were to become law, this family's lender probably would have offered more than a ``Band-Aid on cancer.'' The lender likely would have offered a modification that would have kept the Baehrs in their home and paying their mortgage.  And, certainly, avoiding foreclosure would be a better result for both the Baehr's and the lender.  The neighbors who live around families who are kicked out on to the street--like the Baehrs may soon be--typically see the value of their homes--their most valuable asset--take a nosedive.  In Florida, neighbors of families that lose their homes will watch more than $36 billion of their assets evaporate unless we pass my amendment.  In Ohio, we estimate that nearly 44,000 more families will lose their homes in the next few years if we don't pass my amendment.  Some time ago I met the Glickens, a husband and wife from Ohio who were persuaded by a mortgage broker to commit to a mortgage that seemed fine at the start.  Then, the adjustable interest rates kicked in. They soon were being asked to pay 60 percent more than the original payments, and they just couldn't keep up.  Families like the Glickens are supposed to reach out to their lender to figure out how to modify the mortgage so that it is more affordable and so that foreclosure can be avoided.  Avoiding foreclosure is better for the homeowner and the bank, right?  Get this: the Glickens' lender charged them $425 to apply for a loan modification . . . and then turned them down anyway.  The Glickens needed a bit more leverage to negotiate with their lender, leverage that the threat of bankruptcy assistance would provide.  In Ohio, neighbors of families that lose their homes will lose more than $1.5 billion of their assets unless the Senate passes my amendment.  In Pennsylvania, over 37,000 additional families will lose their homes in the next few years if we don't pass the Durbin amendment.  As one example of many, a divorced father of twin boys in Levittown refinanced his mortgage after his divorce in an attempt to keep a stable home environment for his boys.  The refinance placed him in an interest-only mortgage with American Home Mortgage, which itself went into bankruptcy.  He ended up in chapter 13 trying to make the payments on all of his debts.  But, the bankruptcy court could not help him restructure his mortgage under current law, even though the court has restructured each of his other debts to help him make his payments.  Prior to filing for bankruptcy, he tried to reach an agreement with his lender, but he couldn't find anyone to talk to consistently about the situation and he was given no viable options to catch up on his payments.  This single dad would have benefited from my amendment. So would his neighbors.  In Pennsylvania, neighbors of families that lose their homes will watch more than $3.3 billion of their assets evaporate unless we pass my amendment.  In Maine, nearly 5,000 additional families will lose their homes in the next few years if we don't pass this bankruptcy provision. If you are watching at home in California or New York that may not sound like a lot of families, but people who live in Maine know just how devastating those losses would be.  For instance, a woman from Woolwich was barely making ends meet when she received a notice that the interest rate on her mortgage was going to increase by 3 percentage points.  She immediately contacted the mortgage company and indicated that she could not handle the additional expense.  The lender told her that they were not going to be able to work with her and there was nothing that they could do for her.  I am confident this woman's lender would have tried a little harder to help if the threat of assistance in bankruptcy loomed.  In Maine, neighbors of families that lose their homes will lose more than $100 million of their assets unless we pass my amendment.  In Missouri, we estimate that 22,000 additional families will lose their homes in the next few years if we don't pass this amendment.  We are talking about people like a Ford retiree in Kansas City who had fallen behind on his mortgage payments due to a high interest rate on the loan. He passed away, and his widow was unable to keep up with the payments.  The home was worth far less than the outstanding mortgage balance, and she started to receive foreclosure notices. Her loan servicer was not receptive to a discussion regarding a loan modification.  Her monthly income left her with about $700 after she made this mortgage payment. And her monthly heating bills that winter were $600.  Again, I have to believe the availability of bankruptcy assistance would have encouraged her lender to work with her.  In Missouri, neighbors of families that lose their homes will watch almost $1 billion of their assets disappear unless we pass my amendment.  In my home State of Illinois, last year in Chicago alone nearly 20,000 homes were in some stage of foreclosure.  The red dots represent these 20,000 homes. They are everywhere. And the problem is getting worse.  Statewide, my amendment would help 60,000 families avoid foreclosure. Their neighbors would preserve nearly $20 billion if my amendment becomes law.  How could I not fight for this?  Maybe I shouldn't take this amendment so personally. Perhaps I shouldjust argue dispassionately about the merits of the proposal, since the merits really do speak for themselves.  But when a family loses its home, that is personal.  The home is where parents tuck their kids in at night. It's where families share their daily stories over meals at the dining room table. It's where secrets are shared, where dreams are born, and where bonds are formed.  Every foreclosure is a tragedy. Every foreclosure is deeply personal for the parents who have to explain to their kids why they can't sleep in their bedrooms anymore. Every foreclosure that can be prevented, should be prevented.  The Senate can stop 1.7 million of them with one vote. The Senate can save their neighbors--our constituents--over $300 billion in the preservation of home equity with one vote. I urge a ``yes'' vote.  I ask unanimous consent that the letter of support attached to this statement be submitted for the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Help 1.7 Million Families Stay in Their Homes! Support the Foreclosure                      Amendment to the Housing Bill                                                   April 29, 2009.       Dear Senator: The undersigned consumer, civil rights,      labor, faith-based, housing, financial, and community      organizations representing tens of millions of Americans      strongly urge you to vote for the foreclosure prevention      amendment that will be offered by Senator Durbin when the      full Senate takes up the House-passed housing bill (``Helping      Families Save Their Homes Act'') later this week. Our      organizations long have supported legislation to empower      bankruptcy judges to modify mortgages on primary residences      so as to provide the ``stick'' financially strapped      homeowners desperately need to get their lenders to work with      them to prevent avoidable foreclosures. Absent this stick,      all the voluntary programs that have been put in place during      the last 18 months have failed to produce the modifications      necessary to save American families and repair the faltering      housing market.       The amendment that will be offered on the Senate floor      substantially narrows previous versions by enabling the      servicer to prevent the borrower from obtaining a mortgage      modification in bankruptcy simply by offering the borrower an      affordable modification. Any such offer would bar judicial      modification of the borrower's mortgage forever. And, with      this ``stick'' in place, the new voluntary modification      programs have a substantially greater chance of succeeding,      which would help stop foreclosures and stabilize the economy.       Mark Zandi of Moody's Economy.com projects that up to 1.7      million families will be able to save their home from      foreclosure if this amendment is approved. At a time when an      estimated 6,600 families are losing their home to foreclosure      each and every day, there is no time for delay. We urge the      Senate to support the amendment to lift the ban on judicial      modification of primary residence mortgages in extremely      narrowly drawn circumstances. Passage of this legislation is      the most important thing Congress can do right now to help      arrest the financial crisis and the terrible toll that it is      taking on American families.
