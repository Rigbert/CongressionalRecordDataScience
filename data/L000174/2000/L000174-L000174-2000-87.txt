President, I agree with the distinguished Senator from California on Bonnie Campbell. As the one who has brought life into the Violence Against Women Act, it is remarkable that she cannot even get a vote in this Chamber on her judicial nomination.  I have said on the floor, although we are different parties, I have agreed with Gov. George Bush, who has said that in the Senate a nominee ought to get a vote, up or down, within 60 days. I urge in the time remaining in this session that he, as the head of his party, as their Presidential nominee, call the Republican leader of the Senate and say that all of these women, all of these minorities, in fact, all of the people who have been sitting here for well over 60 days waiting for a vote on their nomination, let them have a vote. Vote for them or vote against them. Bonnie Campbell deserves a vote. My guess is the reason she has not been brought for a vote is they know at least 80 of the 100 Senators would vote for her. It would be impossible to justify a vote against her because of her extraordinary qualifications.  Again, if Governor Bush is serious when he says have a vote within 60 days, pick up the phone, call the Senate majority leader, reach him at the switchboard, 202-224-3121, and ask him to bring her to a vote. It is a very easy thing to do.  I agree with the Senator on the Internet alcohol bill. That was included over my objection. It is unnecessary. It is dangerous to e-commerce. Adding Internet sales on alcohol demeans the issue of violence against women and sex trafficking that this bill is all about. It is demeaning to what is a good bill.
