President, this has been an effort that has been bipartisan all the way around. It has been 3 years in the making. For all of us to get along this well for 3 years--I hope it does not end after this is over.  I compliment you and Senator Baucus, along with Senator Bond, and the Democrats and Republicans on the Environment and Public Works Committee who are so cooperative.
