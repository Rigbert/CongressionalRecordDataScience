 President, reclaiming the floor, it is disappointing to us that the Republican majority has objected to bringing these bills forward and blocking our efforts to provide some much needed economic stability and security for our workers in this country. Our workers have been waiting a long time for relief from the trickle-down system that has hurt our middle class.  This Senator wants to put the Senate on notice that the Democrats are going to keep working on ways to grow our economy from the middle out, not the top down, and we are going to be working to make sure our workers and our families have a voice at the table. We are going to continue to focus on making sure our country works for all Americans, not just the wealthy and few.  Thank you, Mr. President.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from Texas.
