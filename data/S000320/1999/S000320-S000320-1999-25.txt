R. 1000 and S. 82 without regard to changing budgetary treatment of the aviation accounts. I would be very disappointed if the prospect of a multiyear reauthorization were frustrated by the House's intransigence on changing the budgetary treatment of the aviation accounts to the detriment of all other discretionary spending, including Amtrak, drug interdiction efforts of the Coast Guard, as well as many of the domestic programs funded in appropriations bills other than the one I manage as the Chairman of the Transportation appropriations subcommittee.  According to the Administration, the budget treatment envisioned in H.R. 1000 would create an additional $1.1 billion in outlays, which if it were absorbed out of the DOT budget would mean: ``elimination of Amtrak capital funding, thereby making it impossible for Amtrak to make the capital investments needed to reach self-sufficiency; and severe reductions to Coast Guard, the Federal Railroad Administration, Saint Lawrence Seaway, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of the Secretary, and the Research and Special Programs Administration funding, greatly impacting their operations.'' Clearly, firewalls or off-budget treatment for the aviation accounts is a budget buster that would only further exacerbate the current budget problems we face staying under the spending caps.
