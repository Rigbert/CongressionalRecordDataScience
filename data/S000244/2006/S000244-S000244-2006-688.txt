Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 367, honoring and praising the National Society of the Sons of the American Revolution on the 100th anniversary of being granted its Congressional Charter.  As the Declaration of Independence states, governments are instituted among men to secure the inalienable rights that the Creator has endowed upon us. Because the bonds of tyranny over the United Colonies were destructive of this end, the United Colonies sought separation from Great Britain and fought to attain their freedom and independence.  The National Society of the Sons of the American Revolution, or the SAR, was formed by descendants of patriots of the American Revolution who sought a fraternal and civic society to salute those who pledged their lives, fortunes, and sacred honor in America's battle for independence from the British Crown.  Today, we honor the SAR, which was founded on April 30, 1899, and chartered by Congress 100 years ago on June 9, 1906. The SAR is composed of lineal descendants of the men who wintered at Valley Forge, signed the Declaration of Independence, fought in the battles of the American Revolution, served in the Continental Congress, or otherwise supported the cause of American independence.  The SAR is a historic, patriotic, and educational organization. In keeping with its historical mission, the SAR commemorates and provides memorials for the people and events of the American Revolution, helps preserve records relating to the events leading up to and during the revolution, and supports research and presentations related to the history and people of the revolutionary era.  In fulfilling its patriotic mission, the SAR reaffirms the principles upon which our Nation was founded, maintains and extends the institutions of American freedom, provides recognition for public service, and honors, respects, and supports veterans.                              {time}  1230  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution to honor the SAR for its important work to preserve the legacy of these fallen heroes.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
