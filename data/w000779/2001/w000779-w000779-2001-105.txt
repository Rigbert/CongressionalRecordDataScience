President, if my colleague will yield, because we have gone through various versions, he has indicated that he is strongly in support of this effort and is still looking at some of the specifics.  The Senator is absolutely right. I think the Senator from West Virginia has made a real contribution because he has seen from a historical standpoint how there has been such an explosion of these negative commercials.  I want our colleagues to know that we are very appreciative of the input of the Senator from West Virginia in fighting these negative ads.
