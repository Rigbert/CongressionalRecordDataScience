President, today I am introducing bipartisan legislation to address the needs of the Federal Judiciary, our coequal branch of Government. This bill would respond to a discrete situation in five States regarding the need for temporary judgeships. In order to adequately address fluctuations in a court's caseload, Congress can authorize a judgeship on a temporary basis. These temporary fixes do not undermine the independence that comes with lifetime appointment to the judiciary because the judges assigned to fill these vacancies, are, in fact, appointed for life, as are all Federal judges. They are temporary in the sense that when these judgeships expire, the next vacancy in the jurisdiction is not filled and the extra judgeship expires.  Last Congress two of these needed temporary judgeships were allowed to expire. One was in Nebraska and the other in California. That was unfortunate in my view since they continue to have high caseloads. This legislation would restore those judgeships by reauthorizing those temporary judgeships to restore the status quo in those two busy districts.  In addition, three districts have temporary judgeships that are close to expiration. Caseloads in Ohio, Hawaii, and Kansas remain at a high level. Isupport acting to ensure their continuation until we have had the opportunity to conduct a comprehensive review of the judgeship needs throughout the Federal system. I hope to undertake that review next year.  This legislation would extend each of the five temporary judgeships for 10 years. This will allow Congress some flexibility with regard to future judgeship needs.  This measure is supported by the Judicial Conference of the United States and every Senator representing the five States. I thank Senators Feinstein and Brownback, who also serve on the Judiciary Committee, for their work on this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1327       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
