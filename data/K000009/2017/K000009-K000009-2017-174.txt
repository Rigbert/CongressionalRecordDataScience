But, you know, in this job, you meet everybody. I come from a working class family. We had to work for everything we ever had.  I thank the people of my district for allowing me to serve and kind of learn a whole lot more about our country and the world. And one of the things I have learned is that when you are that wealthy, these billionaires, they purchase their own doctors, they purchase their own nurses. They have special houses where they put them in on their property.  So, you know, it isn't just the tax cut that goes to the wealthiest among us, but the imbalance between those who have much and those who eke out a living is growing greater and greater and greater in our society.  Now, I think everybody should have good health care. But, honestly, when you can do that, you are not living in the real world that the vast majority of Americans live in. I thank the gentleman for allowing me to put that on the Record.
