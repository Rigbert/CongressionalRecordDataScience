Speaker, I rise today as the Syrian displacement crisis has consumed seven nations in the Middle East, among them Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, obviously, and Syria itself, and has spawned the largest refugee crisis Europe has faced since World War II.  The scope of the damage is incredible. This protracted conflict has decimated Syria's infrastructure and has already taken the lives of over 250,000 civilians, has displaced over 4 million people, and has subjected tens upon thousands of children in that nation to Assad's horrific barrel bombs. Most everyone who remains in Syria endures power and water cuts, the threat of shelling, galloping inflation, and rampant speculation about: What will happen next? Who will help us, the innocents?  With roads often subject to ambush, freedom to travel has been heavily curtailed. Checkpoints and concrete blast barriers have become accepted adornments of daily life. Institutions such as schools, hospitals, and offices remain open in government-held areas, though many schools have become shelters for the legions of war injured and homeless. Truly, it is grim. Often, classes are held in double shifts to make room for the extra students. This is everyday life in Syria.  Five years into the conflict that has ravaged this once-modern nation, more than half of the Syrian population is displaced, with over 4 million refugees in neighboring countries and tens of thousands moving toward Europe. We see this on television every evening.  My hometown of Toledo has taken in 8 weary Syrian families--refugees who have now again found hope in the liberty that America offers--but fewer than 2,000 Syrians have come to the United States, though the war has displaced more than 12 million since 2011. The free world simply cannot allow this savage slaughter and dislocation to continue.  We ask ourselves: Where is the leadership for resolution?                              {time}  1715  Now, in addition to daily airstrikes against civilians by the Syrian Government violating international humanitarian law, Russian warplanes arestriking medical facilities and residential areas in non-ISIL areas where rebel forces are fighting to overthrow the Assad regime while Russia publicly proclaims its aim of eliminating ISIL targets.  I brought a map to the floor here that essentially shows most of Syria, who holds it. If one looks at these red dots here, the Russian planes are mainly bombing in the rebel-held areas, not in the ISIL-held areas. So we see a complex situation that has developed on the ground.  As Putin moves with defiance to maintain the Syrian dictatorship, his actions simply must be checked because it tells us that, in the future, there will be more slaughter with what remains if those moderate forces are not allowed to survive.  Since Russia began airstrikes at the end of September, at least 127 civilians, including 36 children and 34 women, have been killed by Russian airstrikes, according to the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.  For the sake of liberty in Syria, in Europe, and around the world, America, NATO, the Transatlantic Alliance, and our allies in the Middle East must lead the region to peaceful settlement.  I happen to represent a region in America where Syrian Americans have lived for over a century. I can't even explain to you how they feel about the total destruction of their homeland, its artifacts, and its history. I am not even able to contain it in words here.  They came to see me last week, and they asked if I would read some of their words into the Record, which I promised I would do this evening. They want the American people and the world to know:       The biggest killer of civilians in Syria is the Assad      regime's use of barrel bombs. Packed with TNT and shrapnel,      these dumb bombs have no target and are just dropped from      helicopters on civilian neighborhoods. These bombs cause      massive destruction and casualties. Thousands upon thousands      of children have been killed and injured by these helicopter      flights.  And they said to me: Congresswoman, if you can say one thing to the Congress and to those in Washington who can make a difference, please tell them to disrupt and stop these helicopter flyovers. So the barrel bombs aren't coming out of the F-16s obviously flying over Syria, but they are coming from helicopters that the Assad regime is dispatching across that country.       The most important step that can be done to save lives      would be the imposition of a no-fly zone. A no-fly zone will      turn the tide of war, and bring down the regime of terror and      force Assad to negotiate his exit.  We know there is resistance to that, but the world community must meet this latest test in order to secure a better life for the people that remain in Syria, those who may wish to return, and, obviously, the millions that have fled and are in refugee camps throughout that region and now as far as Western Europe.  I would urge the President of our country to consider the appointment of a special envoy without portfolio for Syrian peace to work full-time to bring all relevant nations together to resolve this unfolding tragedy and aim at a civil military strategy for transition and settlement.  I include for the Record Anthony Cordesman's writings. [From the Center for Strategic & International Studies, Oct. 1, 2015]  The Long War in Syria: The Trees, the Forest, and All the King's Men                       (By Anthony H. Cordesman)       Cliches are cliches, but sometimes it really is hard to see      the forest for the trees. In the case of Syria, the ``trees''      include the UN debate between Obama and Putin over Syria and      the fight against Islamic extremism, Russia's sudden military      intervention in Syria, the failure of the U.S. training and      assist missions in both Syria and Iraq, and the developing      scandal in USCENTCOM over exaggerated claims of success for      the U.S.-led air campaign in Syria and Iraq.       The most important ``tree,'' however, is trying to      negotiate an end to the fighting from the outside, as if      Assad was the key issue and as if it would be possible for      some diplomatic elite or mix of power brokers to bring Syria      back to some state of stability if only Assad would agree to      leave and the United States and Russia could agree on how to      approach the negotiations.            Focusing on the Trees When the Forest is Burning       The problem is that the ``forest'' is dying, burning, and      occupied by four broad sets of fighters that have little      reason to cooperate with any UN-led negotiating effort,      outside agreement over Assad--with or without U.S. and      Russian cooperation.       To shift from one cliche to another, Syria presents far      more problems than Humpty Dumpty. ``All the king's horses and      all the king's men'' couldn't put Syria back together by      negotiating a solution from the outside even if there was one      King instead of a divided mix of the United States, Russia,      Iran, Turkey, Iraq, the other states surrounding Syria, the      Arabian Gulf states, Egypt, and France and the other      interested European powers.       It shouldn't take a child's nursery rhyme to point out the      obvious--although it is one whose origins may date back to      England's civil wars and first appeared in print shortly      after it became fully clear that there was no way English      could ever bring the 13 colonies back under its control. To      begin with, there is no equivalent of Humpty.   Putting Four Humptys Together with No King and No Unity Among the                                King's Men       The problem is not simply ISIS or Assad. ISIS is one of the      four ``Humptys'' in a shattered Syria, but ISIS controls only      a limited part of Syria's population even in the east. ISIS      occupies both parts of Syria and Iraq. It continues to      systematically purge any religious and ideological dissent      while neither government in Damascus or the government in      Baghdad have shown any clear ability to gain support from a      major portion of the Sunnis in the area that ISIS controls.       So far, neither the forces of the Syrian or Iraqi      government have had much military success against ISIS, and      U.S. claims that Iraq has regained some 35% of the territory      it lost to ISIS are little more than dishonest spin. They are      based on the maximum line of ISIS advance before any fighting      took place and before ISIS established any level of      governance or control. They include vast areas of unpopulated      desert: areas where no one controls anything because no one      is there.                               The Kurds       The second Humpty consists of the Syrian Kurds--who have      gone from a partially disenfranchised minority to the      equivalent of a mini-state in the north and east of Syria,      and have been the only real U.S. military train and assist      success. They have no reason to support Assad or any of those      who support Assad. They too are divided, and some have ties      to Turkish Kurds, some to Iraqi Kurds, some to both, and some      are independent.       At the same time, they have no clear economic viability as      a state, face growing water problems, and would need to grab      a significant part of Syria's limited oil and gas resources      in the East to be viable unless they somehow united in a      broader Kurdish entity--one that included Turkish and/or      Iraqi Kurds and would be likely to create a new set of      regional conflicts.       Furthermore, these Administration claims and maps that talk      about liberating 35% of the area that ISIS occupied ignore      the fact that control of much of the disputed populated areas      in Anbar remains undecided, and that it was the Iraqi Kurds      which not only recovered much of the lost populated areas      that did matter, but grabbed a large additional part of      Iraq--including Kirkuk and its oil fields--and created a      whole new dimension of the Kurdish problem and its tensions      with Iraq's Arab and the Turks while the corrupt government      in the Kurdish zone of Iraq has divided and threated to      create a new round of internal power struggles.                        The Other Sunni Fighters       The third Humpty consists of an uncertain coalition of      other Sunni fighters. They control--or are fighting for      control--in many of the most populated areas in Syria. There      are no reliable unclassified estimates of the number,      strength, and ideological character of these factions but      there are well over 20 groups--and some estimates go well      over 30.       Some, like the Al Nusra Front--one of the most successful      in military terms--are linked to Al Qaeda. Others are less      radical Islamist factions, but are scarcely secular or      moderate, also have no ties to the hollow outside efforts to      create moderate governments in exile, and are being backed by      Arab states like Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. The small      groups being given limited support with U.S. weapons and      Special Forces assistance are at best petty and uncertain      players.       This is also a group of fighters that is fighting the pro-     Assad forces in what is increasingly becoming a wasteland.      The fighting on the ground, Assad's barrel bombs and the      threat of poison gas, deliberate isolation and efforts to      starve out rebel held areas have created one of them most      serious humanitarian disasters in any one country in modern      history.       Many of the more than 4 million Syrian refugees that had      left Syria lived in the area where this fight takes place.      The same is true of the well over 7 million internally      displaced persons (IDPs) that no long have a real home, job,      business, or access to key services like health and      education.       Many of the more than 250,000 Syrian civilian dead, and at      least 500,000 seriously wounded are the product of this      fighting--although it is important to note that the UN ceased      to be able to make meaningful casualty estimates well over      half a year ago, and the estimates of refugees and IDPs have      ceased to increase because (a) there no longer is a basis for      guesstimating the increase, and (b) many of the remainder are      simply too poor to leave.       To go back to cliche number one, this is the area where the      forest has now been burning for some four years. This was one      of the     most populated and developed parts of Syria. It is an area      where Syria's already poor economy probably now has a GDP      around 20% of what it was in 2011 and has no clear basis for      recovery. It is an area where no top down negotiation between      Assad or his backers and any outside faction can begin to put      even one Humpty back together again.                          The Assad Faction(s)       The fourth version of Humpty is the group of factions and      fighters supporting Assad. It is important to note that this      is not a unified group. No one has given most of those in the      area Assad control a choice as to who controls them. The      majority of the population is Sunni and other non-Alawites.      The Alawites are not Shi'ite, and are a gnostic religious      group that may have political ties to Iran and the Hezbollah,      but Alawites are not Muslims in the normal sense of the term.       There are no reliable data on Syria's population. The CIA      estimates, however, that some 17-18 million people remain in      Syria, it estimates that 87% are Muslim (official; includes      74% Sunni 74% and 13% that are a mix of Alawi, Ismaili, and      Shia). Some 10% are Christian (includes Orthodox, Uniate, and      Nestorian), and the final 3% are Druze and some small number      of Jews who remain in Damascus and Aleppo).       If one looks at the maps of Syria's sectarian and ethnic      divisions before the fighting, they are also distributed into      a series of small enclaves, many near the coast. They have no      clear ``region,'' and it is far from clear how many of the      Sunnis in the regular Syrian forces, the real Shi'ites and      other minorities in Syria, or the more secular Sunni      businesspersons and civilians would support either Assad or      any mix of Assad supporters if they had a choice.       It is also important to note that the World Bank rated the      Assad regime as having some of the worst governance in the      world before the uprising began in 2011. It was also rated as      deeply corrupt. Transparency International rated it as the      159th most corrupt country in the world--out of 175--in 2014.      The Arab and UN development reports warned that the younger      Assad was no better in moving the country towards real      economic development than his father, and that the massive      population increase in Syria had created a ``youth bulge''      for which there were often no real jobs.       The Syrian GDP per capita was at best around $5,100 even in      Purchasing Power Parity P terms in 2011 before the upheavals      began--and ranked a dismal 165th in the world. It now may      average half that level. Some 33% of the population is 0-14      years of age; 14% is 15-24, and over 500,000 young Syrian men      and women now reach job age each year in a country where      direct (ignoring disguised) unemployment is estimated to be      33-35%, and the poverty level was well over 12% before the      fighting started.             A Time for Honesty, Transparency, and Realism       One cannot ignore trees, anymore than one can ignore the      forest. The failure of U.S. policy and military efforts,      Russian and Iranian support of Assad and major Russian      military intervention, and the conflicting ways in which      other states intervene will all make things worse. The impact      of religious warfare and extremism, and failed Syrian      secularism, are even more serious problems.       It is time, however, to stop focusing on either ISIS or      Assad, to pretend that Syrian ``moderates'' are strong enough      to either affect the security situation or negotiate for      Syria's real fighters, and act as if a shattered nation could      be united by some top down negotiation between groups that      hate each other and have no competence in dealing with the      economic, social, and governance challenges Syria now faces.       The first step in solving a problem is to honestly assess      it. No negotiation can work that does not deal with grim      realities and divisions created by years of fighting. No      amount of U.S. and Russian intervention and argument can      bring security or stability. No UN effort at conventional      negotiation can survive encounter with reality, and no effort      of any kind that does not address the sheer scale of Syrian      recovery and reconstruction.
