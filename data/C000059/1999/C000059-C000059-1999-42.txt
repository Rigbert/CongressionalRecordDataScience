Chairman, I would like to thank the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner), the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Science.  Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment to H.R. 1553. This amendment was crafted in a bipartisan manner with my colleagues, the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Tiahrt), the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Costello), the ranking minority member of the Subcommittee on Energy and Environment; the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Peterson), and the gentleman from Guam (Mr. Underwood). It contains carefully thought out language which will ensure that we maintain a proper balance between the protection of life and property while promoting a private sector weather forecasting industry.  Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the amendment.
