 President, we have been talking all week about the ways our historic tax reform law is immediately helping middle-class families. It has been less than a month since Congress passed and the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but already more than 1 million Americans are on track to receive special bonuses, permanent raises, and other benefits, and their employers are attributing these changes directly to tax reform.  In fact, 100,000 employees of American Airlines are each receiving a $1,000 tax reform bonus; U.S. Bank is raising its minimum wage to $15 and is also giving $1,000 bonuses to 60,000 employees; 29,000 employees of Nationwide Insurance are also receiving bonuses, and 33,000 are getting an increase in their retirement match.
