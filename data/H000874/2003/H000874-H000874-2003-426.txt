Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his information. First, if I might, Mr. Leader, you indicate that we may also consider a motion to go to conference on the Armed Services Tax Fairness Act on Monday. Do you know whether that is more definite now? The reason I ask that is we may want to have a motion to instruct on this side.  I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. DeLAY. I appreciate the gentleman yielding and I wish I could give him a more definite answer. We are trying to consider how we would approach this very important bill and we want to get it out before the Easter break. And the best I can tell the gentleman is it looks like we are going to conference on it or we want to go to conference on it. But I do not want to mislead him. There may be other alternatives available to us after we consider work with the Senate.
