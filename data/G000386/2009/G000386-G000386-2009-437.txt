 President, I would like to take a moment today to recognize the 75th anniversary of Hostelling International USA. Since 1934, Hostelling International USA has helped facilitate travel within the United States by the world's youth and promoted intercultural understanding. As part of the international hostelling movement, this organization has helped Americans to experience different parts of their own country and helped international travelers to better understand our unique and proud history, people, and way of life.  The sharing of cultures that naturally occurs in a hostel helps people to better understand and identify with others of various backgrounds. Instead of retreating to a hotel room every night, travelers in a hostel are literally living beside and interacting with fellow travelers from other countries. Several of my staff have stayed in hostels while traveling, and I know their experiences have helped shape their ability to appreciate different cultures and points of view. In this respect, it is the small, everyday human interactions that can have the biggest impact, like encountering someone who may not speak English and learning to communicate or sharing favorite foods among an international group of travelers.  In my home State of Iowa, the Northeast Iowa Council of Hostelling International USA has provided activities for youth and adults alike in Postville and surrounding communities since 1975. I am glad that Iowans have the benefit of this programming to give a greater understanding of the world and its people to residents who may not have had a chance to travel widely. I am also glad that Hostelling International USA continues to provide the opportunity for people from around the world, and especially young people, to see the real America firsthand and meet the American people. This is the best way to build good will across the globe, and I congratulate Hostelling International USA for its 75 years of service.                          ____________________
