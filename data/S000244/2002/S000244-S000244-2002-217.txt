Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3988 would amend the Federal charter of the American Legion.                              {time}  1430  Current law makes a veteran eligible to become a member of the legion if that veteran has served since ``August 2, 1990 through the date of cessation of hostilities as decided by the United States Government'' and was ``honorably discharged or separated from that service or continues to serve honorably after that period.''  The United States Government has never issued a cessation of hostilities declaration for the Persian Gulf War. For those who are no longer serving, they have discharge papers stating that they honorably served during that period. Servicemen who have served since August 2, 1990, and are still on active duty, have no discharge papers for the period, and are not serving after the cessation of hostilities, but during that period.  The amendment would simply change the standard for qualification for membership in the legion by adding the words ``during or'' so that it states ``continues to serve during or after that period'' to make it clear that legion membership is open to active duty personnel who served during Operations Desert Shield, Desert Storm, and all of the operations that followed in Iraq, Bosnia, Kosovo, and Afghanistan.  Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to pass H.R. 3988 to make this change in the Federal charter of the American Legion.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
