President, I rise today to recognize the achievements of the ROTC Program at Providence College on the occasion of their 50th Anniversary.  ROTC dates back to 8 January 1951, when the Very Reverend Robert J. Slavin, O.P., President of the College,received word that the Department of the Army had approved the establishment of a Reserve Officer Training Corps within the curriculum. On 19 September 1951, Colonel Roy P. Moss, officially opened the Military Science Department of Providence College Transport Corps Unit. In 1951-52, the original student enrollment was 512 cadets and in 1953, the first class of seven received commissions in the Transportation Corps.  In the 1954-55 academic year, the unit was re-designated as a General Military Science program. In 1956, a rifle range was built and had its official inauguration as Company K-12. During the Vietnam era, the ROTC program at PC provided many qualified officers and as a result of the ROTC Vitalization Act of 1964, students from local colleges without programs became eligible to participate. The act also resulted in both four-year and two-year ROTC scholarships going into effect.  In the late 60's and early 70's, changing public opinion lead to a decline in enrollment in programs throughout the country until the revitalization of ROTC began in the 1973-74 academic year as women were allowed to enroll. In 1982, Bryant College was added to the Patriot Battalion and along with Brown University, Johnson & Wales University, UMASS Dartmouth, Rhode Island College, the Community College of Rhode Island, Bristol Community College. As of May 2000, 1,690 officers have been commissioned through the Providence College Program.  The ROTC Program at Providence College was recognized in 1996 as one of the top programs in New England and the New York area. As it celebrates this milestone in the history of the program, we pause to recognize the many students who have learned about the history and structure of our military and who have gone on to study tactical operations and military instruction as well as advanced techniques of management, leadership and command. These proud cadets have earned scholarships and upon graduation are Commissioned Officers in the Army.  The strength of this program lies in patriotism and dedication to duty. The Patriotic Battalion faculty and staff are indeed to be commended for the success of the program and for the significant part they play in instilling leadership and good citizenship in these young people. I would respectfully ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the proud tradition of the Providence College ROTC Program on the occasion of its 50th Anniversary.                          ____________________
