President, I rise today to talk about what should be a moment of great joy: the birth of a child. But for millions of women in the world, childbirth is a deadly game of Russian roulette.  Over 500,000 women died last year in childbirth or from complications during pregnancy. Another 10 million were injured or disabled, often permanently. During her lifetime, a woman in Angola has a 1 in 7 chance of dying in childbirth or from complications stemming from pregnancy--1 in 7. In Sierra Leone, the risk of dying is 1 in 6. That number is the same in Afghanistan--a 1 in 6 chance of dying from pregnancy or childbirth. In developed countries, such as ours, the risk of dying in childbirth is 1 in 2,800. Every such death is a tragedy, but it is hard for us to even imagine that we would lose 1 of every 6 or 7 of our mothers, wives, sisters, or daughters.  That statistic, the chance of dying from childbirth, represents one of the widest chasms separating rich and poor countries.  That gap is wider than differences for life expectancy and wider than differences in child mortality, even though the health of the mother and her baby are deeply intertwined.  As Isobel Coleman of the Council on Foreign Relations has stated, ``In some countries, getting pregnant is the most dangerous thing a woman can do.'' We have an obligation to change that state of affairs.  Earlier this fall, William Kristof wrote in the New York Times, ``These women die because they are poor and female and rural--the most overlooked and disposable people throughout the developing world.''  Kristof did a pair of columns on the subject of maternal mortality.  In the first column, he described how a young woman in Cameroon named Prudence Lemokouno was desperately ill. Her baby was already dead and she was dying, her uterus ruptured. After 3 days of labor, her family had managed to get her to a hospital, but the doctor initially refused to operate, saying he needed both money and blood. The family did not have the money, and the nearest blood bank was 50 miles away. Kristof and his associate provided the money and donated the blood. They hoped it would be enough, but the doctor still did not operate immediately. Later, Mr. Kristof wrote a second column. In it, he told us that the young woman had died. In describing her struggle, he wrote, ``It was obvious that what was killing her wasn't so much complications in pregnancy as the casual disregard for women like her across much of the developing world. . . . It's not biology that kills them so much as neglect.''  We cannot continue to overlook these women. No one should be disposable. And today's devastating statistics do not have to be tomorrow's realities. We cannot make childbirth risk free; it is not. There are sometimes factors and conditions that doctors cannot in the finest hospitals in the world cannot prevent.  But women and girls in developing countries die at such tragically high rates during pregnancy and childbirth primarily for some basic and preventable reasons. And many of the solutions are both simple and cost effective.  Millions of deliveries in the world take place without a skilled birth attendant--that means no doctor, no nurse, no midwife, no one with any medical training at all. In fact, millions of women literally give birth alone.  The shortage of health workers handicaps the world's fight against HIV/AIDS and every other global health challenge. That is equally true of the struggle against maternal mortality. Training community health workers, nurses, midwives, and doctors is part of the battle. But it is also critical to help countries better distribute their health workforces and better manage their health systems.  Malawi, for example, has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world. But 25 percent of its nurses and 50 percent of its physicians are concentrated in 4 central hospitals. And yet the population of Malawi is estimated to be 87 percent rural.  We address the maternal mortality crisis in part by building health workforces to provide prenatal care and to be there during delivery, in rural areas as well as cities.  We also help countries address this crisis by getting them to take a second look at child marriage. In developing countries, girls aged 10 to 14 who become pregnant are 5 times more likely to die in pregnancy or childbirth than women aged 20 to 24. These same young mothers are also at higher risk of obstetric fistula. Fistula is a devastating condition that can result from prolonged labor without medical help. In the end, as a result, babies are most often stillborn and women and girls are left with gaping holes in their bodies that leak feces and urine. They are then often abandoned by their families.  Even if their mothers escaped this brutal, prolonged labor and its terrible consequences, infant mortality rates for the babies of these child mothers are also much higher than for the children of older women. Yet an estimated 25,000 girls are married each day in the world, some of them as young as 7 or 8 years old.  We save lives not by demanding that countries ban child marriage in fact, child marriage is officially illegal in most nations. We save lives by convincing communities to keep their daughters in school rather than marrying them off. Many parents believe that marrying their daughters early is the best way to keep them safe from sexual predators and other dangers. We can help their communities find better ways to keep their daughters safe.  Senator Hagel and I have introduced a bill, the International Child Marriage Prevention and Assistance Act, to help countries take such steps. We plan to reintroduce this bill when Congress reconvenes for the new session in January and work toward its enactment.  Women and girls also die during pregnancy and childbirth because they are cut off from access to health care. There is a direct link between lack of transportation and high maternal mortality rates. That is one of the many links between poverty and maternal mortality. Being poor should not be a death sentence.  Rural development is critical to solving this problem, and reducing maternal mortality will enhance economic development. We can and should train more health workers, encourage communities to end child marriage, and build better transportation networks.  But those aren't the only factors that affect maternal mortality and our response to it. Politics is another cause of death. Of all the factors that contribute to the deaths of mothers, and often their babies, this is the easiest one to fix and the most unforgivable to allow to persist.  The United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA, is an organization that is doing lifesaving work. They help to promote reproductive health, including, for example, providing safe delivery kits. What is a safe delivery kit? It is often just a plastic sheet, a bar of soap, a razor to cut the umbilical cord, and a string to tie it. Imagine being on the verge of giving birth or knowing that your wife is about to deliver and lacking even these most basic supplies.  UNFPA provides family planning assistance in countries where they are welcomed. In those countries, they provide this help to families who ask for it. They also have a well developed program to prevent and treat obstetric fistula, that terrible condition which I described earlier that results from prolonged labor without medical assistance.  So each year, Congress appropriates money to support UNFPA's efforts to help countries and families who want their assistance. Yet every year the Bush administration has withheld that money. The administration does so because it claims that since UNFPA works in China, that UNFPA is supporting or participating in coercive abortions or involuntary sterilization, practices which the Chinese Government has long carried out.  In fact, UNFPA works to do exactly the opposite. UNFPA promotes voluntary family planning and opposes abortion as a form of family planning.  The United States sent a fact finding mission to China in 2002 to investigate this matter. It found no evidence of wrongdoing by UNFPA and recommended that the funds Congress appropriated for UNFPA be released. Studies have shown that abortions decrease in areas where UNFPA operates--and so do maternal and child mortality.  False accusations that UNFPA supports abortions in China are cutting off funding that could help save the lives. Yet, on September 13, for the fifth year in a row, the Bush administration announced that it was withholding the $34 million appropriated by Congress for UNFPA.  Every minute, a woman in the developing world dies from treatable complications of pregnancy or childbirth. That is a terrible tragedy. But the fact that politics are making this tragedy worse is an abomination.                          ____________________[Pages S11683-S11684]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                           MATERNAL MORTALITY
