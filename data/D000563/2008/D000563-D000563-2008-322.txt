I wanted to do a calculation. When we talked to the Republicans 2 days ago, they suggested that at that time they had 28 amendments they wanted to offer. We are hoping to wrap up this session without stopping for the weekend by going 10 straight days.  I heard from the Republican leader that in a previous debate over the span of 15 days of debate on the floor of the Senate, there were 19 rollcall votes. If I do the simple math here of 28 separate Republican amendments to start with 2 days ago, there is no way in 10 days we could finish this debate on the Energy bill before the August recess.  I ask the majority leader, does the math work in terms of opening this to as many amendments as people can dream up and actually finishing within 10 days?
