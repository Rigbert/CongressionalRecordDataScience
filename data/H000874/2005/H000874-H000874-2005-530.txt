This, obviously, is a very important bill, a large sum of money, critically important at a time when we are confronting terrorists in Iraq and around the world and our men and women are in harm's way. All of us want to make sure that we have our ideas on how we can best strengthen our efforts in that bill. So to the extent that the leader can prevail upon the Rules Committee to allow such amendments as Democratic Members and, for that matter, Republican Members want to offer, I think that would be in the best interests of full consideration.  Mr. Leader, the stem cell research legislation you indicate will be on Tuesday. It is my understanding that that bill will be brought to the floor and that it will not be subject to amendment; it will be considered as reported out of committee. Is that accurate?  Mr. DeLAY. We are working with your side on a unanimous-consent request to bring the bill up even without a rule. Hopefully, we can agree to a lengthy debate. This issue is so important for an up-and-down vote. Hopefully, we could have a full and open debate on this very important issue. And it will be hopefully done under a unanimous-consent request that will be worked out with your side, probably on Monday.
