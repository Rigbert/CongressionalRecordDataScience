 Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the fact that the chairman does not oppose and that the committee of jurisdiction does not oppose.  It is very timely. We just had a study about child safety seats which raises questions about rear-facing seats, and I think this comprehensive data would be very, very important as we move forward, potentially changing the guidelines on how we restrain children in vehicles to better protect them.  I congratulate the gentlewoman on bringing this amendment forward, and I hope that it is accepted.
