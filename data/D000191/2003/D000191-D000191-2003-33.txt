Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, I do sincerely believe that what is at stake here is the future integrity of the air traffic control system in the United States. There is none better in the world. I fear that in the future, fragmentation of that system, taking major control towers and putting them into the private for-profit sector, will bring pressures to bear that will ultimately cause a catastrophe.  Look at Europe. Just last year, a midair collision. We have not had a midair collision in a really long time in the United States of America.  This is not about making the system safer, it is not about making it more efficient. The Europeans, the Canadians and others admit that our traffic controllers are 75 percent more productive than their's. So it is not about making it more productive. It is not about making it safer.  The only reason that we are opening the door here, and we are blasting the door open here by removing any restriction on privatization, as was in the original bill, this White House has shown it will fight to privatize. They have already threatened to veto the bill unless we inserted the specificity of 71 towers. So they are clearly going to go ahead with privatization.  Now, they are going to go ahead, not because they think it will be safer, not because it will be more efficient. I do not even believe it will be less expensive. The other failed air traffic privatizations around the world have actually cost the taxpayers more, and they have had to be bailed out in England and in Australia.  This is a ticking time bomb that I believe one day will kill Americans, and I just cannot believe that we are going ahead in this form without the proper consultation, without a conference, but vitiating all the rules of the House, just so someone might be able to make a little bit of money on something that is run so well by the government today.
