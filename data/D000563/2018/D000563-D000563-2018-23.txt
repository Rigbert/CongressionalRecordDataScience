President, I join my colleagues in thanking Senator Heidi Heitkamp for her service to her State and our Nation.  I remember one of the first conversations Senator Heitkamp and I had after she joined the Senate. I told her: ``I would really like your support on a bill to help the kinds of mom-and-pop stores that are the heart of so many small towns in your state and mine.''  I was about to give her my ``elevator pitch'' on the Marketplace Fairness Act. It wasn't necessary.  Heidi said: ``Uhm, Dick, you know the 1992 U.S. Supreme Court decision that makes the Marketplace Fairness Act necessary. I'm the petitioner in the case. `Quill v. North Dakota?' That's me. I was the North Dakota tax commissioner who started that lawsuit.''  As I was quick to learn, helping Main Street, mom-and-pop stores stay in business in the age of Amazon is just one of many causes that Heidi Heitkamp had been working on, tenaciously, for years before she was elected to this Senate.  Heidi Heitkamp came to Washington with a to-do list. She worked doggedly, with Democrats and Republicans, to whittle down that list.  It was clear from the day she arrived here that she meant to use her new position as a U.S. Senator to right as many old wrongs and fix as many intractable problems as she could.  She leaves knowing that she made a difference in the lives of countless people, in North Dakota and far beyond.  She has been a champion for Native Americans, whose voices are so rarely heard in the halls of power.  The first bill she sponsored in the Senate created a new and long overdue Commission on Native Children, to try to rectify the conditions that cause one-in-three Native American and Alaska Native children to live in poverty, with suicide rates 2.5 times the national average.  Like so much of her work here, that was a bipartisan effort. Her partner in that case was Lisa Murkowski.  When the Violence Against Women Act was reauthorized in 2013, it was Heidi Heitkamp who pushed successfully to close a loophole that allowed non-Indians who commit sexual assaults on Indian Reservations--very often--to go unpunished.  Her commitment to ``make a better future'' for Native children--and all children--is what motivated Heidi to become my partner on a bill to increase and improve the treatment of childhood trauma, the root of so much suffering and violence.  We are proud that our trauma bill was included in the new law to combat the opioid epidemic. It will save lives.  Heidi has said that her proudest achievement as a U.S. Senator was when she was able to help a Korean war veteran receive the Purple Heart and other medals.  The man, Corporal Andy Shaw, was a Native American elder who had served in World War II, was wounded in a gunfight in South Korea at the start of that conflict, and spent nearly the entire Korean war as a POW, but never received the thanks or medals he should have.  After 60 years, Heidi Heitkamp was able to right that wrong.  She and her staff tracked down the facts needed to document Corporal Shaw's heroism and sacrifice, and she travelled to the Spirit Lake Sioux Reservation in North Dakota to present Corporal Shaw's medals to him personally.  Andy Shaw has a little trouble standing now, but he stood proud and straight as his Senator presented his Purple Heart.  Heidi cried because she knew how much he had sacrificed for that medal and what it meant to him.  That is who Heidi Heitkamp is: a woman who uses her power to help the underdog.  I wish she were not leaving so soon.  She has been a force for progress, a friend, and a leader for whom I have great respect.  I know that she has a lot of grit and determination still in her, and I look forward to seeing what her next chapter will bring.                          ____________________
