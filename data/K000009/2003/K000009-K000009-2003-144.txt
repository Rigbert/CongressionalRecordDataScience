Speaker, I was struck by the fact that here we are on the very first day of the 108th Congress, and I am proud to say it is the Democratic Party that is down here on the floor tonight talking about the economy and the recession and how we invest our way out of it; we are talking about war, how we avoid it; we are talking about new job creation for our country. I do not hear anything from the other side. I mean, it is easy to go to cocktail parties and leave for dinners because it is kind of a day of pomp and circumstance; on the other hand, we are a serious party, we are true to our traditions, and I want to thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) for being a part of this this evening. I am very proud to be a Democrat tonight. We are doing our job.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, if I could expand on that, it is day 10 since the extended unemployment benefits expired, and Congress is not in official session this evening taking care of that problem. They are out, many of them downtown with the lobbyists on K Street celebrating with champagne beyond the weekly food budget of many of these families who are unemployed.
