President, as many of you know, in March of 2001, Senator Breaux and I wrote the first congressional letter on the New Source Review Program to Vice President Cheney in his capacity at that time as chairman of the National Energy Policy Development Group. Our letter stated that, unless reformed ``EPA's flawed and confusing NSR policies will continue to interfere with our Nation's ability to meet our energy and fuel supply needs.''  At this point in my presentation, I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                   Washington, DC, March 23, 2001.     Hon. Richard B. Cheney,     Vice President of the United States of America, The White          House, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Vice President: In your capacity as the Chairman      of the National Energy Policy Development Group, we are      writing to bring to your attention our concerns that, unless      addressed, the prior administration's EPA's New Source Review      (``NSR'') enforcement policies will continue to interfere      with our nation's ability to meet our energy and fuel supply      needs. We strongly urge that the Administration take into      account these concerns in developing its national energy      plan.       As you are very much aware, the nation faces a potential      energy supply shortage of significant dimension. The      California energy crisis is receiving the greatest attention      in the media. However, major challenges exist in meeting      demands for gasoline and other fuels, especially in the      Midwest. More troubling, current projections suggest fuel      shortages and price spikes--far exceeding last year's      problem. These are due to a number of factors including:      difficulties in making summer-blend Phase II reformulated      gasoline; EPA hurdles to expanding refinery capacity; and the      overall increase in energy demand.       Unless reviewed and addressed, EPA's implementation of NSR      permitting requirements will continue to thwart the nation's      ability to maintain and expand refinery capacity to meet fuel      requirements. In 1998, EPA embarked on an overly aggressive      initiative in which it announced new interpretations of its      NSR requirements that it has applied retroactively to create      a basis for alleging that actions by electric utilities,      refineries and other industrial sources taken over the past      20 years should have been permitted under the federal NSR      program. We also understand that these new interpretations      conflict with EPA's regulations, its own prior      interpretations and actions, and State permitting agency      decisions.       EPA's actions have been premised heavily on its      reinterpretation of two elements of the NSR permitting      requirements. First, EPA's regulations specifically exempt      ``routine maintenance, repair and replacement'' activities      from NSR permitting. EPA now claims that projects required to      be undertaken by utilities and refineries over the past 20      years to maintain plants and a reliable supply of      electricity and fuels were not routine and thus should      have gone through the 18-month, costly NSR permitting      process. EPA's enforcement officials are asserting this      even though, for more than two decades, EPA staff have had      full knowledge that these maintenance, repair and      replacement projects were not being permitted.       A second ground for many of EPA's claims has to do with      whether projects resulted in significant emissions increases.      By employing a discredited method for determining whether      emissions increases would result from a project-using so      called ``potential emissions'' instead of actual emissions,      EPA is asserting that numerous projects resulted in emission      increases when in reality they had no effect on emissions or      were followed by emissions decreases.       EPA's NSR interpretations have created great uncertainty as      to whether projects long recognized to be excluded from NSR      permitting can be undertaken in the coming months to assure      adequate and reliable energy supplies. Electric utilities and      refineries have expected that they could undertake      maintenance activities, modest plant expansions, and      efficiency improvements without going through lengthy and      extraordinarily costly NSR permitting, as long as the project      involved either routine maintenance or no significant      increase in actual emissions.       Now, in light of the new interpretations, utilities and      refineries find themselves in a position where they cannot      undertake these very desirable and important projects. This      is not an acceptable result when the nation is faced with      severe strains on existing facilities. Against this backdrop,      we strongly urge that the National Energy Policy Development      Group:       Give investigation of EPA's implementation of its NSR      requirements a high priority;       Suspend EPA's activities until such time as there has been      a thorough review of both the policy and its implications;       Clarify whether the implications of EPA's new NSR      interpretations and its enforcement initiative are being      reviewed by the White House Office of Energy Policy and the      Secretary of Energy prior to actions that could undermine      energy and fuel supply; and       Establish guidelines to assure that EPA's application and      enforcement of its NSR requirements will not interfere with      the Administration's energy and fuel supply policy.      Requirements should be developed, which are consistent with      responsible implementation of the statutory NSR requirements.       Specifically, to assist you in assessing the implications      of NSR on meeting the nation's energy and fuel supply      demands, you may want to obtain the following: (1) all      requests since January 1, 1998 for information under section      114 of the Clean Air Act issued to facilities and companies      in any sector involved in energy and fuel supply; and (2)      notices of violation issued to, and complaints filed against,      any such company and/or facility alleging NSR violations      during that period. We are submitting a similar request to      EPA today.       Thank you for your consideration of this matter. We look      forward to working with you in the future to develop      environmental policy, which further protects human health and      the environment and works in concert with sound energy      policy.           Sincerely,     James M. Inhofe,       U.S. Senator.     John B. Breaux,       U.S. Senator.
