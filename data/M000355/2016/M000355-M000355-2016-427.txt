 President, I wish to pay tribute to my constituent, Dr. Harold E. Shufflebarger, for his exemplary dedication to duty and service to the U.S. Navy and to the United States of America. He has spent his life serving his Nation and his community, and I would like to recognize him today.  Harold Shufflebarger was born and raised in Grayson, KY. At the age of 20, he became a Navy corpsman, serving from 1943-1945 as part of the 4th Division, 24th Marines. Dr. Shufflebarger's combat record in World War II was exemplary; in the short space of one year, he participated in four major amphibious assaults, during which his unit won two Presidential citations. In February 1944, he conducted an assault landing onto Roi-Namur Island in the northern part of the Kwajalein atoll of the Marshall Islands. From June to August 1944, Dr. Shufflebarger assaulted onto the Saipan and Tinian Islands of the Northern Mariana Islands. Harold's heroic actions culminated in the historic amphibious assault onto the island of Iwo Jima in February of 1945.  After valiantly serving his country, Dr. Shufflebarger returned home to Grayson, KY, and became a family practitioner. For over 50 years, he served as a physician in northeastern Kentucky, a region without many medical providers.  Dr. Shufflebarger has served his community throughout his life. He founded a regional radio station that won four National Association of Broadcasters Crystal Radio Awards for community service, and he served as mayor of Grayson. Dr. Shufflebarger is a great example of the Greatest Generation putting country and community before self.  On behalf of a grateful Commonwealth and a grateful nation, I join my colleagues today in recognizing and commending Dr. Harold E. Shufflebarger for over seven decades of service to his country and to his community. We keep Dr. Shufflebarger's health in our thoughts and prayers, and we wish him; his wife, Hazel; his daughter, Alicia; his son, Eric; and his four grandchildren the best.                          ____________________
