 President, as they say, reserving the right to object, I don't think there is a problem; we may be able to work it out. But you mentioned two amendments Senator Grams of Minnesota has regarding the United Nations. If we can't work out the second one relating to U.N. arms, I would want a second-degree amendment, or else I would object.
