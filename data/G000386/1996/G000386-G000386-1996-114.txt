 President, I rise to speak on the maritime bill that is before us. I, first of all, want to compliment the leadership of the Senate, plus the managers of this legislation, because we are bringing up maritime legislation in the daylight. The last time it was brought up it was the last item on an omnibus bill, a very big omnibus bill. It was at 9 o'clock at night. It was just before we were taking a week's recess. And it was to finance a subsidy for the maritime industry.  For something that costly, for something that important, it seems to me it is not something that we should try to sneak through in the dark of night as the last piece of business because controversy that is connected with it might not be so welcomed to be answered. And, consequently, we just avoided all the necessary discussion we ought to have of very costly legislation.  So here we are not doing it on a Friday. We are not doing it late in the evening. And I want to compliment the leadership for bringing up a very important new program, a very costly new program, at a time when it can be given some legitimate consideration.  I also want to compliment our majority leader because he has been very forthright with me and very open with me in making sure that I had opportunities to present my point of view and to offer amendments. And it was not handled in the stealth manner that I have teased him about in the past as this bill was working its way out of committee. So I think again it is being done in an open and very forthright manner so we can have discussion on this.  I see the leader has come in. And if he is here to do other business, I would be happy to yield to him for that sole purpose.
