 President, with that we now have three Senators who will be calling up amendments.  I again say to any Senator who has an amendment they want to offer tonight, we are moving quickly to final passage. In a few minutes, we will have a number of amendments that have been agreed to on both sides. We will be calling those up.  Between now and then, the Senators I referred to will be speaking to their amendments and calling them up.
