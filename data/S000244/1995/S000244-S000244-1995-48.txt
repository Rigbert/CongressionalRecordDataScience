 Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a killer amendment, and it is a killer amendment because it goes back from the principles stated in the bill that the party who is at fault pays and the party who is not at fault does not pay.  The bill provides for several liability for noneconomic losses. That means that if a person or a party is determined by the jury to be 1 percent at fault, that party will pay 1 percent of the noneconomic losses, not 100 percent, if the party who is found more negligent by the jury ends up not having any assets or not having any insurance to pay for the judgment.
