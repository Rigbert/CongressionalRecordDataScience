For those who don't know, again, OASIS is a system of records containing all this data on the physical, mental, and functional status of Medicare and Medicaid patients receiving care from home health care agencies. So HCFA then implemented OASIS, as I understand it, as a tool to help the agency improve the quality of care and form the basis for a new home health prospective payment system. There is certainly nothing wrong with that. But the problem, as the Senator has pointed out, is that the collection of data is burdensome and expensive for agencies; it invades the personal privacy of patients, and it must be collected for non-Medicare patients--that is the part I don't understand--as well as those served by Medicare.  Why on earth would they require that? I don't understand this. You talk about an unfunded mandate. This has to be at least in the top 10.  The Kansas House of Representatives actually passed a resolution earlier this year that asked Congress to rescind HCFA rules requiring OASIS. I have it right here. It is not often that an entire legislature of a State passes a resolution telling some alphabet soup agency back here, wait a minute, this doesn't make any sense; you are causing an awful lot of regulatory overkill and causing home health care agencies to go out of business. Let's see. The State of Kansas is very concerned about the health and well-being of the senior and disabled citizens. We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ``whereases,'' translated: Whoa, HCFA, don't do this. It is an unfunded mandate.  This was passed by the House of Representatives of the State of Kansas and it was resolved ``that the Secretary of State be directed to provide an enrolled copy of this resolution to the President of the United States, Secretary of Health and Human Services, President of the United States Senate, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Minority leaders of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives,'' saying please don't enforce these OASIS regs the way they are being enforced. It is signed by the distinguished speaker of the House in Kansas and the President of the Senate.  I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material resolution was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 5041       Whereas, New rules made by HCFA require OASIS assessment      and follow-up reports for all patients of Medicare-certified      home health agencies and health departments whether or not      the personal or attendant care for such patients is paid from      Medicare; and       Whereas, The new HCFA report requires an 18-page initial      assessment, which must be completed by a registered nurse,      with a 13 page follow-up assessment being required every 60      days; and       Whereas, The requirement for computer software for the      preparation and transmission of such assessments and follow-     up reports is another unfunded mandate of the federal      government; and       Whereas, The HCFA requirement requires costly unfunded      reporting of those who receive services which are not paid by      Medicare--which reporting duplicates existing assessment and      reporting requirements of the Kansas Department on Aging; and       Whereas, In the environment of the small, home health care      services existing in Kansas, it is not feasible to create      separate organizations to provide services for non-Medicare      customers. The end result of the HCFA rules is that Medicare-     certified agencies will no longer be able to provide in-home      services to non-Medicare customers. Consequently, with lower      levels of preventive home services being available to older      Kansans there will be an increase in hospital admissions,      thus increasing Medicare costs, and an increase in nursing      home admissions, thus increasing Medicaid costs; and       Whereas, OASIS appears to be solely a research project of      HCFA, totally unfunded by federal sources, and accomplished      with loss of funds by reporting agencies and loss of services      for Kansas seniors: Now, therefore,       Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the State      of Kansas, the Senate concurring therein: That we memorialize      the Congress of the United States to require the Health Care      Financing Administration OASIS reporting and data reporting      requirements to apply only to Medicare patients and not to      all patients of Medicare-certified home health agencies; and       Be it further resolved: That the Secretary of State be      directed to provide an enrolled copy of this resolution to      the President of the United States, Secretary of Health and      Human Services, President of the United States Senate,      Speaker of the United States House of Representatives,      minority leaders of the United States Senate and the United      States House of Representatives, and to each member of the      Kansas Congressional delegation.
