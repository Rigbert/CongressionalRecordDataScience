 President, I was concerned to learn this morning that the IRS will not allow individuals who purchase a special stamp intended to raise funds for breast cancer research to list the donation as a charitable gift for tax deduction purposes.  Last year, Congress passed legislation that authorized the US Postal Service to issue a stamp priced at 40 cents, with the additional 8 cents going to the National Institute of Health and the Department of Defense to fund breast cancer research. The clear intent of my legislation was that gifts made to fund breast cancer research through the purchase of the breast cancer stamp are to be considered as a charitable donation. For the IRS to treat them in any other way violates the spirit of the law.  Breast cancer is one of the greatest health risks facing America today. More than 2.6 million women are living with breast cancer right now, one million of them have yet to be diagnosed. Breast cancer is still the number one killer of women between the ages of 35 and 52. The disease claims another woman's life every 12 minutes in the U.S.  Despite increases in the last few years, research dollars are still desperately needed to fund cancer research. In 1996, the National Cancer Institute could fund only 26% of the research grant applications, a decline from 60% in the 1970's.  Clearly, there needs to be innovative ways to offset this reduction in research spending. The breast cancer stamp is one such idea. It has the potential to raise millions of badly needed cancer research dollars. I am disturbed that the IRS has chosen to make it more difficult to raise this money. My legislation was designed to encourage contributions for breast cancer research and I hope the IRS will help fulfill its intent.                          ____________________
