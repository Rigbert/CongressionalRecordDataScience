Chair, I would say that I am convinced that this is a good amendment, and I will be in support of the amendment.  We have many Members, particularly Cathy McMorris Rodgers on our committee, who are strong supporters of hydropower.                              {time}  2015  This amendment promotes the research, development, and demonstration of marine hydrokinetic energy technologies and improves the regulatory process for such programs. As such, we support the amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.
