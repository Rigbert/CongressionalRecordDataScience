 President, I see the Senator from Tennessee on the floor. I particularly commend him for his outstanding work on the Cures bill. The Senator has had two major accomplishments this Congress--the rewrite of No Child Left Behind last year and now this medical innovation bill. I may have more to say about that later, but I commend the Senator from Tennessee for his outstanding work on this important bill.                          ____________________
