We are trying to move this along and work it out. I understand the concerns the majority leader has.  As he knows, both the two times I have served here with the Democrats in the majority and the two times I have served with Republicans in the majority, I have always respected the majority leader's prerogatives in bringing things up.  My concern is not that this be a lockstep matter, but I say to my friend from Mississippi--and this is one of the things that concerns many people on this side of the aisle--there were 30 pending judicial nominations that were received by the Senate prior to the Stewart nomination coming, and they deserve our attention, too.  Obviously, I understand the special circumstances of the Stewart nomination. If we work out some of these other things, I expect to be voting for him. But there were 30 ahead of it, not all of which are on the calendar, but were received ahead of it and 6 in front of him on the Senate Executive Calendar. We have concern that they aregoing to get consideration, that each of them will be accorded a Senate vote. People should be fair to them all. Some of them have been there for 2 or 3 years, some for a matter of months. What I am trying to do with the distinguished Senator from Utah is work out some kind of understanding where we have Senate votes on the nominations on the Executive Calendar, will have the hearings that are needed to move others along. I was hoping we could work out some kind of a package that the distinguished Republican leader and the distinguished Democratic leader could agree to today, but I don't think we can.
