During the course of the past year the Oregon and Washington Farm Bureaus, the Alaska Waterfowl Conservation Committee, and state and federal wildlife agencies have worked together on a plan to address this growing problem, and I appreciate the Chairman's help in funding this proposal. Mr. President, theOregon and Washington Farm Bureaus have provided critical leadership in helping us obtain these funds, and I wonder if the Chairman of the Subcommittee would engage in a colloquy about how these funds are to be spent.
