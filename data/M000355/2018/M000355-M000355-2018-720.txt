 President, this continues to be a productive August here in the Senate. We convened this month because too much of the American people's business remained outstanding--too many legislative priorities unfinished, too many noncontroversial, completely qualified nominees left languishing on the Executive Calendar due to partisan obstruction and delays.  Coming back to work this August was not a conventional decision, but of course there is nothing conventional about the historic level of obstruction Senate Democrats have systematically visited upon this administration's nominees, even for critical positions. President Trump's nominees have already been subjected to more than four times--four times--as many cloture votes as the nominees of his six most recent predecessors combined--combined--in their first 2 years.
