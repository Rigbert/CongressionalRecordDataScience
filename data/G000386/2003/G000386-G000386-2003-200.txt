S. sanctions in 1992. Senator Voinovich submitted an amendment to the Department of State Authorization bill to grant normal trade relations status to Serbia and Montenegro. However, because this matter is within the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee, which I chair, I felt it necessary to object to including the provision on that piece of legislation.  Still, I understand Senator's Voinovich's frustration. The Finance Committee reported out legislation which would renew normal trade relations status for Serbia and Montenegro on March 20, 2003, in the Miscellaneous Trade and Technical Corrections Act of 2003, S. 671. This bill generally passes each year by unanimous consent in the Senate.  Unfortunately, the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill has been held up for months by the insistence of some Senators on including an unrelated, controversial provision to the bill. This provision cannot be included in the bill because other Senators will object. By holding up this important piece of legislation, U.S. manufacturers and workers whose businesses rely on duty suspensions are being harmed. They are losing money, and facing the possibility of laying off workers every day that we fail to act.  This is important legislation, and I know that I am not the only one who thinks so. Sixty-six of my colleagues sent a letter to the Majority Leader, urging him to bring up S. 671 for a vote. I support their efforts, and hope this vitally important legislation will move as soon as possible. I would like to thank Senator Voinovich for raising the issue, and ask that all my colleagues recognize not only the importance, but the urgency of this legislation.  I will submit for the record a letter in support for NTR for Serbia and Montenegro, from the America's Development Foundation, ADF, a nonprofit organization assisting the international development of democracy. The ADF is working in Serbia to promote economic and social development through a program called Community Revitalization through Democratic Action, or CRDA.  I will continue to try and pass normal trade relations for Serbia and Montenegro and appreciate my colleague's strong support and advocacy on the issue.  I ask unanimous consent that the letter to which I referred be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                             America's Development Foundation,                                     Alexandria, VA, July 3, 2003.     Senator Charles E. Grassley,     Chairman, Committee on Finance, Dirksen Senate Office          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Grassley: Thank you for your leadership in      passing S. 671 out of the Senate Finance Committee. As you      are well aware this measure contains provisions that will      grant historic Normal Trade Relations (NTR) status to Serbia      & Montenegro.       America's Development Foundation (ADF) is a U.S. nonprofit      private voluntary organization dedicated to the international      development of democracy. We are very interested in the      economic and social development of Serbia & Montenegro. Among      our many activities around the world, we are now engaged in      revitalizing 70 communities located in 12 municipalities      comprising more than a million people in the Vojvodina region      of Serbia. Our broad portfolio of work is supported by the      United States Agency for International Development (USAID)      and includes providing assistance for income generating      activities for farmers and small and medium enterprises.       ADF is strongly supportive of the Bush Administration and      your Congressional leadership in highlighting the clear      linkages between development and trade. The economic growth      supported by free trade and open markets creates new jobs and      increased income for many people. From our direct/experience      working in Serbia, ADF sees a wonderful potential in further      advancing such linkages. NTR for Serbia & Montenegro will      promote its economic and social development and enhance the      prospects for strengthening democracy. Perhaps most      importantly, NTR for Serbia & Montenegro is in our nation's      direct national interests. Open markets and increased      investment will result not only in benefiting the people of      Serbia & Montenegro but also U.S. investment, trade and other      important strategic interests.       Thank you for championing S. 671. ADF looks forward to      quick passage of the bill by the U.S. Senate.           Sincerely,                                                   Michael Miller,     President.                          ____________________
