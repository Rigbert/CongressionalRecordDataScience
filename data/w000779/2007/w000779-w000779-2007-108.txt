President, I am pleased to be joined today by all Members of the Senate from the Northwest: Senator Gordon Smith, Senator Larry Craig, Senator Patty Murray, Senator Maria Cantwell, Senator Jon Tester, Senator Max Baucus and Senator Mike Crapo in introducing the Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation Mitigation Act of 2007, or FRIMA. Our legislation extends a homegrown, commonsense program that has a proven track record in helping restore Northwestern salmon runs. Dollar-for-dollar, the fish screening and fish passage facilities funded by our legislation are among the most cost-effective uses of public and private restoration dollars. These projects protect fish while producing significant benefits. That is why it is important that this program be reauthorized and funding be appropriated now.  Since 2001, when the original Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation Mitigation Act of 2000, FRIMA, was enacted, more than $9 million in Federal funds has leveraged nearly $20 million in private, local funding. This money has been used to protect, enhance and restore more than 550 rivers miles of important fish habitat and species throughout Oregon, Washington, Idaho and western Montana. For decades, State, tribal and Federal fishery agencies in the Pacific Northwest have identified the screening of irrigation and other water diversions, and improved fish passage, as critically important for the survival of salmon and other fish populations.  This program is very popular and has the support of a wide range of constituents, including community leaders, environmental organizations, and agricultural producers. Senator Smith and I are proud of the successful collaborative projects that irrigators and members of the Oregon Water Resources Congress have completed while putting this program to work in our home State. Our program also has the support of Oregon Governor Ted Kulongoski, irrigators throughout the Northwestern States, Oregon Trout, American Rivers and the National Audubon Society.  FRIMA authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to establish a program to plan, design, and construct fish screens, fish passage devices, and related features. It also authorizes inventories to provide the information needed for planning and making decisions about the survival and propagation of all Northwestern fish species. The program is currently carried out by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on behalf of the Interior Secretary.  FRIMA provides benefits by: keeping fish out of places where they should not be, such as in an irrigation system; easing upstream and downstream fish passage; improving the protection, survival, and restoration of native fish species; helping avoid new endangered species listings by protecting and enhancing the fish populations not yet listed; making progress toward the delisting of listed species; utilizing a positive, win/win, public-private partnership; and, assisting in achieving both sustainable agriculture and fisheries. Since FRIMA's enactment in 2001, 103 projects have been installed. This is a true partnership and fine example of how our fisheries and farmers can work together to protect fish species throughout the Northwest.  While he was Governor of Idaho, Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne said, ``. . . . the FRIMA program serves as an excellent example of government and private land owners working together to promote conservation. The screening of irrigation diversions plays a key role in Idaho's efforts to restore salmon populations while protecting rural economies.'' This is from ``Fisheries Restoration and Irrigation Mitigation Programs, fiscal year 2002-2004'', U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Washington, DC, July, 2005, page 13.  The bill that we are introducing today specifically extends the authorization for tbis program through 2014; gives priority to projects costing less than $2.5 million, a reduction in a targeted project's cost from $5,000,000 to $2,500,000; clarifies that any Bonneville Power Administration, BPA, funds provided either directly or through a grant to another entity shall be considered nonFederal matching funds, because BPA's funding comes from ratepayers; requires an inventory report describing funded projects and their benefits; and changes the administrative expenses formula used by the Fish & Wildlife Service and the States of Oregon, Washington, Montana and Idaho, so that administrative costs may be held to a minimum while projects in the field receive the majority of available funding.  Ultimately, it will take the combined efforts of all interests in our region to recover our salmon. State and local governments, local watershed councils, private landowners and the Federal Government need to continue working together. Initiatives such as the bill I am introducing today help to sustain the partnerships upon which successful salmon recovery will be based.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to see this legislation pass.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1522       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
