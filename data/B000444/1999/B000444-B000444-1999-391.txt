 President, this is a very straightforward concurrent resolution, but I think it bears reading again.  It says,       Authorizing the President of the United States to conduct      military air operations and missile strikes against the      Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring), That the President of the United States is      authorized to conduct military air operations and missile      strikes in cooperation with our NATO allies against the      Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).  It is straightforward and simple. It is a clear up-or-down vote on whether or not we support the action that is contemplated by the President, that NATO, through its action order--so-called action order--has authorized Solana to call for at his discretion and concurrence with the leaders of the 19 NATO countries.  I think we have debated this a lot. There are very strong views on this. I happen to think this is an authority that Congress should be giving the President, but at a minimum I think most of us agree that the President needs to hear from the Congress as to what our position is.  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this resolution.  I reserve the remainder of the time.
