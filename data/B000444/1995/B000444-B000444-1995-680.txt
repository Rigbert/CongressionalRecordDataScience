 President, I also remember something Benjamin Disraeli said when a young member of Parliament walked up to him one evening--as you know, better than I, the Parliament meets in the evening. He walked up to Benjamin Disraeli, his party leader, and he said, ``Mr. Prime Minister,''--there was a particular bill on the floor--he said, ``Mr. Prime Minister, such and such a bill is on the floor tonight. I wonder whether you think I should speak tonight on this bill.'' And Disraeli looked at the young member and said, ``Sir, I think it better that the House of Commons wonder why you did not speak than why you did.''  And occasionally I think we are going to find Disraeli's admonition, not as it relates to this particular bill, I suspect we may find his admonition may be well placed in terms of how we conduct ourselves the remainder of this session.  But I want to make it clear for the record, I am not referring to the Senator from Iowa or anyone in particular. But I just hope that on some of the legislative initiatives I have heard about, other than the one I have seen tonight, that we follow Disraeli's advice: Sometimes it is better not to speak than to speak.  But I am going to break that admonition myself right now and I am going to ask unanimous consent that I be able to proceed for 10 minutes as if morning business.
