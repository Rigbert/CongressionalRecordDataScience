Chairman, I want to return the body and the Members to the issue at hand, and the issue is the loss of wetlands in the United States of America. This year, we will lose approximately 70,000 to 90,000 acres of wetland. The two provisions in the bill are not going to lead to the entire loss of all of those wetlands, but they are contributing factors; and for every acre we lose, we cannot get it back.  The gentleman indicated earlier that as far as the authorization bill, we had other issues to deal with, and I appreciate the Chairman's comments. We have other issues to deal with in this bill to the tune of about $20 billion, and that is what we ought to be focused on. We ought to remind ourselves that in the last three Congresses, there were 225 on other bills dealing with issues related to wetlands and permitting, similar to that being debated at this point in time, and we have not ourselves, Republicans or Democrats alike, been able to resolve those in the authorization process. This is not the time, this is not the place, this is a mistake and is subject to a veto, and I would ask my colleagues to support the Visclosky-Oberstar-Borski amendment.
