Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to a good friend of mine, Dr. Charles ``Chuck'' Gunnoe. Dr. Gunnoe passed away March 10, 2012, in Corona, California, with his wife Becky and his family at his side. Chuck was a pillar of the community in Corona, California, and he will be deeply missed.  Chuck was born September 25, 1928, in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Andrew Benton and Anna Gunnoe. After honorably serving in the United States Air Force, Chuck earned his medical degree from Indiana University. Chuck worked as a family physician for 54 years. Chuck, and his wife Becky, were known throughout the community and Dr. Gunnoe was the longest practicing physician in Corona. Chuck considered himself a country doctor and was inspired by his hometown doctor in Indiana who would make house calls. Dr. Gunnoe moved to Corona in 1956 after completing his residency at Riverside General Hospital and took over the practice of a local doctor.  Chuck was a visionary in Corona; he immediately saw the need for more medical services in the community and purchased land that would become the site for the second hospital in Corona. After many years of work, that hospital would become part of the Corona Regional Medical Center. As a physician, Dr. Gunnoe never rushed with his patients, would visit some at home if they were unable to come to the office, and gave many his home telephone number. That kind of service and commitment to the health of his patients is rare today. Dr. Gunnoe retired in 2010, having been a doctor to three generations of Corona residents. He would still see some patients in his home after he retired; his dedication to his patients as steadfast as ever.  It is hard to imagine that Chuck would have any free time on his hands yet he always found time for his community. He was past president of the Corona Chamber of Commerce, its Citizen of the Year in 1996, founder of the local Jaycees, and owner of Deerfield Station, a gourmet restaurant. In his free time, Chuck enjoyed spending time with his family, traveling in his motor home, playing tennis, golf and bowling.  Chuck is survived by his wife, Becky Gunnoe of 35 years; daughters, Dawne (David) Malone, Janis Tedesco, Laura Leigh (Michael) Gunnoe-Pass; sons, Bryan A. Gunnoe, Charles E. (Susan) Gunnoe, Jr.; sister, Mabel Pugh; seven grandchildren, Dylan and Nicolas Tedesco, Jessica, Danielle and Jake Gunnoe, Michael Benton and Sean Christian Pass, and three great-grandchildren, Sienna, Jonah and Sebastian.  On Friday, March 16, 2012, a memorial service was held celebrating Chuck's extraordinary life. Chuck will always be remembered for his unwavering care for his patients, incredible work ethic, generosity, contributions to the community and love of family. His dedication to his work, family and community are a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will continue. I extend my condolences toChuck's family and friends; although Chuck may be gone, the light and goodness he brought to the world remain and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
