I think that one of my greatest misgivings about the H.R. 400, and the reason I am supporting the substitute is because, having met many inventors, in a State like Ohio, what this bill does is it, and the gentleman says, well, they can defend their rights, and the gentleman from the other side was saying the same thing, but this is a real lawyers' field day because the small inventor, maybe the person who is working on their first patent, will be forced to take money that many of them do not have.  People can defend themselves if they are representatives of a large corporation that has a patent or is filing for a patent. They do not have as much trouble. But the average small inventor under this bill is seriously compromised by the system the gentleman is setting up where we publish after 18 months.
