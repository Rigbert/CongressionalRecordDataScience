President, I rise today to congratulate Karen J. Lewis on her many years of service to Congress. After a 45-year career distinguished by outstanding achievements, Karen will retire from the Congressional Research Service, CRS, in January 2020 after leading the Service's American Law Division, ALD, for many years.  Karen joined CRS as a legislative attorney in 1974 after graduating from Albany Law School earlier that year. In the following decade, Karen provided nonpartisan advice to Congress on some of the most difficult legal matters facing the Nation in the 1970s and 1980s, including sex discrimination in the workplace, abortion rights after Roe v. Wade, and the Equal Rights Amendment. She also advised Congress on the implementation of numerous civil rights laws, including title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Fair Housing Act, title IX of the Higher Education Act, and the Age Discrimination Act.  In 1984, Karen moved into CRS management, serving first as the section head of ALD's consumer law group before heading the Division's administrative law section. In the nearly 25 years she served in these roles, Karen helped mentor dozens of attorneys, engraining in them CRS's core values of providing authoritative and objective legal advice regardless of partisan affiliation. Any attorney trained under Karen's tutelage is well familiar with her repeated advice to rely on primary sources to ensure CRS's legal advice is trustworthy and reliable.  In 2007, Karen was promoted to senior CRS leadership, serving in a variety of capacities, including 11 years as the Assistant Director of CRS's ALD. As the head of the law division, Karen played a central role reviewing ALD's written work, helping to ensure its accuracy, completeness, and quality. She also led countless initiatives for the Service. This included helping to establish the Legal Sidebar--CRS's first exclusively web-based product line to provide succinct and timely analysis to Congress on matters of pressing importance. She also was instrumental in raising the profile of the Service's Federal Law Update, a seminar series that provides continued legal education for Congress, which tripled its average attendance under Karen's leadership. Karen also spearheaded the first major revision since 1952 of the ``Constitution Annotated,'' the Congress' official treatise of record on the Constitution. And Karen has been instrumental in hiring some of the finest attorneys in the Federal Government to help Congress in legal debates over executive power, health care reform, immigration, and the future of the Supreme Court. Moreover, throughout her time in management, Karen served on countless advisory panels that have helped establish organizational practices and policies for CRS.  While Karen's retirement is a loss for Congress, her imprint on the legislative branch will not soon disappear. CRS and the ALD offer an invaluable service to Congress by providing members with reliable, nonpartisan information to assist the legislative process at every step. Karen spent nearly all of her professional career supporting Congress's work and strengthening CRS through her work in ALD. She served as a role model for hundreds of attorneys who can attest that her integrity, work ethic, and dedication to CRS's core values is second to none. Her legacy will continue with the division she helped build and the Service more broadly. Congratulations to Karen, and I wish her many long and happy years in retirement.                          ____________________
