In doing so, these Marines made one of the most significant strides in our Nation's fine military history. For their courage and for their willingness to serve their country, these American heroes were honored at an event in Hammond, Indiana, on Sunday, February 21, 2010.  On June 25, 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802, which prohibited discrimination in the defense industry. This historical order was followed in 1942 by a directive that gave African Americans the opportunity to join the United States Marine Corps, a directive that would become one of America's most important advances, not only in terms of our military, but in society as a whole.  Between 1942 and 1949, approximately twenty-thousand African Americans from across the United States were recruited into the Marine Corps. Instead of being sent to traditional Marine training locations, such as San Diego, California, and Parris Island, South Carolina, they were segregated and sent for basic training to Montford Point Camp at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. Montford Point remained active until 1949, following President Harry S. Truman's issuance of Executive Order 9981, which ended the practice of segregation in the United States Military.  As the war progressed, the military could no longer deny that these dedicated and skilled Marines were equally as capable of performing their duties and serving their country as any other members of the military. The Marines of Montford Point sought to serve the United States through their military service, and in doing so, their impact spanned far beyond the military and into American society.  While many of the Marines were recognized for their military achievements, one of the highest honors was bestowed on April 19, 1974, when Montford Point Camp was renamed in honor of one of the most outstanding Marines of the camp, Sergeant Major Gilbert H. ``Hashmark'' Johnson. One of the first African American enlistees to join the Marine Corps, Johnson was a distinguished drill instructor and a veteran of both World War II and the Korean War. To date, Camp Johnson remains the only Marine Corps installation named in honor of an African American.  Madam Speaker, at this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring these fine individuals. Let us never forget their service and the sacrifices they made in defense of the United States of America.                          ____________________
