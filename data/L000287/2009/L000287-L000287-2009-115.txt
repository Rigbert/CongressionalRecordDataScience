Madam Speaker, I am proud to reintroduce the National Parents Corps Act of 2009. Just as it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a community to protect a family.  Unfortunately today, American families in every corner of our country are working harder and longer hours to just make ends meet. They labor frantically to keep food on the table, gas in the tank, and a roof over their heads. As you can imagine the troubled economy makes it especially hard for parents to fully shepherd their children through those critical formative years. Study after study shows how vulnerable pre-teen and teenage young people are to developing life-long, harmful behaviors such as smoking and drug abuse.  The National Parents Corps Act of 2009 helps address this problem, by providing parents with the resources necessary to organize and protect their children in unique but proven methods. This legislation will create a national network of parent leaders who will educate and mobilize other parents in their children's schools. These full-time, professional parents will serve as liaisons between teachers, parents, and administrators to build much-needed safety nets among police, social workers and community based organizations in schools across our country.  The program has proven successful in both identifying and preventing dangerous behaviors and trends among their middle and high school children. Thousands of parents were recruited, and their collective efforts resulted in significant decreases in criminal activity, drop-outs, and disciplinary problems in their schools and communities.  Madam Speaker, we must adapt our methods to better address the challenges facing American families. This legislation is a common-sense, modern way of building families and communities to support our most vital assets--our youth. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting the National Parents Corps Act of 2009. It is an investment in the core of our society.                          ____________________
