President, about a month ago when we passed the last continuing resolution, I spoke about the damage a provision included in the CR by the House of Representatives would cause to our international family planning programs. Senator Hatfield, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, also spoke at that time. We both expressed real concerns about what the House had done, and the effect it would have on the lives of millions of couples around the world especially women.  We also pointed out that the House had essentially handed us a fait accompli, since it recessed immediately thereafter and our only alternative to passing what they sent us in the form they sent it was to close down the Federal Government again. We passed the CR under protest, and I have been very encouraged by the strong stand the chairman of the Appropriations Committee has taken on this issue. He has always been a strong opponent of abortion, but he has also supported family planning and has made the point as eloquently as anyone that the way to reduce the number of abortions is to give couples the means to avoid unwanted pregnancies.  I am not going to repeat all that I said back then. Suffice it to say that as a result of the House action, millions of couples will be denied family planning services, including contraceptives, who want them, need them, and have no other access to them. It does not take a genius to realize that the result will be many more unwanted pregnancies, and many more abortions. In the countries where these family planning programs are carried out, abortion is often unsafe and the incidence of maternal death is alarmingly high.  I cannot believe that was the intent of the authors of the House provision, but how they could have failed to anticipate that result is beyond me. I can only conclude that they do not want the U.S. Government to provide assistance to couples who want to limit their number of children, even though these people want the assistance and many of them live in countries where millions of people go hungry each day.  A February 16, 1996, article in the Baltimore Sun made this same point. Not only does it discuss the steps AID Administrator Atwood has taken to improve efficiency at his agency, it notes that Congress rewarded him by cutting several hundreds of millions of dollars in AID's budget, cuts that I opposed. It cites the example of AID's family planning program, and points out that what the House has done will not only hurt mothers and infants, it will increase the very redtape Congress has been urging AID to cut.  As the article indicates, once again ideology won out over common sense. That seems to be a recurring theme around here.  Mr. President, I ask that the article be printed in the Record.  The article follows:                [From the Baltimore Sun, Feb. 16, 1996]            AID Learns That Good Deeds Do Not Go Unpunished                            (By Sara Engram)       When the Clinton Administration preached ``reinvention'' of      government the State Department's Agency for International      Development (AID) heeded the call.       Along with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, AID      became one of two federal ``reinvention laboratories'' where      all the talk about more efficient more effective and less      costly management turned into reality.       AID has shed some 70 senior level positions, each paying      about $100,000 a year. It      has slimmed total staffing levels by 16 percent--from 10,800 people to      9,050. It has cut regulations by 55 percent, cut the time it      takes to award competitive contracts from a year to 150 days,      cut project-design time by 75 percent and overhauled its      program operations, procurement, accounting and budget      procedures.                        Virtue is its own reward       And what thanks does it get for doing more with less?       A whopping budget cut, along with potentially devastating      restrictions on some programs.       The saga of the 1996 AID budget is one of the grimmer tales      of the budget stand-off. The agency never expected an easy      ride, given the Republican-controlled Congress' zeal for      slashing the budget and the difficulty of defending aid to      other countries when we have plenty of poor, homeless and      hungry people right here at home.       But the fact is that foreign aid is crucial to advancing      U.S. interests around the globe and to making the world a      safer place. From nurturing economic activity that raises      living standards and slows the rate of illegal immigration,      to helping emerging democracies set up a system of law, to      providing medical care and family-planning assistance to      countries with burgeoning birth rates and high rates of      infant and maternal mortality--the agency's programs plant      seeds that, eventually, can help forestall political unrest      or hostilities that spill over into wider wars.                               tiny share       Foreign aid is a tiny share of the budget--less than 3      percent (1.2%), and AID gets only a sixth of that. But a      recent poll showed an alarming number of Americans assumed      that the government spent more on foreign aid than on      Medicare.       Under the compromise finally reached by the Congress and      the White House, the agency's budget will be cut 11 percent.      Since some aid programs, such as assistance to Egypt and      Israel, must hold relatively steady, other programs took an      especially hard hit.       None, however, got the shabby treatment reserved for family      planning assistance. Those programs, a favorite target of a      small House group of zealous opponents of abortion and      family-planning, were cut 35 percent, a loss of more than      $200 million from 1995 funding levels. Even worse, these      opponents succeeded in requiring that no funds for 1996 be      spent before July 1--and then that the allocation be dribbled      out in 15 monthly increments, most of which would come,      absurdly, after the end of the year for which the money is      appropriated.       Since the budget impasse had blocked expenditures after      October 1, that requirement creates a nine-month gap--an      ironic length--in U.S. aid for family-planning services for      some of the poorest families in the world. Clearly, the      restrictions are aimed at interrupting these programs, many      of which are administered by private, non-profit      organizations in countries receiving the aid.                          defeat for families       The victory for ideology is a clear defeat for tens of      thousands of families who, as a consequence, will experience      higher rates of unplanned pregnancies and more deaths among      mothers and infants. Pregnancy is a high-risk undertaking in      countries where nutrition is poor and health care is      unaccessible or primitive.       It's also a defeat for efficient government--and an      illustration of how Congress can talk one game and play      another. Despite its calls for effective government, Congress      can't resist an ideological power play. What else explains a      requirement that must have been dreamed up in red-tape      heaven?       Instead of one, clean transaction, we'll now have 15 checks      and 15 contracts for a program that is underfunded to begin      with. Reinventing government? The bureaucrats are hearing the      message. It's the ideologues who, it seems, couldn't care      less.                          ____________________
