 President, today it is my honor to pay tribute to Willard Kinzer, a one-of-a-kind Kentuckian who will receive a lifetime achievement award at the beginning of April. Willard, a leading figure in Floyd County, seems to have done it all.  He is a World War II veteran, who felt compelled to join the Navy after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Willard's a nonstop worker, becoming a prominent entrepreneur in eastern Kentucky, leading Kinzer Drilling through expansions and growth. His philanthropy has helped build schools in his native Appalachia and has supported the Mountain Arts Center, and perhaps most unexpectedly Willard holds the distinctionas the first individual in history to drive a stock suspension car faster than 230 miles per hour. If that weren't impressive enough, wait until you hear that Willard was in his 80s at the time.  He certainly has a notable list of accomplishments, and Willard shows no plans to slow down any time soon. Last year, he celebrated his 90th birthday by winning a drag-racing championship at 175 miles per hour, In Willard's trophy room, which is packed with the many awards he has earned over a long career of achievement and thrill-seeking, a sign reads, ``Life begins at 200 mph.'' It is a fitting motto for a man who never seems to take his foot off the gas pedal.  Willard's local community will continue to enjoy his many contributions and inspirational example for generations to come. I am pleased to see his incredible life be honored, and I would like to add my voice to the chorus of those praising this remarkable Kentuckian. I hope my Senate colleagues will join me in recognizing Willard Kinzer for a lifetime of achievement and to congratulate him on this honor.                          ____________________
