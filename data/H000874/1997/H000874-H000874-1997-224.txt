Speaker, one cannot discuss this issue in 1 minute. Everybody on this floor knows this, and in fact perhaps in 5 or 50 minutes.  For over a decade and a half as chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I was not for most-favored-nation status for the Soviet Union. Why? Because they did not meet international norms. America has been, is now and hopefully always will be the beacon of freedom and justice for all the world. I am for constructively engaging on those premises, but I am also for principled engagement, for an engagement that says we will not do business as normal with those who do not treat their own people as international norms would demand. And not only do international norms demand that, but the peace and security and stability of all the world demands that.  My colleagues, let us stand up, let us lift that torch high of liberty and justice and say not business as usual.
