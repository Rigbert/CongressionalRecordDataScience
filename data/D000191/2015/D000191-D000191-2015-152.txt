The gentleman from Oregon has 6\1/2\ minutes remaining. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 20\1/2\ minutes remaining.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  First off, I want to join in what many others have said: transportation infrastructure has not been historically nor should it become a partisan issue. I appreciate the chairman's willingness to work together on many aspects. We will at times disagree over elements of bills, but in general we agree that what makes this country great, what makes us competitive in the world is a world-class system of transportation infrastructure and other critical infrastructure, and today we are deficient. I talked during my introductory remarks about some of the needs. Let me just talk about the revenues.  Back in 1993, when the gas tax was raised by a bipartisan coalition in the House--actually, on the Republican side, led by the chairman's father, Bud Shuster--we paid about 14 percent. Every time you went to the pump, with the increase in the gas tax in 1993, 14 percent of your bill went to invest in the Nation's infrastructure. Yet today, some 22 years later, 7 percent goes to the infrastructure. Population has grown, road miles have increased, and the Eisenhower infrastructure has aged.  Infrastructure doesn't just age a little bit each year. It reaches a point where it accelerates dramatically, so a bridge that you could fix for $15 million or $20 million today, 2 years from now you might have to totally replace for $100 million. So not delaying these needed investments, unless we want to see people detouring around all the rivers in America because of bridge outages, is really, really critical for a just-in-time economy, for our world competitiveness, to save on fuel efficiency.  Now, a number of States have stepped in to fill the void; 14 States have voted to raise their own gas taxes since 2013. As the gentleman from Oregon pointed out, six deep red Republican States have voted to raise their gas tax this year.  Just to assure my colleagues, for those who raised it before the last election, nobody lost their election because they raised the gas tax in those States. People recognize it as a user fee. They are tired of blowing out tires and car repairs because of potholes. They are tired of detours. The trucking industry is tired of detours, and they don't want a proliferation of tolls across America. The solution is a Federal partnership.  The chairman held a hearing recently where we had the Department of Transportation director from Wyoming, a deep red State, talking about the fact that they had increased their gas tax, but they still need the Federal partnership; it is critical. We had the Governor of North Carolina--has one of the highest gas taxes in the country, deep red State these days--saying the Federal partnership was more critical than ever. The same with the mayor of Salt Lake City, the Federal partnership is critical. No State can do it on its own.  I propose that we index the gas tax to construction costs, inflation, fleet fuel economy. That would mean next year the gas tax would go up by 1.7 cents. I would like to see the Member of Congress who thinks they are going to lose their election over a 1.7 cent investment in America's infrastructure to avoid those potholes, the congestion, the detours, the delays, or the additional tolling to maintain what we have. It won't happen. It hasn't happened recently in red States that have raised it much more than 1.7 cents.  But if we index to inflation, fleet fuel economy, and construction costs inflation, we could borrow upfront for the trust fund, let's say, $150 billion, a nice increase over the current levels of spending, and we could pay it back in about 15 years with that increment, just the indexed increment that would grow a tiny bit each year.  And again, you drive by the gas station on your way to work, and when you drive home at night, ExxonMobil has raised it a nickel because there were rumors of war in the Middle East or a refinery had an outage or something or this. Where did that nickel go? It went into the pockets of ExxonMobil or speculators on Wall Street. It didn't go into our Nation's infrastructure.  The American people would sure as heck rather pay 1.7 cents to rebuild our system and make America more competitive and put hundreds of thousands of people to work than another nickel in the coffers of OPEC or ExxonMobil or Wall Street speculators.  It is time to suck it up around here, act like men and women who were sent here to make tough decisions, to regain our legacy, to begin to bring America back toward a world-class infrastructure. It would take many years and many tens or hundreds of billions of dollars to reclaim the legacy of the Eisenhower era, but it is only a lack of will--will--that prevents us from doing that. There is no major impediment. Nobody is going to lose their election over 1.7 cents a gallon. In fact, people will thank you at home.  The trucking industry is begging--begging--for an increase in the diesel tax. The United States Chamber of Commerce, when is the last time they asked for an increase in a tax? Look, all across the spectrum, the retailers, the business community, all across this country people are saying: Help us; get us out of congestion; fix the system; bring it up to a state of good repair. There is another whole contingent of American people who are saying: We need jobs.  There is no more certain way to create jobs in this country than investing in America's infrastructure. And they are not just construction jobs. They are engineering jobs. They are manufacturing jobs. In the case of mass transit, they are high-tech jobs. They are small business jobs. They are disadvantaged business enterprise jobs. It goes through the entire economy. No American will be left behind.  We could create hundreds of thousands of jobs and make America number one again. All we lack is the will here in this House. Let's say this is the last 60-day delay. Let's work together, and let's get a real 6-year bill by the end of July.  Mr. Speaker, I just want to announce we introduced the GROW AMERICA Act comprehensive bill with which we could begin policy discussions, H.R. 2410, today, with 19 cosponsors.  I yield back the balance of my time.                              {time}  1500
