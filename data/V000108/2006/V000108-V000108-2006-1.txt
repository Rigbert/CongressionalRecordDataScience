Chairman, I appreciate the chairman yielding and would associate myself with his remarks and add my voice and objection to the amendment being offered.  The fact is our committee does a great job at oversight. And as the chairman mentioned in his opening statement, we held a series of hearings dedicated to oversight. As he points out, you do have offices of inspectors general, and we do have a very competent staff, and we do exercise a great deal of care.  So I do join the chairman and appreciate his yielding.
