President I rise today to introduce an important component to further the scientific understanding of the earth's role as it relates to the environment, specifically the carbon cycle. What sparked my interest in introducing a carbon cycle research bill was a 1998 finding by academic and federal researchers that the North American continent from 1988 to 1992 absorbed an equivalent amount of the carbon dioxide emitted from fossil fuel emissions during the same time. Scientists know it happened, but cannot pinpoint the mechanisms of the process. Although you cannot watch carbon dioxide move into soil, you can see soil with high levels of carbon like river bottomland that has rich dark soil. Naturally, the question arises of how agriculture supplements this natural process.  By introducing this bill, it is my intention to follow through on the advice of climate scientists that there is a need for more research because the carbon cycle issue is complex. The bill makes sure that USDA is researching voluntary agricultural best practices such as conservation tillage, buffer strips, the Conservation Reserve Program, and new technology like precision sprayers that have multiple environmental benefits.  These voluntary agricultural best practices increase soil carbon levels also tend to reduce soil erosion, reduce fuel costs for producers, improve soil fertility, and increase production. It's a win win win. Nonetheless, there are agencies and individuals with agendas that believe agriculture is a source of greenhouse gas emissions and do not care about the multitude of benefits accruing from production agriculture. Therefore, we must arm agriculture with sound science on the carbon cycle.  This bill is intended to give producers and policymakers better understanding of the link between the carbon cycle and voluntary best practices. It authorizes USDA to conduct basic research on the mechanics of carbon being stored in soil and applied research to fine tune voluntary agricultural practices to increase the storage of carbon in soils. Furthermore, research will be helpful in finding out if agriculture can be a tool to solve the challenge of climate change.  I also want to make clear that this is a research bill. It has nothing to do with trading carbon credits or setting up a scheme for early action rewards if the Protocol becomes effective. The whole point of this bill is that there needs to be an understanding of the science and examining methods to meet the challenge of climate change without an international treaty. This bill compliments other legislation, such as Mr. Murkowski's bill, that calls for increased energy efficiency research.  The bill taps into USDA's broad research capabilities as it relates to production techniques and soil databases, but I have also incorporated state-of-the-art research tools including satellite-based technology. Satellite basedremote sensing is becoming more useful as an agricultural production component. Right now, satellites measure the greening up of wheat during spring months, making more precise estimates of wheat harvests. In discussions with remote sensing leaders at the University of Kansas, remote sensing has a role in providing the ``big picture'' as it relates to what agriculture is doing as it relates to the carbon cycle, such as mapping vegetation and estimating the amount of carbon it can store in soil.  Because of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's initial research that shows the North American Continent is a net carbon sink, I have included bill language to use air monitors to study the regional interaction of carbon dioxide. For instance, measure the movement of air from Denver to Kansas City. If the carbon dioxide level is lower in Kansas City than Denver, Kansas agriculture and land is absorbing carbon. With this data, scientists can start looking at specific ag practices.  It is my hope that the Senate can enact this legislation to be proactive in meeting the climate challenge, encouraging voluntary agricultural best practices and technology that have multiple benefits. This is a strategy that is based on commonsense, not suggestions made by the International Panel on Climate Change that would halt production agriculture as we know it. Producers can use technology to feed a troubled and hungry world, plus absorb carbon dioxide.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the legislation was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1066       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Carbon Cycle and      Agricultural Best Practices Research Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) agricultural producers in the United States--       (A) have, in good faith, participated in mandatory and      voluntary conservation programs, the successes of which are      unseen by the general public, to preserve natural resources;      and       (B) have a personal stake in ensuring that the air, water,      and soil of the United States are productive since      agricultural productivity directly affects--       (i) the economic success of agricultural producers; and       (ii) the production of food and fiber for developing and      developed nations;       (2) in addition to providing food and fiber, agriculture      serves an environmental role by providing benefits to air,      soil, and water through agricultural best practices;       (3) those conservation programs and Federal land provide      the United States with an enormous potential to increase the      quantity of carbon stored in agricultural land and      commodities through the carbon cycle;       (4) according to the Climate Modeling and Diagnostics      Laboratory of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric      Administration, North American soils, crops, rangelands, and      forests absorbed an equivalent quantity of carbon dioxide      emitted from fossil fuel combustion as part of the natural      carbon cycle from 1988 through 1992;       (5) the estimated quantity of carbon stored in world soils      is more than twice the carbon in living vegetation or in the      atmosphere;       (6) agricultural best practices can increase the quantity      of carbon stored in farm soils, crops, and rangeland;       (7) although there is a tremendous quantity of carbon      stored in soil that supports agricultural operations in the      United States, the quantity of carbon stored in soil may be      increased by using a strategy that would benefit the      environment without implementing a United Nations-sponsored      climate change protocol or treaty;       (8) Federal research is needed to identify--       (A) the agricultural best practices that supplement the      natural carbon cycle; and       (B) Federal conservation programs that can be altered to      increase the environmental benefits provided by the natural      carbon cycle;       (9) increasing soil organic carbon is widely recognized as      a means of increasing agricultural production and meeting the      growing domestic and international food consumption needs      with a positive environmental benefit;       (10) agricultural best practices include the more efficient      use of agriculture inputs and equipment; and       (11) tax credits should be offered in order to facilitate      the widespread use of more efficient agriculture inputs and      equipment and to increase environmental benefits.
