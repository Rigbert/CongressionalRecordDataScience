 President, I am pleased to once again be the lead Republican cosponsor of the ``Training for Realtime Writers Act''. This legislation that Senator Harkin and I are introducing today will provide grants for the training of realtime reporters and captioners. While we ran out of time to address this matter in the 107th Congress, I would remind Senators of the looming problem related to a shortage of what are called ``realtime writers''. Realtime writers are essentially trained court reporters, much like the Official Reporters of Debates here in the Senate, who use a combination of additional specialized training and technology to transform words into text as they are spoken. This can allow deaf and hard of hearing individuals to understand live television as well as follow proceedings at a civic function or in a classroom.  In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress mandated that most television programming be fully captioned by 2006 in order to allow the 28 million Americans who are deaf or had of hearing to have access to the same news and information that many of us take for granted. Information provides a vital link to the outside world. Americans receive a large amount of their information about what is happening in the world and right in their communities from television. Whether it is an international crisis or a weather warning, information is necessary to fully participate in our society. In order for those who are deaf and hard of hearing to receive the same information as it is broadcast on live television, groups of captions must work around the clock transcribing words as they are spoken.  Currently, video-programming distributers must provide an average of at least 900 hours of captioned programming. Starting in 2005, this will increase to 1350 hours. By 2006, 100 percent of new nonexempt programming must be provided with captions. At the same time, student enrollment in programs that provide essential training in captioning has decreased significantly, with programs closing on many campuses. In order to meet the growing demand for realtime writers caused by this mandate, we must do everything we can to increase the number of individuals receiving this very specialized training.  Our bill will help address the shortage of individuals trained as realtime writers by providing grants to accredited court reporting programs to promote the training and placement of individuals as realtime writers. Specifically, court reporting programs could use these grants for item like recruitment of students for realtime writing programs, need-based scholarships, distance learning, education and training, job placement assistance, the encouragement of individuals with disabilities to pursue a career as a realtime writer, and personnel costs.  The expansion of distance learning opportunities in particular will have an enormous impact by making training accessible to individuals who want to become realtime writers but do not live in metropolitan areas. Also, need based scholarships offered using these grants funds would be subject to an agreement with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration to provide realtime writing services for a period of time.  We must act quickly because the shortage of individuals trained as realtime writers will only grow more severe as the captioning mandate in the 1996 Telecommunications Act continues to take effect. Failure to act could leave the 28 million deaf or hard of hearing Americans without the ability to fully participate in many of the professional, educational, and civic activities that other Americans enjoy. Congress was not able to complete work on this urgent matter before the end of the 107th Congress, so we must redouble our efforts. I would urge all senators to support the swift passage of this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
