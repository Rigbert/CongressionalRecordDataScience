R. 2658, the DOD appropriations bill. The managers of the bill encourage Members who have amendments to come to the floor on Monday afternoon to debate those amendments. We will consider amendments throughout the afternoon, and any votes ordered will be stacked to occur at 5 or 5:30 p.m. on Monday. Therefore, let me repeat, the first vote of Monday's session will occur in that rough timeframe of 5 to 5:30. The Senate may consider executive nominations during Monday's session as well.  On behalf of the majority leader, I inform my colleagues that next week will be a busy week as well. We are going to continue to work through the appropriations process and could have late nights throughout the week. Therefore, all Senators should expect rollcall votes each and every day next week.                          ____________________
