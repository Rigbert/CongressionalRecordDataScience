 President, Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens were instrumental in securing funding for Tunisia. I have had a number of conversations with both members regarding this initiative. I have also advised them of the tough fiscal constraints under which we in the Foreign Operations Committee are operating.  However, I too recognize Tunisia's importance in the Peace Process and have agreed with Senator Leahy to provide $7 million of Foreign Military Financing (FMF) in this bill. $5 million is available under draw down authority and $2 million will be available through a direct grant.  I want to assure Senators Inouye and Stevens that if the Tunisians continue their role in the Peace Process, we will explore other funding initiatives in the fiscal year 2000 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill.  Mr. Inouye. Mr. President, I thank Chairman McConnell and Senator Leahy and look forward to working with them on this issue in the Fiscal Year 2000 Appropriations bill.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
