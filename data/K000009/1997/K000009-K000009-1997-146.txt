Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Indiana for his strong support of the WIC program, making sure that there is a funding stream for WIC that is not smoke and mirrors, one that we can depend on and one that is not just invented a few hours before a bill comes to the floor.  I can say that I serve as a member on two of the subcommittees of concern here, the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies, dealing with the WIC funding, and the Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies as well, which includes the NASA budget. We never had any kind of hearings with NASA on taking money from that account and placing it in the WIC account.  It was very unclear to us yesterday when we went before the Committee on Rules. We were told, well, maybe they might make a rule in order where we could debate the funding issue. Then it turns out to be a self-executing rule, and when we asked the Committee on Rules yesterday when we testified, well, where is the money coming from, they said, well, we think it may be coming from a NASA account. I said which NASA account? Well, was it the wind tunnel account? They said, well, maybe it is section 8, maybe it is not NASA.  It was very confusing up in the Committee on Rules, and then today we are presented with a self-executing rule where apparently the money is being taken from some NASA account.  This was never, never talked about, as the gentleman from Georgia knows, in our Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies, and I can assure the gentleman that as a member of the Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies, which includes the NASA budget, we never talked about this and had the opportunity to deal with the agency people from NASA.  So I think for those of us who are fighting for the WIC Program and for certainty, not just after next fall, the gentleman from California [Mr. Riggs] said he wants to hold hearings next fall. We have people being taken off the rolls today around the country, including in his own State of California, where the Governor has written us and said he needs an additional $27 million just in California alone.                          ____________________
