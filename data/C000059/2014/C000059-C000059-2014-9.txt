Speaker, I rise today with my colleague, Congressman Mark Takano, to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community are exceptional. Riverside, California has been fortunate to have dynamic and committed leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent to make their communities a better place to live and work. Charles Field is certainly one of these individuals. Charles' wide ranging accomplishments have made a permanent mark on Riverside. On September 17, 2014, Charles will be stepping down from the Western Municipal Water District Board of Directors after seven remarkable years of service.  During Charles' time with the Western Municipal Water District Board, he enthusiastically gave his talents to a variety of positions, including President, Vice President and Secretary. Additionally, Charles represented the Western Municipal Water District through distinguished leadership on the Chino Desalter Authority and on the Chino Basin Watermaster Board as well as serving on additional Western Municipal Water District and regional committees during his tenure.  Charles' dedication to civic service was matched by his passion in the legal field. Prior to joining the Western Municipal Water District Board of Directors, Mr. Field spent more than forty years in the various legal capacities, serving as a judge at the Riverside County Superior Court from 1990 to 2004 and also as a partner at the Riverside law firm Best, Best and Krieger.  It is hard to imagine that Charles would have any free time on his hands, yet he always found time to further support the community and the lives of those around him. The variety of organizations Charles gave his efforts to include the Riverside Arts Council, the Riverside County Barristers, the Mission Inn Foundation Board, the Historic Committee for Riverside Superior Court, the Press-Enterprise Board of Directors, the Board of Regents of the University of California, and the UCR Alumni Association.  For all that he has done, it is no surprise that Charles has been the recipient of numerous community awards. His dedicated civic leadership, service and support of the Riverside community were honored with the prestigious Frank Miller Civic Achievement Award. Charles, along with his wife, Virginia, also received the Lifetime Achievement Award for their devoted community involvement from Riverside's Mayor's Commission on Aging.  Charles' unparalleled commitment and tireless passion for public service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the Riverside community. We are proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many individuals are grateful for his service and we salute him as he steps down and embarks on a new chapter.                          ____________________
