President, today, Senator Brown and I are introducing important legislation to extend tax relief to working families: The Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2013.  This legislation will ensure that taxes do not increase on working families in the coming years, and will expand an effective incentive to work.  The Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2013 is pro-family, pro-work legislation that would permanently extend critical refundable tax credit provisions that have helped lift millions of working families out of poverty.  These provisions were only extended for 5 years in the American Taxpayer Relief Act, the same bill that permanently lowered the estate tax for the wealthiest Americans.  The Child Tax Credit, CTC, and the Earned Income Tax Credit, EITC, are refundable tax credits that encourage work, help families make ends meet, and lead to healthier and better educated children.  Both the Senate-passed budget and the President's FY 2014 budget request call for making these provisions permanent.  Consistent with the original goals for the EITC, the Working Families Tax Relief Act would help the only group that our Tax Code pushes into poverty: childless workers.  The EITC was designed to help childless workers offset their payroll tax liability. In reality, employees bear the burden of both the employee and employer portion of the payroll tax.  As a result, a typical single childless adult will begin to owe Federal income taxes in addition to payroll taxes when his or her income is still significantly below the poverty line. These changes will result in a full-time worker receiving the minimum wage to be eligible for the maximum earned income credit amount.  This may sound complicated, but these CTC and EITC provisions have real-world impacts.  An analysis of Census data showed that these CTC provisions lifted 900,000 people above the poverty line in 2011, using a poverty measure that counts not only cash income but also taxes and government benefits.  According to recent estimates, letting the expanded CTC expire will increase taxes on 12 million families who will see the size of their CTC credit shrink, and 5 million families will no longer be eligible for the credit at all.  The EITC has long been one of the most effective anti-poverty measures in our toolkit. In 2011, according to the Internal Revenue Service, the EITC lifted 6.6 million Americans out of poverty, 3.3 million of whom were children.  In Illinois last year, 1 million taxpayers claimed the EITC and received an average credit of about $2,300. That money isn't a hand-out, it is food on the table, school clothes for children and maybe a little bit leftover to buy Christmas presents.  When Ronald Reagan signed the 1986 Tax Reform package, he had this to say about its provisions that expanded the EITC:       The Earned Income Tax Credit is the best anti-poverty, the      best pro-family, the best job creation measure to come out of      Congress.  I could not have said it better myself.  I thank Senator Brown for his leadership on this, as a new member of the Finance Committee.  I look forward to working with him and many of my colleagues to ensure that these provisions are included in tax reform.                                 ______                                       By
