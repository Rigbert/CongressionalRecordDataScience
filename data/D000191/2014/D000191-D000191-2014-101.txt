I think it is an excellent point.  If we fully implemented Dodd-Frank and reined in some of the commodities speculators, it wouldn't be quite so volatile. But the point is, if we took a tiny fraction of the way they jack it up when you are driving to work every week and invested it, your friends, your neighbors would go to work, your commutes would be better, there would be less damage to your car, the country would be more efficient, and we would lose less jobs overseas.  So, if we indexed it and we paid it back over 15 years, we could put somewhere between $120 and $150 billion into the trust fund that would be paid for and paid back over a 15-year period.  Another alternative would be to put $1 on a barrel of crude oil. For every $1 you tax a barrel of crude oil today--Texas is at $101.70, I think, when I last checked--that would be less than 1 percent. That raises $4 billion a year to invest in the future of America, its infrastructure, and putting people back to work in this country. It would also help to rein in some of the speculation on the price of crude oil. And it would also help because OPEC and other suppliers would have to be paying a part of rebuilding our infrastructure.  The proposal I put forward exempts all manufacturing; it exempts all heating oil; it exempts all agricultural uses; it exempts school buses and other things that are currently exempt. So it would only be the fraction of the barrel that goes to current taxable transportation use as $1 dollar a barrel, which is $4 billion a year. Again, we could use that future cash flow to bond and fill in the giant pothole in the trust fund.
