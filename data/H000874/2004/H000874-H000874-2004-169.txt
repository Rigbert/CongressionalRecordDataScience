Speaker, I take this time for the purposes of requesting of the majority leader information regarding the schedule for the week to come, and I yield to my friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), the distinguished majority leader, for the purposes of giving us the schedule.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished whip, for yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, the House will convene on Monday at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several measures under suspension of the rules. A final list of those bills will be sent to Members' offices by the end of this week. Any votes called on these measures will be rolled until 6:30 p.m.  On Tuesday and the balance of the week, we expect to consider additional legislation under suspension of the rules. We also plan to consider several bills under a rule: The Fiscal Year 2005 Department of Defense appropriationsbill; H.R. 4548, the Fiscal Year 2005 Intelligence Authorization Act; H.R. 3973, the Spending Control Act of 2004; and the Fiscal Year 2005 Energy and Water Development appropriations bill.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would like to note that we are expecting a very busy week leading into the July 4 district work period. We are likely to work some late nights and possibly late Friday afternoon. I repeat, for the Members listening, possibly late Friday afternoon as we work to resolve these important pieces of legislation.  I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time, and I would be glad to answer any questions.
