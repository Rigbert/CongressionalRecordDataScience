Speaker, I want to commend Mr. Ehlers and his Subcommittee for its excellent oversight of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, Within the Department of Commerce. The agency was established originally as a part of the Department of Commerce by Executive Order in 1970. NOAA has operated under Executive Order for 36 years now. However, with no legislative ``organic act'' NOAA was restrained from taking a real leadership role in national oceanic and atmospheric policy.  This legislation sets up guidelines and oversight of programs as any authorizing legislation should do for a Federal agency. NOAA now will: have a defined leadership structure and organization; defined missions and authorities; provide strategic plans to the Congress; and be able preserve current NOAA rules and regulations within its legal structure.  I realize that the legislation has been 2 years in the making and that the other body has yet to act, but this is exactly what an authorizing committee ought to be doing exercising its oversight powers. I commend Chairman Ehlers, and Ranking Democrat Wu your persistence in pursuing the goal of passing the legislation.
