Speaker, on Thursday, January 15, 1998, tragedy struck Northwest Indiana when Dorian David Rorex, a police officer with the Gary Police Department, was fatally shot by a drug dealer. Dorian made the ultimate sacrifice by giving his life in the effort to protect our community. On the day he was killed, Dorian was working with a team of detectives in an undercover sting operation to put illegal drug dealers behind bars. In the process of making the arrest, however, a drug dealer turned on Dorian and fired his gun repeatedly, putting an abrupt end to the life of a man who had been dedicated to helping protect others.  The black bunting that hung over the police station door in Gary, Indiana, was a reminder of the sadness that hung on the hearts of all the people who have been affected by this terrible incident. It affected all the citizens of Northwest Indiana who suffered loss, knowing that the plague of illegal drugs and the violence they breed had taken the life of a courageous public servant who had been working to protect them. Dorian's colleagues, the officers who knew him and worked with him, are now forced to deal with the pain and anger of a lost partner. Most of all Dorian's family, his mother, father, fiance, and his young son, David, must face this terrible pain that this tragedy has brought them. They must now struggle to come to terms with their painful loss.  As we all work to move on from this point, we can take solace from the Bible and St. Paul, who said: ``Let us not grow weary in doing good. For in due season we shall reapif we do not lose heart.'' Dorian Rorex did not grow weary of doing good, and he did not lose heart. In all of his life's endeavors he worked to help people. He was a member of Tarrytown Baptist Church and a graduate of West Side High School. He was a veteran of the United States Marine Corps, who served in Operation Desert Storm. While serving as a member of the Gary Police Department he was a member of the Fraternal Order of Police, the S.W.A.T. team, and served as an Honor Guardsman.  Dorian's life ended too soon, but his life was full, and he lived it with honor and a sense of duty to others. In all of our endeavors to make our community safe, we were encouraged by his energy. We were made young by his enthusiasm, and, when things weren't perfect, we were warmed by his friendship. His commitment to his colleagues, his department and his city was complete. Dorian's love for his family was absolute. And, though we'll never know ``Why?'' Dorian was taken from us, we can take heart in knowing that at least part of the reason he gave his life was so that the world his son, David, inherits will be the best he could make it. And with that, in some small way, we can all try to make sure that Dorian's hope for a better world for David, and all of our sons and daughters, is fulfilled.                          ____________________
