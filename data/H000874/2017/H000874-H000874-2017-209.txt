Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those comments.  Does the gentleman contemplate the possibility of a short-term CR being necessary?  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding again.  I was encouraged by the bipartisan agreements we reached on the MILCON/VA bill and the defense appropriations bill. As you know, together, these two bills make up roughly one half of our total discretionary spending.  However, I was disappointed to hear that Democrats have apparently walked away from the negotiating table on further bipartisan agreements like these. Personally, I was disappointed to hear rumors that Democrats are hoping for a government shutdown.  The New York Times is reporting that, ``as a minority party struggling to show resistance in the era of President Trump''--Democrats--``are now ready to let the lights of government go dark.''  I sincerely hope these rumors and reports are not true. I know the gentleman disagrees with ever having a government shutdown.  As I mentioned, discussions are ongoing about how to ensure the government is funded after April 28. I want everybody to know that my door is always open, especially to you, my friend from Maryland, and any other Housecolleague who wants to play a constructive role in the process. I firmly believe the government will not shut down. It will be funded as we continue further.
