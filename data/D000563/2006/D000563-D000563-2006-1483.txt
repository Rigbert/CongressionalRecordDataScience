 When you referred to the suggestions of our colleague, Senator DeWine, on the Judiciary Committee, and other proposals to change the law that might accommodate what we are now seeing in this wiretap program, is that not an admission that what is going on now is violative of law or at least outside the bounds of the laws as written which authorize wiretaps?
