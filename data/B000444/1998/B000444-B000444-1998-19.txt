 President, I support the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999. Naming this bill after my good friend Strom Thurmond is a fitting tribute to one of the Senate's greatest defenders of America's military interests. I urge everyone to take a minute to read Section 1, which highlights Senator Thurmond's distinguished record of service and leadership.  As always, finding the right compromises to protect our national security while still living within our budget caps has been hard. Recent events in Iraq and Kosovo, and the attack on our embassies in Tanzania and Kenya are stark reminders of why our diplomatic efforts must be supported by a robust military.  I compliment the Committee on Armed Services, under the leadership of Chairman Thurmond and Senator Levin, for its dedicated effort to address some of our nation's critical national security needs. While I do not agree with everything in the conference report, on balance I believe this bill does a great deal of good.  On the personnel front, I know that all of us are pleased with the 3.6 percent pay raise. We know that our patriotic men and women in uniform do not serve in order to make money, but that doesn't change the needs of their families and themselves for adequate recompense. This is a solid step in the right direction.  Along the same lines, I thank the conferees for joining me in supporting an increase in hazardous duty incentive pay for mid- and senior level enlisted aircrew personnel. This necessary increase reflects our commitment to the experienced aircrew personnel without whom our planes could not fly vital missions in Bosnia and Iraq.  I was also pleased to see that this bill recognized the increasingly vital role of our Guard and Reserve personnel in the new Total Force. As that old Oldsmobile commercial said, ``this is not your father's'' military. Guard and Reserve personnel are absolutely vital to meeting America's leadership commitments around the world, to protecting communities here at home, and to defending national security. Among other things, this bill authorizes the payment of selective reenlistment bonuses, increased funding for Guard and Reserve training, the restoration of up to 800 military technicians (dual-status), and funds for the Guard's Youth ChalleNGe program and STARBASE program.  The conference report continues Congress's effort to address the strains on our ability to provide high quality health care to our military retirees. Both houses of Congress are agreed that more work needs to be done in this area and the demonstration projects included in this year's bill are part of that process.  In looking at some of the provisions in this bill that address foreign relations issues, I am less sanguine. As I said when the Senate dealt with this bill, I do not support the Sense of Congress provision that endorses NATO missions with ground forces that would not include any American troops. This is a dangerous precedent that encourages the erosion of American leadership in NATO.  This bill also addressed satellite transfers. While we do not want to handicap America's satellite manufacturers and telecommunications firms, the most important consideration must always be to safeguard national security. The changes made in the licensing system appear to make sense, despite their being adopted on the basis of a very incomplete analysis of a complex issue. Transferring licensing authority back to the State Department--the same agency that licensed the controversial Loral satellite launch in February 1996--may help, so long as the State Department is given the resources to do the job right. This conference report permits the Department of State to keep all the fees it collects for registration by the Office of Defense Trade Controls--the office which administers licenses for military exports--a sensible approach that is also contained in the Department of State authorization bill. Now the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations conference must adopt a similar provision; otherwise we will be giving the State Department an unfunded mandate that it will be unable to fulfill. We run the risk of exacerbating the problem of perpetually under funding of our foreign policy tools.  One provision addressing foreign policy that I was very pleased to see retained is the amendment that I authored calling for a report on the peaceful employment of former Soviet experts on weapons of mass destruction. The slightly revised provision is now found at section 1309. Section 1309 requires detailed reporting on theformer Soviet experts who are at risk of recruitment by a rogue state or terrorist group. I am confident that this language will not require the Department of Defense to produce an impossibly detailed analysis. I am pleased to note that the revised provision will permit the Secretary of Defense to inform Congress of ways to increase the number of former Soviet arms experts whom we assist in their transitions into new occupations. That is a vital national security objective, and it will become even more vital in the coming years as Russia's nuclear establishment is substantially downsized and more of their nuclear weapons experts are left to find new ways to earn a living.  In conclusion, Mr. President, the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act is a comprehensive bill that addresses many of our military needs. As I have said, there are some provisions that concern me. But, overall, I believe this bill provides some of the bricks that make up the foundation of our national security policy. It takes important steps to improve the quality of life for our most critical national security asset--our military personnel. My overall concern continues to be that it should not take terrorist attacks to realize that spending more on our first line of defense--our foreign policy--is an equally vital part of our national security policy.                               sec. 1512
