Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, I just want to thank all the people who have been involved in this Chamber, our staff, our Members, the Senate as well. I want to thank all the people outside the Chamber who brought their message to us because one of the things that we wanted to do from the very start was listen. You tell us what we need to do so we can find these cures for you--name the disease. I will confess that some of us had probably never heard of some of the diseases and some of the disease patient advocacy groups that actually came to us.  We are doing the right thing because, yes, we listened; yes, we knew we needed more research; and as fiscal conservatives--and we all care about the deficit, we all do--we want to make sure that we can actually have the resources and a timeline to spend it in a prudent manner, really outlining the priorities that both sides of the aisle share.                              {time}  1500  I commend the President. He was personally involved in this issue, not a Johnny-come-lately, coming up this aisle with his last couple of State of the Union Addresses on both Precision Medicine and the Cancer Moonshot. Vice President Biden spent weeks of his time and many hours with us helping us draft the legislation that we all care about and is included in this legislation. There are Lamar Alexander, Mitch McConnell, Patty Murray, Chuck Schumer, and others in the Senate caring about this legislation, knowing its impact on so many millions of people--our researchers, who have devoted their lives, and, again, many of us here.  We traveled to MD Anderson, the Mayo Clinic, Ann Arbor, the Cleveland Clinic, and other great places to do research that actually can save people's lives. And we learned a lot. We learned a lot that, working together, we can get something done, and that is what this bill does.  But I will tell you why this vote is important when we take it at about 5 p.m. or so. We don't want to win by a narrow margin. We want to win by ahuge margin. We want to send a message to the Senate that what we did in countless hearings and roundtables has made a difference, that it is a strong bipartisan message, including the mental health legislation, again, which we debated for weeks and months here in the House, not only in the committee, but on the House floor. It is very important. It is important to people like Joe Kennedy, who spoke on the floor earlier today. The Ways and Means provisions that passed on a voice vote here are included so we can get the job done.  Our leadership on both sides--John Boehner, Paul Ryan, Kevin McCarthy, Steve Scalise, Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Nancy Pelosi, Steny Hoyer--have really been outstanding. They knew from the get-go that we needed to get this thing done. Patients can't wait. They cannot wait. We are going to have the cure to get this thing done, and, yes, it will impact millions of lives.  So, in an hour or two, when we vote on this, I would urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``yes'' for patients.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
