Okay.  In any case, the bill itself does establish a pilot program that would establish that five States would be allowed not just to do logo flowers, but to do other innovative projects that could generate revenues for use in the maintenance of the rights-of-way, and this would be five States. There would be guidelines published by the Secretary. They would terminate after 6 years, and then we would see if there was wisdom in expanding it.  One problem that is raised is we have gone through, as I said, many controversies over billboards, particularly when they went to billboards that would change as you were driving.  There was heavy regulation of that because of the period of the change so as not to distract drivers and cause potential traffic accidents. I can imagine you are driving along and you are really wanting to read that logo as you are going by, and this could contribute to distracted driving. So we must oppose the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
