 President, yesterday, Senator Conrad, and Representatives Nussle and Boswell helped me stand up for American agriculture.  Agriculture is capital intensive. As a family farmer myself, I know you can't put your love of the land to work if you don't have the resources to get started.  My colleagues and I introduced a bipartisan bicameral bill that will expand opportunities for beginning farmers who are in need of low interest loans for capital purchases of farmland and equipment. This legislation is called the ``Agricultural Bond Enhancement Act.''  Back in the early 1980s, I realize the federal government needed to do more to provide young farmers an opportunity to start farming. In 1981, I pushed for pilot projects to establish the Aggie Bond program. After temporarily reauthorizing the program many times I succeeded in making the Beginning Farmer Loan Program permanent in the 103rd Congress.  Current law permits state authorities to issue tax exempt bonds and to loan the proceeds from the sale of the bonds to beginning farmers and ranchers to finance the cost of acquiring land, buildings and equipment used in a farm or ranch operation. The tax-exempt nature of the Aggie Bonds provides a below-market interest rate on the loan made to the farmer or rancher.  The program has been very successful, especially in my home state of Iowa. Since the beginning of the program in 1981, more than 2,600 Iowans have taken advantage of this opportunity. Iowa's program has provided over $260 million in qualified beginning loans and the default rate has only been 1.5% of the total number of loans. I believe most ag lenders would agree those are very good numbers.  We have an opportunity to make the Beginning Farmer Loan Program even better. Currently, Aggie Bonds are subjected to a volume cap. That puts them in competition with industrial projects for bond allocation. This is the problem we would like to remedy.  Aggie Bonds share few similarities to Industrial Revenue Bonds and should not be subjected to the same volume cap. Insufficient funding due to the volume cap limits the effectiveness of this program.  The solution: amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exempt small issue bonds for agriculture from the State volume cap.  During the past three years the Iowa Agricultural Development Authority has consistently used all of the $24 million bond allocation it was allowed. Some beginning farmers had to sit idle until the next year to close their loan, or pay a higher interest rate if they closed their loan without the bond.  We cannot afford to stand by and allow the next generation of family farmers to lose out on an opportunity to start farming. The average age of America's family farmers continues to climb.  Deserving young farmers should not be forced to compete against industry for reduced interest loans.  The ``Agricultural Bond Enhancement Act'' will open the door to more young farmers and help cultivate the next crop of family farmers in the 21st century.                          ____________________
