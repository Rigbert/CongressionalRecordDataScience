Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I may suggest one thing. The President will have a chance to sign an appropriation bill very soon this week. If he vetoes that bill, that means that the parks will not be open. By the way, I say this, this has not happened before. Yes, in some of the monuments, and the refuges are what really concern me the most when the State manages them. This is an example of this administration, the arrogance of this administration, mismanaging the parks that the taxpayers pay for.  As far as who can do it and who cannot do it, I will put up any State park against the Federal parks right now and how they are run. In fact, in California the one park that is being run right is the Redwoods State Park in California, not the National Redwood Park we made at a cost of $1.4 billion. It is poorly attended, poorly managed, poorly visited.  All we are saying, though, if, in fact, this would happen again, there can be differences of opinion between the Congress of the United States and the President of the United States. But no Secretary of the Interior should deprive any taxpayer the ability to visit that which he paid for because they have decided by the will and whim of any one individual that they are going to shut it down. In fact, they shut down concessionaire stands on the Smokey Ridge over here. They shut them down when the concessionaires themselves had a binding contract. They had people come in and said, ``You will shut down.'' It was Gestapo tactics from the very get go.  This bill will stop the Secretary and this administration when the State says, ``We can do it, we will do it, we will pay for it. We are liable, and we are going to keep it open for the American people.''  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton].
