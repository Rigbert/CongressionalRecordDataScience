  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, well, it promises to be yet another hot muggy day in Washington, D.C., so the Republican leadership are rushing to drag out a bloated tax give-away bill and rush it through before it begins to stink too badly in the heat and the light of day. It is rumored to be 4,400 pages long, but there are no printed copies available to Members of Congress, the general public, only lobbyists who wrote the bill.  It is a $4 billion problem, and it will be solved with a $150 billion burden on the American taxpayer. Only in Washington, D.C. It has to do with U.S. corporations' taxes overseas, but this bill addresses Eskimo whalers, fishing tackle manufacturers, $9 billion for tobacco growers, and it is going to privatize tax collections in the United States, giving our most private information to the private sector bill collectors. Only in America do we solve a $4billion problem with a $150 billion expenditure; only in a Republican America.                          ____________________
