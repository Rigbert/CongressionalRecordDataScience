The bill we have before us here--that Senator Dodd and the Banking Committee brought forward--has the strongest consumer financial protection law in the history of the United States. It has an agency with independent authority to protect Americans, but more importantly to empower Americans to make the right decisions when they are taking out a mortgage, a loan for a car, a home loan or a student loan. What the Republicans are suggesting in the Shelby amendment is to go back to the old days when there was no protection, there was no authority.  The argument is made about the fact that when it comes to mortgages, they weren't the problem, the problems were with Wall Street. But at the heart of the issue on Wall Street was the mortgage being signed by the family in Springfield, IL, and Portland, OR. So I ask the Senator: In your State, in your experience, as you look at this, if the Republicans have their way and move us back to the old days when it comes to this consumer empowerment, consumer protection, don't we run the risk of falling into another economic crisis, losing millions more jobs across America? Isn't that the risk we run if we go the route suggested by the Republican amendment?
