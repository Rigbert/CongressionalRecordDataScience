 President, I associate myself with the remarks of my friend from Connecticut. This is about the raw exercise of political power. I do not know how many times in my 31 years I have ever heard a Senator stand up on the floor when he represents the greatest number of constituents affected by a bill, who are major players in his State, and say he disagrees with their position. We are missing an awful lot of that.  I acknowledge that this man has some political courage. We all would do a lot better if there were a lot more of it to go around.  I yield the floor.
