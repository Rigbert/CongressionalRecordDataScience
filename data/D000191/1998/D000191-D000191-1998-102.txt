Speaker, it is my privilege and honor to congratulate Pearl Buck Center on 45 years of dedicated service to individuals with developmental disabilities.  When Pearl Buck opened in 1953, it was one of the only educational programs in Oregon providing educational services to children with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities. Pearl Buck Center has continued this tradition of leadership in the community, the state, and the nation, providing vocational training, employment, education, and case management services to people with developmental disabilities.  Annually, Pearl Buck Center provides services to about 400 individuals with developmental disabilities and their children. Since it was founded, Pearl Buck Center has helped thousands of adults and children meet the challenges of their disabilities and find opportunities to succeed in school and on the job; to succeed as parents and as self-sufficient individuals; and to contribute to the community and society.  I would like to acknowledge the hard work and spirit of service that characterizes this organization. I hope that all Americans will reflect on the dedication of the staff and volunteers of Pearl Buck Center and on the struggles and successes of the individuals they serve.  I extend my deepest appreciation and thanks to Pearl Buck Center for their efforts, past and present, to help individuals with disabilities more fully realize their abilities, potential, and independence. We are all richer for your 45 years of service.                          ____________________
