  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, at this very moment the President of the United States is announcing yet another plan to bail out the Government of Mexico. He says it is an issue of national security. The President is wrong.  Meanwhile on the other side of town, Mr. Speaker, a secret meeting of the Federal Reserve Board to consider a policy change that will affect the security of every American family is going on with little notice. They may propose the seventh increase in 1 year to fight imaginary inflation. This act could raise the deficit by $2.5 billion, drive up the costs of a hundred-thousand-dollar house by $1600 a year, close down home building, close small businesses, and it is designed to increase unemployment to 6 percent.  The misguided policies of the Federal Reserve are a real national security issue, and I would advise the President to drop the Mexican bailout and go after the no-growth policies of the Federal Reserve Board.                          ____________________
