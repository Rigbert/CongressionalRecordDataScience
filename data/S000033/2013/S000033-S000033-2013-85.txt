 All of us, I would hope, are deeply concerned, embarrassed, and disagree with what the IRS did in terms of picking out one political persuasion in terms of tax-exempt status. That is clearly wrong, unacceptable, and must be dealt with.  Many of my friends attack government day after day when government is trying to do the right thing in protecting middle-class and working families.
