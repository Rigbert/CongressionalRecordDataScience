Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 1087) designating Room H-139 of the Capitol as the ``Henry J. Hyde Room''.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 1087       Resolved, That--       (1) Room H-139 of the Capitol shall be known and designated      as the ``Henry J. Hyde Room''; and       (2) this resolution shall take effect on the day following      the date on which Henry J. Hyde is no longer serving as a      Member of the House of Representatives.
