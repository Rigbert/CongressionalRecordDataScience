. 320, a bill to designate a national Distinguished Flying Cross memorial in Riverside, California.  I thank my friends Mr. Young and Mrs. Napolitano for managing the bill today.  I am honored to represent the Inland Empire Chapter of the Distinguished Flying Cross Society, which is the primary sponsor of this memorial. The memorial honors all current and former members of the Armed Forces who have been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.  In the 111th Congress, I introduced H.R. 2788, which passed the House unanimously; and today, I stand again in support of H.R. 320, which would designate a memorial at March Field Air Museum as the Distinguished Flying Cross National Memorial. The legislation is supported by the Distinguished Flying Cross Society, the Military Officers Association of America, the Air Force Association, the Air Force Sergeants Association, the Association of Naval Aviation, the Vietnam Helicopter Pilots Association, and the China-Burma-India Veterans Association.  I would like to point out the language in the bill specifically states that the designation shall not be construed to require or permit Federal funds to be expended for any purpose related to the national memorial. Funds have been and will continue to be raised through private means for these purposes.  The Distinguished Flying Cross recipients have received this prestigious medal for their heroism and extraordinary achievement while participating in aerial flight while serving in any capacity with the U.S. Armed Forces. There are many well-known people who have played a vital role in the history of military aviation and have received the award. As was previously mentioned, this renowned group includes Captain Charles L. Lindbergh, former President George H. W. Bush, Brigadier General Jimmy Doolittle, General Curtis LeMay, Senator McCain, Jimmy Stewart, and Admiral Jim Stockdale--just to name a few.  The March Air Reserve Base, which hosts the C-17As of the 452nd Air Mobility Wing is adjacent to the location of the memorial at the March Field Air Museum. Visitors are able to witness active operational air units provide support for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, which is an appropriate setting that honors the many aviators who have distinguished themselves by deeds performed in aerial flight.                              {time}  1650  I would like to thank those who worked tirelessly to ensure this memorial is built and is properly designated in honor of the distinguished aviators that have served this great Nation. In particular, I'd like to recognize Jim Champlin; his late wife, Trish; Distinguished Flying Cross Society president, Chuck Sweeney; and the society's historian, Dr. Barry Lanman, who have been instrumental in this effort.  Again, I hope you'll join me in supporting the designation of the National Distinguished Flying Cross Memorial at the March Field Air Museum and support H.R. 320.
