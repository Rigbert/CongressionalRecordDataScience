Speaker, my district in Riverside County depends on a number of facilities to provide quality health care to its residents. Many of these facilities have been hit hard by the restrictions that were imposed after enactment of the Balanced Budget Act. This legislation would increase reimbursements to Skilled Nursing Facilities with patients that have medically complex conditions, provide flexibility in staffing and procurement priorities at rural hospitals, ensure the availability of home health care, and restore funding lost from some of the BBA reforms. With these new provisions, we will be able to continue to reap the benefit of the savings provided by the BBA reforms without driving critical healthcare facilities out of business and deteriorating our healthcare infrastructure.  I support this important bill and would have voted for the bill. Unfortunately, I have conflicting responsibilities in may congressional district. Specifically, I have been asked to participate in the dedication of the National Medal of Honor Memorial at Riverside National Cemetery. While I regret having to miss this vote, I look forward to honoring the recipients of the Medal of Honor at this dedication. We enjoy freedom and liberty today because of their dedication and sacrifice for our country.
