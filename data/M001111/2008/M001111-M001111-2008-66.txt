 President, all of us who go home and listen to our constituents each weekend know one thing and one thing only is on their mind these days; that is, the rising price of gas. I have made a habit of writing down what I pay each weekend when I fly out to Washington State, and when it hit $4 a month or so ago, I was aghast. Imagine what everyone filling their tank in Washington State is thinking now that the price in my home State is pushing $4.50 a gallon. We need action. We need action now.  For months, Democrats have been trying to address this problem by providing short-term relief along with a long-term strategy. For months, we have heard only two things from our friends on the other side of the aisle: No, and drill. Democrats know there is no silver bullet to this crisis. It is going to take a series of steps, both short term and long term, to bring some sanity back to the situation.  Today, we are going to vote on another of those short-term solutions, and we are going to try to end excessive speculation in the markets. Democrats believe we have to rein in Wall Street and our traders who are unfairly driving up these oil prices. With regard for nothing but their own profits, some traders are bidding up oil prices by buying huge quantities of oil just to resell it at an even higher price. For nearly 8 years now, the Bush administration has turned a blind eye and let these questionable practices continue with virtually no oversight. Some experts are saying this kind of trading now accounts for 20 to 30 percent of what we pay at the pump.
