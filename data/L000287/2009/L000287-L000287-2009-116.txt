Madam Speaker, I am proud to reintroduce the Consumer Product and Food Safety Information Act.  This very simple bill creates a comprehensive information process to notify American consumers about food and product recalls. It seems that practically every week there is another product or food recall, but there's no single, comprehensive, federal resource to relay this information to consumers. As a result, many Americans are rightfully concerned and confused about what products might endanger the lives of their loved ones.  In the 110th Congress after a steady stream of countless food and product recalls, I co-chaired a Ways and Means joint Oversight and Trade subcommittee hearing on Import Safety. In that hearing, we learned that there is no collective federal public information process to inform Americans about food and product safety recalls. Instead there is an expectation that press releases and Internet announcements with moderate outreach efforts are sufficient communication tools.  This legislation is not about creating a new bureaucracy; the sole purpose is to establish a process. We must provide consumers with single resources--through various media phone, print, Internet, and radio--to learn exactly what toys are safe for their children, what food is safe to eat, what beds are safe to sleep in, and what medicines won't compromise their health. The Consumer Product and Food Safety Information Act of 2009 presents a clear plan to relay accurate and timely information to all consumers--regardless of age, income or location.  Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this basic, common-sense legislation. I want to make sure that my constituents--parents, senior citizens, those who have access to the Internet, those who prefer newspapers and libraries--are provided with universal, consistent information about what foods and products are harmful to themselves and their loved ones.                          ____________________
