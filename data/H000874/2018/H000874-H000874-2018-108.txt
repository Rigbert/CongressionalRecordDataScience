Meanwhile, the population of the United States has grown by an estimated 19 million people. Less service for our people.  That is why I wrote the Appropriations Committee and asked the MRA be funded at least at 2010 levels, 8 years ago. I am disappointed that was not done.  At the same time--and, Members, hear this, because most of you won't say it because you are afraid that somehow your constituents will make you pay the price--we have once again frozen the cost-of-living adjustment as the costs go up in Washington, D.C.  I don't ask for a raise for Members, but I do ask that they be kept at the same level. We ought to stop all this hair-shirting in this body and treat Members with the respect that they deserve.  Mr. Chair, I will vote against this bill. I will vote against this bill because it is bad process and bad product and lets the American people down.
