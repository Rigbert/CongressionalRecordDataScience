Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  The amendment before the House is quite simple. It says, and I can read it because it is so brief, ``None of the funds provided in this act for the national missile defense program may be obligated for space-based interceptors or space-based directed energy weapons.''  The intent of this amendment is to have the Pentagon focus on effective missile defense; that is, theater missile defense and other national missile defense initiatives which have great promise, and not to spin off back into space in the fantasy of star wars once again.  As we know from our last experiences with star wars, it has an infinite capacity to consume funds. We have had much debate here today about scarce resources at the Pentagon, and I believe adopting this amendment will help the Pentagon to focus more effectively on the technologies that have the most promise to defend the United States of America and defend our allies.  It will not impact theater missile defense; it will not impact the Nautilus program, which is being developed in concert with Israel; it will not impact the Navy Upper Tier program; it will not impact the three-plus-three BMDO proposal; it will not impact the LEAP proposal of the Navy; it will not impact the EKV proposal of the Army. But what it does, within the context of this bill, which will provide $3.2 billion for missile defense programs of all types, it will prevent movement and dispersal of scarce funds into space-based fantasies.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
