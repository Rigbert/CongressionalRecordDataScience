In fact, because Miguel Estrada does not see a problem with this is an indication to me that perhaps some in the White House are being overly cautious again. They coached Miguel Estrada to come before us and not answer questions and now when he says, disclose the memoranda, they are saying, no, no, we did not want the Senate raising that.  Going to the point raised by the Senator as to in the history of this Senate how often this has occurred, let me reflect on this for a moment. In most instances, this will never happen. There are only a few nominees who will come before the Senate who actually have generated this kind of documentation in the Solicitor General's Office or the Department. And many of those nominees will have an open record as judges with their writings to indicate what they believe. And most, if not all, of them will have been responsive to the questions that we have asked of the nominees.  We find ourselves backed into this corner with Miguel Estrada because he does not have a body of established opinions as a judge. He does not have an abundance of writings reflecting on his philosophy. He has not answered the questions which we have asked of him. And we are straining to find some information on which to base a reasoned judgment about his nomination to the second highest court of the land for a lifetime appointment.  We find ourselves in the difficult, and I think somewhat rare, situation that has been created by Miguel Estrada and the strategy of the White House in sending this nominee to Capitol Hill. I think that is rare. I hope it does not happen again.  I yield for a question.
