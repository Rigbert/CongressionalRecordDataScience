 She is a superior ranking member. When she is chairman of the subcommittee, she is a superior chairman of the subcommittee. I do not know any Senator who loves her assignment more than the Senator from Maryland. If we hear one thing from her, it is about her VA-HUD bill. She does a super job. I am just so grateful for her service to our country, to our veterans, and to housing. It has just been exemplary.  I yield the floor.
