 Speaker Langevin, I congratulate you on taking the podium. I congratulate you on your extraordinary service to the people of Rhode Island and the people of our country. And I congratulate you for being an example of the can-do spirit that has made America such a great country.  Mr. Speaker, I am so pleased to be here on this, the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Americans with Disabilities Act. I'm particularly pleased to be here on the floor with my former colleague and my lifetime friend Tony Coelho of the State of California. Tony Coelho was the Whip on our side of the aisle for a number of years, elected into that position very shortly after he took his seat in the Congress of the United States. He is a person of extraordinary ability, extraordinary energy, extraordinary focus, and extraordinary accomplishment.  But early in his life, he fell off, in a farming accident, a tractor and injured his head. As a result of that traumatic injury, he became an epileptic. And because of that, his lifetime dream of becoming a priest was not available to him. That was something of a great trauma, again, to him.  However, he overcame that, came to Congress, and has made his life's work opening up America to those who had been discriminated against, to those who had been shut out, to those for whom the pursuit of happiness was made either impossible or very difficult by the barriers and prejudice that existed.  Twenty years ago today, the first President Bush signed the Americans With Disabilities Act. I was proud to help pass that legislation. But much more, I was proud to see our country come together to rededicate itself to the principles of equal opportunity, irrespective of race or color, national origin, religion, or any other arbitrary distinction, including disability.  The ADA made it possible for Americans with disabilities to use the same public spaces that so many of us take for granted and to succeed as their talent and drive allows them to. Fifty million Americans have gone through the doors of equal opportunity that are open. When I first heard that figure, it sounded awfully high to me because I thought about disabilities being somebody who, like Mr. Langevin, as a result of an accident had been forced to use a wheelchair for mobility purposes. I was used to thinking of disability as somebody who used a cane because they had no sight or somebody who used a hearing aid because their hearing was diminished or nonexistent.  Helen Keller, of course, taught us a great and powerful lesson about overcoming disabilities. But I learned quickly that so many of us have a disability that nobody else sees. Mr. Coelho is on the floor. If I asked you to identify Mr. Coelho by his disability you'd be unable to do so because it's not apparent. But the prejudice with respect to his disability was in fact very present.  So the Americans With Disabilities Act not only dealt with actual, visual impairments, but also perceived impairments.  We know that those doors are not all the way open, however. We strengthened the act in 2008, and today it is our job to live up to its enduring principles, whether it's making the House rostrum wheelchair accessible--thank you, Madam Speaker, for your leadership on making sure that Jim Langevin, our colleague, who has the ability to preside, has the accessibility of the rostrum so that he can exercise that ability. That's what the Disability Act was all about.  I thank my colleagues that helped to make the ADA possible. Tony Coelho, of course, in the House was our leader, our spark plug, our visionary, and he enlisted many of the rest of us to assist in this effort. The disability community who fought so hard, who showed so much courage, who spent so much time to let Members of Congress know the discrimination to which they were subjected.  I believe that this act is an act which will continue to make America a better country, it will continue to make America a country that is in fact living out the core of its principle, which is equal opportunity for all under the law.  I want to thank a number of people, some of whom we will see further today. Mr. Markey, who was so critical on the communications issue. I want to thank my friend Jim Sensenbrenner, who sits on the floor here, who was a leader on the Judiciary Committee, a critical component of the passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act. I want to thank my friend Steve Bartlett, who himself was a Member of Congress--not now--but was my partner in coordinating the various committees and subcommittees and worked together with me in an absolutely nonpartisan--it wasn't bipartisan. It had nothing to do with party or politics; it had to do with our country's principles.  I want to thank Augustus Hawkins, who was chair of the Education and Labor Committee; Major Owens; Matthew Martinez; Steve Bartlett, whom I mentioned; Congressman Fawell. I want to thank John Dingell, who chaired the Energy and Commerce Committee; Edward Markey, the chair of the Telecommunications Subcommittee; Tom Luken; Norm Lent; Bob Whittaker; Matt Renaldo; Glen Anderson, who was the chair of the Public Works Committee; Robert Roe, ranking Democrat; and Norm Mineta.  Every time you see a bus that's accessible or train station that's accessible or an airplane that's accessible, remember Norm Lent. Remember Norman Mineta as well, who made that possible. And that was very difficult because there was a cost associated to it, and we wanted to make sure that it was a reasonable cost to be imposed. But we knew that in the long run, that investment would pay off for America.  I want to thank John Paul Hammerschmidt as well; Jack Brooks chaired the Judiciary Committee at that time; Don Edwards; Bob Castermire; Hamilton Fish; and, of course, Jim Sensenbrenner. There are many, many others.  This resolution recognizes the adoption of a bill 20 years ago. Jim Langevin is the living, breathing, participating example of how that statute made a difference.                              {time}  1430  Not just for Jim Langevin but for all of us who will benefit from the contribution that the Jim Langevins of America will make, and we ought to be proud in America that this bill is now an example to all the world and has been used as a model by many nations in the world that they have followed tomake their societies more accessible and make the lives of those with disabilities fuller and more productive  There is much that remains to be done. Those with disabilities still are more likely to live in poverty. Those with disabilities are still more likely not to be able to get a job. Those with disabilities are still confronted with a lack of access to some facets of our society.  So as we recognize this anniversary, as the President tonight will honor the 41st President of the United States, George Bush, and his son who signed the Amendment Act, so both President Bushes have played a role in making accessibility a reality in America. So as we celebrate this day, let us recommit ourselves as our Founding Fathers talked about equality of opportunity and as we have seen for the 200-plus years of the existence of our constitutional democracy, that periodically we've had to take steps to make sure that the promise of opportunity was the reality of opportunity.  So, Speaker Langevin, congratulations to you. Congratulations to our country. Congratulations to our citizens as we all work together to make this a more perfect union.
