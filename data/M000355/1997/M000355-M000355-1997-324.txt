 Current law requires the President to destroy the U.S. stockpile by 2004. Condition 27 extends the deadline to 2007. Mr. President I am emphatically opposed to this provision. I do not believe it wise to give the Army, or any party the opportunity to slow down efforts to identify alternative technologies or to delay the destruction process.
