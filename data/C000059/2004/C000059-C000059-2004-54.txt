Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an organization whose dedication and contributions to the community of Riverside County, California are exceptional. Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community organizations who willingly and make their communities a better place to live and work. Western Municipal Water District is one of these organizations. On Thursday, May 13, 2004, Western Municipal Water District will celebrate 50 years of service.  Western Municipal Water District, since its formation on January 19, 1954 and authorization by public vote on January 26, 1954 has fulfilled its founding raison d'etre, to augment the shortage of local water available to local communities with supplemental water imported 242 miles to western Riverside County via Metropolitan Water District's Colorado River Aqueduct.  The Western Municipal Water District, recognizing the need for a long-term source of high quality drinking water to sustain domestic needs of a burgeoning population, began importing a second source of high quality water in 1979 from northern California via the State Water Project's 444 mile-long California Aqueduct.  The Western Municipal Water District provides vital wastewater services as administrative operator of the West Riverside County Wastewater Authority since 1998, as operator of the Santa Ana Regional Interceptor (SARI) brine line since 1983, and as owner-operator of the March Air Reserve Base treatment facility providing irrigation water to the nation's second largest veteran's cemetery since 1996.  The Western Municipal Water District, as a court-appointed watermaster pursuant to the 1969 Stipulated Judgment, has been instrumental in maintaining peace among all parties to water rights and water quality issues in the Santa Ana Watershed.  The Western Municipal Water District, as one of the five water agencies comprising Santa Ana Watershed Project Authority (SAWPA), has provided exemplary water resource management through implementation of the Santa Ana Watershed Basin Plan in cooperation and integrated planning with its neighbors in the Santa Ana Watershed.  Western Municipal Water District, has worked cooperatively and diplomatically to address complex political and regulatory issues impacting water at local, regional, state and national levels, and has invested prudently in efficient drought-proofing ventures such as the Nonpotable Conveyance System, Arlington Desalter and Riverside-Corona Feeder. I would like to express deep appreciation to Western Municipal Water District for profound contributions to the present and future health and prosperity of all communities in Western's 510 square mile service.                          ____________________
