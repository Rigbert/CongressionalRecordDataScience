Chairman, on June 11, 1996, I voted in favor of H.R. 3540, the foreign operations appropriations bill. While I still have some concerns about this legislation, including the continued restrictions on international family planning and funding of expanded-IMET for Indonesia, overall I believe this legislation includes several important provisions which deserve the support of the House.  First, this bill provides crucial funding for our allies in the Middle East. H.R. 3540 recognizes our ongoing commitments to Israel and Egypt, providing $3 billion and $2.1 billion respectively in economic and military aid.  As our Democratic ally in the Middle East, Israel has been a leader in the effort to bring peace to this region of the world. The peace process is under tremendous pressure and we need to continue to show our strong support as Israel and its neighbors continue to seek peace. It is crucial that we maintain this funding and continue our efforts on behalf of the peace process in the Middle East.  H.R. 3540 also takes important steps to strengthen the Humanitarian Corridor Act. As a cosponsor of the Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act, I was extremely troubled with the President's waiver of the Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act for Turkey on May 16, 1996. I am pleased that the House overwhelming approved Mr. Visclosky's amendment which cut economic aid to Turkey by $25 million until it lifts its blockade of U.S. humanitarian relief to Armenia. This amendment will send a strong message to Turkey that the United States will not condone its continued illegal occupation of Northern Cyprus and the internationally condemned blockade of U.S. humanitarian assistance to Armenia. We should not allow humanitarian assistance to be used as a political weapon while innocent victims are deprived of food, fuel, and medical supplies, whether it be in the wake of a natural disaster or armed aggression.  I also supported Mr. Radanovich's amendment to withhold a small portion of aid to Turkey until the government acknowledges the Armenian genocide. We cannot ignore the atrocities that the Armenian people suffered between 1925 and 1923 or the continued denial of this horrible chapter in history. The victims of this holocaust, as well as the survivors and their families, deserve the recognition of this crime against humanity.  As I stated earlier, I remain concerned about several provisions in the bill. I offered an amendment with my colleague, Mr. Frank of Massachusetts, to prohibit funding of E-IMET for Indonesia. The Indonesian Government continues to commit egregious humanrights abuses against the people of east Timor, and, indeed, incidents of abuse by the Indonesia military increased over the past year, according to the State Department. While I am disappointed that this amendment did not pass, I urge my colleagues to continue to pressure the Indonesian government to adhere to international human rights standards and to hold Indonesia accountable for its human rights record.  Overall, this bill provides $11.9 billion for foreign aid operations, a cut of $460 million from last year's level of funding. I believe it is in the best interest of the U.S. to maintain a strong presence abroad. This legislation supports our commitment to the international community while addressing the fiscal realities we face here at home. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.                          ____________________
