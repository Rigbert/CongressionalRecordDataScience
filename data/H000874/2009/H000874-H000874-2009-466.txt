Chair, It can be easy to think that a neighbor's home troubles are no concern of ours. If we can still pay our mortgages, it's easy enough to shut our doors on their problems.  But the world doesn't work like that. Our prosperity is bound to theirs, in good times and bad. A single foreclosed home can threaten a neighborhood; a neighborhood of foreclosed homes can help bring down the economy of a city; and a nation full of foreclosures can expect economic turmoil, and frozen credit, and layoffs, and decreasing demand, and more layoffs. That is where we are today: a nation with 14 million families' mortgages underwater, and counting; a nation in which foreclosed homes can drive down the value of their neighbors' property by nearly 10 percent.  That's why this bill is so necessary. The Helping Families Save Their Homes Act puts into law some of the most important provisions of President Obama's homeowner stability plan. It makes it easier for lenders to renegotiate mortgages for families who are underwater, close to foreclosure, or nearing bankruptcy. And for families that are driven into bankruptcy by their home payments, this bill allows bankruptcy judges to modify the terms of their loans--a step that is free for taxpayers and could reduce foreclosures by 20 percent. Today, investors can restructure debt on their vacation homes; real estate speculators can do it for their property; corporations can do it for their private planes; and you can even do it if you own a boat. It is only fair that average Americans have the same right for the homes they live and raise their families in.  I also want to make very clear that this bill is not designed for those who bought bigger houses than they knew they could afford. It is made for those who acted responsibly but need this breathing room because of circumstances they could not control--circumstances like unemployment or the nationwide decline in home values.  Maybe someone listening in this chamber, or watching on TV, knows what it's like to lose a home. You know, in a way that I do not, just how wrenching it is to be forced to box up your things and turn over your key.  But this bill is not just about you--it is about all of us. As President Obama said this month, ``In the end, all of us are paying a price for this home mortgage crisis. And all of us will pay an even steeper price if we allow this crisis to deepen.'' The effects go far deeper than one family and one now-vacant house. They go to the health of an entire economy--to the jobs and livelihoods of people on the other side of the continent. They go to a crisis that will not end until this mortgage mess is cleaned up.  So for all of our sakes, we need to pass this bill and begin putting President Obama's plan into effect.                          ____________________
