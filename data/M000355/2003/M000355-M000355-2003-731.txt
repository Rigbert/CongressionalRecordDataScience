 President, very briefly, the amendment I just sent to the desk ensures protection of seniors diagnosed with Alzheimer's from the high prescription drug costs associated with that illness.  My amendment states specifically that any senior on Medicare diagnosed with Alzheimer's shall have the right to a drug plan in which the beneficiary shall pay no deductible, no monthly premium, no more than a 2.5-percent copayment for drug spending up to $4,500, no more than a 5-percent copayment for drug spending between $4,500 and $5,800, and no more than a 2.5-percent copayment for any drug spending over $5,800 if their income is below the poverty level.  My amendment states that any senior on Medicare diagnosed with Alzheimer's with an income between 100 and 135 percent of the poverty level shall have the right to a drug plan in which the beneficiary shall pay no deductible, no monthly premium, and no more than a 5-percent copayment for drug spending up to $4,500, no more than a 10-percent copayment for drug spending between $4,500 and $5,800, and no more than a 2.5-percent copayment for any drug spending over $5,800.  My amendment provides that any senior in Medicare diagnosed with Alzheimer's with an income between 135 percent and 160 percent of the poverty level shall have the right to a drug plan in which the beneficiary shall pay no more than a $50 deductible, an average monthly premium not greater than $35, no more than a 10-percent copayment for drug spending up to $4,500, no more than a 20-percent copayment for drug spending between $4,500 and $5,800, and no more than a 10-percent copayment for any drug spending above $5,800.  My amendment also provides that any senior on Medicare diagnosed with Alzheimer's with an income above 160 percent of the poverty level shall have the right to a drug plan in which the beneficiary shall pay no more than a $275 deductible, an average monthly premium not greater than $35, no more than a 50-percent copayment for drug spending up to $4,500, and no more than a 10-percent copayment for drug spending over $5,800.  With this amendment, which conforms to the provisions within the bill, all seniors with Alzheimer's get help with drug costs, especially the poor and moderate-income seniors.  I yield the floor.
