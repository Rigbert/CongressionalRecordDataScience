 Speaker, I stand in complete opposition to this Interior appropriations bill, which could very well be the death knell for the National Endowments for the Arts. The bill itself terminates arts and humanities funding within 3 years.  Mr. Speaker, arts and culture are a vital part of human existence, and the opportunity to enjoy and appreciate the arts must be open to all of our people--and not just the wealthy who can pay $50 for a concert ticket.  Today, the United States spends only 64 cents per person to support the Arts Endowment, 50 times less than our major allies. In contrast, we spend $1,138 per person on military expenditures. Why is it that this Congress can lower taxes on the wealthiest people in our country, but cut back on programs which bring art and culture into the classrooms of Vermont and America? Why is it that this Congress can pour billions of dollars more into B-2 bombers that the Pentagon doesn't want, or an absurd star wars program, but eliminate funding for museums, symphony orchestras, and theater groups all over America?  The $1 million that Vermont receives from the NEA is essential to many groups like Vermont Council on the Arts, the Flynn Theatre, and the Vermont Symphony Orchestra Association.  The Arts Endowment opens the doors to the arts to millions of school children, including at-risk youth. Not only do the arts teach our children understanding, self-expression, cooperation, and self-discipline, but the arts tell the history and the soul of a nation. More and more children are becoming mesmerized by canned entertainment, with the average 5-year-old spending 33 hours per week in front of the television. Today our children should be inspired by music and theater and creative arts, rather than become desensitized to violence by television.  Unlike urban centers where art and cultural experiences are more readily available, arts funding enables programs to go out to the people in the rural communities of Vermont.  Without Federal support, arts programs would be affordable only to the rich. The average American would be faced with rising ticket costs and would be shut out from arts centers, galleries, community festivals, live music performances, and other institutions where families can experience the arts.  Support the National Endowment for the Arts--oppose these draconian cuts to the arts and humanities.                          ____________________
