 Chairman, the Pentagon is spending $31 million in taxpayer dollars for corporate bonuses for the top executives of just one major defense contractor, the Lockheed-Martin Corp. With so much concern about the Federal deficit and Government waste, I would hope that every Member of the Congress supports the amendment that I am offering which would prohibit this practice.  Mr. Chairman, as you know, earlier this year Pentagon officials agreed to use $31 million in taxpayer money to pay a third of the $92 million in bonuses that top corporate executives of the Martin-Marrietta Corp. and the Lockheed Corp. granted themselves for staging the largest merger of defense contractors in American history, and that was the creation of the Lockheed-Martin Corp. with $11.6 billion in annual military sales and $23 billion in total annual sales.  Just 2 months after this development took place, the same corporate executives announced plans to fire 19,000 American workers and to close 12 factories and laboratories across the Nation.  Mr. Chairman, this seems to me to be an example of corporate welfare at its worst and I would hope that the Members would support my amendment, which would prohibit this golden parachute, as well as any which take place.
