Chairman, I would like to congratulate the gentlewoman and inform the membership that not only is this bill historic, but, in fact, the moment we are about to experience here with the gentlewoman from Nevada [Mrs. Vucanovich], the chair of the Subcommittee on Military Construction handling this bill, is a truly historic moment for women and for men in our country, because, in fact, as she moves this bill today, this will only be the second time in the 200-year history of our country that a woman has chaired any of the subcommittees of the Committee on Appropriations, which is an exclusive committee.  The last such woman to handle such a bill was Julia Butler Hansen of Washington State who, at the age of 67, retired from this institution and chaired the Subcommittee on Interior and Related Agencies at the end of her career.  I just want to congratulate the gentlewoman. The road here is still a difficult one for women and to rise and chair one of the most exclusive subcommittees is truly an honor. We are proud of you. Good luck with the bill and congratulations to the people of Nevada for sending you here.
