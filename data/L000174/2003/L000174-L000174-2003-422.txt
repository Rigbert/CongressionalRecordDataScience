President, I am pleased that the Senate is taking up ental holdings1Total= 000>and passing the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2003, S. 764, ental holdings1Total= 000>a bill to reauthorize an existing matching grant program to help State, ental holdings1Total= 000>tribal, and local jurisdictions purchase armor vests for use by law ental holdings1Total= 000>enforcement officers.ental holdings1Total= 000>  This bill marks the third time that I have had the privilege of ental holdings1Total= 000>teaming with my friend and colleague Senator Campbell to work on this ental holdings1Total= 000>legislation. We authored the Bulletproof Vest Grant Partnership Act of ental holdings1Total= 000>1998 in response to the tragic Carl Drega shootout in 1997 on the ental holdings1Total= 000>Vermont-New Hampshire border, in which two State troopers who did not ental holdings1Total= 000>have bulletproof vests were killed. The Federal officers who responded ental holdings1Total= 000>to the scenes of the shooting spree were equipped with lifesaving body ental holdings1Total= 000>armor, but the State and local law enforcement officers lacked ental holdings1Total= 000>protective vests because of the cost.ental holdings1Total= 000>  Two years later, we successfully passed the Bulletproof Vest ental holdings1Total= 000>Partnership Grant Act of 2000, and I hope we will go three-for-three ental holdings1Total= 000>this time around. Senator Campbell brings to our effort invaluable ental holdings1Total= 000>experience in this area and during his time in the Senate he has been a ental holdings1Total= 000>leader in the area of law enforcement. As a former deputy sheriff, he ental holdings1Total= 000>knows the dangers law enforcement officers face when out on patrol. I ental holdings1Total= 000>am pleased that we have been joined in this effort by Judiciary ental holdings1Total= 000>Chairman Hatch, Judiciary Committee Senators Biden, Schumer, Kohl and ental holdings1Total= 000>Feingold, as well as five other Senate cosponsors.ental holdings1Total= 000>  Our bipartisan legislation will save the lives of law enforcement ental holdings1Total= 000>officers across the country by providing more help to State and local ental holdings1Total= 000>law enforcement agencies to purchase body armor. Since its inception in ental holdings1Total= 000>1999, this highly successful Department of Justice program has provided ental holdings1Total= 000>law enforcement officers in 16,000 jurisdictions nationwide with nearly ental holdings1Total= 000>350,000 new bulletproof vests. In Vermont, 148 municipalities have been ental holdings1Total= 000>fortunate to receive funding for the purchase of almost 1200 vests. ental holdings1Total= 000>Without the federal funding given by this program, I daresay that there ental holdings1Total= 000>would be close to that number of police officers without vests in ental holdings1Total= 000>Vermont today.ental holdings1Total= 000>  The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2003 will further the ental holdings1Total= 000>success of the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program by re-ental holdings1Total= 000>authorizing the program through fiscal year 2007. Our legislation would ental holdings1Total= 000>continue the Federal-State partnership by authorizing up to $50 million ental holdings1Total= 000>per year for matching grants to State and local law enforcement ental holdings1Total= 000>agencies and Indian tribes at the Department of Justice to buy body ental holdings1Total= 000>armor.ental holdings1Total= 000>  Not only should we reauthorize this program, but also we should work ental holdings1Total= 000>to see that it is fully funded. While the Bulletproof Vest Partnership ental holdings1Total= 000>Program funding has been consistently authorized at $50 million per ental holdings1Total= 000>year, that amount gets whacked in half during the appropriations ental holdings1Total= 000>process. Law enforcement agencies, however, clearly need our help to ental holdings1Total= 000>purchase vests--for the current fiscal year, the Bulletproof Vest ental holdings1Total= 000>Partnership office received funding requests from small jurisdictions, ental holdings1Total= 000>with populations under 100,000, totaling $59 million--more than double ental holdings1Total= 000>the funds appropriated. The authorizing legislation requires that ental holdings1Total= 000>smaller jurisdictions receive priority funding through this program. ental holdings1Total= 000>Those requests consumed the entire amount of funds available and for ental holdings1Total= 000>the first time ever awards could only be made to small jurisdictions.ental holdings1Total= 000>  We know that body armor saves lives, but the cost has put these vests ental holdings1Total= 000>out of the reach of many of the officers who need them. This program ental holdings1Total= 000>makes it more affordable for police departments of all sizes. Few ental holdings1Total= 000>things mean more to me than when I meet Vermont police officers and ental holdings1Total= 000>they tell me that the protective vests they wear were made possible ental holdings1Total= 000>because of this program. This is the least we should do for the ental holdings1Total= 000>officers on the front lines who put themselves in danger for us every ental holdings1Total= 000>day. I want to make sure that every police officer who needs a ental holdings1Total= 000>bulletproof vest gets one.ental holdings1Total= 000>  I look forward to Senate passage today of the bipartisan Bulletproof ental holdings1Total= 000>Vest Partnership Grant Act, and I hope the House and the President will ental holdings1Total= 000>promptly act on this lifesaving legislation to help better to protect ental holdings1Total= 000>our law enforcement officers.ental holdings1Total= 000>
