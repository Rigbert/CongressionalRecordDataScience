 President, I rise today to commend the U.S. Customs Service and the Departments of Treasury and Justice for one of the most important victories they have had in the war on drugs to date.  I would like to thank Attorney General Janet Reno, Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin, and Undersecretary of the Treasury for Law Enforcement Ray Kelly for their leadership in this important endeavor and the two hundred U.S. Customs agents, who put their lives at stake, diligently and tirelessly for thirty months, to establish this necessary beachhead in the war on drugs. It is a testament to the dedication and the ability of our law enforcement personnel that they were able to complete this difficult and dangerous operation.  On Monday, May 18, Secretary Rubin and Attorney General Reno announced the arrests of 112 people involved in illegal drug money-laundering in Mexico, which resulted in the seizure of an anticipated $157 million in over 100 accounts in the United States, the Caribbean and Europe. Furthermore, 4 tons of marijuana and 2 tons of cocaine were seized during this 30-month undercover investigation. The indictments include officials from 12 of Mexico's 19 largest banks, who stand accused of knowingly abetting drug traffickers to launder hundreds of millions of dollars.  As a result of this investigation, for the first time ever, Mexican banks have been directly linked to money laundering and have been indicted as institutions due to their complicity in money-laundering, the significant number of employees involved, the large number of illegal transactions, and the institution-wide profiting from these illegal transfers, which brought a 4-5% fee per transfer. Bancomer, Mexico's second largest bank, Banca Serfin, Mexico's third-largest bank, and Confia, also among the top twenty, were the three banks involved.  This investigation, known as ``Operation Casablanca'', involved two hundred undercover Customs agents, targeting the Cali cocaine and heroine syndicate in Colombia, the Juarez cartel in Mexico, and the involvement of Mexican banks. Two hundred individuals face arrest warrants as the investigations continue, including warrants issued for the Juarez cartel money manager, Victor Alcala Navarro and one of its leaders, Jose Alvarez Tostado.  I would also like to show my support for the Federal Reserve's issuance of ``cease and desist'' orders suspending the U.S. operations of Banca Serfin, Bancomer, Banamex, Bital of Mexico and Banco Santander of Spain, because of ``serious deficiencies in their anti-money laundering programs.'' These banks must institute new and tougher controls to resume business in the United States.  Despite Mexico's lax enforcement of its own money-laundering statutes, it is good to see that the United States is not afraid to use its own resources to address this serious problem.  I hope that operations like these will continue to bleed the powerful drug cartels. The American and the international drug war has benefited from this peek into the intricacies of drug-related money laundering.  However, Mr. President, I cannot help but see this latest good news in relation to my concerns about Mexico's insufficient counternarcotics cooperation with the United States. The Mexican government was not informed of this 3-year, extensive investigationuntil the same morning the press was. Why not? It would seem that this would have been a perfect opportunity to engage in a cooperative law enforcement effort.  The Administration's certification of Mexico for its counternarcotics cooperation in March certainly suggests that a major investigation like ``Operation Casablanca'' would have been a joint effort. However, the reality is that distrust between U.S. and Mexican law enforcement has strained relations and hurt earlier cooperative efforts.  Undersecretary Ray Kelly, who has been nominated to be the chief of the Customs Service, answered this question in an article of The Washington Post on May 19th. The Mexican authorities were not informed, ``Because of fear of compromising the operation and placing the lives of U.S. agents in danger.''  Since the announcement of the indictments this week, the Mexican government has made statements in support of this operation, and the Mexican Attorney General indicated that his office will investigate these banks as well.  I just hope that this will result in tougher Mexican laws against drug traffickers and money-launderers and progress toward real cooperation to halt the flow of drugs across our borders, rather than the erratic and insufficient cooperation that we have seen until now. Let the Mexican government take this opportunity to prove their commitment to fighting the spread and profit of drugs. Let this be the start of a new concerted and cooperative effort to rid our countries of this menace.                          ____________________
