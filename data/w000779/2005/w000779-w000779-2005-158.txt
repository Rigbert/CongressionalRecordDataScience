President, Oregon's 363 miles of coastline are extremely susceptible to tsunamis. Just 2 weeks ago, at 7:40 p.m. on June 14, 2005, the tsunami threat became reality for those living on or visiting the coast. A 7.0 earthquake off the coast of California triggered an automatic tsunami warning for the entire west coast of the United States. The emergency response capabilities of these communities were put to the test. Fortunately, the warning was called off at 9:09 p.m. after it was determined that the earthquake failed to produce a tsunami.  Looking back, a lot of things went right. In Oregon, in cities such as Seaside and Cannon Beach, the alarms were sounded and people evacuated. However, there is a lot more that needs to be done. Models indicate that should an offshore earthquake trigger a tsunami, coastal towns will only have between 12 and 30 minutes before the first wave hits the beach. On June 14, for many people on the coast, the information would have come too late.  I am pleased that the Tsunami Preparedness Act, S. 50, of which I am a consponsor and strong supporter, will pass the Senate by unanimous consent today. The world has recently seen how potentially devastating a tsunami can be. America needs to take steps to prepare and be ready. Oregonians are acutely aware that, at some point, a tsunami could hit the coast of the United States. This bill will give our coastal communities opportunities that weren't afforded the victims of the tragic tsunami in Southeast Asia last year. It will harness the brains and expertise of universities, like Oregon State University and Oregon Health and Science University, to improve our tsunami detection and warning system and to make available the resources necessary to adequately prepare, inform, and protect U.S. citizens.  The U.S. has the tools to establish a top-notch national tsunami warning system and hazard mitigation program. Oregon universities are leading the way in tsunami research, and the practical applications of this research must be used. Our region, and the other vulnerable areas in the Nation, will benefit from better knowledge about the tracking, forecasting, and effects of tsunami waves. I look forward to the implementation of the Tsunami Preparedness Act and to reviewing the first annual report to Congress on the status and progress of work on this issue.  The committee amendment was agreed to.                           Amendment No. 1101                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)  The amendment (No. 1101) was agreed to.  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of Amendments.'')  The bill (S. 50), as amended, was read the third time, and passed.                          ____________________[Pages S7930-S7936]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                        TSUNAMI PREPAREDNESS ACT  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill (S. 50) to authorize and strengthen the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's tsunami detection, forecast, warning, and mitigation program, and for other purposes, which had been reported from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, with an amendment.  (Strike the part shown in black brackets and insert the part shown in italic.)                                 S. 50       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     [SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       [This Act may be cited as the ``Tsunami Preparedness Act''.     [SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       [(a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:       [(1) Tsunami are a series of large waves of long wavelength      created by the displacement of water by violent undersea      disturbances such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions,      landslides, explosions, and the impact of cosmic bodies.       [(2) Tsunami have caused, and can cause in the future,      enormous loss of human life, injury, destruction of property,      and economic and social disruption in coastal and island      communities.       [(3) While 85 percent of tsunami occur in the Pacific      Ocean, and coastal and island communities in this region are      the most vulnerable to the destructive results, tsunami can      occur at any point in any ocean or related body of water      where there are earthquakes, volcanoes, or any other activity      that displaces a large volume of water.       [(4) A number of States and territories are subject to the      threat of tsunamis, including Alaska, California, Hawaii,      Oregon, Washington, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the      Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S.      Virgin Islands.       [(5) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is      responsible for maintaining a tsunami detection and warning      system for the Nation, issuing warnings to United States      communities at risk from tsunami, and preparing those      communities to respond appropriately, through--       [(A) the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Ewa Beach,      Hawaii, which serves as a warning center for Hawaii, all      other United States assets in the Pacific, and Puerto Rico;       [(B) the Alaska/West Coast Tsunami Warning Center in      Palmer, Alaska, which is responsible for issuing warnings for      Alaska, British Columbia, California, Oregon, and Washington;       [(C) the Federal-State national tsunami hazard mitigation      program;       [(D) a tsunami research and assessment program, including      programs conducted by the Pacific Marine Environmental      Laboratory;       [(E) the TsunamiReady Program, which educates and prepares      communities for survival before and during a tsunami; and       [(F) other related programs.       [(6) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration      also represents the United States as a member of the      International Coordination Group for the Tsunami Warning      System in the Pacific, administered by the Intergovernmental      Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO, for which the Pacific      Tsunami Warning Center acts as the operational center and      shares seismic and water level information with 26 member      states, and maintains UNESCO's International Tsunami      Information Center, in Honolulu, Hawaii, which provides      technical and educational assistance to member states.       [(7) The Tsunami Warning Centers receive seismographic      information from the Global Seismic Network, an international      system of earthquake monitoring stations, from the United      States Geological Survey National Earthquake Information      Center, and from cooperative regional seismic networks, and      use these data to issue tsunami warnings and integrate the      information with data from their own tidal and deep ocean      monitoring stations, to cancel or verify the existence of a      damaging tsunami. Warnings are disseminated by the National      Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to State emergency      operation centers.       [(8) Current gaps in the International Tsunami Warning      System, such as the lack of regional warning systems in the      Indian Ocean, the southwest Pacific Ocean, Central and South      America, the Mediterranean Sea, and Caribbean, pose risks for      coastal and island communities.       [(9) The tragic and extreme loss of life experienced by      countries in the Indian Ocean following the magnitude 9.0      earthquake and resulting tsunami in that region on December      26, 2004, illustrates the destructive consequences which can      occur in the absence of an effective tsunami warning and      notification system.       [(10) An effective tsunami warning and notification system      is part of a multi-hazard disaster warning and preparedness      program and requires near real-time seismic, sea level, and      oceanographic data, high-speed data analysis capabilities, a      high-speed tsunami warning communication system, a sustained      program of education and risk assessment, and an established      local communications infrastructure for timely and effective      dissemination of warnings to activate evacuation of tsunami      hazard zones.       [(11) The Tsunami Warning System for the Pacific is a model      for other regions of the world to adopt, and can be expanded      and modernized to increase detection, forecast, and      warning capabilities for vulnerable states and      territories, reduce the incidence of costly false alarms,      improve reliability of measurement and assessment      technology, and increase community preparedness.       [(12) Tsunami warning and preparedness capability can be      developed in other vulnerable areas of the world, such as the      Indian Ocean, by identifying tsunami hazard zones, educating      populations, developing alert and notification communications      infrastructure, and by deploying near real-time tsunami      detection sensors and gauges, establishing hazard      communication and warning networks, expanding global      monitoring of seismic activity, encouraging the increased      exchange of seismic and tidal data between nations, and      improving international coordination when a tsunami is      detected.       [(13) UNESCO has recognized the need to establish tsunami      warning systems for regions beyond the Pacific Basin that are      vulnerable to tsunams, including the Indian Ocean, and has      convened a working group to lead an effort to expand the      International Tsunami Warning System in the Pacific to such      vulnerable regions.       [(14) The international community and all vulnerable      nations should take coordinated efforts to establish and      participate in regional tsunami warning systems and other      hazard warnings systems developed to meet the goals of the      United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction.       [(b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--       [(1) to improve tsunami detection, forecast, warnings,      notification, preparedness, and mitigation in order to      protect life and property both in the United States and      elsewhere in the world;       [(2) to improve and modernize the existing Pacific Tsunami      Warning System to increase coverage, reduce false alarms and      increase accuracy of forecasts and warnings, and expand      detection and warning systems to include other vulnerable      States and United States territories, including the      Caribbean/Atlantic/Gulf region;       [(3) to increase and accelerate mapping, modeling,      research, assessment, education, and outreach efforts in      order to improve forecasting, preparedness, mitigation,      response, and recovery of tsunami and related coastal      hazards;       [(4) to provide technical and other assistance to speed      international efforts to establish regional tsunami warning      systems in vulnerable areas worldwide, including the Indian      Ocean; and       [(5) to improve Federal, State, and international      coordination for tsunami and other coastal hazard warnings      and preparedness.     [SEC. 3. TSUNAMI DETECTION AND WARNING SYSTEM.       [(a) In General.--The Administrator of the National Oceanic      and Atmospheric Administration shall operate regional tsunami      detection and warning systems for the Pacific Ocean region      and for the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico      region that will provide maximum detection capability for      United States coastal tsunami.

(11) The Tsunami Warning System for the Pacific is a model      for other regions of the world to adopt, and can be expanded      and modernized to increase detection, forecast, and warning      capabilities for vulnerable states and territories, reduce      the incidence of costly false alarms, improve reliability of      measurement and assessment technology, and increase community      preparedness.       (12) Tsunami warning and preparedness capability can be      developed in other vulnerable areas of the world, such as the      Indian Ocean, by identifying tsunami hazard zones, educating      populations, developing alert and notification communications      infrastructure, and by deploying near real-time tsunami      detection sensors and gauges, establishing hazard      communication and warning networks, expanding global      monitoring of seismic activity, encouraging the increased      exchange of seismic and tidal data between nations, and      improving international coordination when a tsunami is      detected.       (13) UNESCO has recognized the need to establish tsunami      warning systems for regions beyond the Pacific Basin that are      vulnerable to tsunami, including the Indian Ocean, and has      convened a working group to lead an effort to expand the      International Tsunami Warning System in the Pacific to such      vulnerable regions.       (14) The international community and all vulnerable nations      should take coordinated efforts to establish and participate      in regional tsunami warning systems and other hazard warnings      systems developed to meet the goals of the United Nations      International Strategy for Disaster Reduction.       (15) On February 16, 2005, the United States, together with      53 other Nations participating in the Third Earth Observation      Summit in Brussels, Belgium, adopted a 10-year implementation      plan as the basis for establishing the Global Earth      Observation System of Systems.       (16) The Global Earth Observation System of Systems will      consist of existing and future earth observation systems,      including the United States tsunami detection and warning      system.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to improve tsunami detection, forecast, warnings,      notification, preparedness, and mitigation in order to      protect life and property both in the United States and      elsewhere in the world;       (2) to improve and modernize the existing Pacific Tsunami      Warning System to increase coverage, reduce false alarms and      increase accuracy of forecasts and warnings, and expand      detection and warning systems to include other vulnerable      States and United States territories, including the      Caribbean/Atlantic/Gulf region;       (3) to increase and accelerate mapping, modeling, research,      assessment, education, and outreach efforts in order to      improve forecasting, preparedness, mitigation, response, and      recovery of tsunami and related coastal hazards;       (4) to provide technical and other assistance to speed      international efforts to establish regional tsunami warning      systems in vulnerable areas worldwide, including the Indian      Ocean; and       (5) to improve Federal, State, and international      coordination for tsunami and other coastal hazard warnings      and preparedness.
