 I also want to say that, yes, I have seen his comments. I think they have been positive. I think the gentleman has just gone through a list on places where we can, perhaps, find common ground. What we need, of course, is a vehicle, hopefully on this floor in the very near future, in which to find common ground and also to offer alternatives that each of our parties or individuals in this House think will, in fact, grow the economy and create jobs. I think that would be very useful.  The President indicated in his speech a sense of urgency that the American people feel. They gave us that message very loud and clear. I think all of us share that message. To think about somebody being unemployed for 3 months or 6 months or 18 months or 2 years, not want to, and have the ability to work and can't find a job is a crisis, is in fact a depression in that person's life--not only psychologically but actually.  So I would urge the gentleman to bring something to the floor as soon as possible that incorporates that on which we can agree and gives us an opportunity to offer solutions that, perhaps, the House will agree on. And if not, we won't agree.  I also welcome the gentleman's rejection of the philosophy of ``my way or the highway.'' We welcome that recognition, that, in fact, we have to reach compromise if we're going to move this country forward.  If I might in closing, let me, perhaps, ask you about the schedule longer term than next week.                              {time}  1350  Obviously, we have a special committee. I think the gentleman and I are both committed to--I know I am committed to--the success of that committee. I think it is absolutely critical to give our business community confidence, to give our people confidence, and to give the international community confidence that this government can, in fact, work and can address very serious problems--in this case, the debt and deficit--but also confront the problem of growing our economy. As both the Bowles-Simpson Commission and the Rivlin-Domenici Commission said, we ought to address both. That's what the jobs bill is about, and that's what the special committee is about.  Does the gentleman have any thoughts in terms of the probability of the schedule that you have issued that indicates that we'll get out on December 8? As we know, the committee has to be voted on by December 23. That doesn't mean we have to wait until the 23rd, assuming the committee comes out with a positive report.  Could you elaborate somewhat on what you see the schedule to be and the certainty with which Members can plan based upon the schedule that has been issued given what faces us?
