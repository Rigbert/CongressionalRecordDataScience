 The Senator is right. It's like going to someone and saying: By the way, we are going to demand that you be self-sufficient within the next 2 weeks or 2 years. By the way, we are going to give you half of what you need to be self-sufficient. And now you have to promise me you are going to be self-sufficient.  I know darned well I can't get self-sufficient based on what I have to operate with. But what do I do? What has been done--and this is the lie of it, in effect--what has been done too long, they say: OK, don't shut us down now. We will be self-sufficient--hoping that something happens in the next year and the year after and the year after.  So my friend is exactly right. He made a believer out of me. He's absolutely right. That is what I mean by let's not do that anymore, let's shut it down or whatever we want to do.  Mr. McCAIN. I would be glad to yield an additional 2 minutes to the Senator from Delaware if he wants.
