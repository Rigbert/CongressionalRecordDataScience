Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Istook), the chair of our subcommittee, for the leadership he has shown on this bill. I want to thank our staff, particularly our staff director, Ms. Michelle Mrdeza, Jeff Ashford, Kurt Dodd, Walter Hearne, Tammy Hughes and Randy Cogga, who is a detailee working with us. I also want to thank my own staff, Mike Malone and Scott Nance, who have done an outstanding job. I also want to thank Chairman Young for his assistance, and Ranking Member Obey for providing an allocation that is workable. And I want to thank Chairman Istook, as I said earlier, for working with us.  Although we disagree on some of the funding levels and provisions included in this bill, our views have generally been incorporated in the bill.
