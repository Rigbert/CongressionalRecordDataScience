Created by The Times and BusINess magazine, induction into the Indiana Business and Industry Hall of Fame is determined by a panel of local civic and business leaders. While there were many deserving nominees, the individuals selected as the 2009 Indiana Business and Industry Hall of Fame inductees are: Calvin Bellamy, Don Burrell, Bruce Leetz, Cynthia Powers, and Burton Ruby. For their many contributions to the enhancement of Northwest Indiana, these honorees will be recognized at a ceremony taking place at the Radisson Hotel at Star Plaza in Merrillville, Indiana, on Thursday, March 12, 2009.  Cal Bellamy is the former president and chief executive officer of the former Bank Calumet, where he worked for an astonishing thirty-one years. Having served as Bank Calumet's CEO for twenty-four of those years, Cal made a lasting impression on the Northwest Indiana community through his immense dedication to many worthwhile causes. Now an attorney with Krieg DeVault LLC, where he specializes in financial planning, Cal has continued to champion the needs of his community. From working to improve schools to working to develop small businesses and affordable housing, Cal has led the charge toward bettering the quality of life in Northwest Indiana.  Don Burrell is the founder and President of Burrell Color Imaging in Crown Point, Indiana. Don, having gotten his start in the business world with a few hundred dollars he obtained from the sale of his car, truly understands what hard work and perseverance can attain. This is why a key aspect of his business strategy is to respect his employees and allow them to advance to their full potential. While his business has been very successful, it is Don's commitment to those most in need that is most commendable. Throughout the years, Don's staunch support for the Burrell Cancer Institute at Saint Anthony's Medical Center and the Saint Jude House women's and children's shelter has been truly remarkable.  Bruce Leetz joined North Coast Distributing in 1963 as a driver. By 1970, he was named president of the family owned business that has grown to become a multi-million-case distributor based out of Valparaiso, Indiana. Bruce's explanation for the success is the company culture, which is based on values that he has always lived by: passion, respect, integrity, commitment, and excelling, which he refers to as the PRICE of success. While other companies throughout Northwest Indiana have surely replicated this structure, it is the exemplary commitment to their community that set Bruce Leetz and North Coast Distributing apart. In 2008 alone, North Coast raised nearly $80,000 for Saint Jude Children's Research Hospital to help find a cure for childhood cancer.  Cynthia Powers is the owner of Century 21 Powers Realty, Inc. Well-respected and well-known for her success as a businesswoman in Northwest Indiana, she may be even more recognizable for her immeasurable contributions to her church and her community. As a cancer survivor, Cynthia truly understands the importance of faith, and her commitment to her church, First African Methodist Episcopal Church in Gary, can be seen in the more than twenty years she has led the youth choir. In the Northwest Indiana community, a more giving person could not be found. To name a few of her contributions, Cynthia has served as chairman and on the board of directors for the Lake Area United Way, and she has served on the board of directors for The Discovery Alliance, Tradewinds, and the Friends of Hospice of the Calumet Area.  Burton ``Bud'' Ruby, chairman of Jamar-Ruby, has spent over seventy years with the company founded by his father over ninety-three years ago. After learning the trade from the shop floor, Bud advanced in the ranks, eventually becoming president and chief executive officer in 1957. Today, at age 89, Bud remains chairman of the company, which now conducts business under the name Trans-Apparel Group. In addition to his success as a businessman, Bud knows a thing or two about serving his community; he is a World War II veteran. Locally, Bud has served the community through his service with several councils and foundations, including: the Duneland Health Council, where he serves as its chairman, and the Purdue University North Central Chancellor's Advisory Board and the Unity Foundation of LaPorte County, where he serves on each of their boards of directors. Additionally, he has been a member of Rotary International since 1939.  Madam Speaker, I ask you and my distinguished colleagues to join me in commending these outstanding leaders on their induction into the Indiana Business and Industry Hall of Fame. These individuals are most deserving of being named the class of 2009, and for their leadership and commitment to the Northwest Indiana community, each of the recipients is worthy of our respect and admiration.                          ____________________
