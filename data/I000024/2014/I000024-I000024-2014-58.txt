President, I wish to pay tribute to Army CPL Gary L. Moore. Corporal Moore died March 16, 2009 of injuries sustained when an improvised explosive device blew up next to his vehicle in Baghdad, Iraq.  Gary was born on January 18, 1984 in Del City, OK and graduated from Westmoore High School in Oklahoma City, OK in 2003. After graduation, he worked as a mall security guard before enlisting in the Army in January 2007.  Starting his career at Fort Leonard Wood, MO, Gary was reassigned to the 978th Military Police Company, 93rd Military Police Battalion in Fort Bliss, TX, where he deployed to Iraq in June 2008 to help provide training and oversight of the Iraqi police force.  BG David Phillips, the chief of the military police corps, praised Gary's unit for their service and accomplishments in Iraq. He said people in Baghdad are beginning to experience normal lives again because of the work of Moore and others. ``This past fall, when the elementary schools reopened, young girls were able to go to school,'' Phillips said.  Engaged to be married on November 14, 2009, his fiancee Randi Ivie said, ``He loved life. He wasn't a stranger to anyone. He always had a good smile and a strong handshake.''  Funeral services for Gary were held on March 24, 2009 and he was laid to rest with full military honors in Sunnylane Cemetery in Del City, OK.  At the funeral service, Sam Davison, the church's head pastor said ``Gary was 38 years younger than me, but he was one of my heroes. I'm proud of the service that he rendered. I'm proud of his bravery. I'm proud of Gary.''  Today we remember Army CPL Gary L. Moore, a young man who loved his family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                      Corporal Stephen S. Thompson  Mr. President, I would also like to remember the life and sacrifices of CPL Stephen S. Thompson who died on February 14, 2009 of injuries sustained from small arms fire in Baghdad, Iraq.  Stephen was born on July 14, 1985 in Tulsa, OK and was a 2004 graduate of Memorial High School in Tulsa, OK. After enlisting in the Army on June 27, 2006, he attended boot camp at Fort Sill, OK. He was then assigned to the 1st Battalion, 22nd Infantry Regiment, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, Fort Hood, TX. The unit had deployed to Iraq in March 2008 and was set to return home within weeks.  BG Ross Ridge, the deputy commander of Fort Sill, said Stephen ``constantly exuded enthusiasm'' and always sought more responsibility to lead men. To his fellow soldiers, he ``was an instant friend and confidante,'' the general said.  Corporal Thompson was buried at Floral Haven Cemetery, in Broken Arrow, OK. Army pallbearers from Fort Sill escorted his flag-draped coffin to the gravesite and an honor guard fired rifle volleys and a bugler played ``Taps.''  ``I am so proud of my son. Stephen became a man the day he joined. This young man changed overnight. I remember when I went to his graduation from boot camp, I couldn't hardly believe who the person that was standing in front of me,'' his father Philip Thompson said.  Stephen is survived by his mother Tresa, his father Philip, and two brothers, Austin and Christopher of Tulsa, OK.  I extend our deepest gratitude and condolences to Stephen's family and friends. He lived a life of love for his family and country. He will be remembered for his commitment to and belief in the greatness of our Nation. I am honored to pay tribute to this true American hero who volunteered to go into the fight and made the ultimate sacrifice for our protection and freedom.                          ____________________
