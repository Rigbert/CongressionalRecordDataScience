 President, I am for this amendment. There has been a little bit of blood that has been spilled on the floor here in the last couple of days, especially when the unanimous consent to vote at a certain time was obviated by our being pushed into a recess, a legitimate parliamentary move, but one that sort of violated the spirit of what everyone thought was going to happen.  I hope and I plead with the majority leader that when he moves to reconsider--and I will be with him; I will be for this under the following circumstance: as long as we all know it is going to be done and everyone is here. If the majority leader called for a motion to reconsider knowing that there were absences that would affect the outcome of this vote, I would, on a matter of procedure, change my vote to prevent that happening. I do not think that is the majority leader's intention, but I do not want to mislead anybody. I think this is so important that this has to be dealt with straight up, with all 100 Senators, unless they are ill, in the hospital and cannot make it, that every consideration should be given to every Senator to be able to vote.  I yield the floor.
