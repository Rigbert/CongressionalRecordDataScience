 President, a couple of days ago I stated that I had worked in early February to put together a bipartisan package with my colleague, Finance Committee Chairman Baucus, to address some time-sensitive matters that needed to be considered. So I find it surprising we are taking up a package this week that, as was last week's exercise, is still a partisan product belonging to the Senate Democratic leadership. We are not taking up the bipartisan package I put together with Finance Committee Chairman Baucus.
