 President, let me just say briefly that this is now a good bill. It will not keep citizens from exercising their rights to petition the Congress. We were able through bipartisan compromise to work out something which I think everybody can proudly vote for.  I particularly want to thank Melissa Patack of my staff, and Alison Carroll of Senator Lott's staff for the good work they have done on this and helping us get to this particular place.
