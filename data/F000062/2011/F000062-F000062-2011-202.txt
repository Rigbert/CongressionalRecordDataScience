 President, I rise today to introduce legislation to remove the encumbrances from land patents for a dam project that will never be built. This will enable the current owner of the land to sell or bequeath his land more easily.  Donald Smith and his family acquired two parcels of undeveloped public land in Madera County, California by patent of the United States in 1983 and 1987. These parcels, comprising 103.26 acres and 41.323 acres, respectively, are adjacent to U.S. Forest Service land.  In the early 1980s, the U.S. Government anticipated that a hydroelectric power project might someday be built in the vicinity, causing all or a portion of these lands to be inundated with water. Accordingly, when it issued the 1983 patent to Mr. Smith, the Bureau of Land Management included a ``flowage easement'', reserving the right of the government to flood the lands for a power dam. In the mid-1980s, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission determined that this reservation and others like it were ``non-essential'', and that no dam would be built. Accordingly, no easement was included in the 1987 patent, although some believe it was erroneously omitted.  Flowage easements constitute a cloud on the title to land, restricting its market value and the orderly disposition of his estate. Since FERC, and all potentially interested parties, including BLM, Southern California Edison and the U.S. Forest Service, have agreed that the easement in this instance serves no purpose, and no damwill be built, clear title should be restored. The Solicitor of the Department of the Interior has decided this requires an Act of Congress.  Mr. Smith is now a senior citizen, and seeks to assure that his heirs will not be burdened by this matter and will benefit from the full fair market value of these now-verdant and recreational lands. Through enactment of this simple bill, the Congress will finally affirm a decision made by FERC in 1986, and restore ``clean'' title for benefit of Mr. Smith, his heirs and assigns.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 524       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. TERMINATION OF HYDROPOWER RESERVATIONS.       (a) Termination of Reservation Relating to Bureau of Land      Management Patent Numbered CA 6313.--The reservation under      section 24 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 818) of the      Bureau of Land Management patent numbered CA 6313 and dated      May 13, 1983, to the approximately 103.26 acres of land now      owned by Donald L. Smith in Madera County, California, and      more particularly described as a portion of secs. 25, 26, 35,      and 36, T. 4 S., R. 24 E., Mount Diablo Meridian, is      terminated.       (b) Termination of Reservation Relating to Bureau of Land      Management Patent Numbered CA 19394.--To the extent that any      reservation of use for hydropower could be determined to have      been omitted under section 24 of the Federal Power Act (16      U.S.C. 818) from the Bureau of Land Management patent      numbered CA 19394 and dated September 25, 1987, to the      approximately 41.323 acres of land conveyed to Lindsay Smith,      Peggy L. Birchim, Donald L. Smith, and Keith Smith, and more      particularly described as comprising a portion of secs. 25      and 36, unsurveyed T. 4 S., R. 24 E., Mount Diablo Meridian,      Jackass Mining District, Madera County, California, the      reservation is terminated.                                 ______                                       By
