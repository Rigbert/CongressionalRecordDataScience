President, I am shortly going to bring up an amendment on UNFPA. I know the distinguished Senator from Iowa was here waiting.  Mr. McCONNELL. Will my friend from Vermont yield, just for an observation? The Senator from Colorado is here. He has an amendment which I believe is acceptable. I wonder if we could go ahead and process that.
