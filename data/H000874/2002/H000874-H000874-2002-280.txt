Chairman, I yield myself 15 seconds.  Mr. Chairman, tarring with a broad brush is not worthy of this House. It has happened before, and it has demeaned the Constitution and the generosity of the Statue of Liberty that stands at her door.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Menendez).
