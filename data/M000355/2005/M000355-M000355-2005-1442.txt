 President, I assure the Senator from Missouri, I am also about through. Listening to Senator Schumer, maybe we have parameters of an understanding here. I think it was probably before the Senator from New York came on the floor, but I suggested that we couple an assurance that we have an up-or-down vote on the floor of the Senate for appellate court judges and Supreme Court Justices with a guaranteed expedited procedure in committee, guarantee that some of the legitimate grievances his party may have had toward the end of the Clinton years could not be committed again. All of this seems to me presents the possibility for an understanding that might settle this issue once and for all.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
