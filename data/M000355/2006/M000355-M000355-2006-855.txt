 President, I have one further observation on the measure which we just passed.  I again congratulate the Senator from Massachusetts and Chairman Enzi for this important piece of legislation. This has been a tough few years in coal country--in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and in Kentucky. As everyone knows, we just lost five miners last weekend. This legislation couldn't be more timely.  Again, I congratulate those on both sides of the aisle who made an important contribution to move this legislation out of the Senate and over to the House.                          ____________________
