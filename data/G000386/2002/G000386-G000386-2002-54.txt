 President, during the conference on the farm bill, the conferees threw out my bipartisan amendment on reasonable payment limits. I was extremely disappointedthe provision was dropped. Reasonable, legitimate payment limits were a top priority to Iowa's family farmers. It is important to the farmers of Iowa that we fix this shortcoming of the new farm bill.  American's recognize the importance of the family farmer to our Nation, and the need to provide any adequate safety net for family farmers. In recent years, however, assistance to farmers has come under increasing scrutiny.  Critics of farm payments have argued that the largest corporate farms reap most of the benefits of these payments. The reality is, 60 percent of the payments have gone to only 10 percent of our Nation's farmers.  What's more, the payments that have been designed to benefit small and medium-sized family famers have contributed to their own demise. Unlimited farm payments have placed upward pressure on land prices and have contributed to overproduction and lower commodity prices, driving many families off the farm.  The new farm bill fails to address the use of generic commodity certificates which allow large farming entities to circumvent payment limitations. The supposed ``reform'' in the farm bill is worthless due to the lack of generic certificate reform. In recent years, we have heard news reports about large corporate farms receiving millions of dollars in payments through the use of generic certificates. Generic certificates do not benefit family farmers but allow the largest farmers to receive unlimited payments.  Legitimate, reasonable payment limits are critical to family farmers in Iowa. I feel strongly the farm bill failed Iowa's farmers when it failed to effectively address the issue of payment limitations. Hopefully, the proposal I am introducing with Senator Enzi and Senator Hagel will help to restore public respectability for Federal farm assistance by targeting this assistance to those who need it the most, while providing the much needed disaster assistance for livestock producers.  This new proposal allow for a total of $35,000 for direct payments, $65,000 for counter-cyclinal payments, $150,000 for LDP/MLA payments, and $30,000 over the LDP limit for generic certificates.  This new proposal allows for a total of $35,000 for direct payments, $65,000 for counter-cyclical payments, $150,000 for LDP/MLA payments, and $30,000 over the LDP limit for generic certificates.  This new farm bill establishes an $80,000 limitation on direct payments, $130,000 on counter-cyclical payments, $150,000 on LDP/MLA payments, and no limitation on generic certificates.  The grand total for the new farm bill payments is $360,000 with unlimited payments through the use of generic certificates. The cumulative payment limit under the Enzi-Grassley legislation is $250,000 plus $30,000 for generic certificates.  There is no ``active participation'' requirement in this proposal, as compared to my farm bill payment limit proposal.  This legislation does not eliminate the three entity rule, but it does eliminate the need for multiple entities by allowing farmers who choose not to participate in multiple entities to participate at an equal level as those that choose to receive the same benefits from up to three entities.  This legislation finally establishes tangible transparency regarding the fourth payment that only the largest farming entities utilize. That payment is the generic commodity certificate payment.  While I believe generic certificates should be eliminated, I understand the importance in developing a fourth payment limitation so that my colleagues realize there is another payment. Currently, generic certificates are an endless stream of funding only limited by the maximum extent of commodity production by the entity receiving payments.  This legislation would help offset the cost of the much needed livestock disaster assistance and help small and medium-size producers nationwide who are tired of the Government subsidizing large farm entities which drive land rent expenses to unreasonable margins due to economics of scale.                          ____________________
