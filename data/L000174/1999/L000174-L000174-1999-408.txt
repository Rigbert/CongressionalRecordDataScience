President, on Wednesday of this week, I was fortunate to be present during the ceremony commemorating the presentation of the Congressional Gold Medal to Mrs. Rosa Parks. What an inspiring time. I heard Mrs. Parks, Reverend Jackson, and the President each take the occasion to remind us that the struggle for equality is not over.  I heard Jesse Norman, with that incomparable voice, sing to us both our National Anthem and really the anthem of the civil rights movement. Every one of us--black or white, old or young, man or woman, Republican or Democrat, were inspired by what we saw and heard. How could you not be inspired in the magnificent rotunda of the U.S. Capitol?  But then I went back to my office and I started asking myself, have we listened? I serve as the ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the committee still has pending before it, waiting, the nomination of another who has dedicated his life's work to the rights of others. I asked the Judiciary Committee on Thursday, in the spirit of the Congressional Gold Medal to Rosa Parks, and in the tradition of Rosa Parks, that the committee recognize the quiet dignity and strength of Bill Lann Lee and send his nomination to the full Senate so that the U.S. Senate may, at long last, vote on that nomination and, I hope, confirm this fine American to full rank as the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.  Bill Lann Lee is the first Asian American to be nominated to head the Civil Rights Division in its 42-year history. He is currently serving as Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, as he has for almost 18 months. He has done an impressive job in enforcing our Nation's civil rights laws. Mr. Lee was originally nominated in July of 1997, almost exactly 2 years ago. Two years is too long to have to wait for a vote by the Senate on this nomination. I hope the Senate will be allowed the opportunity to vote on his nomination before the Fourth of July recess.  Six former Assistant Attorneys General for Civil Rights, from the Eisenhower administration through the Bush administration, wrote the Judiciary Committee in November of 1997 in support of this outstanding nominee: Harold Tyler, Burke Marshall, Stephen J. Pollak, J. Stanley Pottinger, Drew Days, and John R. Dunne. Nonetheless, the Senate did not vote, and Mr. Lee had to be renominated again in January of 1998 and, again, in March of 1999.  It is past time to do the right thing, the honorable thing, and report this qualified nominee to the Senate so the Senate may fulfill its constitutional duty under the advise and consent clause and vote on this nomination. In deference to the advise and consent power of the Senate, the President has not used his recess appointment power in connection with this nomination.  After consultation with the Senate in late 1997, the President chose to renominate Mr. Lee in January 1998. The Attorney General named him Acting Assistant Attorney General. When the Senate refused all last year to consider the nomination--not to vote him up or down, or not to even vote at all--the President sent that nomination to the Senate for a third time in a third succeeding year, in 1999. Now, no one can fairly contend that the Senate has not been respected. The President has gone the extra mile, and Mr. Lee has shown extraordinary patience during this extended period of Senate indifference to his nomination.  Acting Assistant Attorney General Lee is properly serving while his nomination remains pending. It is the responsibility of the Senate to vote on that nomination. I believe that in a fair and open vote on the merits of this nomination on the Senate floor, the Senate will embrace the opportunity to confirm this fine person, this dedicated public servant. They will confirm him.  If I am wrong, if the Senate were to disappoint me and all those who support this nomination, and if a majority of the Senate were to vote against the nomination, and then he could not continue to serve as Acting Assistant Attorney General--that is a mechanism Congress established by law, but it properly relies on a vote by the U.S. Senate.  Civil rights is about human dignity and opportunity. Bill Lann Lee's nomination ought to have the opportunity for an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor. Twenty-three months and 3 sessions of Congress is too long for this nomination to have to wait. He should no longer be forced to ride in the ``back of the nominations bus,'' but be given the fair vote he deserves.  When Bill Lee appeared before our committee way back in 1997, he testified candidly about his views, his work and his values. He told us why he became a person who has dedicated his life to equal justice for all, specially when he talked about the treatment his parents received as immigrants. He told us how his parents faced prejudice almost every day here in this country. But Mr. Lee told us how, in spite of his father's personal treatment, the experience of prejudice he faced, the names he was called, and the slurs he had tohear, his father, William Lee, remained a fierce American patriot and volunteered to serve in the U.S. Army Air Corps in World War II.  He never lost his belief in America. His father, William Lee, inspired his son, Bill, just as Bill Lann Lee now inspires his own children and countless others across the land.  This is what he told us:       My father is my hero, but I confess that I found it      difficult for many years to appreciate his unflinching      patriotism in the face of daily indignities. In my youth, I      did not understand how he could remain so deeply grateful to      a country where he and my mother faced so much intolerance.      But I began to appreciate that the vision he had of being an      American was a vision so compelling that he could set aside      the momentary ugliness. He know that the basic American tenet      of equality of opportunity is the bedrock of our society.  I know that Bill Lann Lee has remained true to all that his father taught him and I hope that the ``momentary ugliness'' of people opposing his nomination based on an ideological litmus test, and of people distorting his achievements and beliefs, and of some succumbing to narrow partisanship, will not be his reward for a career of good works. Such treatment drives good people from public service and distorts the role of the Senate.  Bill Lee's skills, his experience, the compelling personal journey that he and his family have traveled, his commitment to full opportunity for all Americans--these qualities appeal to the best in us. Let us affirm the best in us. Let us confirm--or at least allow the Senate to vote on the confirmation--of this good man. We need Bill Lee's proven problem-solving abilities in these difficult times.  If the Senate is allowed to decide, I believe Bill Lann Lee will be confirmed and will move this country forward to a time when discrimination will subside and affirmative action is no longer needed; a time when each child--girl or boy, black or white, rich or poor, urban or rural, regardless of national or ethnic origin and regardless of sexual orientation or disability--shall have a fair and equal opportunity to live the American dream.  I have often referred to the Senate as acting at its best when it serves as the conscience of the Nation. In my 25 years I have seen it do that. Again I speak to the conscience of this body. I call on the Judiciary Committee of the Senate to bring this nomination to the floor. Let the Senate have an up-or-down vote on Bill Lann Lee without obstruction, without further delays, so the Senate may vote.  If we do, I am convinced that a majority of this body will confirm a fine person to lead the Civil Rights Division into the next century. Racial discrimination and harmful discrimination in all its forms remains one of the most vexing, unsolved problems in all of our society. In a country so blessed as ours, so rich, so powerful, so wonderful, we still have this cancer of discrimination that shows up randomly throughout our society. Let's not perpetuate it here in the Senate. Let the Senate move forward from the ceremony commemorating the Congressional Gold Medal for Rosa Parks by doing what is right, by voting on the nomination of Bill Lann Lee.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
