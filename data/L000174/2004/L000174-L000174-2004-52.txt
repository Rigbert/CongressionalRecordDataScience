President, yesterday, we passed an important bill granting enormous additional authority and tools to the government to fight terrorism. We authorized the creation of a vast information sharing network that will allow officials throughout the U.S. government to search databases containing extensive data about American citizens. We also gave broad authority to implement new technologies, standardize identification documents and enhance border security. These are great powers that, as the Commission noted, will have substantial implications for privacy and civil liberties.  This bill was also notable because it balanced this grant of power with the creation of a Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board. I thank Senator Lieberman for including this Board as part of the National Intelligence Reform Act, and for working with Senator Durbin, me and others to make sure the Board had the necessary authority, mandate and tools to ensure that civil liberties and privacy are safeguarded as we enhance our antiterrorism policies and tools.
