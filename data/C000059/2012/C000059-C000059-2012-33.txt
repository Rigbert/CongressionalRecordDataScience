Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to a dear friend of mine, Harry Eisen. Harry passed away on Thursday, July 19, 2012 in Norco, California. A Holocaust survivor and longtime businessman in Norco, he was a pillar of the community and will be deeply missed.  Harry was born in May 1917 in Izbica Kujawska, Poland, the son of Yechezkel and Mindel Eisen. His entrepreneurial spirit emerged at the age of 15, when he and a partner ran a meat production plant in Warsaw. He was conscripted as an officer in the Polish cavalry in September 1939 and served honorably as an officer, but was captured by the Nazis in World War II. He worked in a labor camp coal mine before his transfer to the Auschwitz death camp in 1942.  Harry's experiences as a prisoner at Auschwitz were nothing short of horrifying. Harry and his wife Hilda, a Jewish classmate hailing from the same village in Poland, seldom spoke of their imprisonment, but following the opening of the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. and the growing number of Holocaust deniers, they felt it was their duty to tell their story. Harry described the Holocaust as ``going through hell.'' Every day he saw men, women and children die of starvation and other atrocities committed by Nazi soldiers, and he marched with other prisoners through the woods with rags instead of shoes. Thankfully, he managed to escape as Nazis set fire to the camp in 1944, but not without a reminder of his time there: a tattoo of his prisoner number on his left arm.  After fleeing to the United States in 1948, the Eisens established themselves in Los Angeles despite being penniless and unable to speak English. Harry began working in a butcher shop to save money and purchased his first 100 chickens in Arcadia. He was often seen riding his bicycle around the city selling eggs. Eventually he outgrew the facility in Los Angeles and moved his wife and four children to Norco to establish Norco Egg Ranch, employing over 400 people and owning millions of chickens. It eventually became a major supplier of eggs in North America. Harry sold his business in 2000 to Land-o-Lakes, but continued to work as a consultant while managing his properties in California, Arizona, and Nevada.  According to his daughter Mary Cramer, Harry often said, ``There is no place like America.'' His strength in the face of adversity and his modesty serve as an inspiration to those who believe in the value of hard work and determination. Harry's incredible success from humble beginnings and overcoming the horrors of Nazi occupation is the personification of the American Dream. Harry is survived by his wife of over 60 years Hilda, four children, and eight grandchildren.  Harry will always be remembered for his incredible work ethic, generosity, contributions to the community and love of family. His dedication to his family, work and community is a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will continue. I extend my condolences to Harry's family and friends; although Harry may be gone, the light and goodness he brought to the world remain and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
