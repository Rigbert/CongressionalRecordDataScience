Mr. Speaker, I say to my friend and my brother, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Watt), I think it is so fitting and appropriate for him to be standing here as a representative of the great State of North Carolina because so much did take place in North Carolina, not just the sit-ins in Greensboro that got spread throughout the State and around the South, but a few months later in Raleigh, North Carolina, at Shaw University the founding of the Student Nonviolence Coordinating Committee, where many of the youngpeople gathered under the leadership of Martin Luther King, Jr., where we really did come together to learn more about the philosophy and the discipline of nonviolence.
