Speaker, 2 weeks ago the Republican majority leader, Dick Armey of Texas, was asked on one of the Sunday morning talk shows why the Republicans would not disclose to the American people what kind of cuts in Federal spending would come with the Republican Contract With America. The gentleman from Texas [Mr. Armey], who has a tendency to be very candid, to a fault at times, said he felt that the knees of the Members of Congress would buckle if they learned what kind of cuts are in store for us if we follow the Republican Contract With America. [[Page H376]]   Mr. Armey's candor was criticized by some of his fellow Republicans, but frankly I think he was right on the mark. My office has just completed an analysis of the Republican Contract With America and the impact which it will have on my home State of Illinois. I would like those from this State to listen, but from other States to consider there will be similar impacts on their own home State if the Republican Contract With America is in fact enacted.  We took a look at just four or five areas that I think are critically important. First is in the area of health services for children and seniors. To reach the necessary 30-percent cut in Federal spending required by the Republican contract, Medicare and Medicaid funding in Illinois and across the Nation would be slashed in Illinois by $27 billion over 7 years. What it means is that literally thousands of poor families in my home State now under Medicaid, the government health insurance program for poor people, would become uninsured, and it means that many hospitals, particularly smaller and rural hospitals, which are greatly dependent on Medicare patients, would be forced to close their doors.  I have spoken to some of the hospital administrators. What I have just said is not an exaggeration. A 30-percent cut in Medicare would hurt seniors, it would close hospital doors in many of our rural areas and in many of our inner city areas.  The second area of real concern to me is in the area of education. My home State of Illinois would take a big hit from the Republican Contract With America. Under this contract, programs for disadvantaged students would take a 30-percent cut. Some may ask why kind of program is that. It is a program like chapter I, a special tutorial program that takes a child about to drop out or fall behind and puts them through special training to catch up with the class and stay in school.  These programs work. In my county of Sangamon County, IL and downstate Illinois we would lose with the Republican Contract With America $900,000 a year in Federal aid to education. Madison County nearby would lose $1.9 million. It would mean school administrators would have to either eliminate or cut back the programs or ask for increases in local property taxes, something I am sure we all agree is not popular and something we would not want to encourage.  Take a look at highway construction. A lot of States and localities are used to the Federal Government building highways and building bridges and rebuilding and repairing them and think nothing of it.                              {time}  1550  If the Republican Contract With America goes through and we see a 30-percent cut, we will see a dramatic downturn in the amount of money available for Illinois and other States for highway construction. Mass transit is the same. In the city of Chicago, the Republican Contract With America will raise the fares for Chicago workers using mass transit every day 15 cents a day. You say, ``Well, 15 cents a day is not much, two people working in a household. Add it up and then put it against the supposed tax break the Republicans are offering. There is not much there to show for it.''  When it comes to nutrition services, we can expect cuts in the WIC program, a program which serves 40 percent of the infants in America, brings the mothers in during their pregnancy, gives them nutrition information and good guidance for a healthy baby, then brings the mother and baby in after birth and says here is the way to get that baby off on the right foot, with immunizations, good nutrition, a healthy baby, something I think every American wants to see.  The Republican Contract With America will cut that program, will basically eliminate mothers and infants from the program. It follows as night follows day.  The same thing is true for Meals on Wheels. How many senior citizens do we know whose only contact with the outside world is Meals on Wheels? It drops by once a day to say hello, how are you doing, how are you feeling, do you need a helping hand. Those start to go away with this Republican vision of a new America.  In my area of the world, a lot of our farmers depend on Federal spending, not just for their feed grains programs but also for soil and water conservation. These programs help farmers to avoid runoff which can contaminate our water supplies and lead to real problems downstream.  As the Republicans' Contract for America cuts back on this kind of spending, we are literally taking a gamble and a chance with our own health in the future.  These are but four or five examples of what happens in the State of Illinois. This story is repeated many times.  So when Members of the Republicans majority come to the floor and glibly tell us unfunded mandates and balanced-budget amendments do not mean much but a brighter future, ask them for the details.  Our knees are not going to buckle, but we deserve the facts.                          ____________________
