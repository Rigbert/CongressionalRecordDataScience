She was actually one of the lucky ones because she survived, but as you can see her left leg is gone and she uses a homemade crutch. This is what cluster munitions do to civilians. This happened after the war ended, and she stepped in the wrong place.  I first became concerned with this problem in the late 1980s, and in 1990 the first assistance from the Leahy War Victims Fund was provided to help victims of U.S. cluster bombs in Laos. Since then, the Leahy War Victims Fund, administered by USAID, has provided medical and related assistance for thousands of Laotians.  Also, as either chairman or ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, I have included funding each year above the amounts requested by successive administrations, Democratic and Republican, to support programs to locate and destroy unexploded ordnance in Laos. Since fiscal year 1995, the United States has contributed more than $100 million for UXO programs in Laos. There is $19.5 million for UXO clearance in fiscal year 2016, which has bipartisan support, including the current chair of our subcommittee, Senator Graham, and of the House subcommittee, Representative Granger, and the House ranking member, Representative Lowey. I appreciate their support for this.  But I have long felt that the United States should do more, and so I am very pleased that President Obama--the first American President to visit Laos--announced earlier today that the United States will increase its support for UXO programs in Laos.  The President pledged $90 million over the next 3 years to continue clearance, victims' assistance, and risk education programs at the fiscal year 2015 level of $15 million annually. The balance of $45 million is going to be used to support a national UXO survey. The survey is extremely important. As I said, Laos is about the size of Utah. The survey will establish a baseline for contaminated land that remains to be cleared so the Lao Government and international donors can plan their future clearance activities and accurately forecast how much time and money it will take to make Laos UXO impact-free.  Earlier this year, in anticipation of President Obama's trip to Laos, Tim Rieser from my office met twice with White House staff. They discussed ways to increase funding for UXO programs in Laos. I applaud President Obama for publicly recognizing that we have a responsibility to do more to end this tragic legacy by accelerating our efforts.  I will do all I can to ensure that Congress does its part to appropriate the funds, so that in the not too distant future all Laotians can walk in safety.  I think what President Obama is doing is similar to what President George H. W. Bush did, the first President Bush. Even though we had fought a war with Vietnam, even though it divided this country, after the war he decided we needed to do something to begin to reengage with Vietnam and to show our appreciation for those who had helped us with MIAs in Vietnam. He worked with Bobby Muller, Tim Rieser, me, and the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation and used the Leahy War Victims Fund there.  I visited it at the time and could see what a difference it can make. I look forward to going to Laos and seeing what a difference the Leahy Fund and our country's efforts will make there.                          Judicial Nominations  Mr. President, as most of us do in August, I traveled around my State. Vermont--the land area is only the second largest State in New England, which makes it not that large. I can travel all over it. I heard from Vermonters all around my home State about the issues that are important to them.  One thing I heard at almost every stop I made--whether it was for a Republican group, a Democratic group, or an Independent group, whatever their age, whatever they did for work, they said: What about the Supreme Court? Why has the Senate failed to act on the nomination of Chief Judge Merrick Garland?  I told them that the Senate is returning from the longest recess in nearly 50 years, and perhaps the Republican leadership was hoping that Americans had forgotten about the unprecedented obstruction of a Supreme Court nominee. But I can assure you that Americans--and certainly Vermonters--have not forgotten. They have not forgotten the fact that Senate Republicans have refused to hold a hearing for Chief Judge Garland, and they have not forgotten this unprecedented step in not allowing a hearing. They have not forgotten that some Senators still have not even afforded Chief Judge Garland the courtesy of a meeting. This means the Supreme Court continues to be hindered by the lack of a full bench of Justices.  Chief Judge Garland's nomination has been blocked by Republicans in the Senate for 174 days. Nearly half a year has passed since President Obama nominated Chief Judge Garland to the Supreme Court after Justice Scalia's untimely death--and Senate Republicans have done nothing about it. At no time in the history of our country has something like this been done.  I think the Senate should get to work and fulfill its constitutional duty of providing advice and consent on the nomination and then have the guts to vote either yes or no to ensure that we have a fully functioning Supreme Court. Instead of doing our job, we are voting ``maybe.'' Over the recess, the Majority Leader bragged that one of his ``proudest moments'' was when he unilaterally declared that he would not allow the Supreme Court vacancy to be filled by President Obama. Such cynical rhetoric is beyond disappointing. The partisan decision to refuse any sort of consideration of a highly qualified nominee such as Chief Judge Garland is an embarrassment. It is not an accomplishment of which the Senate can be proud.  We must all be reminded that this stubborn refusal to consider Chief Judge Garland has real world consequences that go beyond politics. The Republican obstruction of Chief Judge Garland has diminished the Supreme Court. It has impacted millions of families across the country. This summer when the Supreme Court completed its most recent term, the damage became clear. In seven separate cases, the eight remaining Justices could not serve as the final arbiter of law when they were unable to issue a final decision on the merits. In another case involving a death penalty appeal--a matter of life and death--the Court also deadlocked. Just last week, the Court deadlocked on consideration of an election lawcase that will impact the constitutional rights of millions of voters ahead of this year's election.  Notwithstanding that, Senate Republicans, who are in the majority, have taken this unprecedented step--the only time in the history of the country. For months, in poll after poll, two-thirds of the American people want a public hearing for Chief Judge Garland. They continue their blockade in the hope that their party's Presidential nominee wins in November. It is disappointing that they continue to hold our highest Court hostage in support of an intemperate political candidate who has demonstrated contempt for the rule of law and who has said that some judges aren't qualified because their forebears were Mexican.  The Republican nominee for president is a man who opposes the bedrock principle of freedom of the press. He is a man who attacked a Federal judge based on his race and heritage. He is a man who repeatedly attacked the gold star parents of a brave, selfless Army captain who was killed in Iraq while protecting his fellow soldiers. Despite these and several additional episodes demonstrating that the Republican nominee represents an unacceptable risk to our country, Senate Republicans continue to block Chief Judge Garland in the hope that their nominee is elected and can appoint judges.  The Republican obstruction and disregard for a coequal branch of government also extends to the lower Federal courts. Since taking over the majority last year, Senate Republican inaction has allowed judicial vacancies to more than double and to reach 90 vacancies. This amounts to more than 10% of the Federal bench. Vacancies have reached what the Congressional Research Service calls ``historically high'' levels. The American people are left waiting for justice as the number of vacant seats pile up. Yet the Republican leadership refuses to allow a vote on any of the 27 judicial nominees who are already pending on the Executive Calendar. These nominees are the result of the President working with home State Senators, Republicans and Democrats, to make a nomination. Each of these nominees was voted out of the Judiciary Committee with bipartisan support.  For example, the next Federal district court nominee ready for a vote is Edward Stanton from Tennessee. Mr. Stanton is the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Tennessee. He has the support of both of his Republican home state senators and was voice voted out of the Judiciary Committee. Yet this excellent nominee, who has been serving the people of Tennessee as one of the state's top Federal prosecutors, has been languishing on the floor since last October. I think both Senators from Tennessee will agree with me that there is no good reason why Mr. Stanton should have waited this long for an up-or-down vote.  In 2008, George W. Bush was President. He was in the last year of his term. Democrats controlled the Senate. I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee. All Senators, whether Republican or Democratic, actually worked together to fill these lower court vacancies. In September 2008, we confirmed 10 judicial nominees in 1 day. We actually did it in September. And not a single nominee was left on the Executive Calendar. Of those 10 nominees, nine had support from home state Republican Senators. I was proud to work with Senators Arlen Specter, Pat Roberts, Sam Brownback, John Warner, Mel Martinez, Wayne Allard, Bob Bennett, and Orrin Hatch to confirm nominees to fill vacancies in their states, and help ensure that the people of those states had access to justice in our Federal courts.  Today, 13 judicial nominees from States represented by 16 Republican Senators are ready for confirmation votes. These nominees have been waiting two, three, even 10 months for a simple vote. I hope that these 16 Republican Senators are able to impress upon their leadership just how important it is to allow the Senate to do its job and vote on these nominees who would serve their States. I despair somewhat because even though they are nominees from their States and are here with their approval, they are not getting their leadership to move forward, just as not a single Republican Senator has been able to get their Republican leadership to allow a hearing and a vote on Judge Garland.  I hope the Republican leadership will reconsider their outright refusal to allow a hearing and vote for Chief Judge Garland's nomination on the Supreme Court. This unprecedented, unwarranted stance has already undermined one term of the High Court, but there is still time to avoid harming another term.  It is good that we actually show up now and then in Washington to do our work. There is plenty of time to have a hearing and vote on Chief Judge Garland's nomination. It is time for the Senate to get back to work.  I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle will realize what they have done to the Supreme Court and will reverse this. It is able to be blocked only because all Republicans stood with their leader and blocked the Supreme Court nominee. I think that is wrong. It has never been done before. In fact, the last time there was a vacancy--I mention this for the young pages who are here. They will get a little history lesson, and it is something the Senators should know. The last time there was a vacancy in a Presidential election year, there was a Republican President and Democrats were in control of the Senate. We confirmed that nominee in the Presidential election year, and the vote was unanimous.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous consent that the time be equally divided.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). Without objection, it is so ordered.  The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
