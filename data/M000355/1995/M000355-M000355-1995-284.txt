 President, just for the information of our colleagues, there is now a great likelihood we will be able to have a vote at 6 on the Levin-McConnell compromise, and even though I do not have the unanimous-consent agreement in front of me to read yet, there is an excellent chance we will have a recorded vote very shortly.
