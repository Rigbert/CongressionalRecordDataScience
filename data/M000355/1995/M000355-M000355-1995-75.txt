 President, with regard to the Jordanian drawdown, the $100 million drawdown will allow the United States to keep its commitments to King Hussein to address legitimate security concerns of Jordan in a post-peace environment. The King's courageous decision to provide refuge to the Iraqi defectors only increases his security problems.  Moreover, this drawdown package demonstrates America's resolve to support those who support peace in that area of the world. We are at a very critical time in the peace process and it is important we maintain our credibility if we are to maintain our leadership role in brokering further peace agreements.  The drawdown is designed to address the immediate needs of the Jordanian Armed Forces primarily for border security. In the immediate post-peace treaty era with Israel, Jordan finds itself hard-pressed to prevent infiltration of its border with Israel by potential terrorists and smugglers. They desperately need to increase their capability to survey the border, especially at night.  I am well aware of the economic constraints our Nation faces as it fights a bulging deficit, which is precisely why the drawdown package is tailored so that it has a minimum impact upon our force readiness.  Mr. President, I will also say, while not typically being a spokesman for the administration, they are strongly in support of the Jordanian drawdown, as well.  I yield the floor.
