Thank you.  Madam Chairman, the legislation before us also leaves intact the anti-prostitution/sex tracking pledge, a policy designed to ensure that pimps and brothel owners don't become, via an NGO that supports such exploitation, U.S. government partners.  Last February, the U.S. Government Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld the prostitution pledge and said, in pertinent part, ``In this case, the government's objective is to eradicate HIV/AIDS. One of the means of accomplishing this objective is for the U.S. to speak out against legalizing prostitution in other countries.''  The Court of Appeals goes on to say, ``it would make little sense for the government to provide billions of dollars to encourage the reduction of HIV/AIDS behavioral risks, including prostitution and sex trafficking, and yet to engage as partners in this effort organizations that are neutral towards or even actively promote the same practices sought to be eradicated.''  Finally, we've come a long way, Madam Chairman, since 2003, when significant opposition materialized against an amendment that I had offered to ensure that faith-based providers, and others, are not excluded from participation. Worldwide, but especially in Africa, faith-based organizations are absolutely critical in the fight against AIDS. So, we welcome and are deeply grateful for their support and their work.  The conscience clause in H.R. 5501 restates, improves, and expands conscience protection in a way that ensures that organizations like the Catholic Relief Services, with its 250 plus projects in 52 countries, which has had a remarkable record on HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care, are not discriminated against or in any way precluded from receiving public funds.  Madam Chairman, this bill is carefully crafted, and again, I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for the enormous amount of work that has been poured into its creation.
