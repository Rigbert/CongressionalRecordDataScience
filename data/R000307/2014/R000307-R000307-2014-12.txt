President, I first congratulate my colleague Senator Isakson for doing a good job of summarizing exactly where we are and the problems we are experiencing with the complexity of the Affordable Care Act and the hope that the new Secretary will be responsive, as the Senator so eloquently pointed out when he questioned her when she came before the committee. I thank the Senator for making an excellent speech and making excellent points, and I will endeavor to do the same, as we are talking about the same subject.  My remarks are once again on the Affordable Care Act. I know we have other issues, many important issues--the Veterans' Administration, the release of terrorists in an exchange--but it is equally important we continue to shed light on the many failings of this law.  During the very first debate on the Affordable Care Act, I distinctly remember comparing this rush to government health care as akin to riding hell-for-leather into a box canyon to find the only alternative would be to turn around, ride back out, and get on a more realistic, market-oriented health reform trail.  Then I put it another way. I said: There are a lot of cactuses out there. We didn't have to sit on every one of them.  We never even saw the bill before we voted on it. I think everybody understands that. I voted no and so did every Republican Senator and Member of Congress. This was not a bipartisan effort.  I regret to say to my colleagues that I told you so, and here we are in a box canyon. Until the administration provides us more details to the contrary, we have to assume that more Americans are losing the care they liked,through cancellation notices, than they have enrolled in the exchanges. They are in a box canyon.  It is now estimated that ObamaCare will cost the Nation nearly $2 trillion and has created higher premiums, higher taxes, less choice, confusion, delays, and problem after problem. Unfortunately, the President and his allies in the Congress continue to protect this law, despite its toll on our economy, our patients, and our providers.  The President promised, as we all remember: We'll lower premiums for a typical family by $2,500 per year.  Valerie from Wichita, KS, wrote me a letter to share her story on this broken promise. She writes:       I wanted to let you know that I had to drop my company      health insurance due to the Affordable Care Act. My premium      before the Act was $250 a month and my employer paid $100 a      month toward the premium.       My insurance year expired April 1st and the new year is      under the ACA health insurance. The new plan is now much      higher at $565 a month and my employer can only afford to      pitch in $150 a month. I had to drop my plan due to      unaffordability. I could not pay the $415 a month.  The President also promised, highly publicized: ``If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan, period,'' and, ``If you like your doctor, you'll be able to keep your doctor.''  This law has significantly disrupted the individual health insurance market by imposing mandates and causing at least 5 million Americans to lose the insurance they had or have.  Doug, also from Wichita, wrote to share his personal story on this one. He said:       I am a small business owner who just got my family's health      insurance cancelled. I have talked it through with [the      insurance company] and at a minimum I will be paying 63% more      per month for coverage that has a deductible 3 times greater      than what I had and my doctor may or may not be in the      network.  Doug continues on to say:       The only topic that matters in Washington is stopping the      insanity of [ObamaCare].  Most important, the President promised, ``I will protect Medicare.'' This law cuts over $700 billion from Medicare to pay for ObamaCare. Part of those cuts come from the establishment, the establishment of an Independent Payment Advisory Board--what a wonderful acronym for this board--IPAB. This Board is supposed to be made up of 15 unelected bureaucrats who will decide which treatments in Medicare coverage should be taken away with regard to reimbursement. As I have stated on the Senate floor before, the IPAB has no accountability and their decisions are practically impossible to overturn.  The administration continues to give us piecemeal data on exchange enrollments, delays provisions of the law that they can't implement on time or simply wants to delay--a large serving of politics involved--and is providing exclusive waivers and special deals to unions and others from the yoke of ObamaCare.  In fact, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service confirmed that the administration has missed half of the mandated deadlines of this law. Most recently, press reports have indicated the government may be paying incorrect subsidies to more than 1 million Americans for their health care plans in the new Federal insurance exchanges, and they have so far been unable to fix the errors. Obviously, this poses a lot of problems for a lot of people.  Unfortunately, the President and his allies in Congress continue to protect this law despite its toll on our economy, patients, and providers.  A new Health and Human Services Secretary has been nominated, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, as Senator Isakson referred to, but with ObamaCare, nothing will alter. We are headed for socialized medicine. ObamaCare is the President's legacy. The President will unilaterally change what suits him best.  The hard-working taxpayers who are paying for this law, in large part from the 21 tax increases contained in it, have a right to some answers. That is right, I said 21 tax increases. Just some of these taxes include the following: the individual mandate tax, where people have to pay the government for not having insurance, even if they can't afford it; the employer mandate tax, where an employer pays a tax because they may have chosen to forgo providing insurance to their employees instead of having to lay off workers; the health insurance tax, which will be passed along to individuals in the form of higher premiums; the medical device tax.  I could go on and on. Many of these taxes have bipartisan support to be repealed, but we can't even get a vote on those.  With a $1.8 trillion pricetag, this bill is so far-reaching it is difficult to find a Federal agency that doesn't have a hand in this pot; from your doctor's office to your wallet, to your privacy. That is why I am introducing today a bill to require a special inspector general for monitoring the Affordable Care Act. We call it the SIGMA Act. It is the Special Inspector General for Monitoring the Affordable Health Care Act.  While all of the Federal agencies charged with implementing the Affordable Care Act have Offices of the Inspector General--and they do, they are all investigating this law in their own silo--where have we heard that before with a lot of problems within the Federal Government--the Health and Human Services inspector general isn't talking to the Treasury IG or the Department of Labor IG or the Homeland Security IG or any one of those with each other.  This bill would give appropriate authority to investigate and to audit any programs or activities related to this law across the many Federal departments, State exchanges, and private contractors.  The legislation will require a report to be submitted to Congress and the American people 6 months after enactment and quarterly reports for the duration of time the Affordable Care Act is on the books. They have broad authority to review all aspects of the law. Things such as the following:  Changes in the health insurance marketplace, the amount of folks who have seen their premiums and out-of-pocket costs increased, shrinking physician and other provider networks. We have a right to know that.  The employer mandate, its effect on worker hours, employers' hiring, and the number of businesses subjected to the penalty. We have a right to know that.  The healthcare.gov Web site, its security, functionality, and verification systems. We have read a lot about that, but we have a right to know.  Duties of the Internal Revenue Service, plans for calculating subsidy overpayments and underpayments, how they will notify these individuals and what their plans are for recapturing these overpayments.  Medicare cuts via the IPAB, they will provide an analysis of the impact on medical outcomes for our seniors as a result of these cuts. We should know that.  All of these questions could and should be answered by a special inspector general. The bill would equip the special IG with the same investigative and law enforcement authority as standing inspectors general, including subpoena and audit powers to compel responses from the administration.  President Obama has claimed that his--his--is ``the most transparent administration in history'' and that his administration is committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness in government. Given these statements, I think the President should embrace the idea of a special inspector general for his health care law. After all, we need to know the outcomes of the 41 changes he has already made to the law.  It would provide increased transparency so the general public has a better understanding about this law. It would protect taxpayer dollars, and by providing an independent analysis of this law, it will allow the administration and Congress to make more informed decisions and work together on how we move forward with reforms to our health care system. I believe we need to do everything possible to repeal and replace this law with real health care reform--reforms that lower costs and restore the all-important relationship between a patient and a doctor.  However, as long as this law is on the books, we need a watchdog or a special inspector general to investigate the implementation of this law and ensure that our scarce taxpayer dollars are being spent in an appropriate manner. I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in support of this bill in calling forincreased oversight of the affordable--or unaffordable--health care law.  Let's ride out of the box canyon. Let's get on a better health care reform trail, and on the way we certainly don't have to sit on every cactus that comes along.                                 ______                                       By
