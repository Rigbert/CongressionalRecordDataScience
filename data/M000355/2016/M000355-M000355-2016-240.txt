 President, we were saddened to learn last night that Shimon Peres, the ninth President of Israel, has passed away at the age of 93. He leaves behind a remarkable legacy of service on behalf of the people of Israel and a lengthy resume to match. The Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Gold Medal--Peres earned them all. In fact, I was honored to be a part of the ceremony to award him that Gold Medal just a few short years ago.  His political career is one that spans nearly seven decades and encompasses just about every high office imaginable: President, Prime Minister, peacemaker, revered statesman, and one of the last remaining connections to the founding of the modern State of Israel. This is how the world will remember Shimon Peres, but above all, we will remember him as the embodiment of a nation that the United States is privileged to call an ally and dear friend.  Our thoughts are with his family; with our friends, the people of Israel; and with the many others around the globe who mourn his passing today.                          ____________________
