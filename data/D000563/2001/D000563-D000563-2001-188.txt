 This legislation would require the Federal Government to operate passenger and carry-on baggage security checkpoints and screening operations in airports. The federalization of the screening process, and the Federal Government's role, will be accomplished by using FAA or U.S. DOT personnel, security personnel detailed by other Federal agencies, or by establishing a government or government-controlled corporation to screen carry-on baggage and the traveling public. Additionally, the FAA will have the authority under this Act to make changes and adjustments in screening policy to assure safety.  This legislation would require the FAA Administrator to immediately make arrangements with airport operators for armed, uniformed law enforcement personnel at passenger, carry-on baggage and employee security checkpoints. O'Hare and Lambert Airports have already posted such personnel at passenger and carry-on baggage checkpoints.  The Airline Passenger Safety Enhancement Act of 2001 also would require the FAA Administrator to conduct a comprehensive study to determine how best to organize the securityoperations at airports in cooperation with air carriers and local airports in order to secure the safety of passengers and workers. A report to Congress would be required no later than 30 days after the enactment of this legislation. This report would include recommendations for legislation to assure greater airport security.  I've heard from a number of Downstate Illinois airports that support stronger airport security procedures. However, these airports will be asked to shoulder a heavy financial burden. For example, the Central Illinois Regional Airport in Bloomington-Normal will likely need to spend as much as $30,000 per month for additional security measures. These funds are above and beyond what has been budgeted and could create a financial hardship for the airport. The Department should explore ways to help smaller airports by providing resources and technical assistance to upgrade security and enhance passenger safety. My legislation would provide for additional support to these small-to-medium size airports by providing them with added financial and technical support which would enhance, upgrade and improve security operations.  I am hopeful that these upgrades and improvements of a federalized security system can be paid for through an added fee of up to $1.00 per domestic flight segment.  While this concept generally appears to be supported by the airlines and by some in the Administration, I think it's important for Congress to act swiftly to codify these important changes.  In closing, together, we can craft common-sense solutions that protect passengers, secure our airports, and ensure that our aviation system is the safest in the world and I believe this legislation can make that happen.                                 ______                                       By
