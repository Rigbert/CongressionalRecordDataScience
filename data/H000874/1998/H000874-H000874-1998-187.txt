 Madam Speaker, I want to first of all respond to my chairman and my friend, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Livingston), as well as to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. McInnis).  The fact of the matter is that this administration did make a request that over $1 billion specifically be included in a $3.5 billion emergency request for Bosnia and for Y2K, so the representation that this administration did not address it is simply wrong. I hope it is wrong because of a lack of information, as opposed to an intent to mislead. I am sure the latter is not true. But it is nevertheless wrong. This administration has addressed this problem.  Now, as the private sector has experienced, the Federal Government has also experienced an emergency situation, an emergency that both in the public and private sector has grown exponentially, where the private sector, like the public sector, has experienced a growing scope of the problem and a growing expense to solving the problem.  There is no option to solving the problem, period. As has been said, no one wants to be on an airplane when FAA's computers decide that they cannot function because they have not contemplated the change of centuries.  I will tell the Members, Mr. Speaker, previous administrations and this administration have purchased a lot of information technology, as the private sector has purchased information technology, that does not contemplate the change of century. This is a great surprise to all of us, of course, that the century is changing.  But having said that, there is a reasonable explanation, of course. There was, in my opinion, a pennywise and pound-foolish, perhaps, judgment that was made in previous administrations, and as recently, perhaps, as this administration, which purchased technology which did not contemplate this change, knowing full well that there was absolutely no alternative but to solve this problem.  There is a lot of protestation on that side of the aisle, but in point of fact, the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Appropriations went to the Speaker and it was agreed, it was agreed between the Speaker and the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, to do exactly what this committee recommended, to do exactly what the Committee on National Security yesterday had recommended, and that the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murtha) talked about. That was to fund a solution to this emergency, unavoidable expenditure that confronts us.                              {time}  1130  And so the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Livingston), chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, in conversation with the Speaker, agreed to recommend this. And the Republicans and Democrats in the Committee on Appropriations voted these bills out.  But lo and behold, there are some who would say, no, this is not an emergency, we will wait; just like with the BESTEA bill, that we are going to fund this at a later date. Ways and means to be announced. Vote with us now on faith.  Madam Speaker, we ought not to do that. We ought to reject this rule and we ought to go back to the drawing board. And, frankly, the Speaker and the chairman of the committee ought to again come to their conference and say the responsible thing to do is to make sure that we solve this problem, that we confront it honestly and we do it now. Now, if at some point in time later we want to fund that, we can do it. Nothing precludes that. The only thing that we are doing now is delaying the decision. We should not do that.  Madam Speaker, I regret that. And I want to say that the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe), chairman of my subcommittee, and I agree on this. He believed this ought to be. I did not put it in. We do not have the votes on my subcommittee to put this in. It is 7-to-4 when we vote from a partisan standpoint and there was no dispute in the subcommittee, either from the seven Republicans or the four Democrats.  So I lament the fact that there has been some change because some Members of the Republican Conference felt this was not the way they wanted to proceed. That was not reflective of the Republican leadership of the Committee on Appropriations, nor for a period of time, at least, reflective of the Republican leadership of this House, including the Speaker.  Madam Speaker, I may speak at some greater length as well on this rule, because it is not just the Y2K problem that I think is unfortunate. And I want to say to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. McInnis), I do not think the Committee on Rules made this determination, and I understand that as well.  Not that he would have disagreed with the solution that was effected; I do not mean to imply that. But I understand this decision was made by the leadership and not per se by the Committee on Rules, although the Committee on Rules obviously implemented in its rule that decision. So I do not quarrel with the Committee on Rules. I want to make that clear. What I quarrel with is the decision having been made to retreat from responsibly and immediately confronting this emergency situation.  Madam Speaker, I may also at some future time talk about the rule itself. I think, unfortunately, the rule did not do some of the things I think it should have. Other Members will discuss that,and perhaps in concluding a couple of minute remarks I will discuss those items as well.  Mr. McINNIS. Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Tiahrt).  (
