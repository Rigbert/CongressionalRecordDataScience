MSSM was recently awarded an outstanding 13th-place ranking among more than 21,000 public high schools included in the 2013 U.S. News and World Report national rankings on school achievement. I would like to engage my fellow Senator from Maine in saluting this accomplishment, which makes us both proud.  This award recognizes that MSSM students achieve at the highest level academically. MSSM is a top-performing school on State-required assessments, and staff at the school use assessments throughout the academic year as a tool for improving and customizing instruction. The school's faculty works closely with students to forge a strong school community where students are encouraged to pursue their interests.  I applaud the students who are working hard to excel and in doing so, making their families, communities, and State proud. I also want to commend the administrators, teachers, and staff of MSSM who are succeeding in their mission to generate confidence and momentum for learning. They are making a difference in the lives of their students and are helping them reach their full potential as independent, responsible learners and engaged citizens.  I am pleased that the U.S. News and World Report has recognized the achievements of the Maine School of Science and Mathematics, and I congratulate the entire community for this outstanding achievement. Having grown up in Northern Maine, I could not be more proud of what these students and this faculty have achieved.
