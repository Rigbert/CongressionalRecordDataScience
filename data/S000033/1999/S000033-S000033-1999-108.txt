 Because once again we have got to deal with the reality that the wealthiest one-quarter of 1 percent of the population make 80 percent of the campaign contributions. Unless I would be very mistaken, and I do not think I am, when these guys kick in $50,000 or $100,000 or $1 million, and their corporate friends kick in huge sums of money to both political parties, maybe that is the reason that they are making those contributions.  After all, imagine just trying to live on a couple hundred million dollars a year when one can get a tax break and earn even more money. My guess is that when they go to these $50,000 a plate dinners, they are not sitting there saying, raise the minimum wage, that is why we contributed $50,000; expand the Pell Grants; provide health care to all people; cut the cost of pharmaceuticals so that ordinary folks can afford it.                              {time}  1830  My guess would be that people who contribute huge sums of money to the political parties are not quite so interested in the needs of the middle class and working families of this country but rather their own interests. And one of their own interests is to pay less and less and less in taxes, and that certainly has happened in recent years.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Well, certainly, then, we can expect that we will take up campaign finance reform soon here on the floor of the House.
