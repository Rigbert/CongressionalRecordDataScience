Mr. Chair, I rise today to speak to the provisions in the bill related to programs of the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration (NOAA) that address the monitoring and mapping of our Nation's coastlines. This function is an important function for the safety of navigation, environmental protection, and homeland security of the United States. There is little dispute that important commercial, military, and recreational activities are supported by this effort.  While important across the entire country, I want to address the specific needs of my State of Alaska. I understand that there is a concerted effort by NOAA to improve sea subsurface surveys. I fully support their efforts and applaud them for continuing this important work. The safety of navigation for our waterways is extremely important.  However, there is another dimension of survey that needs some attention also. Most of the shoreline in the Arctic along Alaska's northern and western coasts has not been mapped since 1960, if ever, and confidence in the shoreline depicted on the region's nautical charts is extremely low. Less than 10% of Alaska has contemporary shoreline data and less than 1% is mapped annually. There is also a disturbing lack of consistent elevation data.  The current state of shoreline mapping leaves those who ply Alaskan waters and depend on accurate shoreline mapping for their livelihood unnecessarily vulnerable. Due to Alaska's vast size and sparse population, the cost of acquiring traditional high-resolution topographic data and mapping thousands of miles of coastline is a daunting endeavor. Alaska has more than 44,000 miles of shoreline, which more than doubles the shoreline of the entire lower 48 states. Further, the emerging importance of the Arctic is adding to the need for updated shoreline charts. Increased economic development and shipping transits require that the most accurate data be collected and up to date charts be produced.  As a result, citizens and the State's economy are at risk. In addition to understanding sea-level rise impacts on fish and wildlife habitat, sea-level rise investigations are also important given that three quarters of Alaska's citizens live in coastal regions, which support 80% of the state's economic activity. Economic activity in Alaska's coastal zones includes world-renowned fish and shellfish industries as well as a burgeoning recreation and tourism industry.  Many approaches are available. Some techniques can be a painstaking undertaking due to cost and logistical challenges because of the vast area and distances involved. As a result the data collected within Alaska can be fairly limited in coverage. Another promising technology is the use of satellite remote sensing that can help assist current NOAA efforts. The complementary use of optical and radar satellites can add a new dimension to remote sensing applications. Within the State of Alaska there is an emerging capability using this approach that is cost effective and not dependent on weather conditions. This capability includes the ability to download data and provide the refined products needed to create the needed mapping quickly and cost effectively. I understand that NOAA regularly uses both government and commercial satellite imagery to support nautical charting in Alaska.  Regardless of the approach, I want to encourage NOAA to make a concerted effort to use funding received to reduce the backlog of outdated and uncharted shorelines in Alaska as quickly and cost effectively as possible in addition to continuing the important work of conducting the sea subsurface surveying. The economic and strategic importance of the Pacific Northwest region and the emerging Arctic require that this be done.                          ____________________
