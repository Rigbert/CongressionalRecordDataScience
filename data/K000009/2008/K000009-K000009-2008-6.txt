 My colleagues, a vote to reject this bill is not a vote to do nothing. I will vote ``no'' on the rule and on the bill because I want to vote to do something that really works. My ``no'' vote will be a call to not reward speculators, but first to bring in the regulators to do their job.  We should be using the regulatory powers of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the accounting powers of the Security and Exchange Commission to unseize credit lines to our banks. That is at the heart of the problem that we are facing. Let's do that first.  I would urge the leadership of this House to put a sense of Congress resolution attached to this agreement that does exactly that. Let us do that first. Let's wait a week. Let's see what happens. Let's see if those actions defuse the tension in the credit markets.  We must craft an alternative that will also provide help to our home owners facing foreclosure now. How can we reward Wall Street, who made bad decisions, but yet allow millions of our people to be thrown out of their homes by the first of the year?  Let's work on a bill that doesn't reward bad behavior but corrects the real problems inside this marketplace.  Let's unleash the power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Securities and Exchange Commission to use their authorities to unseize credit flows and mark mortgages to the true economic value of the assets. This will not cost the taxpayers a cent. It will restore rigor to the markets and use the market, as was done in the 1970's and 1980's successfully, to resolve troubled banks suffering under the weight of real estate foreclosures.
