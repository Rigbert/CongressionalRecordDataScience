Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's elaboration of what this bill does and what it does not do. I would say to the gentleman, I have a concern. As the gentleman knows, when someone who has been very much involved in the fire grant program, and focused on the fire service, not just as it relates to terrorism, but as it relates to safety in our neighborhoods and the safety of our firefighters and emergency medical response teams, am I correct that unlike the House-passed bill, we have now shifted from the fire administration, the fire grant program, into the Office of Domestic Preparedness?
