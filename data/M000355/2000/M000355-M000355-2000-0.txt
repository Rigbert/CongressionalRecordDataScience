 Torricelli, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr.         Allard, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Burns, and Mr.         Bennett):       S. 1. A bill to establish an Election Administration      Commission to study Federal, State, and local voting      procedures and election administration and provide grants to      modernize voting procedures and election administration, and      for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and      Administration.                          election reform act  Mr. McCONNELL Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Election Reform Act. As chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, I am pleased to be introducing along with Senators Torricelli, Feinstein, Allard, Smith, and Landrieu meaningful, bipartisan legislation to reform the administration of our nation's elections. As we move into the twenty-first century it is inexcusable that the world's most advanced democracy relies on voting systems designed shortly after the Second World War. The Election Reform Act will ensure that our nation's electoral process is brought up to twenty-first century standards.  By combining the Federal Election Commission's Election Clearinghouse and the Department of Defenses' Office of Voting Assistance, which facilitates voting by American civilians and servicemen overseas, into the Election Administration Commission, the bill will create one agency that can bring focused expertise to bear on the administration of elections. This Commission will consist of four Commissioners appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. It will continue to carry out the functions of the two entities that are being combined to create it. These include advising states on the requirements of the Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act, carrying out the Federal functions under the Uniformed and Overseas Voting Act, and servicing as a clearinghouse for information on federal elections and election administration.  In addition, the new Commission will engage in ongoing study and make periodic recommendations on the best practices relating to voting technology and ballot design as well as polling place accessibility. The Commission will also study and recommend ways to improve voter registration, verification of registration, and the maintenance and accuracy of voter rolls. This is of special urgency in view of the allegations surfacing in this election of hundreds of felons being listed on voting rolls and illegally voting, as reported last week in the Miami Herald, while other law abiding citizens who allegedly registered were not included on the voting rolls and were unable to vote. Such revelations from this year's elections coupled with the well-known report by ``60 Minutes'' of the prevalence of dead people and pets both registering and voting in past elections make clear the need for thoughtful study and recommendations to ensure that everyone who is legally entitled to vote is able to do so and that everyone who votes is legally entitled to do so--and does so only once. In addition to its studies and recommendations, the Commission will provide matching grants to states working to improve election administration.  I think it is important that this Commission be established as a permanent, ongoing body. Many issues of election administration, such as polling place accessibility and alternative voting methods require ongoing examination in view of ever-changing technology. A permanent Commission will be able to better facilitate timely information about new, cost-effective technologies that can improve election administration, such as technology to enable physically-challenged citizens to vote with the same degree of privacy and dignity enjoyed by other citizens. In this age of rapid technological innovation, continuous, ongoing assessment of the ways technology can improve election administration serves our nation's interest by ensuring that outmoded technology and procedures never again impede democracy in our great nation.  I am pleased to announce that Representative Tom Davis, along with Representatives Rothman and Kennedy, are introducing the House companion to our bill today. And finally, I would like to mention some of the citizens organizations that have announced their support for our bill. They include the Paralyzed Veterans of America, The Voting Integrity Project, The National Council on Disability, and the National Foundation for the Blind.  Mr TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators McConnell, Feinstein, Allard, Landrieu, Smith and Bennett to introduce the Election Reform Act of 2000, bipartisan legislation that seeks to modernize and improve the nation's election procedures. Although there is much about the aftermath of the November 7th elections upon which Americans can disagree, this much should be clear: the United States is a 21st century democracy with a 19th century election system. In order to maintain the legitimacy of our country's democratic institutions, we must have an election system that is fair and accurate.  The antiquated voting equipment used in most counties around the country is perhaps the most startling revelation from this year's election. Election Data Services reports that eighteen percent of Americans vote using technology that prevailed around the time Thomas Edison invented the lightbulb and nearly thirty-three percent of Americans vote by punching out unpredictable little chads, a system implemented during the Johnson administration. In a nation where people can confidently access the balance in their checking account on any street corner, it is unacceptable to have any less confidence in the exercise of the most fundamental of rights. Many states and localities continue to use outdated systems because of the cost of replacing them. Electronic voting machines with touch screens similar to bank ATMs, which are the most modern and accurate systems, cost about $5,000 each while replacing a punch-card system costs only about $225.  The inequity in quality of voting machines across the country raises fundamental questions of fairness and equal protection. Statistics from Florida demonstrate that those individuals who voted in areas with punch cards had a much higher chance that their vote would not register than those who voted with more modern equipment. For example, in Florida predominantly African-American neighborhoods lost many more presidential votes than other areas largely because of the inferiority of their voting machines. Thus, thousands of legally qualified voters were disenfranchised as a direct result of the financial resources of their community.  Therefore, in order to help improve and modernize the nation's election procedures, the Election Reform Act establishes a permanent, federal commission charged solely with the improvement of election administration. By combining the Federal ElectionCommission's Office of Election Administration (OEC) and the Department of Defenses' Office of Voting Assistance which facilitates voting by American civilians and servicemen overseas, into the Election Administration Commission, the bill will create one agency that can bring focused expertise to bear on the administration of elections. This Commission will engage in ongoing study and make periodic, recommendations on the best practices relating to voting technology and ballot design as well as polling place accessibility. The Commission will also study and recommend ways to improve voter registration, verification of registration, and the maintenance and accuracy of voter rolls. Finally, to help diminish the cost to states and localities of updating their election procedures, the Commission will provide at least $100 million a year in matching grants to states working to improve election administration.  There can never be a sense again that an election in the United States is settled on an arbitrary basis or that elections are an approximation. Constitutional guarantees of one person, one vote mean nothing in theory if they do not have any meaning in practice. So long as one voter, whether it be a senior citizen, an African-American, or one in service to their country has doubt about whether their vote was counted, our democracy suffers. That is an American, not a partisan problem. The challenge before Congress is to make sure that the legacy of this election is not the confusion that has reigned for the past five weeks but an enhancement of the legitimacy and credibility of our democratic processes.  Therefore, I look forward to working with the chairman of the Rules Committee as well as my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to see that this bipartisan legislation is the first priority of the 107th Congress. I am encouraged that both Vice-President Elect Cheney and Senator Joseph Lieberman have expressed their strong desire to make election reform legislation their immediate priority in the next administration and Congress. I am also pleased that Representatives Rothman, Davis, Kennedy, and Alcee Hastings are introducing the House companion of this legislation today. Their support along with the endorsements of the Voting Integrity Project, Paralyzed Veterans of America, the National Organization on Disability, and the National Foundation for the Blind gives me great confidence that this legislation will gather strong support progress quickly.
