President, today I am introducing legislation that speaks directly to the issue of fairness in public policy.  The Kansas natural gas industry operates on the slimmest of margins. It is still subject to the heavy regulatory ambitions of the Federal Government. It employs 24,000 individuals, operates in 89 of 105 Kansas counties, and in 1996 paid $132 million in mineral and property taxes in the State. Mr. President, the natural gas industry is a major industry, an important industry, and a beneficial industry to the citizens and local governments of Kansas. Unfortunately, as happens too often, a regulatory body of the Federal Government is about to cripple another valuable industry.  At issue is the failure of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to use discretionary authority and mitigate damages to the Kansas natural gas industry resulting from a retroactive and punitive order. Since 1974, first sellers of natural gas in Kansas have been allowed to recover the cost of a State ad valorem tax. First the Federal Power Commission and, later the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, held the Kansas ad valorem tax was eligible for recovery as a reimbursable tax under the Federal price ceilings established by the Federal Power Commission and later under section 110 of the Natural Gas Policy Act. In 1983, an interstate pipeline company petitioned the Commission to overturn treatment of the Kansas ad valorem tax as recoverable. In 1986 and 1987, the Commission responded to this petition by stating the Kansas tax clearly qualified as recoverable. In 1988 the D.C. Circuit court reviewed these prior rulings and, believing the Commission had failed to adequately explain its orders, remanded the issue to the Commission. In 1993, five years after the court remand, the Commission reversed 19 years of regulatory treatment of the Kansas ad valorem tax and ordered refunds retroactive to the year 1988 based on the date of the District of Columbia Circuit's remand order. Kansas gas producers paid the ordered refunds for the period after 1988, both principal and interest. Unfortunately, in 1996 the D.C. Circuit reversed the Commission's decision and required refunds back to 1983, based on the Federal Register notice of the 1983 interstate pipeline company's petition to the Commission. In essence, what had been legal for 19 years was retroactively declared illegal, to the serious financial detriment of not only the Kansas natural gas industry, but local and state government budgets that rely on this industry's economic base. The burden on the industry was made even heavier by the assessment of interest on the period 1983 to 1988.  Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to alleviate the unjust and punitive financial burden placed upon this Kansas industry by the Commission. This legislation does not address the legality of the Commission or the court rulings. The subject of this legislation, the interest penalty on the principal between the years 1983 to 1988 with such interest accumulated to the present, was never considered by the D.C. Circuit. This is an issue of equity and of the proper exercise of discretion and authority by the Commission in association with an order retroactively declaring a practice ruled legal for 19 years illegal.  While the industry and the State of Kansas still are in the process of assessing the cost of this Federal action, there is no question the cost will be huge and threatens to bankrupt many small producers. Relieving the industry of severe interest penalties is appropriate.  Congress entrusts oversight and administration of law to regulatory bodies. When that regulatory body fails to properly administer a law, or when it exercises authority in an egregious, inequitable manner inconsistent with congressional intent, Congress has theresponsibility to intervene. Notwithstanding the D.C. Circuit's decision in this case, the actions of the Commission are unacceptable. If ever a case demonstrated the need for oversight of administrative bodies and corrective action, this is the case.  The natural gas industry and the administrative bodies in Kansas government had every right to follow established regulatory guidance in treatment of the Kansas ad valorem tax. Indeed, since 1974, Kansas producers had been permitted to recover this tax. In 1978, with passage of the Natural Gas Policy Act, Congress explicitly used the term ad valorem tax in report language to clarify the intent of section 110. Further, upon another challenge in 1983, the Commission reaffirmed and ruled favorably on the Kansas ad valorem tax as recoverable several times. Clearly a precedent was established and, over a fourteen year period, not once did Kansas gas producers have any reason to suspect or question the Commission's rulings.  Mr. President, this is an issue of fairness, of equity, of this Congress' oversight responsibilities. Regulated industries have every right--indeed a responsibility--to follow and rely upon established Commission regulatory guidelines based on statutorily granted authority. I rise today to reaffirm the proper Federal-State relationship and a state's right to rely on regulatory decisions in establishing and administering the natural resource policies of the State.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1388       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States in Congress assembled, That the Natural Gas      Policy Act of 1978, as amended, is amended by adding the      following new section:       ``Sec. 603. In the event any refunds of any rates and      charges made, demanded, or received for reimbursement of      State ad valorem taxes in connection with the sale of natural      gas prior to 1989 are ordered to be made by the Commission,      the refunds shall be ordered to be made without interest or      penalty of any kind.''.                                 ______                                       By
