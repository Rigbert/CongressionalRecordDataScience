President, it is easy from our perch on Capitol Hill to sometimes forget about the city that surrounds us. Like so many communities across the country, urban and rural, Washington, D.C. wrestles with a population in poverty. Soon, those people will have a new advocate at the head of one of the Nation's capital's leading organizations focused on ending the cycle of poverty among local youth and adults. Starting in April, Patty Stonesifer will become the new C.E.O. and President of Martha's Table.  Patty devoted 9 years of her life to the work of the Gates Foundation. As its chief executive officer, she helped the foundation become the largest philanthropic institution in the world while taking no salary for herself. After her time at the Gates Foundation, Patty's passion for change led her to become part of the U.S. delegation to the United Nations General Assembly Special Sessions on AIDS, and was later appointed by President Obama in 2010 to chair the White House Council for Community Solutions. We have become friends through our shared service on the Smithsonian Board of Regents, and she is active on the board of the Center for Global Development, and is a member of the Circle of Allies and Champions for the National Council of Youth Leaders.  Patty's dedication to philanthropy aligns perfectly with the mission of Martha's Table. This nonprofit is more than a food pantry. Not only does Martha's Table supply more than 1,000 meals each day to hungry Washingtonians, it also works to develop long-term solutions to hunger and nutrition issues, seeking an end to poverty. Martha's Table helps to break the cycle of poverty by providing education, nutrition, and family support services to hundreds of children and families. Martha's Table is lucky to have someone like Patty at the helm. I have no doubt she will successfully prepare the next generation of young people for a bright future. Patty's self sacrifice and dedication to ending poverty and hunger in our Nation's Capital is to be commended, and I wish her the best of luck in her new role.  I ask unanimous consent that an article from The Washington Post entitled, ``Patty Stonesifer, former CEO of Gates Foundation, to lead D.C. food pantry,'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [The Washington Post, January 29, 2013]  Patty Stonesifer, Former CEO of Gates Foundation, To Lead D.C. Food                                  Pantry                           (By Steve Hendrix)       It took about six months after moving to Washington for      Patty Stonesifer to find her new job. As the former chief      executive of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, she had a      lot of corner-office options to sift through, including a      university presidency and the top jobs at a national charity      and an international development agency.       Her choice? She's going to run Martha's Table on 14th      Street NW. Starting April 1, she will take over the well-     regarded but decidedly local food pantry and family-services      nonprofit organization.       Stonesifer, 56, who oversaw the Gates Foundation endowment      of $39 billion and a staff of more than 500 for nine years,      will manage the D.C. charity's $6 million budget, 81 paid      employees, three vans and thrift shop.       Martha's Table plans an official announcement Wednesday.      But as word of Stonesifer's unexpected career move began to      circulate in recent days, it inspired twin reactions:      ``Wow!'' and ``Why?''       Overachievers usually work their way from small to big.      Having Stonesifer come run a small local charity is like      General Electric business titan Jack Welch showing up to      manage the corner appliance store, or one of the Super Bowl-     bound Harbaugh brothers deciding to coach high school      football.       ``If you just look at my resume, I find that I have to      explain this,'' Stonesifer said last     week at the temporary office she'd established at a Busboys      and Poets table across the street from her new home base. In      between a series of briefings from Martha's Table managers,      she tried to explain how a top-of-the-charts philanthropy pro      came to match fates with an ambitious local charity.       ``But if you know me, I don't have to explain it at all,''      she said. ``I absolutely think I can help Martha's Table, but      this is going to be wonderful for me.''       A shift in scale       Cathy Sulzberger, the head of the Martha's Table board of      directors, was in a taxicab last fall when she got a call      from the headhunter leading the board's search for a new      leader: A surprising--and exciting--candidate had applied.       ``Honestly, my first response was, `Is Patty Stonesifer      sure she wants this kind of job?' '' recalled Sulzberger.       Running the 33-year-old nonprofit group will certainly be a      shift in scale. Under Stonesifer, the Gates Foundation became      the largest philanthropic institution in the world. It has      set colossal, planet-shifting goals for itself: eradicating      polio and malaria, transforming American high schools, and      more.       Before that, Stonesifer was a senior vice president at      Microsoft responsible for developing MSNBC, Encarta and Slate      magazine (now owned by The Washington Post Co.).       More recently, President Obama asked her to chair his White      House Council for Community Solutions, and she has just      wrapped up a stint as chairman of the Smithsonian      Institution's Board of Regents. Stonesifer has appeared on      Time magazine's annual list of the 25 Most Influential      People. She is married to journalist and founding Slate      editor Michael Kinsley. She is a boldface name.       ``There is no phone call that Patty would make that      wouldn't be returned, none at all,'' said Diana Aviv,      president of Independent Sector, a Washington-based coalition      of nonprofit groups and foundations.       Soon after leaving the Gates Foundation in 2008, Stonesifer      and Kinsley began splitting their time between Seattle and      the District, where he used to live and where she has a      daughter from a previous marriage working at USAID. Last      year, Kinsley accepted an editor's job at the New Republic      magazine, and they decided to make the District their full-     time home.       Stonesifer has been wealthy since piling up tens of      millions in Microsoft stock in the company's early years.      (She also became a director at Amazon.com before it went      public and remains on that company's board.) But she retains      the modest bent of the Indiana Catholic who grew up with      eight siblings in a house where volunteerism was as regular      as making the bed. She took no salary while running the Gates      Foundation.       After the couple bought a restored brownstone near Dupont      Circle, Stonesifer began exploring Washington by foot and      Metro.       ``I was amazed at how there is a city within a city here,''      she said, reeling off the stats: 110,000 households live in      poverty, one in three households with children can't afford      enough food. ``This idea that the District has so much child      hunger, it's mind-boggling.''       Stonesifer decided she needed some time in the trenches.      Nothing would teach her, and her peers in the foundation      world, more about these intractable problems than confronting      them, year after year, in the faces of the people who suffer      them.       And then she saw the CEO-wanted ad for Martha's Table.       ``I decided to raise my hand,'' she said.       Her husband said he was surprised, at first.       ``I said, `Are you going to be adding the salt to the      soup?' '' Kinsley recalled, sitting with Stonesifer in their      living room after her coffee-shop meetings were over. The      walls were covered with paintings by Seattle artists, misty      mountain ranges and tulip fields. ``But I shouldn't have been      surprised. You said you wanted to do something hands-on.''       ``You didn't really believe me,'' she said. ``You thought I      should be a university head.''       ``Yes, run a college,'' he said, ``maybe the World Bank.''       ``It's nice to have a husband who thinks you can do      anything.'' She leaned over to pat his leg.       ``You'll get your turn at running Hewlett-Packard, I      assume,'' Kinsley said.       She shot him a look.       ``Joke! Joke!'' he said.       The right person       First she had to get this job.       ``Even if she comes from a major philanthropy and is so      well-known, we had to make sure we were hiring the right      person for Martha's Table,'' Sulzberger said of the long      vetting Stonesifer went through. ``This may be a smaller      stage, but it's not a small job for anybody.''       Martha's Table started in 1980 as a place for hungry      students to get an after-school sandwich. Its ``McKenna's      Wagon'' food vans have been mealtime fixtures at McPherson      Square and other gathering spots for the homeless for      decades. Now, it serves more than 1,100 people a day with      meals and early-childhood and after-school programs.       The group's legion of volunteers is legendary: A roll of      more than 10,000 school kids, poor people and the occasional      president who chop vegetables and build sandwiches.       Now, the organization wants to make a leap.       ``I think Martha's Table is ready for the next stage,''      said Linda Moore, founder of the E.W. Stokes Charter School      in Northeast Washington and longtime board member. ``Even      though I'm not sure what that is, we were looking for a      leader to take us there.''       Stonesifer got the job. The head of the Gates Foundation      U.S. programs, Allan Golston, sent congratulations. So did      Sylvia Burwell, president of the Walmart Foundation. Even      Stonesifer's old boss thought it was a good move.       ``I think it blends all the elements she loves in      philanthropy,'' Melinda Gates said by e-mail. ``Even when      living in Seattle, she did hands-on work at a local charity--     anonymously. That type of work keeps you grounded in the real      issues in people's lives.''       Again, she will work for free, but she will also work for      real. She expects long hours. This is not, she insisted (with      some heat) a ``retirement'' job.       She's heard that one before, after she left Microsoft and      agreed to run Bill Gates's library initiative.       `` `Oh, she's going to convert libraries to the Internet,      how sweet.' Well, it wasn't sweet at all,'' Stonesifer said.      ``We added 11,000 libraries to the Web, and that group went      on to become the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.''       No stepping back.       On a taxi ride from her house to a meeting of philanthropy      leaders at the Hotel Monaco, she described her biggest      concern: that people will assume she can connect a funding      hose from Martha's Table to the Gates Foundation and the      coffers will be full forever.       Not gonna happen.       ``That's not what they do, and that's not what Martha's      Table needs,'' she said. ``The strength of Martha's Table is      in the thousands of small donors and volunteers that ensure      we deliver services every day. I don't want my coming here to      make people step back in any way.''       The cabdriver leaned back. ``You work for Martha's Table?''      he asked in a strong Ethiopian accent.       Stonesifer hesitated. ``I'm going to.''       ``It's a good charity,'' the man said. He picks up      volunteers there all the time, he explained, young people who      need a ride home. Thinking of his own two children in      Virginia colleges, he doesn't take their money.       ``You'd have to be mentally handicapped to charge somebody      doing what they do,'' he said. ``You work for Martha's Table,      I won't charge you, either.''       Stonesifer put a hand on his shoulder, even as she insisted      he take the money from her hand. ``You dear, sweet man,'' she      said. ``God bless you.''       On the curb, she exulted.       ``That's the power of Martha's Table,'' she said. ``A man      driving a cab and putting two kids through school. That's      what we have to work with. I'm so excited.''                          ____________________
