Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 196) recognizing the anniversary of the ratification of the 13th Amendment and encouraging the American people to educate and instill pride and purpose into their communities and to observe the anniversary annually with appropriate programs and activities.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 196       Whereas on December 6, 1865, the 13th Amendment to the      Constitution was ratified, proclaiming that ``neither slavery      nor involuntary servitude . . . shall exist within the United      States'';       Whereas the ratification of the 13th Amendment began a      civil rights movement which would radically change African      American existence in the United States;       Whereas the 13th Amendment represented a victory for      African Americans across the United States, who had been      denied the rights of full citizens;       Whereas the 13th Amendment is a symbol of the Federal      Government's commitment to fulfill its promise of equality,      liberty, and the American dream for all Americans because it      liberated African Americans from the yoke of slavery and      launched a new age activism advocating equal rights for all      minorities;       Whereas December 6, 2005, marks the 140th anniversary of      the ratification of the 13th Amendment;       Whereas the observation of the 140th anniversary would put      into effect section 2 of the Amendment, by reaffirming      Congress' ``power to enforce this article by appropriate      legislation''; and       Whereas the 13th Amendment Foundation supports the      establishment of a national day of recognition commemorating      the anniversary of the ratification of the 13th Amendment to      renew a national commitment to eradicate racial and ethnic      inequalities: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--       (1) recognizes the 140th anniversary of the ratification of      the 13th Amendment to the Constitution;       (2) encourages the American people to educate and instill      pride and purpose into their communities about the history of      liberation and the civil rights movement in the United      States; and       (3) encourages the American people to observe the      anniversary of the ratification of the 13th Amendment each      year by honoring its significance in United States history      with appropriate programs and activities.
