 President, I am very sad to report that Air Force Col. John Boyd died in West Palm Beach, FL, on March 9, 1997.  He was 70 years old.  He passed away after a long and difficult fight with cancer.  His remains were laid to rest today in Arlington Memorial Cemetery.  John was a native of Erie, PA. But John came to Iowa to go to college.  Iowa is where his Air Force career began.  He won an athletic scholarship to the University of Iowa and enrolled in the Air Force ROTC program.  After graduating in 1951, he went to flight school. He earned his wings and began flying the F-86 Saber jet.  Then he went to Korea with one goal: shoot down a MiG.  Fortunately, for everyone concerned, that conflict came to an end before his wish came true.  But to John that was one of the biggest disappointments of his life.  Mr. President, I am proud that John Boyd was educated in Iowa.  He was a great American who dedicated his life to public service.  I would like to honor him by speaking briefly about some of his most important accomplishments.  First and foremost, John Boyd was a legendary Air Force fighter pilot.  But John was no ordinary jet jockey. He applied his vast intellect to understand the dynamics of air combat maneuvering at which he excelled.  To do that, though, he had to teach himself calculus so he could work the formulas to quantify the problem.  This was the problem he saw.  Why did the heavier and slower American F-86 achieve near total domination of the superior MiG-15 encountered in Korea?  John wanted an answer to the question.  After doing some truly original and pioneering work, he began advancing a theory.  His tactical ``Aerial Attack Study'' became the bible for air-to-air combat training.  It was instrumental in the creation of the Fighter Weapons School at Nellis Air Force Base, NV.  That's the Air Force equivalent of the Navy's ``Top Gun'' program.  John being John, he never slacked off. He kept right on working and developing his theory of aerial combat.  He wanted to take it to a higher plane.  And he did.  It culminated in the Energy Maneuverability Theory.  This was a very important piece of work.  John Boyd's Energy Maneuverability Theory was seminal in the development of two of our premier fighters: first the F-15 and then the F-16.  That theory helped to shape the design of those two very important airplanes.  So, Mr. President, John Boyd was truly a giant in the field of air warfare.  When I first met John in early 1983, he was applying his genius in an entirely different field.  He had retired from the Air Force and had set up shop over in the Pentagon.  He was given a small consulting contract and a cubbyhole-size office to go with it.  His Pentagon cubbyhole was the birthplace of some very important ideas.  That's when I met John Boyd. He was just beginning his reform crusade.  He was the leader of the Military Reform Movement.  At that point in time, I was wrestling with the Reagan administration's plan to pump up the defense budget.  I was searching for an effective strategy to freeze the defense budget.  Cap Weinberger was the Secretary of Defense, and he kept asking for more and more money.  The DOD budget was at the $210 billion level that year.  But Cap Weinberger had plans to push it first to $300, then $400, and finally to $500 billion.  The money sacks were piled high on the steps of the Pentagon.  It seemed like there was no way to put a lid on defense spending--that is until John Boyd walked in my office.  To this day, I don't know how he got there. Ernie Fitzgerald may have introduced us. I don't quite remember.  But John had a secret weapon.  His secret weapon was Chuck Spinney.  Chuck was an analyst in the Pentagon's office of Program Analysis and Evaluation, or PA  He had a briefing entitled ``Plans/Reality Mismatch.''  John's plan was to use Spinney's material to expose the flaws in Weinberger's plan to ramp up the defense budget.  So I asked DOD for Mr. Spinney's briefing but ran smack into a stone wall.  At first, the bureaucrats tried to pretend it didn't exist.  For example, Dr. Chu, Spinney's boss, characterized Spinney's briefing as nothing more than: ``Scribblings and writings gathered up and stapled together.''  Well, that didn't wash. It just added fat to the fire.  DOD could no longer suppress the truth.  The Wall Street Journal and Boston Globe had already published major reports on Spinney's briefing. A number of other newspapers had it and were ready to roll.  The press knew this was a substantial and credible piece of work.  John's behind-the-scenes maneuvering finally led to a dramatic hearing that was held in the Senate Caucus Room in February 1983.  It was an unprecedented event.  It was the only joint Armed Services/Budget Committee hearing ever held.  In a room filled with TV cameras and bright lights, Spinney treated the committee to a huge stack of his famous spaghetti charts.  This was Spinney's bottom line: The final bill of Weinberger's 1983-87 defense plan would be $500 billion more than promised. It was devastating.  Mr. Spinney's outstanding performance won him a place on the cover of Time Magazine on March 7, 1983.  And it effectively put an end to Weinberger's plan to pump up the defense budget.  Two years later, my amendment to freeze the defense budget was adopted by the Senate.  If John Boyd hadn't come to my office and told me about Chuck Spinney, the hearing in the Senate Caucus Room might not have taken place.  And if that hearing hadn't happened like it did, I doubt we would have succeeded in putting the brakes on Weinberger's spending plans.  The Plans/Reality Mismatch hearing was just one episode in the history of the military reform movement, but it is the one that brought me and John together.  There were many others. John was always the driving force behind the scenes, giving advice, planning the next move, and always talking with the press.  John Boyd always set an example of excellence--both morally and professionally.  Mr. President, since John died, there have been several articles published about some of his exploits.  There was a truly beautiful obituary--if such a thing exists--in the March 13 issue of the New York Times.  It describes John's vast contributions to air warfare.  Second, there is a more colorful piece, which will appear in the March 24 issue of U.S. News and World Report.  That one is written by Jim Fallows and is entitled ``A Priceless Original.''  Mr. Fallows describes some of John's important contributions against the backdrop of his unusual character traits.  Then, there is the letter from the Marine Corps Commandant, General Krulak.  General Krulak describes John as ``an architect'' of our military victory over Iraq in 1991.  That's an oblique reference to John's ``Patterns of Conflict'' briefing. This piece of work had a profound impact on U.S. military thought.  It helped our top military leadership understand the advantages of maneuver warfare. Those ideas were used to defeat Iraq.  And finally, Col. David Hackworth has devoted his weekly column to John Boyd. It is entitled: ``A Great Airman's Final Flight.''  I ask unanimous consent to have these reports printed in the Record.  Mr. President, we have lost a great American--a true patriot. I will miss him.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Mar. 13, 1997]       Col. John Boyd Is Dead at 70; Advanced Air Combat Tactics                      (By Robert McG. Thomas, Jr.)       Col. John R. Boyd, a legendary Air Force fighter pilot      whose discovery that quicker is better than faster became the      basis of a far-reaching theory that helped revolutionize      American military strategy, died on March 9 at a hospital in      West Palm Beach, Fla. He was 70 and had lived in Delray      Beach.       The cause was cancer, his family said.       To combat pilots of the late 1950's, it was always high      noon in the skies above the Nevada desert. A pilot, a crack      instructor at Nellis Air Force Base, perhaps, or a hotshot      Navy flier passing through would get on the radio to call him      out and within minutes Colonel Boyd would have another notch      in his belt.       They did not call him 40-second Boyd for nothing. From 1954      to 1960 virtually every combat pilot in the country knew that      Colonel Boyd, a former Korean War pilot who helped establish      the Fighter Weapons School at Nellis, had a standing offer:      take a position on his tail, and 40 twisting, turning seconds      later he would have the challenger in his own gun-sights or      pay $40. Colonel Boyd never lost the bet in more than 3,000      hours of flying time.       A high school swimming champion who won an athletic      scholarship to the University of Iowa, Colonel Boyd, a native      of Erie, Pa., had superior reflexes and hand-eye      coordination, but what made him invincible in mock combat was      something else.       At Nellis he taught himself calculus so he could work out      the formulas that produced his repertory of aerial maneuvers      and led to his 1960 report, ``Aerial Attack Study,'' the      bible of air-to-air combat.       His combat experience was limited to a few missions in      Korea, but they were enough to produce a breakthrough      insight. Wondering why the comparatively slow and ponderous      American F-86's achieved near total domination of the      superior MIG-15's, he realized that the F-86 had two crucial      advantages: better visibility and a faster roll rate.       This, in turn, led Colonel Boyd to develop what he called      the OODA Loop, to denote the repeated cycle of observation,      orientation, decision and action that characterized every      encounter. The key to victory, he theorized, was not a plane      that could climb faster or higher but one that could begin      climbing or change course quicker--to get inside an      adversary's ``time/cycle loop.''       The fast-cycle combat theory, expanded by Colonel Boyd into      a lecture he later delivered hundreds of times, has since      been widely applied to fields as diverse as weapons      procurement, battlefield strategy and business competition.       One implication of the theory was that the best fighter      plane was not necessarily the one with the most speed,      firepower or range. Colonel Boyd, who enrolled at Georgia      Tech     after his Nellis tour, was helping a fellow student with his      homework over hamburgers and beer one night when he had an      insight that led to a way to quantify his ideas. The      resulting Energy Maneuverability Theory, which allows precise      comparisons of maneuverability, is now a standard measure of      aerial performance.       Assigned to the Pentagon in 1964, Colonel Boyd became an      important figure in a movement that started in response to      $400 hammers and other headline excesses of Defense      Department spending and soon expanded to question the need      for many hugely expensive weapons systems.       Although he had allies in the Pentagon, Congress and      business, Colonel Boyd's ideas often went against the grain      of a military-industrial bureaucracy devoted to the      procurement of the most advanced, most expensive and (not      coincidentally, he felt) most profitable planes.       Although his design ideas helped give the F-15 a big, high-     visibility canopy, his major triumph was the F-16, a plane      lacking many of the F-15's high-tech, expensive features, but      which is far more agile and costs less than half as much,      allowing for the purchase of many more of them for a given      expenditure.       Top Air Force officers were so opposed to the concept of      producing a plane that did not expand on the F-15's cutting      edge technology that Colonel Boyd and some civilian allies      developed it in secret.       The plane was hailed for its performance in the Persian      Gulf war, a war whose very strategy of quick, flexible      response was based largely on ideas Colonel Boyd had been      promoting for years.       Colonel Boyd, who maintained that the lure of big-money      defense contracts invariably perverted weapons assessment,      was so personally fastidious that during his years in the      Pentagon he became known as the Ghetto Colonel because he      lived in a basement apartment.       He carried his notion of propriety to such an extreme that      when he retired in 1975 and began some of his most productive      work, as a Pentagon consultant, he insisted that his family      live on his retirement pay. Initially offering to work full      time without pay, he was persuaded to accept one day's pay      every two-week pay period, because he had to be on the      Pentagon payroll to have access to the building, before      retiring in 1988.       He is survived by his wife, Mary; three sons, Stephen, of      Springfield, Va., Scott, of Burke, Va., and Jeff, of Delray      Beach, Fla.; two daughters, Kathryn, of Delray Beach and Mary      Ellen Holton of Centerville, Va.; a brother, H.G. Boyd of      Pompano Beach, Fla.; a sister, Marion Boyd of Erie, and two      grandchildren.                                                                    ____               [From Inside the Pentagon, Mar. 13, 1997]                          Letter to the Editor       To the Editor: I was deeply saddened to learn of the      passing of Colonel John Boyd, USAF (Ret.). How does one begin      to pay homage to a warrior like John Boyd? He was a towering      intellect who made unsurpassed contributions to the American      art of war. Indeed, he was one of the central architects in      the reform of military thought which swept the services, and      in particular the Marine Corps, in the 1980's. From John Boyd      we learned about competitive decision making on the      battlefield--compressing time, using time as an ally.      Thousands of officers in all our services knew John Boyd by      his work on what was to be known as the Boyd Cycle or OODA      Loop. His writings and his lectures had a fundamental impact      on the curriculum of virtually every professional military      education program in the United States--and on many abroad.      In this way he touched so many lives, many of them destined      to ascend to the very highest levels of military and civilian      leadership.       Those of us who knew John Boyd the man knew him as a man of      character and integrity. His life and values were shaped by a      selfless dedication to Country and Service, by the crucible      of war, and by an unrelenting love of study. he was the      quintessential soldier-scholar--a man whose jovial, outgoing      exterior belied the vastness of his knowledge and the power      of his intellect. I was in awe of him, not just for the      potential of his future contributions, but for what he stood      for as an officer, a citizen, and as a man.       As I write this, my mind wanders back to that morning in      February, 1991, when the military might of the United States      sliced violently into the Iraqi positions in Kuwait.      Bludgeoned from the air nearly round the clock for six weeks,      paralyzed by the speed and ferocity of the attack, the Iraqi      army collapsed morally and intellectually under the onslaught      of American and Coalition forces. John Boyd was an architect      of that victory as surely as if he'd commanded a fighter wing      or a maneuver division in the desert. His thinking, his      theories, his larger than life influence, were there with us      in Desert Storm. He must have been proud at what his efforts      wrought.       So, how does one pay homage to a man like John Boyd?      Perhaps best by remembering that Colonel Boyd never sought      the acclaim won him by his thinking. He only wanted to make a      difference in the next war . . . and he did. That ancient      book of wisdom--Proverbs--sums up John's contribution to his      nation: ``A wise man is strong, and a man of knowledge adds      to his strength; for by wise guidance you will wage your war,      and there is victory in a multitude of counsellors.'' I, and      his Corps of Marines, will miss our counsellor terribly.--     Proverbs 24:5-6           Sincerely,                                                  C.C. Krulak,                                       General, U.S. Marine Corps,                                   Commandant of the Marine Corps.       Editor's Note: Col. John Boyd, who retired from the Air      Force in 1975, died March 9 at age 70. A fighter pilot of      legendary ability, Boyd was the author of several pivotal      explorations of warfighting theory, including ``Destruction      and Creation'' (1976), ``Patterns of Conflict'' (1981), and      ``Conceptual Spiral'' (1991).       While still in the Air Force, Boyd was largely responsible      for the early design of the F-15 and F-16 fighters, and      contributed significantly to the design of the A-10 close air      support aircraft. His ``energy maneuverability theory'' is      still in use in designing aircraft for maximum performance      and maneuverability.       Boyd is probably best known for developing the concept of      the ``OODA Loop,'' short for ``observe, orient, decide,      act''--effectively a guide to anticipating enemy moves in a      fast-paced battle and heading them off at the pass. The term      was widely used during the 1991 Persian Gulf war in reference      to the U.S. force's ability to get ``inside'' Iraq's      decisionmaking cycle.       Boyd is considered the father of the Air Force's original      ``fighter mafia'' and, after his retirement, a key leader of      the military reform movement in the 1980s.                                                                    ____            [From U.S. News & World Report, March 24, 1997]                          A Priceless Original                           (By James Fallows)       True originality can be disturbing, and John Boyd was      maddeningly original. His ideas about weapons, leadership,      and the very purpose of national security changed the modern      military. After Boyd died last week of cancer at age 70, the      commandant of the Marine Corps called him ``a towering      intellect who made unsurpassed contributions to the American      art of war.'' Yet until late in his life, the military      establishment resisted Boyd and resented him besides.       Boyd was called up for military service during the Korean      War and quickly demonstrated prowess as an Air Force fighter      pilot. More important, he revealed his fascination with the      roots of competitive failure and success. U.S. Planes and      pilots, he realized, did better in air combat than they      should have. In theory, the Soviet-built MiG they fought      against was far superior to the F-86 that Boyd flew. The MiG      had a higher top speed and could hold a tighter turn. The      main advantage of the F-86 was that it could change from one      maneuver to another more rapidly, dodging or diving out of      the MiG's way. As the planes engaged, Boyd argued, the F-86      could build a steadily accumulating advantage in moving to a      ``kill position'' on the MiG's tail.       Boyd extended his method--isolating the real elements of      success--while maintaining his emphasis on adaptability. In      the late 1950s, he developed influential doctrines of air      combat and was a renowned fighter instructor. In the 1960s,      he applied his logic to the design of planes, showing what a      plane would lose in maneuverability for each extra bit of      weight or size--and what the nation lost in usable force as      the cost per plane went up. Within the Pentagon, he and      members of a ``Fighter Mafia'' talked a reluctant Air Force      into building the F-16 and A-10--small, relatively cheap, yet      highly effective aircraft that were temporary departures from      the trend toward more expensive and complex weapons.       Warrior virtues. After leaving the Air Force as a colonel      in 1975, Boyd began the study of long historical trends in      military success through which he made his greatest mark. He      became a fanatical autodidact, reading and marking up      accounts of battles, beginning with the Peloponnesian War. On      his Air Force pension, he lived modestly, working from a      small, book-crammed apartment. He presented his findings in      briefings, which came in varying lengths, starting at four      hours. Boyd refused to discuss his views with those who would      not sit through a whole presentation; to him, they were      dilettantes. To those who listened, he offered a worldview in      which crucial military qualities--adaptability, innovation--     grew from moral strengths and other ``warrior'' virtues. Yes-     man careerism, by-the-book thought, and the military's      budget-oriented ``culture of procurement'' were his great      nemeses.       Since he left no written record other than the charts that      outlined his briefings, Boyd was virtually unknown except to      those who had listened to him personally--but that group grew      steadily in size and influence. Politicians, who parcel out      their lives in 10-minute intervals, began to sit through his      briefings. The Marine Corps, as it recovered from Vietnam,      sought his advice on morale, character, and strategy. By the      time of the gulf war, his emphasis on blitzkrieglike      ``maneuver warfare'' had become prevailing doctrine in the      U.S. military. As a congressman, Dick Cheney spent days at      Boyd's briefings. As defense secretary, he rejected an early      plan for the land war in Iraq as being too frontal and      unimaginative--what Boyd would have mockingly called ``Hey      diddle diddle, straight up the middle''--and insisted on a      surprise flanking move.       John Boyd laughed often, yet when he turned serious, his      preferred speaking distance was 3 inches from your face. He      brandished a cigar and once burned right through the necktie      of a general he had buttonholed.     He would telephone at odd hours and resume a harangue from      weeks before as if he'd never stopped. But as irritating as      he was, he was more influential. He will be marked by a small      headstone at Arlington Cemetery and an enormous impact on the      profession of arms.                                                                    ____             [From King Features Syndicate, Mar. 18, 1997]            Defending America, A Great Airman's Final Flight                        (By David H. Hackworth)       Col. John R. Boyd of the United States Air Force is dead.       Future generations will learn that John Boyd, a legendary      fighter pilot, was America's greatest military thinker. He's      remembered now by all those he touched over the last 52 years      of service to our country as not only the original ``Top      Gun,'' but as one smart hombre who always had the guts to      stand tall and to tell it like it is.       He didn't just drive Chinese fighter pilots nuts while      flying his F-86 over the Yalu River during the Korean War, he      spent decades causing the top brass to climb the walls and      the cost-plus, defense-contractor racketeers to run for      cover.       He was not only a fearless fighter pilot with a laser mind,      but a man of rare moral courage. the mission of providing      America with the best airplane came first, closely followed      by his love for the troops and his concern for their welfare.      Many of the current crop of Air Force generals could pull out      of their moral nose dive by following his example.       After the Korean War, he became known as ``40-Second'' Boyd      because he defeated opponents in aerial combat in less than      40 seconds. Many of his contemporaries from this period say      he was the best fighter pilot in the U.S. Air Force.       Not only was he skilled and brave, but he was also a brain.      The Air Force recognized this and sent him to Georgia Tech,      not to be a ``rambling wreck,'' but to become a top graduate      engineer. It was there that he developed the fighter tactics      which proved so effective during the Vietnam War, and the      concepts that later revolutionized the design of fighter      aircraft and the U.S.A.'s way of fighting wars, both in the      air and on the ground.       He saved the F-15 from being an 80,000-pound, swing-wing      air bus, streamlining it into a 40,000-pound, lean and mean      fixed-wing fighter, which Desert Storm proved still has no      equal.       Boyd was also a key player in the development of the F-16,      probably the most agile and maneuverable fighter aircraft      ever built, and costing half the price of the F-15. The top      brass didn't want it. To them, more expensive was better.      Boyd outfoxed them by developing it in secret.       Chuck Spinney, who as a Pentagon staffer sweated under      Boyd's cantankerous, demanding tough love says, ``The most      important gift my father gave me was a deep belief in the      importance of doing what you think is right--to act on what      your conscience says you should act on and to accept the      consequences. The most important gift Boyd gave me was the      ability to do this and survive and grow at the same time.''       Boyd never made general--truth-tellers seldom do in today's      slick military because the Pentagon brass hate the truth, and      try to destroy those who tell it. They did their best to do a      number on John. But true to form, he always out-maneuvered      them.       Norman Schwarzkopf is widely heralded as the hero of Desert      Storm, but in fact, Boyd's tactics and strategy were the real      force behind the 100-Hour War. Stormin' Norman simply copied      Boyd's playbook, and the Marines were brilliant during their      attack on Kuwait.       As USMC Col. Mike Wyly tells it, Boyd ``applied his keen      thinking to Marine tactics, and today we are a stronger,      sharper Corps.''       His example inspired many. He affected everyone with whom      he came in contact. He trained a generation of disciples in      all the services, and they are carrying on his good work,      continuing to serve the truth over self.       For those who know, the name Boyd has already become a      synonym for ``doing the right thing.'' His legacy will be      that integrity--doing the hard right over the easy wrong--is      more important than all the stars, all the plush executive      suites and all the bucks.       God now has the finest pilot ever at his side. And He, in      all His wisdom, will surely give Boyd the recognition he      deserves by promoting him to air marshal of the universe.       For sure, we can all expect a few changes in the design of      heaven as Boyd makes it a better place, just as he did planet      earth.
