 President, I take this opportunity to extend warm birthday greetings to a constituent of mine, Linda Maxwell Robertson. Linda will be turning 50 on September 1st.  Linda is an unusual woman who pursued a career in commercial film production in New York City right out of high school. She started as a production assistant and rapidly rose through the ranks so that, at the ``ripe old age'' of 26, she co-founded her own production company with a partner, Mark Ross. Within a few years, her company had annual billings in excess of $8 million. Later, Linda established a commercial production company in New York for noted Hollywood directors Ridley and Tony Scott and Patrick Morgan. Linda is a Past President of the East Coast Chapter of the Association of Independent Commercial Producers, AICP, and a current member of the Directors Guild of America.  In addition to her work-related responsibilities, Linda served as a media consultant to the Partnership for a Drug-Free America and was the Executive in Charge of Production for the United Nations' worldwide campaign to celebrate its 50th anniversary. In that capacity, she produced commercials in North America, South America, England, Thailand, South Africa, Mozambique, Australia, and the Czech Republic.  These accomplishments would be enough to satisfy most people, but not Linda! In her mid-40s, she went to college to New School University, where our friend and former colleague, Bob Kerrey, now serves as President. Linda earned her Bachelor's degree in Psychology in 2000, graduating with a 3.9 grade point average, GPA. While she was earning her BA, Linda started Black/Max Productions with her friend, Ann Black. The two of them are busy developing innovative and educational children's programming.  In July 2000, Linda and her husband Mike, daughter Charlotte, and dog Sally moved to Newport Beach and now live in Laguna Beach. At present, Linda is a few semesters shy of earning a Master's degree in clinical psychology from Pepperdine University's Graduate School of Education and Psychology. This September, she'll begin work as a trainee in marriage and family therapy at Pepperdine's Community Counseling Center. She is currently working as head of marketing and special events coordinator at the Cannery Restaurant in Newport Beach.  Linda finds the time, somehow, to get her poetry published and to be active in charitable affairs in her community and at St. Margaret's Episcopal School in San Juan Capistrano, where her daughter Charlotte will be entering the 10th Grade this fall. Meanwhile, her husband Mike is Creative Director at Heil-Brice Retail Advertising, HBRA, in Newport Beach and the two of them are on the brink of opening one or more ``It's a Grind'' coffee shops in Orange County.  I know that Linda is an inspiration to all who know her, especially her family--her younger brother, Gray, served as my legislative director for two years. It's a pleasure to send her birthday greetings. I could tell her to keep up the great work, but I don't think it's necessary!                          ____________________
