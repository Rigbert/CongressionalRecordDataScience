 President, we oppose this amendment. We oppose it because it takes $420 million out of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. We oppose it because the committee in the stimulus bill put in as many dollars as these departments could absorb in the period of time for maintenance.  I move to table. I ask for the yeas and nays.
