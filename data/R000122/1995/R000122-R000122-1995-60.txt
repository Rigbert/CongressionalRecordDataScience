Chairman, I rise in strong support of this amendment offered together with my colleague the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Kleczka. I also want to commend him for his leadership on this amendment.  We are talking about creating a block grant structure. I have some very serious concerns about that. But if we are going to pursue a block grant strategy, this amendment must be adopted.  We want to ensure that the Governors and the State legislatures not only have flexibility but also that we have accountability. As the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Kleczka] so well explained, the underlying bill provides for a rainy day fund so that in good times moneys can be built up to face more difficult economic times.  At present the bill requires the states to run this account up to 120 percent of the title I moneys but after that there is no clarification or determination of what excess funds should be used for.  As the gentleman from Wisconsin pointed out, under the present law, these funds could be used for any general State purpose. And having served in a general assembly, I never underestimate the ingenuity and the imagination of state governors and state representatives to find ways to spend Federal moneys. So as a result, I think it is incumbent upon us to insist upon accountability, to require that when this 120 percent fund level is met that any additional funds be either returned to us or used for the purposes that we provide them for these welfare programs.  [[Page H3515]] This is a very good amendment. It gives flexibility but it does not ignore accountability by the states.  I urge this amendment be adopted. And again, I commend the gentleman from Wisconsin for his leadership.
