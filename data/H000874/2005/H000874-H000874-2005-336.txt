Speaker, I appreciate the leader's remarks. We have advised our Members to be available for Friday, and they will be, obviously, if we have a session.  In addition, the gentleman has indicated and just reiterated the possibility of doing further legislation as a result of Katrina and responses to Katrina. Can the majority leader give us an idea of what legislation might be possible in response to Katrina next week?  Mr. DeLAY. I thank the gentleman for continuing to yield.  I cannot, obviously, give a list like that. I do not have a list with me. Lists are being worked on, and certainly the gentleman will be included, or his side will be included in discussion of these issues.  These are issues that are incredibly important that need to be addressed immediately so that we can do the recovery work that needs to be done for the victims of Katrina. It is a very expedited process, I might say, as to how we can take these simple bills and get everybody signed off on them and bring them to the floor.  So I do not have a list now, but by this afternoon, or tomorrow certainly, the gentleman and his side will be informed as to what we are thinking about. Any ideas that the gentleman and his side of the aisle might have, we would welcome and would consider those. We are working with both sides of the aisle trying to be as bipartisan as we possibly can in considering everybody's ideas.
