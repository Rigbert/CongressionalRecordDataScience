 I don't see on the schedule, Mr. Speaker, that we are going to a budget conference. At least there's no notice from the majority leader of that fact. Mr. Speaker, as you know, we are facing a number of critical deadlines. It has now been 125 days since the House passed a budget and 123 days since the Senate passed a budget. On issue after issue, our Republican colleagues, Mr. Speaker, have passed bills and then refused to negotiate. Mr. Speaker, it's past time for action. We should go to conference and reach an agreement. I would urge my friend, the majority leader, Mr. Speaker, to go to conference.  One of his colleagues, Mr. Speaker, from Virginia said this: ``I am proudly on record about this. I believe we need to go to conference,'' speaking of the budget. This Member went on to say, ``I have listened carefully to the argument that we should not go to conference, and frankly I do not find it compelling.''  Mr. Speaker, that was Representative Scott Rigell of Virginia.  I would ask my friend, the majority leader, does the gentleman expect that we will go to conference at all on the budget?  I yield to my friend.
