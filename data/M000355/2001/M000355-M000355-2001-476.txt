 He is the one who thought of paycheck protection. He outlined the history of it a few moments ago. I understand we will not have his vote on this offering because, as he knows, we were trying to meet the objections of some of those on the other side who have said for years: You ought to apply it to corporations as well as unions. We did that. It looks as though we are not going to get any of their votes anyway.  I do credit the Senator from Oklahoma. This is his piece of work originally. I hope at some point in the debate he will offer the amendment without the corporate provision. I certainly would vote for it. I think many Members would. It deals with a very real problem in the American political system.  I think we are essentially through with the debate, I say to my friend from Connecticut.
