  The first letter is to Frank Raines of OMB asking that 2 million additional dollars in fiscal year 1999 be included, and giving the rationale for those inclusions.  I have received a letter dated October 20 indicating--and I thank him very much for that--that OMB is reviewing the request.  I also have a letter dated September 23 to Bruce Babbitt of the Interior, and to John Bernal of the International Boundary and Water Commission. I have received no response to either of these letters.  It is my view that the Department of the Interior should take this off of the back burner and put it on the front burner. And I would respectfully suggest that they utilize the same club-fed methodology that they have used I think with great success in handling California's water problems. This is where the Secretary of the Interior really takes the responsibility to pull together all of the disparate groups into a kind of working commitment to see that the right thing is done.  My concern is that the die-off could continue for years, and the chemical and agricultural wastes continue to interface.  If you fly above this river you will see where the river leaches out a crystalline substance into the agricultural heartland of the Imperial Valley. You will see where it directly abuts green field row crops. This I think is the potential danger in terms of the future for people working in that area, not only for blisters but also for something potentially much more serious.  So I am hoping that Secretary Babbitt will elevate this into a club-fed effort and that we can really get cracking.  The House Subcommittee on Water and Power also held an oversight hearing in Palm Desert on October 3 of this year, a few weeks ago, helping to focus national and regional attention on the Salton Sea and the need for action. However, as I said, at this time there is no agreement on a plan. And the critical research must be done. But what is clear to me is that it must be expedited. We now have a die-off that has been going on throughout this decade, and is escalating. We now have identified microorganisms which yield typhoid, cholera, and tuberculosis, and other diseases in what is a 350-square-mile body of water which is polluted in a major and very sad way.  So the longer a solution is delayed, Mr. President, the worse the situation will become.  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.                          ____________________
