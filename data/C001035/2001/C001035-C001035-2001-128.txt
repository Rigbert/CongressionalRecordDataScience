President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate immediately proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination on the Executive Calendar: No. 77.  I further ask unanimous consent that the nomination be confirmed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, that any statements relating to the nomination appear at this point in the Record, and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action. I also ask unanimous consent that the Senate then return to legislative session.
