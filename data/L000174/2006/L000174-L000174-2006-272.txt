President, recently I was pleased to introduce with Senators Kohl, Grassley and Schumer, the Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act of 2006, S. 3582. That bill was designed to improve the timely and effective introduction of generic pharmaceuticals into the marketplace.  It is no secret that prescription drug prices are rapidly increasing and are a source of considerable concern to many Americans, especially senior citizens and families. In a marketplace free of manipulation, generic drug prices can be as much as 80 percent lower than the comparable brand name version. Unfortunately, there are still some companies driven by greed that may be keeping low-cost, life-saving generic drugs off the marketplace, off pharmacy shelves, and out of the hands of consumers by carefully crafted anticompetitive agreements between drug manufacturers.  In 2001, and last Congress, I introduced a related bill, the Competition Act. That bill, which is now law, is small in terms of length but large in terms of impact. It ensured that law enforcement agencies could take quick and decisive action against companies seeking to cheat consumers by delaying availability of generic medicines. It gave the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department access to information about secret deals between drug companies that keep generic drugs out of the market--a practice that not only hurts American families, particularly senior citizens, by denying them access to low-cost generic drugs, but also contributes to rising medical costs.  The Drug Competition Act, which was incorporated in the Medicare Modernization Act, was a bipartisan effort to protect consumers in need of patented medicines who were being forced to pay considerably higher costs because of collusive secret deals designed. It is regrettable that we must come to the floor again today and take additional action to prevent drug companies from continuing to find and exploit loopholes.  The bill I am introducing tonight with Senators Rockefeller and Schumer is very important. It will provide incentives for generic companies to make the investments needed to introduce low-cost generic medicines for all our citizens.  The bill assures all Americans that the original intent of the Hatch-Waxman law is carried out. That law was to provide incentives for generic companies to challenge the validity of patents on medicines and provide incentives for generic companies to manufacture low-cost medicines. That incentive was simple.  Under Hatch-Waxman law, the first generic company, called the first-filer, which successfully develops a generic version of a patented drug and meets certain other requirements, can get a 180-day exclusivity period to be the only generic company to have permission to make and sell that generic drug.  That was called an exclusivity period because that is what the Congress intended--that generic company would have the exclusive right for 180 days to make the generic version of the patented medicine.  The problem is that recently brand-name companies have been labeling their own patented drugs also as a generic version of itself, or licensing others to make it, and selling both the brand-name version and the so-called generic version. This undercuts the potential profits of the ``real'' generic company and denies them what the Hatch-Waxman law promised and for a long time delivered--an exclusivity period lasting up to 180 days.  When the brand-name company offers a competing ``fake'' generic version of the drug, that can cut the profits of the real generic manufacturer greatly--thus making it less likely that a real generic company will even want to make the product.  The Rockefeller bill prevents the brand-name company from doing that for the 180-day exclusivity period. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this effort.                          ____________________
