 When I asked for the opportunity to go to Scott Air Force Base in Belleville, just to spend a few moments with the men and women of the 126th Air Guard Refueling Wing, I wasn't certain whether they would consider this a colossal waste of time to have to have some political figure come and drop by. Exactly the opposite happened.  It was an important experience for me, and I also think for many of them, just to come by, have a few kind words, and to really thank them for the sacrifice they have shown for this country.  This is an Air Guard unit that has been activated many times. It was originally based at O'Hare and now is at Scott Air Force Base. They refuel planes and are very important to any military effort of the United States. There were about 340 members of this unit, men and women, who have joined the military, understanding their lives would be on the line. To go through the crowd there and meet each one of them, to talk for a few moments about their hometowns and their families, baseball, and so many other things that are just part of American life, was so refreshing and encouraging and, in a way, inspiring--spending that time with them and General Kessler, who is their commanding officer at Scott Air Force Base.  Theirs is a unit that has been activated, in part. And I am sure others will be as well. The 182nd Airlift Wingin Peoria is also a unit that is likely to be mobilized--the 183rd Air National Guard Fighter Wing in Springfield, the 954th Air Reserve Support Unit out of Scott Air Force Base, the 182nd Air National Guard Security Forces, the 126th Air National Guard Security Forces, and the 183 National Guard Security Forces out of Springfield.  The one thing they raised to me--and I think at least bears some comment in this Chamber--was their concern about their families once they left. That is a natural feeling. It is one we ought to remind ourselves of, that we have passed laws to protect these men and women in uniform who are activated so that they can return to their jobs without any loss of status, and also to help them in some financial circumstances.  But beyond the laws, and beyond the Federal commitment, beyond the political speeches, I hope that every community across the United States will offer a helping hand to the families of those in the Guard and Reserve who are now called on to serve our country, as well as the active-duty men and women who are in harm's way at this moment in service to our Nation.  Many times, as I went around Illinois, people would say: Senator, what can I do? I have given blood. I have sent my check in. The President has said to embrace my family. I did it; I do it every day. Is there anything more I can do? Think about the families of the men and women in uniform in your community who just may need a helping hand or a word of encouragement of perhaps a little more. That is something every one of us should do.                          ____________________
