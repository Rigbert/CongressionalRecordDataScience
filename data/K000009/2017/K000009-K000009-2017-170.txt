Speaker, I want to ask why the Democratic microphone is turned off. This happened to me the other day when the Republican microphone was on over there.  The last two speakers we have not been able to hear as well as we heard Ms. Cheney, and I want to know why that is.  I hope somebody hears my plea and that the Parliamentarian will take care of this problem. This debate is too important to have our microphones at a lower scale.
