 I spoke yesterday on this issue. My good friend, Mr. Goodlatte, and I have talked a number of times about this.  In 1995, as I said yesterday, I voted for an amendment very similar to this, almost exactly like it. I had a confidence at that point in time that, in an emergency, three-fifths of us would come together and vote to do that which the country needed to keep it stable and safe.  Regrettably, over the 16 years, I have lost that confidence. I've lost that confidence this year, where, frankly, on the majority's side of the aisle we would not have passed a CR to keep the government open once. We wouldn't have passed it a second time; and, very frankly, had we had to rely on the votes solely of the majority side, as we have in the past on my side, we would have defaulted on our debt.  That is not a good context in which to adopt an amendment that puts the country at risk if three-fifths are not available to act in an emergency. As a result, I will not vote for this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.  We are engaged at this very day in an effort to try to come to agreement on how we balance the budget; and, very frankly, we only need 51 percent, and 51 percent is not there.  But we have balanced the budget, and we balanced it without an amendment. We balanced it in 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001. And my Republican colleagues rightfully say, ``Well, we offered those budgets.'' Yes, they did. But I will tell you, I have no doubt, not a single doubt, that if the surpluses that were created by those budgets had been available in 1998 and Bill Clinton had not said save Social Security first, that what we would have done is cut revenues deeply and had deficits during those 4 years. Now, you may disagree, but I have no doubt, based upon the philosophy that I have heard since 1981 from my Republican friends, that that would have been the case.                              {time}  1310  I said yesterday that what we need is not a balanced budget amendment, that what we need is a balanced budget.  How do we get to a balanced budget?  The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Latta) pointed out he was a county commissioner. Now, I'll bet as a county commissioner he probably had to pay for what he bought. He gave the analogy, if you've got X coming in, then that's what you spend, not X plus Y. The fact of the matter is his party has spent X plus Y, plus Z, plus A, plus B, plus C, and has run a deficit for every single year they had the Presidency during the last 30 years I've been in the Congress--without fail.  Now, what happened to bring us a balanced budget?  First of all, we had two parties responsible. I don't think we could have done it with just one party--my party or your party. We had two parties responsible, and we constrained one another. Then we had extraordinary growth in our economy, and that's what brought us a balanced budget. But we also adopted in 1990, again in 1993 and in 1997--and I tell my good friend, the sponsor of this, sometimes he voted for PAYGO and sometimes he did not, and your party abandoned the principle of paying for what you bought in 2001.
