 President, I introduce legislation which would authorize the establishment of nonprofit entities to provide grants and other assistance for international educational, cultural and arts programs through the Department of State. This is an initiative I have discussed with officials of the Department of State and introduce today to initiate discussion on how to best stimulate a vibrant exchange of international educational, cultural and arts programs.  We are in a era in which cultural issues are increasingly central to international issues and diplomacy. Trade disputes, ethnic and regional conflicts and issues such as biotechnology all have cultural and intellectual underpinnings.  Cultural programs are increasingly necessary to promoting international understanding and achieving U.S. national objectives. American multinational companies and other Americans doing business overseas welcome opportunities to show their support for the unique cultures of nations in which they do business, as well as their interest in telling the story of America's diversity in other countries.  One way they could do this is by helping to sponsor cultural exchange programs arranged through the Department of State. The problem is that there is apparently no clear easy way to do that--no point of contact for corporations or others interested in supporting cultural diplomacy--no clear avenues to assist cultural programs supported by our government. There also are concerns about possible conflicts of interest. Moreover, many people in our own government are uncertain whether they should engage in presenting the creative, intellectual and cultural side of our nation.  Under this legislation Congress would authorize the establishment of private nonprofit organizations for the support of international cultural programs, making it both easy and attractive for private organizations to support cultural programs in cooperation with the Department of State. In so doing, we would affirm support for the promotion and presentation of the nation's intellectual and creative best as part of American diplomacy.  This initiative would support a broad range of cultural exchange programs--projects that send Americans abroad and that bring people from other countries to the United States. Its priority would be to support the organization and promotion of major, high-profile presentations of art exhibitions, musical and theatrical performances which represent the finest quality of creativity our nation produces. These should be presentations that reach large numbers of people, which contribute to achieving our national interests and which represent the diversity of American culture.  There would be authority to solicit support for specific cultural endeavors, offering individuals, foundations, multinationals corporations and other American businesses engaged overseas the opportunity to publicly support cross-cultural understanding in countries where they do business.  The nonprofit entity would work with the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs as well as the Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs at the Department of State.  Mr. President, that is the overall purpose of this legislation. I am sure we will be able to improve on how to encourage a vibrant exchange of cultural programs, and I welcome suggestions on how best to do that. It is for that purpose that I introduce this legislation at the end of this Congress, with the intention of reintroducing it next year with the benefit of those suggestions.  I ask consent that the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3251       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SEC. 1. FINDINGS.       The Congress makes the following findings:       (1) It is in the national interest of the United States to      promote mutual understanding between the people of the United      States and other nations.       (2) Among the means to be used in achieving this objective      are a wide range of international educational and cultural      exchange programs, including the J. William Fulbright      Educational Exchange Program and the International Visitors      Program.       (3) Cultural diplomacy, especially the presentation abroad      of the finest of America's creative, visual and performing      arts, is an especially effective means of advancing the U.S.      national interest.       (4) The financial support available for international      cultural and scholarly exchanges has declined by      approximately 10 per cent in recent years.       (5) Funds appropriated for the purpose of ensuring that the      excellence, diversity and vitality of the arts in the United      States are presented to foreign audiences by and in      cooperation with our diplomatic and consular representatives      have declined dramatically.       (6) One of the ways to deepen and expand cultural and      educational exchange programs is through the establishment of      nonprofit entities to encourage the participation and      financial support of multinational companies and other      private sector contributors.       (7) The U.S. private sector should be encouraged to      cooperate closely with the Secretary of State and her      representatives to expand and spread appreciation of U.S.      cultural and artistic accomplishments.     SEC. 2. AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH NONPROFIT ENTITIES.       Section 105(f) of the Mutual Educational and Cultural      Exchange Act of 1961, as amended, (22 U.S.C. 2255(f)) is      further amended--       (1) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``(f)''; and by adding at      the end the following new paragraphs:       (2) The Secretary of State is authorized to provide for the      establishment of private, nonprofit entities to assist in      carrying out the purposes of the Act. Any such entity shall      not be considered an agency or instrumentality of the United      States government, nor shall its employees be considered      employees of the United States government for any purposes.       (3) The entities may, among other functions, (a) encourage      participation and support by U.S. multinational companies and      other elements of the private sector for cultural, arts and      educational exchange programs, including those programs that      will enhance international appreciation of America's cultural      and artistic accomplishments; (b) solicit and receive      contributions from the private sector to support these      cultural arts and educational exchange programs; and (c)      provide grants and other assistance for these programs.       (4) The Secretary of State is authorized to make such      arrangements as are necessary to carry out the purposes of      these entities, including the solicitation and receipt of      funds for the entity; designation of a program in recognition      of such contributions; and designation of members, including      employees of the U.S. government, on any board or other body      established to administer the entity.       (5) Any funds available to the Department of State may be      made available to such entities to cover administrative and      other costs for their establishment. Any such entity is      authorized to invest any amounts provided to it by the      Department of State, and such amounts, as well as any      interest or earnings on such amounts, may be used by the      entity to carry out its purposes.                          ____________________
