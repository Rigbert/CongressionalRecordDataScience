 President, I appreciate that very much. Perhapsone way of answering this would be to place in the Record a letter sent to Senator Daschle by the Secretary of the Treasury on February 3. Let me simply read one sentence. Referring to the majority amendment, the Secretary writes:       The amendment as drafted does not distinguish between      capital investment and current spending. Outlays are defined      as ``all outlays in the United States except for those for      repayment of debt principal.'' Even if Congress were to      create a separate capital budget by statute, outlays from      that budget would still be ``outlays of the United States.''      Under the majority amendment, a capital budget would be      prohibited.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                   Department of the Treasury,                                 Washington, DC, February 3, 1997.     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Leader: You asked for our views on whether the      Balanced Budget Amendment (the Amendment), as currently      proposed, would allow Congress to establish a separate      capital budget unconstrained by the Amendment. We discussed      this with counsel and, in our view, the present language of      the Balanced Budget Amendment would not allow for statutorily      exempting capital expenditures from the Amendment's      requirement that ``total outlays for the year shall not      exceed total receipts for that fiscal year.'' Your inquiry      illustrates the inflexibility of the Amendment.       The Amendment as drafted does not distinguish between      capital investment and current spending. Outlays are defined      as ``all outlays of the United States except for those for      repayment of debt principal.'' Even if Congress were to      create a separate capital budget by statute, outlays from      that budget would still be ``outlays of the United States.''      Indeed, a provision in such a statute that capital      expenditures were not ``outlays of the United States'' for      purposes of the Balanced Budget Amendment would be      unconstitutional because, under fundamental principles of      statutory construction, it would be at odds with the express      language and intent of the Amendment.       Proponents of the Balanced Budget Amendment cite the state      experience with balanced budget requirements as precedent for      a federal Constitution amendment. In relation to your      specific question regarding capital budgets, most state      requirements are not analogous because spending for capital      investments does not have to be offset. States with balanced      budget provisions generally have separate operating and      capital budgets. Many states require only the operating      budget to balance--a situation prohibited by the Amendment.      Although the remaining states with balanced budget provisions      also require the capital budget to balance, they include bond      financing for capital expenditures as a receipt. In other      words, in these states, capital funds may use borrowed funds      to balance--a solution expressly barred by the definition of      receipts in the present Balanced Budget Amendment.       Proponents of a capital budget argue that the absence of a      capital budget has reduced investments in infrastructure and      other capital improvements that would add to future growth. I      do not believe we should move to a capital budget, but under      different circumstances in the future, others might want to      do so. The Balanced Budget Amendment before you now would      prevent us from moving to a separate capital budget, even if      we wanted to.       I hope this answers your question. We would be happy to      respond to any further inquiries you may have.           Sincerely,                                                  Robert E. Rubin.
