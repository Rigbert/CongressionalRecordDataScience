President, I am pleased to be joined today by my good friend, the senior senator from Montana, Senator Baucus, in introducing the ``Downtown Equity Act of 1999.''  The location of federal buildings and facilities have a tremendous impact on local communities. We are introducing the ``Downtown Equity Act'' to ensure that the federal government is a good neighbor that promotes the vibrancy of communities throughout the country.  Guidance for federal agencies on the location of their facilities exists in two executive orders. Unfortunately, these directives are at times inconsistent with each other and have been used to support different goals. This became clear to me when I worked closely with the General Services Administration (GSA), the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and the city of Burlington. In 1998, I called together a meeting with all these interested parties to discuss eligible locations for a new INS facility in downtown Burlington. Officials from the city cited one executive order about locating buildings in downtown areas while INS officials countered with another executive order that promotes the location of federal facilities in rural areas. Instead of complementing one another to promote a reasonable policy, the two executive orders are negating each other and clearly neither have enough teeth to result in the policy proclaimed in either order.  Mr. President, managing a city is a difficult enough task. Mayors and city managers across the country should not have to also wade through dueling executive orders when they share the same goals as the Administration to re-energize town centers. The federal government needs to set a clear policy on the location of federal buildings in downtown areas. Without legislation to clarify this policy, agencies make decisions about the location of buildings and operations that can undercut the viability of central business districts, encourage sprawl, degrade the environment, and have an adverse impact on historical economic development patterns. Federal facilities should be sited, designed, built and operated in ways that contribute to--not detract from--the economic well-being and character of our cities and towns. Federal facilities can have a tremendous impact and we need to make sure that location decisions do not erode the character and quality of life in our cities and towns. I want to prevent a repeat of the experiences in Vermont, and I know that Senator Baucus has many of the same concerns in Montana.  The Downtown Equity Act of 1999 clarifies the intention of these dueling executive orders by directing federal officials to give priority to locating federal facilities in central businessareas. This bill does not pit urban areas versus rural areas, but instead promotes the siting of these facilities in downtown areas--urban or rural. By adopting this legislation, the Federal government can become a leader in the effort to limit sprawl and support the economic vitality of central business areas.  There is a fundamental problem with development that our bill also tries to address: it's more expensive to build and rent in a traditional downtown area than to build on an empty site outside of a business district. Downtown areas have great difficulty competing in the procurement process because of the higher costs generally associated with downtown areas. Sometimes, despite the best intentions of federal officials, sites with the lowest absolute cost are predisposed to win. This approach is too simplistic. Our ``Downtown Equity Act of 1999'' directs the General Services Administration to study the feasibility of establishing a system for giving equal consideration to both the absolute and adjusted costs of locating in urban and rural areas, and between projects inside and outside of central business areas. While the absolute cost of projects will always be important, a more balanced and robust consideration of the costs of a project is needed.  The benefits of limiting sprawl, supporting historic development patterns, and revitalizing our downtown central business areas can mitigate the higher costs associated with constructing, leasing, and operating Federal establishments inside central business areas. Unless the overriding mission of the agency or economic prudence absolutely dictate otherwise, location of Federal facilities should be supportive of local growth management plans for downtown central business areas.  When Federal landlords or tenants arrive in town, we have every right to expect that they will be good neighbors. Beyond that, the Federal government also needs to be a leader in the effort to limit sprawl and protect the environment and the character of our cities and towns. Livable and thriving central business districts can be a renewable resource, and the Federal government should be part of the solution, not part of the problem.  Senator Baucus and I look forward to working with our colleagues and with the Executive Branch to bring much needed reform to the decision-making process that governs the siting of Federal facilities. We all recognize that decisions to prevent or limit sprawl will always be made locally, but the Federal Government can do much to help our communities act on their decisions. And, the Federal Government must stop being an unwitting accomplice to sprawl by siting buildings outside of downtown areas.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, and a section-by-section summary of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1896       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Downtown Equity Act of      1999''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that locating Federal      facilities in central business areas--       (1) strengthens the economic base of cities, towns, and      rural communities of the United States and makes them      attractive places to live and work;       (2) enhances livability by limiting sprawl and providing      air quality and other environmental benefits; and       (3) supports historic development patterns.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to ensure that Federal agencies recognize the      implications of the location of Federal facilities on the      character, environment, economic development patterns, and      infrastructure of communities;       (2) to ensure that the General Services Administration and      other Federal agencies that make independent location      decisions give first priority to locating Federal facilities      in central business areas;       (3) to encourage preservation of historic buildings and      stabilization of historic areas; and       (4) to direct the Administrator of General Services to      study the feasibility of establishing a system for meaningful      comparison of Federal facility procurement costs between      central business areas and areas outside central business      areas.

(b) Study.--Not later than 2 years after the date of      enactment of this Act, the Administrator of General Services      shall conduct a study and report to Congress on the      feasibility of establishing a system for--       (1) assessing and giving equal consideration to the      absolute and adjusted comparable costs (as determined under      paragraph (2)) of--       (A) locating Federal facilities in rural areas as compared      to locating Federal facilities in urban areas;       (B) locating Federal facilities in central business areas      of rural areas as compared to locating Federal facilities in      rural areas outside central business areas; and       (C) locating Federal facilities in central business areas      of urban areas as compared to locating Federal facilities in      urban areas outside central business areas;       (2) for the purposes of paragraph (1), adjusting the      absolute comparable costs referred to in that paragraph to      correct for the inherent differences in property values      between rural areas and urban areas; and       (3) assessing and giving consideration to the impacts on      land use, air quality and other environmental factors, and to      historic preservation, in the location of Federal facilities.       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--In addition to      amounts made available under any other law, there is      authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section      $200,000 for each of fiscal years 2001 and 2002.                                  ____               Summary of the Downtown Equity Act of 1999       The ``Downtown Equity Act of 1999'' clarifies a multitude      of Federal laws and regulations governing the location of      Federal office     space and other facilities by requiring that first priority      be given to central business areas. Currently, the location      of federal offices and other facilities is governed by      several different laws and executive orders, which often      creates confusion and conflict. For instance, current law      gives a strong preference to locating Federal facilities in      rural areas, while an Executive Order (No. 12072) promotes      the location of Federal facilities in central business areas.      These conflicting policies can have serious adverse      consequences to communities, such as promoting sprawl and      contributing to the decline of downtown areas.       The ``Downtown Equity Act of 1999'' seeks to eliminate this      confusion by establishing a clear, statutory preference for      locating Federal facilities in central business areas, both      in rural and urban areas. Thus, Federal facilities will help      strengthen the economic base of cities, towns and rural      communities and make them more attractive places to live and      work. Locating Federal facilities in downtown areas will also      support historic development patterns, limit sprawl, and have      other important environmental benefits.       The bill also requires the General Services Administration      (GSA) to study the feasibility of establishing a procurement      assessment system which considers both the absolute and      adjusted costs of locating Federal facilities between central      business areas and outside those areas.                      Section-by-Section Analysis       Section 1. Title.       Section 2. Finding and Purposes       Section 3. Amends the Public Buildings Act of 1959 (40 USC      601 et seq.) to add a new section establishing a preference      for locating Federal facilities in central business areas in      both rural and urban areas. This preference could be waived      if locating a facility in such area would either materially      compromise the mission of the agency or would not be      economically prudent. GSA is required to adopt rules to      implement this provision and also to report annually to the      Congress on the location of Federal agencies under this      section. This section also defines ``central business area''      as the centralized business area determined by local      officials.       Section 4. This section requires that within two years, the      GSA conduct a study and report to Congress on the feasibility      of establishing a system for comparing the absolute and      adjusted costs of locating Federal facilities in rural areas      as compared to urban areas and in central business areas as      compared to outside central business areas. The bill      authorizes a total of $400,000 for the study.
