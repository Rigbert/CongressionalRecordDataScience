 President, I understand the position of my friend from Vermont on this. This Finance Committee meeting obviously will be open to the public. There will be many amendments offered, most of them I expect reflecting the views of the Senator from Vermont, but the meeting will go forward. The committee will simply be inconvenienced by the current actions of the Senator from Vermont, but the committee will go forward. The Senate will be in recess, and the committee will meet at the earliest possible time and finish the bill today.
