President, I would like to tell you about Connie Martin from Sycamore, IL. Connie's son decided to go to culinary school in Chicago 5 years ago at the age of 25. To pay for tuition, he borrowed $58,000 in private loans from Sallie Mae at 18 percent interest. His first payment was $1,100 a month--his entire monthly salary at a downtown eatery where he worked after graduation. His loan balance, including government-backed loans, is now $100,000. Connie's son has been working hard, and she and her husband have been trying to help him make the payments. I worry for borrowers like Connie's son who can't start over and will have debt that will likely haunt him for the rest of his life.  The Chicago Sun-Times recently ran a story that described the devastating effect large student loan debt has on the lives of borrowers. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following article from the Chicago Sun-Times be inserted for the Record.  Private student loans are the fastest growing and most profitable sector of the student loan industry. As college tuition continues to rise, the private loan market flourishes. According to the College Board, tuition, fees, room and board at public 4-year schools have risen by 42 percent over the past 5 years from $9,032 to $12,796. Add books, supplies, transportation and other living expenses, and the total increases to $16,357 for those paying instate tuition and $26,304 for those paying out-of-state tuition. Students rely on private loans to pay for any unmet need that Federal loans and grants fail to cover. According to the College Board, since 2001 the market for private student loans has grown at an annual rate of 27 percent to $17.3 billion in 2006--roughly 20 percent of total student borrowing. Ten years ago, only 5 percent of total education loan volume was in private loans.  Private student loans are more profitable than Federal student loans because lenders can charge whatever interest rate students will pay, barring State usury laws. The interest rates and fees on private loans can be as onerous as credit cards. There are reports of private loans with interest rates of at least 15 percent and often much higher. Unlike Federal student loans, there is no government-imposed loan limit on private loans and no regulation over the terms and cost of these loans.  Today, I am pleased to introduce a bill that will give students, who find themselves in dire financial straits, a chance at a new beginning. My bill takes the bankruptcy law, as it pertains to private student loans, back to where it was before the law was amended in 2005. Under this legislation, privately issued student loans will once again be dischargeable in bankruptcy. My bill also clarifies that existing protections are specific to loans that were issued by or are guaranteed by State and Federal Government.  Federally issued or guaranteed student loans have been protected during personal bankruptcy since 1978. This provision protects Federal investments in higher education. In 2005, a provision was added to law to protect the investments of private lenders participating in the student loan industry. This change in the law creates a couple of problems. First, extending protections to private lenders of student loans but not to other potential creditors who are at risk in a bankruptcy disposition is inherently unfair. Second, such protections are unfair to the debtor. Repayment schedules--with accumulating interest--can extend for decades.  With the 2005 protections in place, there is essentially no risk to lenders making high-cost private loans to people who may not be able to afford them. There is no risk to private lenders extending credit to students at schools with low graduation rates and even lower job placement rates.  Giving private loans such high status in bankruptcy also puts other creditors at a significant disadvantage. No one seems to know how or why private student loans gained this status in 2005. There is nothing in the Congressional Record explaining the reasons behind the change. Why should a private student loan lender be able to jump to the front of the creditor line--in front of the local furniture store or the neighborhood plumber? This bill seeks to restore treatment of privately issued student loans in bankruptcy to the same treatment as any other debt.  There is justification for making Federal loans hard to discharge: they are backed by taxpayer dollars, and they come with some borrower protections in cases of economic hardship, unemployment, death and disability. However, private loans involve only private profit and do not have the protections that government borrowers enjoy, including caps on interest rates, flexible repayment options, and limitedcancellation rights. Why should student borrowers, who are trying to better themselves and our country, be treated in the same manner as people trying to escape child support payments, alimony, overdue taxes, and criminal fines?  The 1950s and 1960s saw the democratization of higher education. The GI Bill provided money for returning WWII veterans to attend college. The National Defense Education Act made college a possibility by making low-interest education loans available for countless students all across the country. Talented kids from working families began realizing the possibility of college, and enrollment at colleges swelled. But since then, college costs have gone through the roof. And students--heeding the call to obtain a good education--are also earning themselves years of debt. The average student is graduating with nearly $20,000 in debt and in many cases--much, much more--just look at Connie Martin's son. Our country has made great strides in making college a reality for countless students. Let's not reverse the positive trend we started over 50 years ago. That is why I am introducing this bill--to give students a chance at a fresh start.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and an article of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1561       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. DISCHARGE IN BANKRUPTCY FOR CERTAIN EDUCATIONAL                    LOANS.       Section 523(a)(8) of title 11, United States Code, is      amended by striking ``dependents, for'' and all that follows      through subparagraph (B) and inserting ``dependents, for an      educational benefit overpayment or loan made, insured, or      guaranteed by a governmental unit, or an obligation to repay      funds received from a governmental unit as an educational      benefit, scholarship, or stipend.''.                                  ____                   [From the Sun Times, May 6, 2007]               Students and Loans: 'Til Death Do Us Part                           (By Dave Newbart)       They liken it to a financial death sentence.       They can't get a car loan, a home mortgage or any other      type of loan. They've lost jobs and even spouses over it.       They are so humiliated they don't want any of their friends      or family to know.       And for most, there is no way out.       They are former students trapped under the weight of      student loans. The same vehicle that allowed them to get a      college education has left many graduates buried in debt with      no reasonable way to climb out.       Some students who never graduate are stuck paying off loans      without the earning power of a degree--an estimated      additional $1 million in lifetime earnings.       And some students who finish can't afford the monthly      payments. Others lose jobs and can't catch back up. Then they      get turned down by employers who increasingly check credit      records before hiring.       Some say they would make small monthly payments to show      good faith--only to see their balances continue to grow and      to receive harassing phone calls from collectors.       To be sure, most borrowers pay on time; default rates are      at an all-time low.       But for those who run into trouble, changes in federal      laws--including many in the last decade--have made student      loans among the hardest debts to discharge. They've also made      the loans among the most lucrative for private lenders, who      face little risk--because the government backs the loans--but      reap the benefits when balances balloon.       Some borrowers say they accept reasonable interest, but      they believe the fees and penalties--which over time can      double or triple the loan balances--are unfair.                     Interest rate over 18 percent       Many of the students awash in debt say that they were      blinded by the promise a college degree holds and unprepared      to take on high levels of debt at such a young age.       Connie Martin's son signed up for cooking school in Chicago      in 2002 at age 25. To pay for it, he borrowed $73,000, mostly      in private loans from Sallie Mae, the largest student lender,      at 18 percent interest.       ``He didn't know what the interest rate was. . . . He just      wanted to go to school,'' said Martin, of Sycamore.       His first payment was $1,100 a month, his entire monthly      salary at a downtown eatery where he went to work after      graduation.       ``I don't understand how they can lend a kid that kind of      money with no credit history, who never owned anything, with      no co-signers,'' said his mother, who only learned of the      situation after the bills started to pile up.       Sallie Mae officials said they no longer offer such high-     interest loans, and have offered students a chance to      refinance at a lower rate if certain conditions are met. ``We      recognize it's high,'' spokeswoman Martha Holler said.       Martin's son declined to comment. His balance has since      grown to $98,000.                     It's like indentured servitude       Greg Treece, of Downstate Mattoon, now wishes he never      enrolled in Washington University's Occupational Therapy      program. ``Choosing an expensive private school and borrowing      the money to go there is the single greatest mistake I have      ever made,'' he said.       Treece took out $84,000 in loans. Six months after he got      out of the St. Louis school, his monthly payment was more      than half his take-home pay for his first job in Chicago. He      later lost his job. With compounding interest, his loan      quickly skyrocketed. At times he seriously wished he could go      to jail in exchange for wiping out the debt.       With a new job, he's managed to pay $60,000, but his      balance remains at $111,000 because of fees, penalties and      interest. ``It's like indentured servitude,'' he said.       For those who default, lenders can truly play hardball,      often employing no-scruples private collection firms that      call borrowers as often as 10 times a day.       Shirley, an Ivy League-educated lawyer, lost her job in      Chicago in the late 1980s. She pleaded for reduced payments      from a collector working for the Illinois Student Assistance      Commission--but was denied.       ``I said you are driving me to bankruptcy,'' she recalled.      ``They wouldn't budge.''       In bankruptcy court ISAC claimed she owed $78,000, which      included $13,000 for collection costs, 20 percent of the      total debt. Nearly all of the debt was eventually erased,      according to court records.       Because that was before the recent law changes, she should      have been clear.                     Loan chief admits ``mistakes''       But several years later, the collectors began calling      again--first from ISAC and then from the U.S. Education      Department. They claimed the bill was now over $100,000.       ``It was as though they were above the law,'' she said. She      eventually went to court again and proved she no longer owed      the money, but her husband left her in the process. She asked      that her real name not be used out of fear of retaliation.       ISAC and the Education Department say they have several      programs that allow students to delay payments in hard times      or make lower ones based on income. Officials say they try to      help borrowers in default get back into good standing, a      process known as rehabilitation. Last year, ISAC rehabbed $30      million in defaulted loans, up from $4.4 million in 2002.       Agency director Andy Davis says the agency has to strike a      balance between helping borrowers repay and making sure      taxpayers aren't left in the lurch.       But he acknowledges his workers ``make mistakes'' and said      he is looking to make changes in some of the outsourcing of      collections.       Then there are those with hard luck, who make bad decisions      or just simply can't get a break.       Richard and Sheila Friese both have degrees from Southern      Illinois University, financed in part on student loans. They      were also both discharged from the Navy after suffering      injuries while serving stateside. Richard is learning      disabled.       They have never been able to find high-paying jobs; now      they both use wheelchairs to get around and suffer from      ailments including arthritis, constant abdominal pain and      chronic fatigue. They're currently fighting with the Veterans      Administration over benefits; they also are wrangling with      the Social Security Administration.                  Collector: ``We will never go away''       They currently have no income to pay off their combined      $141,000 loan balance. ISAC has seized $3,200 in tax refunds      from Sheila, 37. Richard, 49, avoids the phone after      constantly being called by collectors for Sallie Mae--one of      whom he claims called him a ``low-life, S.O.B.'' Holler said      Sallie Mae's collectors are trained in fair debt collection      practices. ``That should not happen,'' she said.       If this were virtually any other debt, experts say, the      couple would be able to discharge some or all of it through      bankruptcy. But the Frieses, of Mundelein, are stuck. ``Our      life has hit a brick wall,'' Richard said.       Davis said it might make sense for the federal government      to ``write off'' debt if borrowers--particularly vets--have      no hope of paying.       Pam, 58, of Dolton, graduated from Downstate SIU-     Edwardsville in 1984, but spent time on welfare. She      eventually defaulted on her loan after a dispute over the      amount of the balance and monthly payments. Her $12,500 in      loans has grown to $28,000. Experts say borrowers should      continue to make payments during a dispute so the loan      doesn't get out of control.       She has gone underground, blocking collectors' calls and      running her own business so her wages can't be garnisheed.      But when collectors do get through, they have a harsh      message. ``When they call they say, `We will never go away      until you are dead.'''
