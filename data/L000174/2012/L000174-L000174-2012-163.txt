President, earlier this week, Senate Republicans followed through on their partisan opposition to the President by slamming the door on a highly qualified, consensus circuit court nominee with bipartisan support. It was the first time in history that a circuit court nominee reported with bipartisan support from the Judiciary Committee was successfully filibustered. Judge Robert Bacharach, who was nominated to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, had had the strong support of his Republican home State Senators, Senator Coburn and Senator Inhofe. Unfortunately, they chose not to vote to end the unprecedented filibuster of his nomination and cloture fell just short. This deprived the people of Oklahoma and the Tenth Circuit of an outstanding judge who could today be serving the American people as an appellate judge. The Bacharach nomination is one of the many judicial nominees ready for final action by the Senate but being delayed by Republican opposition.  There was an article in the Washington Post this morning entitled ``A Bench with Plenty of Room'' about the judicial vacancies being perpetuated by partisanship all to the detriment of those seeking justice in our Federal courts. It notes that a lower percentage of President Obama's nominees have been confirmed than had been during the Bush administration and that at this point during the Bush Presidency there were only 28 judicial vacancies. It observes that ``Obama, with 78 vacancies, may be the first president in decades to end his first term with more judicial vacancies than when he began.'' We can change that if Senate Republicans will cooperate in the consideration of the 23 judicial nominees on the Senate Executive Calendar awaiting a final, up-or-down confirmation vote. I ask that a copy of that article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, Aug. 1, 2012]                      A Bench With Plenty of Room       The Senate's rejection Monday of Oklahoma Magistrate Judge      Robert Bacharach for a U.S. Court of Appeals seat sent a      clear message to the three other appellate nominees hoping      for a vote on the Senate floor:       Fuhgeddaboudit.       Ditto for 16 U.S. District Court nominees also pending in      committee. The odds of judicial confirmations after this      August recess are exceptionally slim--at best. The Cubs will      win the pennant before you'll be putting on the black robes.       No nominees were confirmed after the August recess when      President Bill Clinton was running for reelection in 1996 and      only three when President George W. Bush was running for a      second term in 2004--although five got in during the lame-     duck session.       Still, a whopping 13 George H.W. Bush nominees, including      two for appellate seats, were confirmed after the August      recess in 1992, according to Senate Judiciary Committee      statistics.       Four Clinton judicial picks were confirmed after the recess      in 2000, when Bush II and Al Gore were running, and 10 Bush      judges were confirmed during the race between Barack Obama      and John McCain, the committee reports.       So with the numbers pretty much set, let's recap.       President Barack Obama, who started off slowly in getting      nominations up to the Senate, never fully caught up. He's      nominated fewer judges (200) than either Bush (228) or      Clinton (245) on Aug. 1 of their fourth year in office,      according to committee statistics.       At the same time, the Senate has confirmed a smaller      percentage of Obama nominees than Clinton nominees--78      percent, compared with 80.8 percent--and a much smaller      percentage than in the Bush administration (86.4).       As a result, Obama, with 78 vacancies, may be the first      president in decades to end his first term with more judicial      vacancies than when he started.       At this point in their first terms, Clinton had 58 judicial      vacancies and Bush had 28. (The latter figure is pretty much      full employment.)       Liberals have criticized Obama for not having pushed harder      for his nominees, noting that Bush issued a lengthy statement      at a 2002 news conference blasting ``a handful'' of Senate      Democrats for holding up his judicial nominees because they      ``fear the outcome of a fair vote in the full Senate.''       ``The Senate has an obligation to provide fair hearings and      prompt votes to all nominees,'' Bush said, ``no matter who      controls the Senate or who controls the White House.'' Obama      did, however, mention Senate delays in a State of the Union      address and in a Saturday radio address, we were told. And      Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) intends to      keep moving nominees this fall. Well, who knows? Deals are      always possible.       But, after those recess appointments of the consumer      finance watchdog and some labor folks in January, furious      Republicans are not feeling particularly cooperative on      appointments.
