  The AgJOBS bill was negotiated over 7 years between the growers and the United Farm Workers Union and others. So it is a negotiated product. I actually thought that we had satisfied the Senator's concerns in many of our discussions. I am trying to recall, but I believe there were at least three areas where we made some changes specifically because of the Senator's concerns in the discussions that we had.  So I thought we had agreement on the H-2A part of the bill, which I believe was your interest, in return for which, with respect to the earned adjustment part of the bill, I would be happy to discuss this with you more. But the bill is based on, if a worker has worked in agriculture, he or she can submit documentation to that effect, for so many hours over so many years, that individual can get what we call ablue card in the original bill and continue to work in agriculture for a substantial additional period. If they satisfied the hours, the filing, the taxes, and everything required of them, then they could apply after that period for a green card. That is as far as our bill went, the original bill.
