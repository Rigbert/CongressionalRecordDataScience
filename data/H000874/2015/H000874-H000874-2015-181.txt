 Mr. Speaker, I think what I hear is we are not going to reach bipartisan agreement on that, and that is unfortunate.  The cybersecurity bill, as the gentleman mentioned, will we consider the two cybersecurity-related bills together or separately? We have heard some information over here about whether they may be joined together or whether we are to consider them discretely, each one of them. I think they are relatively noncontroversial in some respects. But would the gentleman tell us how they might be considered?  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman knows, I usually don't like to get ahead of the Rules Committee, but we will consider these bills separate but then joined together and sent to the Senate.
