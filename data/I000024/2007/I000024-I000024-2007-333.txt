President, recent events in Somalia have opened a unique window of opportunity. The Islamic Courts have been militarily defeated. However, the Ethiopian troops that are currently maintaining order have stated that they have no intention of remaining. There are reports oftroop withdrawals back to the Ethiopian border. Without outside support I fear that the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and Somalia as a whole will be swept back into the cycle of violence and chaos that has defined the country for the past 15 years.  I believe that the United States can make great progress in securing the Horn of Africa by what actions we take right now. First and foremost is security. Until the government troops can offer sustainable stability, we need to assist them. This solution need not include U.S. troops; I am aware of negotiations for the deployment of 8,000 troops from other African countries, including a force of about 1,000 from Uganda. Any efforts in this direction should be greatly encouraged.  The United States has no formal representative to the Somali Republic. The Transitional Federal Government has requested creating such a position.  We need to offer assistance and aid at this most crucial juncture. At an appropriate time the U.S. should encourage public and private investment, possibly through a trade mission. Other areas where help is greatly needed include security training, basic sanitation, water purification, and tax collection.  Perhaps most importantly, we should assist in any steps that can be taken to establish a national unity government. This will require groups from all sides of the spectrum getting together and working out serious solutions.  The United States can make great progress in securing the Horn of Africa by what actions we take right now. I am submitting a resolution expressing the following: support for the Transitional Federal Government; recognize Ethiopia, particularly Prime Minister Meles, and Kenya for the noble efforts aimed toward pursuing peace in Somalia and support for the United States in the War on Terror; and the U.S. should support and push efforts for serious multi-party talks aimed at establishing a national unity government.  There are a number of measures that should be taken at an appropriate time by the United States to promote stability. With the assistance of the U.S., the TFG will be better equipped to face the challenges of restoring peace to this war-torn country.  While I understand that the situation is volatile and some forms of assistance may not be immediately appropriate, I believe it is necessary to raise awareness that there are definite ways that we can affect progress. Please join me in supporting Somalia and bringing peace to this war-torn region.                          ____________________
