President, I speak today with a profound sense of loss. A brave, young soldier from my home State of Oregon, Brandon S. Tobler, was killed in Iraq. Oregon's first war fatality, Army Reserve SP Brandon Tobler, who was only 19, lost his life in a Humvee accident during a sand storm. I have the last correspondence Brandon's parents received from their son, an e-mail sent just 2 weeks prior to his death on March 22, 2003.  Brandon was the only son of Leon and Gail Tobler of Portland. He grew up there and joined the military to help pay for college. He was in a convoy headed to Baghdad providing engineering support to the combat troops. Private Tobler's death reminds us that a soldier doesn't have to be on the combat line to face tremendous danger and possible death. His letter reminds of the bravery of each and every person who puts on a uniform for the United States. Private Tobler will be laid to rest in the Willamette National Cemetery in Portland, OR, on April 3, 2003.  I ask unanimous consent that Brandon's letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Hey Mom and Dad, How are things with you, I hope you are      both doing ok. I am doing fine, things here are going ok we      are just keeping busy. I am a little stressed but other than      that I am alright, I have been loaded down with a lot of      tasks that I have     not even been trained for, but I think I am doing an ok job.      Anyway I am sorry that I have not written you guys lately and      I know I have been writing Val a bit more than you guys and      that is something I really intend to change, I just want you      guys to know that I miss you guys a lot and love you guys      even more and I thank you both for the person you made me      become and all of the things you have struggled to get me      over the years. I really appreciate the support that you guys      have given me and accepting my enlistment in the Army. I feel      that if I can make a difference out here then I have done my      part. If I can save one life, if I can do something that      makes a family sleep easier at night without fear then I have      done my purpose, cause I know now that's what my calling is      in life, not to make money or be powerful and wealthy but to      simply make a difference. And I thank you my loving parents      for all that you have done to get me this far, but now I have      to take the next step and make a difference for someone else      out there. Well go ahead and pass this around to everyone in      the family, Val too . . . And to the family my love and best      wishes and prayers go out to you, little Veronica or shall I      say big Veronica, I miss playing with her and being her big      cousin but at least my being here will help keep her safe and      grow up happy and full of life as she is already. So to my      family, if you see a soldier one of my comrades in arms,      please thank them for the service they give, pray for them      because we as soldiers give up sooo much to come out here and      in sometimes make the ultimate sacrifice in the name of      freedom and soldiers could always use encouragement and a      thanks. . . Well my love to you guys and I'll see you soon. .      .           Love to all,     Brandon.                          ____________________
