This reminds me of a situation quite a few years ago, when the Department came out with a requirement that all Medicare patients would have to be reviewed by a doctor every 24 hours. At the time I said I was for that, stunning all of the health care folks in my district. I was in the House of Representatives then. I said: Surely, if they are going to require a 24-hour reporting requirement by a doctor, they will furnish us the doctor. There was sort of a method to the madness.  At any rate, as I have indicated, there is an 18-page initial assessment that must be completed by a registered nurse. A 13-page followup assessment is required every 60 days. This is on top of assessments already required by the State. That is very important. It isn't as if there is no regulatory function to safeguard the interests of the patients and the taxpayer. The paperwork burden is immense. I am curious about what is included in this assessment. Is the Senator aware of the nature of the questions?
