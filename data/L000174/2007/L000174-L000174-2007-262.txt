President, of all programs to cut funding for, it would be hard to think of anything more shortsighted than to cut funding for the Global Environment Facility. Unless, I guess, you are among the dwindling few who still believes global warming is a hoax, that the pollution of the Earth's rivers and sources of drinking water is of no concern, that the destruction of the remaining areas of tropical forests and endangered species does not matter, and that we don't need the ozone layer.  Because that is what the GEF works to protect or prevent, and the United States has been a leader in the GEF and the President has requested the funding in the bill for it.
