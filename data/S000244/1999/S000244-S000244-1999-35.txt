Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1402. Frankly, I find it ridiculous that we are even discussing this bill here today. We all know that free markets are far preferable to out-dated government price control schemes, yet we are discussing a bill to block even modest market-oriented dairy policy reforms.  The free market has served American producers and consumers exceptionally well. Car prices are not determined according to the distance that they are manufactured from Detroit, software prices are not set by the distance that they are produced from Silicon Valley, and orange prices are not established according to the distance from Florida to where they are grown. Instead, the free market is allowed to determine the prices for these products. Not coincidentally, these industries are thriving. Conversely, milk prices are determined by the distance of the producer from Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and small dairy farmers across the country are struggling to survive. It should be clear that the free market provides the best system for determining prices in America, no matter the product.  The Department of Agriculture's milk marketing order reforms, though certainly less market-based than I had hoped, represent a common-sense step toward simplifying the pricing of milk. Dairy farmers across the country voted in support of this reform by 97 percent. Ignoring this vote, H.R. 1402 would essentially maintain the status quo in milk pricing and force dairy farmers to continue to struggle under the current antiquated government restraints. For the sake of farmers and consumers, I urge you to oppose H.R. 1402 and support market-oriented dairy reforms.
