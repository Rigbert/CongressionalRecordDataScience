 President, now on another matter, if I sound like a broken record discussing the pro-growth, pro-worker trend in our Nation's economy, it is because the headlines continue to roll in faster than I can relate them.  Here is one headline from last week: ``Small-business confidence hits another record high.'' And one industry survey reports more optimism among small business owners this month than at any time in the past 35 years.  Another headline: ``U.S. jobless claims fall for a second straight week.'' That one comes not long after the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits hit a 49-year low last month.  And another: ``U.S. retail sales increase strongly in July.'' In fact, they are up 6.4 percent over 1 year ago.  An economy that is expanding, bringing more people into the workforce, and encouraging investment at all levels--reports like these are exactly what Republicans had in mind when we began implementing our pro-growth, pro-opportunity agenda last year.  But while we worked to pass the historic tax reform and regulatory reforms that are helping create these conditions, our Democratic colleagues offered up a different set of predictions.
