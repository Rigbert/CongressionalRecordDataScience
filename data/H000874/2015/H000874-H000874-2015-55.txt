Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I will say to my friend from Texas, there were 3 years to do exactly that. It wasn't done.  I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for yielding, and I thank him for his courage and Mr. Lucas' courage for working within the rules to bring this matter to the floor. It is an important matter.                              {time}  1845  Since July, businesses and workers across the country have been asking Congress to reopen the Export-Import Bank so that they could compete on a level playing field in overseas markets. This is about jobs and a competitive America. Opening the Export-Import Bank, Mr. Speaker, is about creating and keeping jobs here in America.  A motion on the floor tonight will demonstrate that a majority of this House supports taking action to pass a multiyear extension of the Bank's charter authority. We will have achance to show the American people that Congress can work together, Democrats and Republicans, to get something done that helps businesses and workers compete and create jobs.
