As my colleagues know, this fund was requested by the President as part of his Faith-Based Initiative. This is a significant amount of money and I want to note that the Senate has not yet considered legislation authorizing various aspects of the President's Faith-Based Initiative, including provisions which might alter longstanding rules on government funding of religious organizations.  Therefore, I would like to clarify several points with the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee about the uses of these funds. It is my understanding that this fund is supposed to provide grants to organizations for the purpose of advising charitable organizations on expanding their operations effectively and providing guidance on how to emulate model social service practices. Am I correct on that point?
