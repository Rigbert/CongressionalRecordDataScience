 President, I rise today to pay tribute to an honored Kentuckian who has worked to better the Commonwealth. Mr. Tess Lipps of Clay County, KY, was named to the Clay County Days Wall of Fame in August 2012 for the extraordinary work he has accomplished in his community during his lifetime.  Tess Lipps was born July 8, 1947, in a section of Clay County known as Martin's Creek. Growing up with eight brothers and sisters, Tess and siblings learned what some would call the essentials in life: integrity to others and faith in God. Upon graduating from Clay County High School in 1964, Tess applied these essentials to his life.  In 1971, Tess married Barbara Hicks. From this critical point in life, Tess and Barb spent the next greater portion of their lives living to serve God and their community. They became youth leaders at the Manchester Pentecostal Church and taught a teenage boys' Sunday school class. In 1972, the couple opened the first Christian bookstore in the area in which they lived, the Gospel Variety Shoppe.  Tess continued to accomplish and succeed in a plethora of activities. He became an agent with the Commonwealth Insurance Company in 1984. Progressing through the ranks, he was promoted to sales manager and also branch manager. He retired from this position in 2003, but his work to the community did not cease.  In addition to serving as a board member of Agape and emcee of the Halleluiah Day Festivals, Tess answered his calling in life and became pastor of the Manchester Gospel Mission Church in 2006. Tess also formed the Clay County Cancer Coalition and the UPWARD Soccer Program in Clay County, despite some doubts from others. He was told that the community and church were too small to support such large programs. But Tess's faith allowed him to dream the impossible, and then accomplish that dream.  This year, 250 kids played soccer on a brandnew field in the community. Tess and Barb have been blessed beyond measure. The wish of Tess for the community is that all people can work together making greater opportunities for future generations. Mr. Tess Lipps has served his community well.  At this time, I would like to ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in honoring Mr. Tess Lipps, an individual whose hard work and dedication to the community, combined with faith and persistence, has forever changed the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  A news story highlighting the achievements of Tess Lipps was recently published in the Manchester Enterprise. I ask unanimous consent that said story be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Manchester Enterprise, Aug. 30, 2012]                Lipps Known for Commitment to Community  Clay County Days Hall of Fame sponsored by the Manchester Enterprise       Tess Lipps, recognized this year as a Clay County Days Hall      of Fame inductee, is known as a community volunteer who      helped form the Clay County Cancer Coalition and UPWARD      Soccer.       Lipps was born July 8, 1947, in the Martin's Creek Section      of Clay County, along with eight brothers and sisters. His      parents, Henry and Georgia Lipps, instilled honesty, faith,      and a hard working ethic.       He attended a two-room school at Martin's Creek for seven      years, and was part of the first graduating class of the new      Goose Rock Elementary in 1960. He graduated from Clay County      High School in 1964.       He and his wife, the former Barbara Hicks, were youth      leaders at the Manchester Pentecostal Church for over 13      years, and taught a teenage boys' Sunday school class for the      next 12 years.       In 1972, they opened the first Christian book store in the      area, and operated it until they sold it in 1983.       He became an agent with Commonwealth Insurance in 1984, and      served in that capacity until he was promoted to sales      manager in 1997. He was promoted to branch manager in 2001,      and was there until his retirement in 2003.       A dream of his was realized in January 2006 when he became      pastor of the Manchester Gospel Mission Church.       In May of that year, he was part of a group of concerned      citizens that formed the Clay County Cancer Coalition. He was      president of the coalition for five years, stepping down in      June of this year.       In 2009, he and the congregation of the church, with the      leadership of Joe and Tracy Farmer, started the UPWARD Soccer      Program. This year, 250 youth are playing on a new field,      with a vision for greater things in the future.       Lipps and his wife have a son, a daughter, and two      goddaughters, along with grandchildren.                          ____________________
