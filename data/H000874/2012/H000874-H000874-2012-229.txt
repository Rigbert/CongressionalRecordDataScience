I think that's a good practice. Frankly, I would have liked to have done that when we were in charge, and we didn't get that done. I said then that I didn't think it was good for the institution for the consideration of appropriation bills, and you, I think, rightfully criticized us for that--not you, personally, but the Republican side of the aisle.  Is it your intention to bring the appropriations bills to the floor singly, individually, with an open rule as Speaker Boehner indicated would be the case, and, if so, when will that occur?  I yield to my friend.
