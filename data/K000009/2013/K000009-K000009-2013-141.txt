 His amendment would cut funding from the weapons account in the amount that was added to the President's budget request for the B61. In these tight fiscal times, all programs must find efficiencies, and the $23.7 million was the amount that the administration estimated could be achieved for this activity.  So I want to thank the gentleman very much for his efforts and for waiting all day. We have to proceed in order.  I know it's excruciatingly difficult for such an athlete, like yourself, with all that pent-up energy and drive, to have to wait until this late in the evening, but we thank you for the contribution you have made in many ways, including in offering this amendment tonight.  I ask my colleagues to support his efforts, and I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Quigley).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
