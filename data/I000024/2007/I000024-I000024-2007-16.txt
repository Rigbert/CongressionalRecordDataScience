President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his comments. He is exactly right. If there was time, I would repeat some of the things we talked about last night that the Senator from North Dakota was very complimentary on regarding the history of appropriators versus authorizers since 1816.  I believe what is at stake is the authorization system, which I believe is the only discipline we have in the appropriations process.
