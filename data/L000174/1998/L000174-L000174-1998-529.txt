President, in the global battle against infectious diseases, inaccessibility to safe and effective drugs remains a major obstacle for developing countries. The lack of the public health infrastructure to respond effectively to infectious diseases contributes to widespread and needless suffering. Even where that infrastructure exists, many of the world's poor cannot afford the price of drugs.  But many disfiguring and debilitating diseases can be prevented at minimal cost--in some cases with just one pill, once a year, for as little as a few cents per dose. Last May, the Foreign Operations Subcommittee heard testimony about the need for pharmaceutical companies and governments to work together to combat infectious diseases around the world. Dr. Gordon Douglas, the President of Merck Vaccines, described the company's success with the donation of its drug, Mectizan, in fighting river blindness. Since 1987, Merck has treated 18 million people, spending $70 million on the program in 1996 alone. While the global elimination of river blindness is not expected until at least 2007, Merck has made an invaluable contribution toward this goal.  Last November, Congress provided an additional $50 million to strengthen global surveillance and control the spread of infectious diseases. On December 16, 1997, amid alarming reports about the Hong Kong flu, the U.S. Agency for International Development gathered public health experts from around the world to set priorities and develop a U.S. strategy to support the global campaign against infectious diseases. And then on January 26, 1998, Smithkline Beecham, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, announced that it was taking on elephantiasis, one of the world's most disabling and disfiguring tropical diseases which afflicts some 120 million people, and endangers as many as one billion people. Smithkline Beecham has generously agreed to provide for free an anti-parasitic drug called Albendazole to combat this scourge. The company estimates that it will spend some $500 million over the next two decades working with the World Health Organization to tackle elephantiasis in parts of Africa, Asia, the Pacific Islands, and Central and South America. Over time, the effort could even lead to the eventual elimination of this horrible disease. In addition to protecting against elephantiasis, it is predicted that the yearly distribution of Albendazole will improve the health of millions of children who suffer from chronic intestinal parasites.  Mr. President, Merck and Smithkline deserve our praise and gratitude. This kind of cooperative initiative between governments and private industry is a model for how we can combat infectious diseases in the years ahead, and in doing so make life better for millions and millions of people.                          ____________________
