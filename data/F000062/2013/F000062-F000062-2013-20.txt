 President, I rise today to introduce legislation to commemorate one of our nation's greatest heroes, Neil Armstrong, by re-designating the Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards Air Force Base as the Neil A. Armstrong Flight Research Center.  The legislation will also rename the Western Aeronautical Test Range at Edwards Air Force Base as the Hugh L. Dryden Aeronautical Test Range, as a tribute to Dr. Dryden's enduring legacy.  There are few men in history who have made such substantial contributions to our understanding of aeronautics and our solar system.  Neil Armstrong took the most important steps in the history of mankind when he stepped off Apollo 11.  Dr. Dryden shaped the principles and policies that led to the development of the nation's first high speed aircraft.  Their work in the Antelope Valley, outside Los Angeles, helped create one of our nation's most productive high-skilled manufacturing hubs. Their legacy remains today, and it is fitting that their names are attached to these outstanding facilities.  Dr. Hugh Dryden was one of our Nation's first and most prominent scholars in the fields of high speed aeronautics and aerodynamics.  Dr. Dryden began his distinguished career at the Bureau of Standards and quickly rose to become the Associate Director by 1934.  During World War II, Dr. Dryden dedicated his considerable talents to serving armed forces as a scientific advisor, working on aeronautical matters and guided missiles. For his work on these issues, Dr. Dryden received the Medal of Freedom from the Army in 1946 and Presidential Certificate of Merit in 1948--two of our nation's highest honors for civilian service.  Following the war, Hugh Dryden became the Director of the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics, NACA. Eventually, when the advisory committee was formalized in 1958 and became the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, Dr. Dryden served as its first Deputy Director.  Neil Armstrong is another man that inspired Americans to look to the skies. He may have been born in Ohio, but his life's work was done in California.  In his early years he was stationed in San Diego as a Naval Aviator. Although he left the state to pursue an undergraduate degree, he returned shortly thereafter to become a test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base.  As a NASA test pilot, Armstrong flew more than 200 different models of aircraft. His experience included work with jets, helicopters, rockets and gliders, and he became one of the best known pilots of the X-15 test plane.  Even before he became an astronaut, Armstrong reached unbelievable heights and speeds. While working with the X-15 from November 1960 to July 1962, he reached a top altitude of 207,500 feet and a top speed of 3,989 mph.  Neil Armstrong logged an incredible 2,400 flight hours as a test pilot at Dryden Flight Research Center before setting his sights even higher.  In 1962, Neil Armstrong became an Astronaut.  His career as an Astronaut began with Gemini 8 in 1966. The mission began with a landmark success--Neil Armstrong and his partner David Scott successfully docked their Gemini capsule with the Agena satellite in orbit. It was the first time two spacecraft linked up in space.  However, shortly after the docking, the spacecraft began to spin out of control. After the spacecraft separated, Gemini and its astronauts were rolling at a revolution per second. The violent revolutions threatened the vision and consciousness of Armstrong and Scott, and so Armstrong made the controversial decision to abort the mission. Gemini 8 splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean safely, but only part of its mission had been accomplished.  As a veteran astronaut, Armstrong was an obvious choice for the Apollo missions.  His first assignment was Apollo 11; it was the fifth manned Apollo mission and the first manned landing on the lunar surface. Accompanying Armstrong on the mission were Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins--both accomplished astronauts in their own right.  The Apollo 11 crew launched atop a Saturn V rocket from Cape Canaveral on July 16, 1969. It took more than four days for the crew to reach the lunar surface. Armstrong and Aldrin approached the lunar surface while Collins manned the command vehicle in orbit.  The goal was to find a safe landing zone, which proved more difficult than expected. With only 25 seconds of fuel remaining, the ``Eagle'' landed on July 20, 1969, at the Sea of Tranquility.  As he stepped off Apollo 11, Armstrong uttered his famous words, ``That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.''  Armstrong and Aldrin spent two and a half hours on the lunar surface. They took photographs, inspected the condition of the lander, and planted the American Flag to commemorate their incredible achievement.  It was the first and last time Armstrong would visit the moon. Shortly after Apollo 11's safe return to Earth, Armstrong announced that he did not intend to fly in space again.  But his time in public life was not quite finished. Armstrong toured the world as a celebrity on the ``Giant Leap'' tour. He visited the Soviet Union to meet with the Premier and joined Bob Hope on a USO tour in Vietnam.  Upon his return, Armstrong completed his Master of Science in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Southern California.  He worked briefly for the Advanced Research Projects Agency, or ARPA, and served as Deputy Associate Administrator for Aeronautics at NASA.  In 1971, he returned to Ohio to teach the next generation of engineers at the University of Cincinnati. By the end of his career, Armstrong had been decorated by 17 countries and received many notable honors, including: the Presidential Medal of Freedom; the Congressional Gold Medal; the Congressional Space Medal of Honor; the Explorers Club Medal; the Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophy; the NASA Distinguished Service Medal; the Harmon International Aviation Trophy; the Royal Geographic Society's Gold Medal; the Federation Aeronautique Internationale's Gold Space Medal; the American Astronautical Society Flight Achievement Award; the Robert J. Collier Trophy; the AIAA Astronautics Award; the Octave Chanute Award; and the John J. Montgomery Award.  His long list of accolades demonstrates just how incredible and inspirational Armstrong was, not only for California and our nation, but around the world as well.  Tragically, we lost Neil A. Armstrong on August 25 last year. But his legacy will live on and continue to inspire the next generation of engineers, scientists, and astronauts.  In a fitting tribute, NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden said that: ``As long as there are history books, Neil Armstrong will be included in them, remembered for taking humankind's first small step on a world beyond our own.''  Neil Armstrong's work, career, and legacy have inspired many accomplishments and discoveries beyond his own personal achievements. It is only fitting that the Dryden Flight Research Center, which is located at the base where his career quite literally took off, be renamed in his honor.  This is a simple bill that will help to appropriately pay tribute to two individuals who have helped shape and define the space and aeronautical industries. I urge my colleagues to support this bill to re-designate the Dryden Flight Research Center as the Neil A. Armstrong Flight Research Center and the Western Aeronautical Test Range as the Hugh L. Dryden Aeronautical Test Range.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1636       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
