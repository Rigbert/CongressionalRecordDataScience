Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from New York for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, once again, I rise in disbelief about what the House is about to do today. It is my belief that we are moving down the wrong road.  Before we left for Thanksgiving, the Republican leadership twisted arms to pass a bill slashing funding for vital programs that benefit the neediest Americans. Some might say that the bill was callous. I say that the bill was immoral. Today, it is still immoral, uncaring, and without compassion.  But now, to add insult to injury, we have returned to Washington so that the Republican majority can line the pockets of those at the very top. That is right, they cut vital programs and services that benefit hardworking, low- and middle-income Americans, and with the money saved they are giving more tax cuts to the wealthiest of the wealthy. And in the process of robbing working families to give to the rich, we are ballooning the debt, saddling our children and grandchildren with the bill.  Everybody loses under this bill. Everybody. That is except the top one-fifth of 1 percent. Some might call them the super rich; apparently the majority calls them donors.  It is unbelievable. It is unbelievable that we are doing this during this season. The holy season. It is unreal. This season, of all seasons, you would think they would not have the audacity, the gall to pass such a disgraceful and shameful piece of legislation. Oh, but they do.  Where is our compassion? All of the great religions of the world speak to the issue of taking care of basic human needs. During this season, the question must be asked: What would the great teacher do? What would Jesus do?  We are saying we are people of faith, and yet during this most holy season we do this? Have we lost our way? How long, but oh, how long will we continue to take care of those at the very top and not those in the middle and those at the very bottom? How long, but oh, how long?  This bill is not fair. It is not right. It is not just. As a Nation and as a people, as a Congress, we can do better. Mr. Speaker, I appeal to my colleagues to reject this shameful bill.                              {time}  1100
