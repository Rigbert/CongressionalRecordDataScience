President, before I give a statement on another topic, I would like to note that we continue to focus on the damage that was caused last Sunday by deadly tornadoes and storms in Illinois, estimated to have exceeded $1 billion in cost.  We have seen some scenes from that wreckage in places such as Washington, IL--the hardest hit in our State. They experienced an EF4 tornado, with wind speeds close to 200 miles an hour.  I can recall one news report where a man went home and could not find his SUV--an indication of the ferocity and the intensity of the winds that wiped a swath of devastation through this great town in central Illinois.  Power lines are still down, and there are gas leaks. There is still danger there. But the first responders were there. The obvious helpers, the Red Cross and Salvation Army, are on the scene. Federal, State, and local agencies are pitching in.  Equally important--I spoke to the mayor--the people are pitching in. Those who survived are helping those who have had the most damage: finding them a place to sleep, making sure they have enough to eat, trying to put their lives back together and go through the salvage and recover the important items to their families.  The EF4 that tore through Washington was one of two that touched down in my State that day. The other one struck New Minden, which is down near the metro East St. Louis area, and caused unbelievable damage.  All told, 84 tornadoes were reported throughout the Midwest on Sunday.  We know more about the people whose lives were lost in this terrible event. Three died in Massac County, in deep southern Illinois: Kathy George, who was 58 years old, a devoted wife and mother; Robert Harmon, an avid motorcyclist; Scholitta Burrus, who was excited to visit her son for Thanksgiving. In Washington County, a brother and sister--Joseph and Frances Hoy--died in a tornado. They lived together on a farm near New Minden.  Joseph Hoy was president of the Midwest Bird and Animal Breeders Association. In Tazewell County, Steve Neubauer, of Washington--he was a mechanic and often helped his neighbors repair their tractors and lawnmowers.  My thoughts and prayers are with their families and friends. It is bad enough to lose your home, but someone you love is irreplaceable. I want them to know we are thinking of them at this moment.  There is a lot to do. We have to pitch in and help the communities that have been so heavily hit. I said before and I will say again that there are certain occurrences that come through these disasters that are inspiring. I know a year from now we will go back to these neighborhoods and marvel at the progress that has been made as people rebuild their homes and their lives and their playgrounds and their churches and their schools. They do not quit; they do not give up.  Secondly, we will have a litany of examples of people who reached out and helped others in a selfless, caring, compassionate way. As I said, it is not unique to Illinois; it is not unique to the Midwest; it may not even be unique to America. But each time we go through one of those tests, it warms our hearts to know that people do respond so well to help one another.  We are going to continue to keep in touch with the Governor and local officials and provide the Federal assistance on a bipartisan basis that will help these communities and families get their lives back together.                          ____________________
