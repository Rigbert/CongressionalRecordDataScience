 President, we have heard in the Senate today and last night that the comparative cost adjustment demonstration project, which some of the Members refer to as premium support, would end Medicare as we know it. I want to be very clear, nothing could be further from the truth. I have 10 facts about this demonstration to explain why this is not the case. We are talking about the comparative cost adjustment.  Fact No. 1: It sunsets in 6 years.
