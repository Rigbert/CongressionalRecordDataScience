Speaker, this September a record number of children entered elementary and secondary schools across this country. Every one of them should be concerned about what the House Republicans did with respect to education. Although we have never had so many children in our schools, House Republicans cut funding for elementary and secondary education by $400 million.  In subcommittee I offered an amendment to add $2.1 billion to Head Start and education. It was defeated on a party-line vote. On the floor, House Democrats offered an amendment to add these desperately needed funds. It was defeated on a party line vote.  But yesterday, the Senate voted to add $2.3 billion to educate America's children. I hope that House Republicans have done their homework and will support this very important add-on for America's children and America's families.                          ____________________
