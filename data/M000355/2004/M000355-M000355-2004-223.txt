 President, this morning, the Senate will be in a period for morning business to accommodate several Members who have statements to make. I do not anticipate a long session today, and once we complete our business, we will adjourn until Monday. As we announced last night, no rollcall votes will occur during today's session of the Senate.  As a reminder to Senators, on Monday we will begin consideration of the intelligence reform bill. No rollcall votes will occur on Monday. However, we anticipate that amendments will be offered and debated during Monday's session. Any votes ordered with respect to those amendments will occur Tuesday morning. Therefore, Senators can expect the next vote or votes to occur sometime Tuesday morning. As always, we will notify our colleagues as any votes are ordered.                          ____________________
