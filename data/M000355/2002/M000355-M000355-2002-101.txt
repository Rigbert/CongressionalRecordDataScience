  According to the report, Serbian officials have publicly admitted to providing salaries to over 29,800 people in Kosovo, including Serb ``bridgewatchers'' over the river Ibar who were responsible for injuring 26 United Nations Missions in Kosovo, UNMIK, police officers in a shootout 2 months ago.  Five Americans serving with UNMIK were injured in that incident. While my thoughts and prayers are with the policemen as they recover, I find it completely unacceptable that Serbian government-backed goons have committed destabilizing acts of violence with virtual impunity. The bridgewatchers and other criminals in northern Kosovo must be brought to justice--a job perhaps best handled by UNMIK police officers backed by NATO-led KFOR troops.  Now is not the time for a change in U.S. policy toward Kosovo. America must publicly and forcefully condemn any covert or overt efforts to partition Mitrovica from the rest of Kosovo.  I encourage the State Department to find its voice on this issue, and to publicly condemn the actions of the bridgewatchers and their supporters in Belgrade. This issue should not be left to the gentle massage of quiet diplomacy--this is a cancer that must be treated in an aggressive and forthright manner.  It seems clear to me that if Serbia has 50,000,000 Euro to support the partition of Kosovo, the U.S. Congress should consider reducing future foreign assistance to Serbia by an equivalent amount.  The reformers in Serbia know they have my full support and encouragement. However, Serbia would be wise to invest its revenues in its own political, economic, legal, and social reforms rather than fomenting and sponsoring regional unrest.                          ____________________
