The Republicans are saying there is a double standard. All of the Deputy Attorneys General nominated by Republican presidents have been confirmed, most by voice vote, within a month. This one has waited on the floor for over 4 months and we still cannot even get a vote. As Senators, we should all at least have the courage to vote yes or to vote no. Eventually, we have to stop voting maybe. It allows everybody to go home and say: I may be here on an issue or I may be there. We are Senators and we must have the courage to vote yes or to vote no. We cannot continue to vote maybe, especially on the No. 2 law enforcement officer of the United States. President Bush's first deputy, was confirmed within 24 hours of being reported from Committee, while James Cole has waited 6 months for a vote. Voting maybe is not a profile in courage in the Senate.  I yield to the Senator from Maryland.
