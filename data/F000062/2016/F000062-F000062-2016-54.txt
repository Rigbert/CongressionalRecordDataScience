  Mr. President, as I understand it, the filing deadline for first-degree amendments is this afternoon at either 1:30 p.m. or 2:30 p.m. So everybody should get their amendments in.  I thank Senator Alexander again for the cooperative spirit with which he is working on this bill. It is very much appreciated.
