 President, I thank my colleague from Illinois for putting in perspective what we are talking about today. The students in my classroom weren't Republican, Democrat, or Independent. They didn't say, oh, this is a local issue; oh, this is a State issue, those Federal people should not be involved. They looked around in their classroom and said: How many kids are in here with me? Do I get time with my teacher; do I get personal attention?  As my colleague from Illinois notes, there is no silver bullet to making education better across this country. But we have to put our efforts in places where we know they make a difference. My colleague from Illinois has addressed tirelessly the issue of crumbling schools across the country. And the issue of safety and the ability to learn, and the issue of class size, again, where school buildings simply can't expand, where our children are in unsafe situations. If together we address the crumbling schools, and class size, and if we train our teachers with the skills they need to teach effectively in our classrooms today and tomorrow, we will turn public education around.  I know my colleague from Illinois has heard as much as I have from all those politicians and leaders who are saying public education has failed. I don't believe public education has failed. I believe we have failed public education. We have a responsibility to turn it around right now, today, in the Senate. I thank my colleague from Illinois. I yield to her.
