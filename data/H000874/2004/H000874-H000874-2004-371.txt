Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman for his response. I would observe that, clearly, enforcement mechanisms we believe are critically important as we consider the budget in the mid-2005 budget, but also the outyears as well, whether we use a 5-year or 10-year budget analysis.  Without enforcement mechanisms, obviously, we really do not know what we are doing. We can say we are doing something, but without enforcement mechanisms to make sure that, in fact, we are controlling spending, controlling revenues, controlling entitlements, we do not have really a budget that is meaningful and enforceable. So we are hopeful that that will come relatively soon.  We would like to do it contemporaneously, but I understand what the gentleman is saying; the Committee on Rules wants to consider that. The Senate I think considered that contemporaneously and, of course, there are some in this country who have made it very clear that an enforcement mechanism that impacts on both spending and on revenues was the only kind of enforcement that would really be meaningful. I know there is a difference of opinion among people on that issue, but we think that needs to be debated fairly soon and fairly proximate to close the consideration of the budget.  Mr. Leader, my last question would be, if the gentleman knows, and I notice we have a member of the Committee on Rules on the floor, when will substitutes need to be filed, if the gentleman knows; or can the gentleman inform us when substitutes will need to be filed?  Mr. DeLAY. As soon as we can get back to the Terps game, I think the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Hastings) is going to stand up and announce when they should be filed.
