I don't know exactly what time. I would hope sometime around the middle of the day, noon or thereabouts we would consider the veto, maybe closer to 1 o'clock, but certainly in the middle of the day.  Of course our expectation is that so many of your Members will determine that this policy is absolutely one that ought to be adopted that we will override the veto and that 4 million additional children will be covered. That's certainly our hope. I know that's not your expectation.  So in the event that that does not happen, I think the answer to your question is, I would certainly be prepared to discuss the matter with you. No one has any intention of, frankly, seeing children dropped from the Children's Health Insurance Program.  As you know, the President's proposal, if we adopted the President's proposal, would result in a net reduction of 840,000 children from the current program. We think that's not appropriate and, therefore, we want to move legislation forward, appropriate funding levels, and we would certainly be available to discuss that.  We do anticipate, however, and are very hopeful that the Congress will work its will on this legislation.
