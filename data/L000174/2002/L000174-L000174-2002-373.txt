President, my colleagues sometimes may wonder whether we Vermonters will ever run out of examples to illustrate the pride we take in our beautiful State and its people. Not today, we won't.  Today I rise to describe two of Vermont's finest athletes representing all Americans at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.  Vermont's cold winters and plentiful snow breed true winter athletes. We need not look any further than this year's Olympic roster to see this. At least 21 of America's competitors can claim ties to Vermont. Some of them have lived in the Green Mountain State for their entire lives, while others have come to our mountains to attend one of our schools or universities.  During the last two days, two of these Vermonters swept the Olympic snowboarding halfpipe competitions, winning America's first two gold medals of the 2002 Winter Olympics. Vermont is famous for its firsts. Many of snowboarding's newly formed roots reach deep into the Green Mountains of our State. It is fitting that two Vermont snowboarders have shown the world how it is done.  On Sunday, February 10th, 18-year-old Kelly Clark of West Dover, VT, became the first American to win a gold medal in the 2002 Winter Olympics, scoring a 47.9 out of 50 points in the women's halfpipe competition. Then on Monday, Ross Powers, 23, of South Londonderry, Vermont, took gold in the men's halfpipe competition, winning America's second gold medal of this year's Winter Games.  Since the fourth grade, Kelly Clark has been riding the slopes of Vermont. Her parents own a small restaurant near the beautiful resort of Mount Snow. It was on our Green Mountains that Kelly exerted herself beyond belief, pushing the limit, jumping higher and attempting new moves. She succeeded because she refused to let danger, fear, and exhaustion keep her down.  Kelly is no stranger to winning. Only two short months ago she won the gold medal at the Winter X-Games in Aspen, CO. On Sunday, not only did she win the gold medal, but she managed to do it under great pressure. As the last competitor of the event, she only had one last chance to show the world what she could do, and she rose to the challenge.  The day after Kelly introduced herself to the world, Ross Powers won his second Olympic medal adding to a collection of medals he began during the 1998 Nagano Games when snowboarding made its Olympic debut. All the more remarkable is the fact that Ross led America in a medal sweep of a winter event for the first time in nearly half a century. He impressed the judges and spectators by shooting off the snow 15 feet into the air, landing flawlessly and performing trick after trick.  His family and friends back at Vermont's Bromley Mountain and Stratton Mountain resorts watched Ross, as a child snowboard prodigy, work hard and push himself from the time he first strapped a snowboard to his feet at age five. Three years later he began competing.  Recognizing the hard work, determination and financial backing it takes to become a world-class athlete, Ross formed the Ross Powers Foundation. This non-profit program gives talented and hard-working children the financial support they need to follow their winter sports dreams.  I am sure many more of my fellow Vermonters will find their way onto our sports pages before the Olympics leave Salt Lake City. I know that the country shares our pride in the accomplishments of these courageous Olympic athletes. We Vermonters join all Americans in thanking Kelly and Ross, and all Olympic athletes, for their hard work and devotion to competition and to their country.                          ____________________
