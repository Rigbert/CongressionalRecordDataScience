So yesterday--so everybody can understand what happened--there was a threatened Republican filibuster to stop us from even debating this bill, and in order to stop the filibuster and begin debating the bill so 25 million students could get a lower interest rate on the student loans, we needed 60 votes on the floor. We had all the Democrats and only three Republicans--Senator Collins of Maine, Senator Corker of Tennessee, and Senator Murkowski of Alaska--prepared to vote. No other Republican Senator would join us in starting the debate on lowering the interest rate on student loans.  We need two more Republican Senators to join those three Republicans so we can start bringing relief to student borrowers all across the United States.  Is that where we stand today?
