President, I spoke, as did the Senator from Minnesota, on the issue of LIHEAP yesterday. I commend him for what he has said. This is an issue that is joined certainly in the northern tier States with Republicans and Democrats alike in the Senate.  We should restore these LIHEAP funds. Frankly, I strongly urge our colleagues and leadership in the other body, if need be, to simply pass a LIHEAP appropriations so we can take it up, pass it here and send it down. We would not have this issue were all the appropriations bills now passed. We can pass that one, if need be.  This is a matter of urgency. It is not an answer to say we will have the money in June of next year. It was 8 or 9 degrees below zero at my home in Vermont 2 days ago. It was way below zero last night. We had about a foot of snow in the last few days. The good news, of course, is nothing slows down with only a foot of snow in Vermont. The bad news is that the people who are without money are now faced with the question of whether they will eat or heat. Many of them are elderly. The majority of them are disabled.  There is no question we should try to get this through. It will be colder next month. It always is in January. Last year, we had about a week and a half that did not go above zero. During that time, it hit 25 to 35 degrees below zero, depending where in the State it was.  If you are living in a residence that needs the help of LIHEAP or weatherization for heating, that cold goes through pretty quickly. This is not a case of being uncomfortable. This is a case where people die. People die in their own homes. They die in their own homes from the cold. They die in their own homes sometimes when efforts are made to heat. They die in their own homes when they have actually been pulling boards out of the floor or furniture to burn to keep warm, because they know exposure to that weather for just a matter of, sometimes, minutes could bring about hypothermia and death.  Mr. President, I do not see other Members seeking the floor, so I will talk about another issue.                          ____________________
