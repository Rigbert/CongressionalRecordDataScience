President, just a couple of short weeks ago, we finally finished the fiscal year 2019 appropriations bills, and I greatly appreciate those who worked with us to get that done.  I want to talk today about the need to reach a new 2-year budget deal. We have to do that so the Appropriations Committee could then begin to work in earnest on the fiscal year 2020 bills.  We have shown that we can move the appropriations bills quickly, but we have to have the budget deal. In fact, unless we will get a budget deal, sequestration returns in fiscal year 2020. That would mean steep cuts in programs that invest in America and support working families.  It means we would have to make cuts in our defense programs for the next fiscal year--cuts of $71 billion. This is real money. There would be a 10-percent cut in funding to support our troops and to invest in military readiness.  It would also require that we cut $55 billion for nondefense programs in the next fiscal year. That is a 9-percent cut. The reality is, it means less investment in infrastructure, education, housing, or agricultural programs. It means less money for veterans' healthcare, protecting our environment, or combating the opioid epidemic.  These cuts are not just hypothetical numbers on a piece of paper. They affect real people and real families. They affect people in my State. They affect the people in the State of the distinguished Presiding Officer. They affect people in the 50 States represented by all 100 of us.  Of course, the worst part about that is the cuts will come at the same time we are facing significant increases in important programs that we have no control over.  For example, we have to fund the decennial census. The Constitution requires us to have this census, and we have to fund it by $4 billion if we are going to follow what the Constitution of the United States requires us to do in conducting the 2020 census.  We have all talked about veterans' healthcare. We have had a significant increase in the healthcare costs for veterans, and we have to have significant increases in the budget if we are going to adequately fund their health.  The VA MISSION Act, which provides additional private care options for veterans, becomes effective in June of this year. That is going to cost at least an additional $3 billion, and estimates could climb significantly higher. That is on top of the $3 billion increase for VA medical care that we have already enabled through advance appropriations.  Then we are going to need an additional $1 billion to ensure that an estimated 5 million people who receive affordable housing assistance can stay in their homes. In addition to these increased costs, we expect to lose nearly $4 billion in receipts and cost savings in other programs compared to this year.  This may sound like just a whole lot of numbers. It is more than that. It means we have $15 billion right off the bat that we must account for above this year's levels. Of course, I am sure there will be more increases that we will have to address.  As vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I know how hard Chairman Shelby and I worked with Republicans and Democrats to get through the bills we had this past year. We got them done, but it was not easy staying within levels.  We have to have a 2-year budget deal. We have to negotiate it now. If we wait until the very last second to pass these bills, it will cost the taxpayers a lot more money because the Departments cannot plan. We are not going to bury our heads in the sand and pretend it is going to fix itself.  Of course, again, in the Appropriations Committee, we try to work in a bipartisan way. But we cannot responsibly do our job in the absence of cap levels that allow us to meet the needs of the American people.  Again, this is not just an accounting issue. This is the security and the well-being of the greatest Nation on Earth. It is not rhetoric; it is reality.  The budget deal has to be based on parity if we are going to pass it. It has to have equal treatment for defense and nondefense programs, as we have had in the past.  We have to invest on both sides of the ledger if we are going to create a strong national defense, a strong economy, and a healthy citizenry of the United States.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter to all Senators that was received yesterday from over 300 retired admirals and generals who agree with this premise.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                           Mission: Readiness,                                Washington, DC, February 27, 2019.       Members of Congress: We write as retired admirals and      generals, and members of the national security organization      Mission: Readiness, to urge you to support programs that help      America's children grow into healthy, educated, citizen-ready      adults Particularly, we respectfully request that you      reevaluate spending caps mandated by the Budget Control Act      of 2011 (BCA) and provide balanced investments in both      defense and non-defense discretionary (NDD) programs.       As Members of Mission: Readiness, we recognize the fact      that the strength of our military--and our Nation--is      dependent on the strength of our people. We are deeply      concerned that 71 percent of young Americans ages 17 to 24      cannot qualify for military service because they are too      poorly educated, medically or physically unfit, or have a      disqualifying record of crime or drug abuse. The implications      of this recruitment crisis were underscored last year, when      the Army fell short of its 2018 recruiting goal by 6,500      soldiers. Further, in 2018 the Army missed its end strength      goal for the active duty component by almost 7,500 soldiers,      and the Army National Guard and Army Reserve missed their end      strength goals by 8,000 and 9,000 soldiers, respectively. The      shortage of qualified young people who are willing to serve      will continue to erode the strength of our military, unless      we address the root causes now.       NDD programs play a variety of roles in supporting and      enhancing our national security by contributing directly to      the health, education, and development of our youngest      generation. These crucial NDD programs include:       Child Care and Development-Block Grants (CCDBG), which help      low-income families afford child care. Research shows that      access to quality child care has significant positive impacts      on children's social, cognitive, and physical development.       Head Start and Early Head Start, which help children from      low-income families access early learning opportunities and      become prepared for kindergarten. Studies have found that the      Head Start participants gain long-term educational benefits,      including increased rates of high school graduation.       The sequestration cuts mandated by the BCA pose a direct      threat to the effectiveness of these and other key NDD      programs. Without a new budget agreement from Congress, NDD      funding will be cut by $55 billion compared to Fiscal Year      2019. These cuts would severely undermine the ability of      programs like CCDBG, Head Start, and Early Head Start to      serve children and put them on the path toward productive      citizenship.       Last year, Congress worked in a bipartisan fashion to pass      a two-year budget agreement that avoided sequestration cuts,      provided key new investments for important programs, and did      so in a balanced manner that strengthened both defense and      NDD activities. We strongly urge you to follow this example      for the coming fiscal years and avoid the drastic cuts of      sequestration, while maintaining a balanced approach to      setting discretionary budget levels.       Providing for the common defense is one of the most      fundamental and important constitutional duties of Congress.      By providing balanced investments across both defense and      non-defense discretionary programs, Congress will continue to      ensure our national security, both now and for generations to      come.
