If I could count the votes, and I knew I could defeat the Corzine amendment and have mine, I would do it, but I think we would be in far worse shape if we had that language.  For that reason, I am down to two choices: one to go ahead and withdraw my amendment, and the other to lay it aside so we can talk to see if something can happen. I think I will choose the latter and ask at this time to lay aside amendment No. 1595 for a period of time.
