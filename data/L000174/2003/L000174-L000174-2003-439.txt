President, I am pleased that late last night the Senate again supported lowering drug prices and maintaining a fair generic drug approval process by adding the Drug Competition Act of the Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act of 2003, S. 1. Last November, the Drug Competition Act passed the Senate by unanimous consent. On Monday, Senator Grassley and I, along with Senators Cantwell, Durbin, Feingold, Kohl, and Schumer, offered our bill as an amendment to the larger Medicare bill. I hope that in this Congress it is actually enacted into law as part of the larger effort to improve the health care of millions of Americans. Prescription drug prices are rapidly increasing, and they are a source of considerable concern to many Americans, especially senior citizens and families. Generic drug prices can be as much as 80 percent lower than the comparable brand-name versions.  While the Drug Competition Act is small in terms of length, it is large in terms of impact. It will ensure that law enforcement agencies can take quick and decisive action against companies that are driven more by greed than by good sense. It gives the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department access to information about secret deals between drug companies that keep generic drugs off the market. This is practice that hurts American families, particularly senior citizens, by denying them access to low-cost generic drugs, and further inflating medical costs.  Last July, the Federal Trade Commission released to comprehensive report on barriers to the entry of generic drugs into the pharmaceutical marketplace.
