 Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill. We should not be borrowing trillions from Social Security to give huge tax breaks to the wealthiest 1 percent, and then have inadequate funding for education, prescription drugs, and veterans' needs.  Mr. Speaker, it may make sense to some people to borrow trillions of dollars from Social Security in order to give tax breaks to millionaires. It may make sense to some to raise the $6 trillion dollar National debt for our kids and grand kids, and increase the deficit--and then have inadequate funding for education, veterans' needs, prescription drugs, environmental protection, and other important social needs.  It does not make sense to me and poll after poll shows that it does not make sense to the American people.  Let's be honest. This bill has nothing to do with good social policy. It has everything to do with rewarding the rich folks who have contributed hundreds of millions to the Republican Party. Thirty eight percent of the benefits in this proposal would go to the richest one percent--people who have a minimum income of $375,000 a year.  Tax breaks for millionaires, inadequate funding for veterans, the elderly, the kids. That's what this bill is about. It is an outrage. Let's vote ``no.''
