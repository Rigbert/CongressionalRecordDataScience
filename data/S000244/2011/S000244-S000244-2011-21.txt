Speaker, a $717 million CutGo waiver is not prophylactic in nature. It's whether we are going to abide by our CutGo rules or whether we won't; and the way we enforce the CutGo rules is by delaying consideration of this legislation, sending the patent bill back to committee, and letting the committee spend some time complying with the rules of the House of Representatives. This is a terrible precedent to set. Don't set it now.
