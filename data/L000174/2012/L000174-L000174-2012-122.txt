President, homelessness is not something found only in large urban areas or that is isolated to city limits; it is just as easily found in small towns and rural areas. Vermont, like the rest of the Nation, struggles each day with homelessness. It is estimated that in any given year, there are 4,000 homeless Vermonters, and on any given night, children, as well as adults, find refuge in a shelter.  The Committee on Temporary Shelter, known in Vermont as COTS, has been serving the homeless in Chittenden County since 1982. While COTS relies on the talents of more than 60 dedicated staff members, it is the tireless leadership of their executive director, Rita Markley, that is the heartbeat of this critically important organization.  I have been so proud of the work of Rita and COTS in their service to the people of Chittenden County. During her time with COTS, Rita has worked tirelessly to provide emergency shelter to those in need, while advocating for long-term solutions to end homelessness. Beyond providing emergency shelter for those in need, COTS' prevention program extends a crucial safety net for those on the brink of losing their homes.  Under Rita's leadership more than 100 families found shelter through COTS in 2011, including 115 parents and 122 children. Since 2008, COTS' prevention program has helped 1,264 people to stay in their apartments and has stopped 55 foreclosures.  Rita is known throughout Vermont for her overwhelming generosity, tireless determination, and sharp sense of humor. She truly embodies the Vermont spirit, dedicating herself to helping her neighbors and reminding us that we are all in this together. Vermont is truly lucky to call Rita Markley one of our own.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of an article from September 20, 2012, entitled, ``Innovation, and passion, in the nonprofit world,'' from The Burlington Free Press, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, Sept. 20, 2012] Innovation, and Passion, in the Nonprofit World--Rita Markley of COTS  Talks About the Importance of Partnerships in a World of Great Need,                              Limited Funds                            (By Lynn Monty)       Work is missed when children get sick. Gas for trips to the      doctor's office is costly. Rent payments become late, and      medical bills loom. Homelessness strikes after a long list of      setbacks in a person's life . . . a family's life.       Unforeseen expenditures happen to everyone, but when they      come about on a fixed income it can cause a domino effect of      devastation. Financial insecurity has plagued households      nationwide since the economic downturn, and Burlington is no      exception.       Rita Markley, 53, of Burlington knows all too well what our      community has had to endure. She is executive director of the      Committee on Temporary Shelter, where she's tasked daily with      providing distressed people with emergency shelter and      services, but her ultimate goal is to find long-term      solutions to end homelessness altogether.       More than a hundred families stayed in COTS shelters in      2011. This included 115 parents and 122 children. An average      of 53 people a day used the COTS Daystation, the only drop-in      center for homeless adults in Chittenden County, before a      storm flooded the Daystation in July.       Among her myriad responsibilities, and scrambling to find a      new home for the much needed community resource before snow      flies, surprisingly, Markley finds time to laugh.       Humor is part of the fuel she needs to forge ahead, to      build community partnerships, and to get through tough times.      ``You might as well have fun while you are doing what you      do,'' she said. ``Laughter is a way to connect, and you feel      better when you laugh. It makes you feel alive.''       We spoke to Markley about these philosophies, her life and      her innovations at the nonprofit in an interview at her North      Avenue office on Sept. 5. A fuller version of this interview      is available online at BurlingtonFreePress.com.       Burlington Free Press: What does an average day look like      for you at COTS?       Markley: Very few days look the same. That's what I love      about this job. Some days it's meetings with community      partners, other days is brainstorming with staff, writing      reports, looking at our numbers. I stay in touch with the      people we serve. I advocate to fix problems that put      ridiculous burdens on struggling families.       In the past five weeks, I've been running to every last      corner of Burlington looking for a new Daystation.       Our whole approach isn't about how we help the homeless,      that is the wrong premise, it's about how we can end      homelessness. What can we do so that 20 years from now people      don't need shelters in the first place?       BFP: What fuels your passion?       Markley: It's an underlying belief that everybody has      infinite promise, and potential, and that they deserve a      chance to try to reach that.       I spent the first five years of my life in an orphanage. I      know I would be a very different person today without the      volunteers who would come and rock the babies and read to us.      They came three or four times a week to make us feel loved      and special. I think I would have been one of those kids who      could have otherwise fallen through the cracks, or given up,      before I had even stepped out the door.       I was very lucky to be adopted by the Markleys. It was a      privileged household, but I remember well what holidays are      like when you don't have a home, like the home you read about      in storybooks. Or when you feel embarrassed because of the      fact you are an orphan.       When I think of the kids there, I still remember their      names. I remember who we were and how much useful creativity,      imagination and joy every single one of us had. We were      encouraged when we could have been shut down. The volunteers      and staff there really cared about what they were doing, and      launched us into lives that became meaningful.       I know when you don't get the opportunities for college and      travel and exposure that I was given by the Markleys, you can      start out with that bright shining light, and it gets darker      and darker as each year passes by, and you stop believing      that there are better things that are possible for you. This      underlies everything that I am.       I have never been a woe-is-me kind of person. I believe in      joy, touching that joy, and touching what is most wonderful      in humans who have the capacity to care about each other when      we don't have to. There is no reason that most of the      volunteers need to come to a place like COTS every day, but      they do because they can't bear the idea that somebody is      going to sleep in a car, or not have a chance without their      support.       BFP: How would Burlington be different without COTS?       Markley: I believe in working toward a world where      everybody gets a chance. A lot of the work and the way we do      things at COTS is driven from the principles of finding that      strength, that spark, to help people believe again that more      is possible for them than simply a shelter bed and hoping      they will have enough food day to day. To help them see that      you cannot only survive, but have a rich life.       Without the work we do every day, Burlington would be a      place with shelter upon shelter upon shelter with people      never getting out in front of it. It takes so long to save      for a security deposit, especially when you are only bringing      in $400 a week or less. We help people with this.       In 2008, COTS launched an innovative new prevention program      with $250,000 that we had been fundraising since 2005. We got      tired of     seeing so many people miss paying rent because the alternator      on their car went, or had to miss work because of a sick      child. Homelessness is often the result of this unraveling.       The trajectory was so clear. Incomes were flat, or going      down, and rents were going up. Utilities were skyrocketing,      gasoline was going up, and it was a housing market where if      you lose your place, there are 10 other people who want it.      We saw this and started raising money.       Our goal in mind was to keep families whole, helping them      keep in good financial standing and to regain their footing.      We kept 293 families in their homes that first year.       Since 2008, COTS' prevention program has helped 1,264      people stay in their apartments and stopped 55 foreclosures.      We break their fall.       Far more people than you see now would be sleeping in      doorways without our services. There would be far more      children without a fixed address. Even with this successful      homeless prevention program in place, we still have people      becoming homeless at a quicker rate than we can break their      fall.       BFP: What sustains this organization?       Markley: The community sustains this organization. The      people who come out to contribute time and money have such a      profound impact on so many lives. The amazing thing about      COTS is the people who come out to support it.       They are the ones who make sure no one in our community is      without a safe, warm place to go during the worst of times.      What sustains us is the belief that we are so much more      together than we are alone.       It's because this community is far better informed about      who the homeless really are. They know that the guy in the      doorway might be a veteran, but we have more work to do as an      origination. I think many Vermonters would be shocked to know      that at the start of the school year last year there were 141      homeless children in our area, or that our waiting list is      high right now.       That is the hardest part of this work, when you don't have      enough to help everyone. Last year we had the least amount of      money to give out for prevention, and all of the school      systems felt it keenly because we were not able to keep the      same amount of families stable because of state and federal      funding cuts and donations were down.       BFP: In what other ways have you been innovative in your      approach in leading COTS?       Markley: I have brought a lot of new constituencies to      COTS. I look further up the stream. Where people are used to      hearing nothing but no, I find a way to get to yes.       For people with really awful credit or behavior issues,      every door is slammed. No landlord will take the risk.      Instead of accepting that as a no, we figure out how to help      people build relationships with landlords through a new risk      guarantee program.       We ask landlords to take a chance on our clients who we      know are a challenge. We put up all of the costs of an      eviction as a guarantee, and hold it for a year and a half.       My goal is to make sure nobody loses the hope entirely that      they will ever be back into housing. Once a person gives up,      there is so little you can do. It's like a life lost      prematurely. As long as we can hold out that carrot, you can      work with people to change behaviors, to try a different      approach, and to keep believing in themselves and in having a      home.       BFP: If you could do anything you wanted to innovate at      COTS, with no barriers, what would you do? The sky is the      limit.       Markley: I would triple our prevention fund, and link it to      our follow-up services two years out to make sure families      are still doing OK. I would focus on employment initiatives      and bring together more partnerships. I would integrate the      use of technology and bring together the disparate programs      right now that are hard to navigate.                          ____________________
