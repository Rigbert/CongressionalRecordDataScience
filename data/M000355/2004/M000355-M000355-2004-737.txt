 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a world-renowned surgeon, inspiring educator, and fellow Louisvillian, Dr. Hiram C. Polk.  While most of us are sleeping in the early morning hours, Dr. Polk is already hard at work, making rounds and advising residents. Since 1971, he has served as the chairman of the Department of Surgery at the University of Louisville.  Hiram attended Millsaps College in his home State of Mississippi. As a favor to his chemistry professor, Hiram applied to Harvard Medical School. Since he wouldn't go to Massachusetts for a candidate-screening interview, Hiram received a visit from the late Arthur Guyton, M.D., Ph.D. Dr.Guyton, widely regarded as the world's leading physiologist, discussed the future with Hiram and then offered him a scholarship to Harvard Medical School. While Hiram eventually accepted the scholarship, he dropped out of the program three times because of his aversion to the more tedious demands of the field. He graduated from Harvard in 1960 and began residency at Washington University in St. Louis where he was greatly influenced by one of his instructors, Carl Moyer, M.D. Inspired by Dr. Moyer, Hiram began to consider teaching. His love for intellectual stimulation and talent for surgery made academia a natural conclusion for Hiram.  Under Hiram's leadership in the Department of Surgery at the University of Lousiville, the number of staff has grown from 5 to 70 and the department now receives $1.2 million in annual grants from the National Institutes of Health. He's trained almost 230 general surgeons, more than any other surgery chair and America. He is an inspiration to his residents, colleagues, and patients.  Hiram is also a leader in research. He's considered a world authority in surgical wound infections and has done landmark research regarding the use of perioperative antibiotics. Hiram is also an accomplished author with nearly 400 papers and journal articles. 152 textbook chapters, and 11 books to his name.  Hiram is a dedicated and talented surgeon who has brought the University of Louisville's Department of Surgery to national recognition. He receives the highest praise from his residents, colleagues, and patients. I ask that my colleagues join me in thanking Hiram for his dedication to medical excellence.                          ____________________
