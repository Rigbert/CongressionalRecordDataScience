Will the Senator agree, however, that at the time Judge Paez made his decision, there was a Ninth Circuit decision on all fours, which he as a Federal district judge within that circuit was bound to follow, and he and all judges going for confirmation always say they will follow stare decisis, that they will follow the decision?  Is it not a fact that in that particular case he had a decision on all fours from his circuit which he had to follow? And is it not also a fact that the Ninth Circuit then, under a new ruling, submitted it to the California Supreme Court for their own ruling to the California Supreme Court? Because, obviously, you cannot appeal to the California Supreme Court, Judge Paez being a Federal court. But the Ninth Circuit then submitted it under a certification procedure--a new procedure--in California to the CaliforniaSupreme Court. And then a year or so later, they came down and said the Ninth Circuit's earlier ruling did not interpret California law correctly. They then changed theirs and thus changed the rule Judge Paez had to follow.  Is that not the fact?
