It is hard to believe how much time we wasted today when we could have been considering the global warming bill and passing and considering important amendments. Now we find ourselves past midnight, after wasting hour after hour, when the Republican minority asked the amendment be read, every word of it read into the record, when that was totally unnecessary, an amendment which was available to us days ago, at least in summary form weeks ago, a total waste of time. It is a continued effort by the Republican side of the aisle to slow down and stop any effort to make progress on legislation people care about across America.  It is all their party has left. GOP stands for graveyard of progress. They don't want us to do anything. Today they wasted an entire day of the Senate.  I will close by saying, what troubles me the most is that the Republican minority leader would come to the floor with this sense of urgency about three district court Federal judges, a sense of urgency, yet does not share that same sense of urgency about the global warming that is changing the world we live in. The world will little note nor long remember those three judges, as good as they may be individually, but it will remember that we wasted an entire day and perhaps wasted our best efforts this session to take up the single most important issue for the survival of the planet.  I yield the floor.
