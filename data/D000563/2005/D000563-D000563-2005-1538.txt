President, let me tell you, I listen to the talk shows, and I hear people say that until these judicial nominees were challenged with extended debate or filibuster, it never happened before. I will also submit for the Record, for the third time, this chart which shows on 11 or 12 different occasions when a filibuster was invoked on judicial nominees throughout history, including Supreme Court Justices. This is not new, not novel. It is certainly not earth shattering. It has happened before.  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.
