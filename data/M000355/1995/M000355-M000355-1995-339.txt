 President, I rise today to honor Dr. Hiram C. Polk, Jr., Hiram is chairman of surgery at the University of Louisville, and this week he will be inducted into the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, Scotland as an honorary fellow.  The Royal College of Surgeons is the oldest surgical college in the world and is also the most renowned. The induction as an honorary fellow is the highest honor awarded by the college. This tribute is unquestionably one that Hiram should be proud of, because the college only gives out five or six awards in one year to the best surgeons around the world.  Hiram was also asked to deliver the Lister lecture at the college's annual meeting in Aberdeen, Scotland on May 26, 1995, making him the first American to give the Lister lecture. Hiram is also one of only 13 people to ever deliver the lecture. He joins an impressive list of past lecturers which include two Nobel Prize winners. His speech will focus on his work to understand and control infection after trauma, research he has worked extensively on at the University of Louisville for more than a decade.  Hiram received his medical degree from Harvard University in 1960, and 11 years later he accepted a position at the University of Louisville. At the age of 35, Hiram was named chairman of surgery at the university, making him one of the youngest surgery department chairmen in the Nation.  His research on surgery infection began in 1969, and he says it still has a long way to go. He best describes his work in a recent article from the Courier Journal, ``you keep hoping for a breakthrough. But in fact * * * you're crawling your way up the Washington Monument one step at a time.'' And you can bet, Hiram will continue his research on surgical infections for years to come.  Mr. President, I commend Dr. Hiram C. Polk, Jr., for his outstanding service to the University of Louisville and to the entire medical community. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the hard work of this outstanding Kentuckian and to congratulate him on his induction as an honorary fellow into the Royal College of Surgeons.                          ____________________
