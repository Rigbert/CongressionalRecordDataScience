Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the information.  Mr. Speaker, I note that the bill that was supposed to be on the floor either yesterday or today dealing with DACA and dealing with the children, who are an object of great concern by all the country, is not mentioned in the gentleman's remarks for legislation that will be considered next week.  The DACA bill was supposed to be voted in the second immigration bill pursuant to the rule that we adopted this week. That vote, I thought, had been postponed until next week. Now, however, I do not see it being announced as a bill that is going to be considered.  It is disappointing that, after months of committing to working together on a solution to the DACA crisis, Mr. Speaker, this week, the House considered two partisan bills.  I would like to point out that Speaker Ryan, on September 5, 2017, some 8 months ago, said: ``It is my hope that the House and Senate, with the President's leadership, will be able to find consensus on a permanent legislative solution that includes ensuring that those who have done nothing wrong can still contribute as a valued part of this country.''  Speaker Ryan said more recently, on February 8, 2018, when he urged people to support the caps bill--that is, setting the limits of expenditures--``my commitment to working together,'' and he looked at our side of the aisle when he said that. But, Mr. Speaker, the only persons who apparently will be included in ``working together'' are between the Freedom Caucus and others on the Republican side of the aisle.  He went on to say: ``My commitment to working together on an immigration measure that we can make law is a sincere commitment. Let me repeat,'' the Speaker said, ``my commitment to working together on an immigration measure that we can make law is a sincere commitment. We will solve this DACA problem.''  He said that February 8, 2018, from that rostrum on the floor of this House. There has been no ``together.''  Now, my friend, the majority leader, Mr. Speaker, said this: ``This all started when I was at Camp David with the President this weekend.''  We know that the majority leader is probably the closest ally that the President has in the Congress of the United States.  ``He was telling me how, earlier last week, he was with some Republican Senators talking about DACA. They all agreed, but he said we can't solve that unless we bring Democrats into the room, too.''  That was Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy on FOX News on January 10, 2018.  So I ask my friend, the majority leader, can the gentleman clarify whether or not changes will be made to H.R. 6136--that is, the Ryan-Trump so-called compromise that, from our perspective, ``together'' meant simply together among Republicans trying to decide what the Republicans wanted to do. Can you tell me whether there will be changes to that so-called compromise bill and whether or not thatbill may be brought to the floor anytime soon?  I yield to my friend.                              {time}  1215  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I appreciate him watching me on TV.  Mr. Speaker, if I could just restate, so maybe I could speak more clearly.  The House is also expected to consider legislation relating to border security immigration. So the answer is yes.  As I said before, we are bringing that bill to the floor. We have been working very closely with the entire Conference, taking all ideas in. We had a very productive conference last night. We will work through the weekend, and you will see that bill on the floor next week. And I look forward to Mr. Hoyer's support as well.
