  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, once again the U.S. trade negotiators have taken a page out of history. For the second time in 16 months, we have threatened sanctions to stop the outright piracy of more than $2.3 billion a year in intellectual property rights, software, and CDs from the United States of America. Remember, this is the most unfair trading nation on Earth, with the most protectionist trade policies, as identified by even the World Bank.  They are going to run a $41 billion trade surplus with the United States this year. That means we are going to export 800,000 jobs to China because we do not have the guts to stand up to their unfair trade practices. But even worse is the piracy, outright theft and piracy, violating all international standards, $2.3 billion. Where are our negotiators? They finally got tough. They threatened trade sanctions. We were going to retaliate. They negotiated past the deadline. Then, in an all too familiar pattern, they entered into nothing but another meaningless face-saving agreement where the Chinese will continue their piracy and we will continue occasionally to bellow and huff and puff. They took a page out of history, but unfortunately, the page was from Neville Chamberlain at Munich: appeasement. Appeasement will not work.                          ____________________
