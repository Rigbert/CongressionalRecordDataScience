 President, I wish to pay tribute to the late Albert Greene Clay, a man whose contributions were instrumental to the tobacco and horse industries, and whose presence was well-known at the University of Kentucky.  A native of Mount Sterling, KY, Albert received a bachelor's degree from Duke University in 1938, and attended Harvard Business School in 1939. On October 26, 1939, Albert married his college sweetheart, Lorraine Case Newlin. I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincerest condolences to his family, especially his wife Lorraine, his sons Robert and John, his daughter Charlotte Clay Buxton, and seven grandchildren.  Albert left behind a legacy as an individual whose contributions to the tobacco industry are far-reaching and long-lasting. He played a key role in the establishment of the Burley Auction Warehouse Association in the 1940s, and continued his involvement by serving as chairman and president of the organization's board for 25 years.  Albert's leadership extended to the national level, where he served as director of the National Tobacco Tax Council, Burley and Dark Leaf TobaccoExport Association and Tobacco Growers Information Committee. In 1977, he was appointed by the Carter administration to serve on the Agriculture Policy Advisory Committee for Trade Negotiations.  Not only did Albert's accomplishments encompass the tobacco industry, but they also extended into another important facet of his native State--the horse industry. Albert helped found the American Horse Council in 1969, and continued to serve as secretary of the organization for many years. His passion for horses benefited students at the University of Kentucky, where Albert played a vital role in the creation of the institution's Equine Research Foundation. He served as chairman there from 1988 to 1998 and was also instrumental in the formation of UK's Maxwell Gluck Equine Research Center. Albert maintained his involvement in the university, serving on the UK board of trustees, and as chairman of the board for several years.  I would like to express my appreciation for Albert Greene Clay's outstanding contributions to both the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and the entire United States.                          ____________________
