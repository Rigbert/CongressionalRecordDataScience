President, I would like to read from the EPA's own environmental analysis:       The overall effect of the final rule will be a net benefit      to the environment.  My second-degree amendment calls for a NAS study to look at the impacts of the regulation after implementation of the final rules while allowing the regulations to go forward, thus allowing cleaner and more efficient technologies to be installed in our Nation's manufacturing centers.  Delaying these regulations would delay projects to create safer workplaces. The International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, a member of the AFL-CIO, has recently opined against the proposed delay in the final package on the New Source Review. I would like to read just a small part of their letter and then will have the rest of the letter printed in the Record. This letter is a current letter dated today from the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers. It says:       We have encouraged the Environmental Protection Agency to      clarify the program as soon as possible, and oppose efforts      in Congress to slow reform down. The efficiency and      competitiveness of our facilities and the safety of our      workers hang in the balance. This is a jobs and safety issue      for millions of American workers.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship            Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers & Helpers,                                    Fairfax, VA, January 21, 2003.     Re Opposition to Appropriations Rider Delaying New Source          Review Reform.     Senator John Edwards,     Dirksen Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Edwards: On behalf of the International      Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths,      Forgers and Helpers, ALF-CIO, I am writing to express our      support for clarification of the New Source Review, or NSR,      program and our opposition to any effort to derail NSR      clarification through the appropriations process. Therefore,      we urge you and your colleagues not to offer an      appropriations rider delaying implementation of the final NSR      rules.       Commonly referred to as the Boilermakers Union, we are a      diverse union representing over 100,000 workers throughout      the United States and Canada in construction, repair,      maintenance, manufacturing, professional emergency medical      services, and related industries. Boilermakers, who make and      maintain industrial boilers and the pollution control      equipment they use, have had a long-time commitment to a      clear, effective and reasonable NSR policy. We have      encouraged the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)     to clarify the program as soon as possible, and oppose      efforts in Congress to slow reform down. The efficiency and      competitiveness of our facilities and the safety of our      workers hang in the balance. This is a jobs and safety issue      for millions of American workers.       First, let me be clear today that Boilermakers do not      oppose the Clean Air Act, nor do we oppose its rigorous      enforcement. In fact, construction lodges of our union look      forward to doing much of the actual work for the installation      of new technologies and controls at utility plants and for      industrial boilers across this region and the country. In      reference to the NOX control program alone, our      international President Charlie Jones recently wrote:       ``The EPA estimates that compliance measures will cost      about $1.7 billion a year. A sizeable portion of that money      will go to the Boilermakers who do the work necessary to make      the additions and modifications required by the SCR      technology.''       NSR, correctly interpreted as we hope EPA's new rules will      do, forces new sources or those undergoing major      modifications, to install new technology, like the technology      President Jones mentioned. We support NSR in that context.       However, when NSR is applied in an unclear or inflexible      manner to existing facilities, very different results occur.      In those cases, facilities are discouraged from undertaking      appropriate actions for fear of huge penalties or long delays      or both. By applying NSR in that way, we are pretty sure that      Boilermakers won't have the opportunity to work on projects      that we know are extremely important to energy efficiency.      Further, by reducing the useful economic life of boilers or      by inaccurately setting baselines, the existing NSR confusion      undermines the competitiveness of American job sites. And      that means some of the almost 20 million manufacturing jobs      at stake in heavy industry are placed at risk.       Finalizing new NSR rules is also important to maintain      worker safety. Industrial and utility boilers harness      tremendous forces: superheater tubes exposed to flue gases      over 2000 degrees; boilers under deteriorating conditions;      and parts located in or around boilers subjected to both      extreme heat and pressure. Any delay of these important EPA      rules is simply unacceptable to our workers.       Some have argued that the final NSR rules can await further      study. However, the U.S. EPA held four public hearings in      each region of the country on the proposal. Paul Kern, the      recording secretary of our Local 105 in Piketon, Ohio,      offered a statement at the hearing in Cincinnati. In      addition, it is our understanding that over 130,000      rulemaking comments were received on this initiative, and      over 50 stakeholder meetings were held.       As you can see, Boilermakers have never asked for repeal or      substantial revision of the NSR program. We encourage the      development and installation of new technology, and we stand      ready to continue to train and apprentice workers to meet the      needs of the Clean Air Act. However, when the NSR program      goes where it wasn't intended--and creates uncertainty      regarding the very livelihood of Boilermakers--we must      strongly object. Therefore, we ask you and your colleagues      not to offer any appropriations rider delaying the final NSR      rules.           Sincerely,                                                      Ande Abbott,                                          Director of Legislation.
