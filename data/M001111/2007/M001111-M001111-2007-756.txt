 He says that raising the Federal minimum wage is ``almost a no-brainer.'' Washington's strong economy is proof that even with the highest minimum wage in the United States, as Mr. Brunell put it--and he is president of the Association of Washington Business--``Washington is a great place to do business.''  Some people predicted that small businesses would be hurt in my State. But instead, as the article notes, they have prospered beyond their expectations. So we have a lot of opportunity to do good here, not just for our workers but for our businesses and for our economy. But to do the most good, we have to pass a clean bill, one that is free from unrelated tax provisions and one that rejects antiworker amendments.  Historically, Congress has not found it necessary to pair a minimum wage increase with a package of tax giveaways. In fact, since 1936, Congress has raised the minimum wage nine times. But only once has such an increase been paired with a tax rollback. We should pass a clean bill that gives workers the raise they are long overdue.  In addition, we should not let this bill be used to weaken the rights of American workers. As the chairman of the HELP Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety, I am troubled by a number of the amendments being floated now by our Republican colleagues, proposals to attack the 40-hour workweek, to take away workers' overtime, and to force a pay cut on workers who earn their living from tips. There is also a deeply flawed proposal that would change the treatment of professional employer organizations under the Tax Code.  This week, while we try to raise the wages of one group of workers, we have to fend off the Republican attacks on working families and their right to earn overtime. We all know how the demands of work and family pull two-career parents away from their loved ones all too often. For parents getting their kids to and from school and to afterschool activity is not easy, especially when you are forced to work uncertain hours. The uncertainty of having to work, say, 50 to 60 hours this week and then 20 or 30 hours next week will put incredible strains on many of our overburdened families.  Taking away their workplace rights and their ability to collect overtime would be a cruel and unwarranted double hit on America's working families. The Senate should, once again, reject the Republican comp time and 40-hour work week proposals, because they would force a pay cut on millions of middle-class workers. We know, for those workers who are eligible, overtime can amount to as much as 25 percent of their yearly income. We should not undermine the ability of working parents to balance their lives and share in the American dream.  The Republican comp time proposal would force our workers to take comp time instead of pay. On top of that pay cut, workers would be at the mercy of their employer when it came to asking to use that accumulated comp time. We all know that comp time often disappears under employer pressures of deadlines and other productivity needs.  I believe it is important that this Congress protect the rights of these hard-working families from an erosion of their quality of life and their ability to spend time with their families. We have to stop these attacks on working families and start moving in the right direction, like expanding the Family and Medical Leave Act.  I hope we also work to protect our workers who rely on tips. As we have heard from my female colleagues on this floor already, nearly two-thirds ofour minimum wage workers in this country are women. Many of them are single parents. Raising the minimum wage can give them a small measure of economic security and the ability to better support their families. Many of these low-wage workers are service workers, people such as hairdressers, maids, and waitresses. Many in Washington State rely on tips as a significant part of their livelihood. We should not support amendments that would undermine the tips our workers rely on. In my State of Washington, that would mean a pay cut of some $12,000 annually for over 120,000 of our tipped workers.  Finally, I want to say I am very concerned about the proposed tax changes for professional employer organizations. I fear that this change could undermine the fiscal stability of our State unemployment insurance and worker compensation fund. It would also put more burdens on our employers who are already playing by the rules.  Further, it would reduce worker health and safety protections by undermining incentives for companies to maintain safe and healthy workplaces. By the way, it could also provide an opening for those seeking to change the well-established rules of the employer-employee relationship under the Fair Labor Standards Act. I believe there should be serious thought and debate in the Congress before we make such fundamental changes in our labor laws.  In conclusion, we can do this right by passing a clean bill that finally gives American workers the raise they have earned. Over the last 8 years, Washington State has proven that a minimum wage increase is good for our State's economy and helps our economic development. It increases small business ownership and, of course, it helps our workers maintain their quality of life.  I join my colleagues to urge a vote in favor of this bill to increase the minimum wage so that we can finally, and importantly, give our low-income workers the raise they so richly deserve.  I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1                [From the New York Times, Jan. 11, 2007]        For $7.93 an Hour, It's Worth a Trip Across a State Line                           (By Timothy Egan)       Liberty Lake, Wa. Jan. 9.--Just eight miles separate this      town on the Washington side of the state border from Post      Falls on the Idaho side. But the towns are nearly $3 an hour      apart in the required minimum wage. Washington pays the      highest in the nation, just under $8 an hour, and Idaho has      among the lowest, matching 21 states that have not raised the      hourly wage beyond the federal minimum of $5.15.       Nearly a decade ago, when voters in Washington approved a      measure that would give the state's lowest-paid workers a      raise nearly every year, many business leaders predicted that      small towns on this side of the state line would suffer.       But instead of shriveling up, small-business owners in      Washington say they have prospered far beyond their      expectations. In fact, as a significant increase in the      national minimum wage heads toward law, businesses here at      the dividing line between two economies--a real-life      laboratory for the debate--have found that raising prices to      compensate for higher wages does not necessarily lead to      losses in jobs and profits.       Idaho teenagers cross the state line to work in fast-food      restaurants in Washington, where the minimum wage is 54      percent higher. That has forced businesses in Idaho to raise      their wages to compete.       Business owners say they have had to increase prices      somewhat to keep up. But both states are among the nation's      leaders in the growth of jobs and personal income, suggesting      that an increase in the minimum wage has not hurt the overall      economy.       ``We're paying the highest wage we've ever had to pay, and      our business is still up more than 11 percent over last      year,'' said Tom Singleton, who manages a Papa Murphy's      takeout pizza store here, with 13 employees.       His store is flooded with job applicants from Idaho, Mr.      Singleton said. Like other business managers in Washington,      he said he had less turnover because the jobs paid more.       By contrast, an Idaho restaurant owner, Rob Elder, said he      paid more than the minimum wage because he could not find      anyone to work for the Idaho minimum at his Post Falls      restaurant, the Hot Rod Cafe.       ``At $5.15 an hour, I get zero applicants--or maybe a guy      with one leg who wouldn't pass a drug test and wouldn't show      up on Saturday night because he wants to get drunk with his      buddies,'' Mr. Elder said.       For years, economists have debated the effect that raising      the minimum wage would have on business. While the federal      minimum wage has not gone up for 10 years, 29 states have      raised their wage beyond the federal minimum.       These increases, according to critics like Brendan Flanagan      of the National Restaurant Association, are a burden on the      small, mostly family-run businesses in fast food and      agriculture that employ workers at the lowest end of the pay      scale.       ``We see the political momentum for this,'' said Mr.      Flanagan, a vice president at the association, ``but we      cannot ignore what our members are telling us, which is that      it will lead to job losses.''       But the state's major business lobby, the Association of      Washington Business, is no longer fighting the minimum-wage      law, which is adjusted every year in line with the consumer      price index.       ``You don't see us screaming out loud about this,'' said      Don Brunell, president of the trade group, which represents      6,300 members.       ``It's almost a no-brainer,'' Mr. Brunell said, that the      federal minimum should go higher. Association officials say      they would like to see some flexibility for rural and small-     town businesses, however.       Washington's robust economy, which added nearly 90,000 jobs      last year, is proof that even with the country's highest      minimum wage, ``this is a great place to do business,'' Mr.      Brunell said.       During a recession five years ago, the same group had      argued that Washington's high minimum wage law would send      businesses fleeing to Idaho. The group sent out a news      release with a criticism of the law from John Fazzari, who      owns a family-run pizza business in Clarkston, Wash., just      minutes from the Idaho town of Lewiston.       But now Mr. Fazzari says business has never been better,      and he has no desire to move to Idaho.       ``To tell you the truth, my business is fantastic,'' he      said in an interview. ``I've never done as much business in      my life.''       Mr. Fazzari employs 42 people at his pizza parlor. New      workers make the Washington minimum, $7.93 an hour, but      veteran employees make more. To compensate for the required      annual increase in the minimum wage, Mr. Fazzari said he      raises prices slightly. But he said most customers barely      notice.       He sells more pizza, he said, because he has a better      product, and because his customers are loyal.       ``If you look 10 years down the road, we will probably have      no minimum wage jobs on this side of the border, and lots of      higher-income jobs,'' Mr. Fazzari said.       Job figures from both states tend to support his point.      While Idaho leads the nation in new job growth, it has a far      higher percentage of minimum-wage jobs than Washington.      Minimum-wage positions make up just 2.4 percent of the jobs      in Washington, while about 13 percent of the jobs in Idaho      pay at or less than the proposed federal minimum wage,      according to a study done for the state last year.       Part of the difference could be accounted for by a lower      cost of living in Idaho and the higher percentage of      technology, manufacturing and government jobs in Washington,      economists say. Still, it is hard to find a teenager in Idaho      who lives anywhere near Washington who is willing to work for      $5.15 an hour.       ``Are you kidding? There are so many jobs nearby that pay      way more than minimum wage,'' said Jennifer Stadtfeldt, who      is 17 and lives in Coeur d'Alene, which is just a few minutes      from Washington. She pointed out that Taco Bell, McDonald's      and other fast-food outlets in her town were posting signs      trying to entice entry-level workers with a starting pay of      $7 an hour.       The House today passed a bill increasing the minimum wage,      and about 13 million workers would see a pay raise if the      Senate and President Bush approve it. Mr. Bush has said he      would approve the wage increase so long as concerns of small-     business owners were taken into account; the Senate has not      yet taken up the bill.       Several studies have concluded that modest changes in the      minimum wage have little effect on employment. A study two      months ago by an economist at Washington State University      seemed to back the experience of Clarkston and other border      towns in Washington. The economist, David Holland, said job      loss was minimal when higher wages were forced on all      businesses. About 97 percent of all minimum-wage workers were      better off when wages went up, he wrote.       But other business groups argue that an increase would hurt      consumers and workers at the low end.       In a survey released on the eve of the November elections--     in which voters in six states considered raising their      minimum wages--the National Restaurant Association said      restaurants expected to raise their prices and eliminate some      jobs if the voters approved the measures. The initiatives all      passed.       Here on this border, business owners have found small ways      to raise their prices, and customers say they have barely      noticed.       ``We used to have a coupon, $3 off on any family-size      pizza, and we changed that to $2 off,'' said Mr. Singleton,      of Papa Murphy's. ``I haven't heard a single complaint.''
