 President, another thing that I shouldn't have to come to the floor to talk about--and it will only take me about 3 or 4 minutes--is that I am still hearing questions about my intent to object to the nomination of William Evanina. These are the same questions I heard last year when I initially placed my hold on Evanina.  By the way, my hold is printed in the Record, and the rules of this Senate require all Members who put a hold on a nomination or a bill, within 2 days after doing that, to put something in the Record, and most Senators aren't following that rule of the Senate. So if you have some disagreement about something and you put a secret hold on and somebody wants to sit down and talk with you to see what is wrong, how are they going to know who it is? That is why, in 2011, on a vote of 96 to 4, Senator Wyden and I got these rules, so there should be no secret holds in the U.S. Senate.  So I am back here again. This statement will be the fourth time since June 4, 2018, that I have publicly expressed my reason for this hold here on the Senate floor. It seems to me no one has been listening to what I have been saying, but what is unusual about that?  As I have said repeatedly, the Judiciary Committee has experienced difficulty in obtaining relevant documents and briefings from the Justice Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.  Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein personally--I want to emphasize--personally assured me that the Judiciary Committee would receive equal access to information provided to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence with regard to negotiations about the pending subpoenas from that committee related to the 2016 election controversies.  I haven't received equal access, as promised.  On August 7, 2018, I wrote to the Justice Department and pointed out that the House Intelligence Committee received documents related to Bruce Ohr on May 8, 2018, that the Judiciary Committee did not receive.  I ask unanimous consent to have that letter inserted in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                   Washington, DC, August 7, 2018.     Hon. Rod J. Rosenstein,     Deputy Attorney General,     U.S. Department of Justice.       Dear Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein: As we have      discussed on several occasions, you agreed to provide the      Judiciary Committee equal access to documents produced to the      U.S. House of Representatives, including those pursuant to      requests and subpoenas from the Select Committee on      Intelligence related to 2016 election controversies.       Unfortunately, even though you gave me your word that the      Committee would receive equal access, the Department has      failed to deliver. On July 12, 2018, the New York Times      reported that the Trump Administration ordered ``more      lawmakers be given access to classified information about an      informant the F.B.I. used in 2016 to investigate possible      ties between the Trump campaign and Russia . . .'' The      article also reported that, ``[t]he F.B.I. files about the      informant will now be available to all members of the Senate      and House Intelligence Committees, instead of to just a group      of congressional leaders known as the Gang of Eight.''       As you are aware, in the authorizing resolution that      created the Senate Intelligence Committee, the Senate      explicitly reserved for other standing Committees, such as      the Senate Judiciary Committee, the independent authority to      ``study and review any intelligence activity'' and ``to      obtain full and prompt access to the product of the      intelligence activities of any department or agency,'' when      such a matter ``directly affects a matter otherwise within      the jurisdiction of such committee.''       This Committee has jurisdiction over all federal courts,      including the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC).      Based on public reporting, the new information provided to      the Intelligence Committees appears to be relevant to an      application to the FISC, which is an issue that has already      been subject to extensive oversight by this Committee. Some      of that oversight has been public, when possible. However, as      you know, the Committee has also conducted its oversight      responsibilities through classified letters, briefings, and      document reviews. We have respected the limitations necessary      to protect national security information. The Department has      been responsive to the Committee's previous oversight      requests and has provided access to the FISA application and      some of the relevant background materials on more than one      occasion, which is appreciated.       Yet, my Committee staff have attempted to informally work      with the Department's Office of Legislative Affairs to obtain      the equal access you promised to all of the relevant      materials, but to no avail. For example, on March 23, 2018,      the House Intelligence Committee requested the records of      nine individuals related to Steele, his dossier, or campaign-     related applications to the FISC. The nine individuals are:       1. James Comey,       2. Andrew McCabe,       3. Peter Strzok,       4. Lisa Page,       5. Sally Moyer,       6. Bill Priestap,       7. Greg Brower,       8. James Baker,       9. Bruce Ohr.       The Department produced records to HPSCI related to Bruce      Ohr on May 8, 2018, but initially withheld them from this      Committee and denied that any records relevant to these      topics had been provided to HPSCI. Only after Committee staff      confronted Department staff with the misrepresentation were      the Ohr documents finally produced to this Committee on May      21, 2018.       Accordingly, no later than August 14, please produce all      records previously produced to HPSCI pursuant to its request      and answer the following questions:       1. Are the 63 pages of Ohr-related records produced to this      Committee on May 21, 2018, the sum total of all responsive      Ohr documents in the possession of the DOJ or the FBI? If      not, when will production of records responsive to this      request be complete?       2. When will DOJ and FBI begin producing documents to this      Committee pursuant to this request from the other eight      individuals?       3. When will the Department provide in camera review on      equal terms for the material referenced in the New York Times      article?       Please send all unclassified material directly to the      Committee. In keeping with the requirements of Executive      Order 13526, if any of the responsive documents do contain      classified information, please segregate all unclassified      material within the classified documents, provide all      unclassified information directly to the Committee, and      provide a classified addendum to the Office of Senate      Security. Although the Committee complies with all laws and      regulations governing the handling of classified information,      it is not bound, absent its prior agreement, by any handling      restrictions.       Thank you in advance for your cooperation with this      request. If you have questions, please contact Jason Foster      of my Committee staff.           Sincerely,                                              Charles E. Grassley,                             Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary.
