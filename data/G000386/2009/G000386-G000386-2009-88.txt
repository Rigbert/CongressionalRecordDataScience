 President, I had a chance to hear the Senator from North Dakota. I am not rising to speak on that issue right now, but I support him in that effort. I thank him for working with my staff over a period of years to develop a bill that does not violate any of our trade agreements. That is an important aspect of the work of the Senate Finance Committee on which I serve. I look forward to that debate coming up.
