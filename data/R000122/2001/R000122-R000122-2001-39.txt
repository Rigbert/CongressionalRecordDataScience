Byrd, hosts a luncheon for the participants of the National Youth Science Camp.  This is a distinguished collection of high school students from every State in the Nation who have demonstrated exceptional abilities in the fields of science and technology. They participate in a two-week science camp in Green Bank, WV, and, afterwards, spend several days touring Washington, D.C. Their time in the Nation's capital culminates in the luncheon hosted by Senator Byrd.  At this year's luncheon, held in the Russell Caucus Room on July 19, Senator Byrd was introduced by a member of the board of the National Youth Science Foundation, Mr. Charles McElwee.  When Mr. McElwee introduced Senator Byrd at the luncheon, I was impressed. He recognized the remarkable accomplishments of the senior Senator from West Virginia: that Senator Byrd has served in the Senate for more than 42 years, has been elected to 8 consecutive 6-year Senate terms, and has held more Senate leadership positions than any other Senator in history.  Next, he referred to Senator Byrd's knowledge of Senate Rules, the Constitution, and the Bible, and his prolific writings on the histories of the U.S. Senate and the Roman Senate.  Mr. McElwee then proceeded to challenge the young, budding scientists ``to make the most of [their] natural minds, as has Senator Byrd.''  I consider this powerful introduction of Senator Byrd a touching example of how one of Senator Byrd's constituents feels about him. It highlights the esteem in which he is held by his fellow West Virginians, and I want to share it with my colleagues. Therefore, I ask that Mr. McElwee's introduction of Senator Byrd be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Introduction of Hon. Robert C. Byrd, U.S. Senate Luncheon for National                          Youth Science Campers                          (By Charles McElwee)       How do I introduce a person before whom I stand in awe? How      do I introduce and pay tribute to West Virginia's most      respected and admired elected public official in the State's      history? How do I make the introduction and hold the      attention of youth, our guest science campers, when decades      separate us in age? I resolved to try by relating the mind      and accomplishments of our esteemed speaker to the minds and      aspirations of our youthful listeners.       I commence by way of a reference to a renowned      mathematician, John Forbes Nash, Jr. Nash was born and reared      in Bluefield, West Virginia. He is recognized as a genius in      mathematics, especially in game theory, for which he was      awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1994. His recent      biographer has described Nash as having ``A Beautiful Mind''      and has given that title to her biography of him.       While I stand among a hundred, young, beautiful minds, I      introduce a man with a singularly beautiful mind who has      cultivated, developed and used his natural endowment to its      fullest potential. I speak of the Honorable Robert C. Byrd,      the senior United States Senator from your host state, the      State of West Virginia, and your host for this luncheon      today.       Senator Byrd has served in the United States Senate for      more than 42 years and was reelected in 2000 to an      unprecedented eighth consecutive six-year Senate term. He has      held more leadership positions in the Senate than any other      Senator in history, and presently serves as Chairman of the      powerful Senate Committee on Appropriations.       Senator Byrd is a lawyer, having obtained his J.D. degree      cum laude after ten years of study in night classes in law      school, making him the only sitting member of either House of      Congress to begin and complete law degree studies while      serving in Congress.       I have already told you enough to establish that Senator      Byrd is a man with a great mind and substantial achievements.      But I don't want to stop there because I want to use this      brief occasion of introduction to challenge you to make the      most of your natural gifts of beautiful minds, just as      Senator Byrd has done. Let me illustrate what a beautiful      mind can accomplish when it is disciplined and applied.       (Holding up a copy of the United States Constitution.)      Senator Byrd carries with him at all times when discharging      his public duties a copy of the United States Constitution.      His knowledge of this document is, in my opinion, unsurpassed      by any other member of the Senate. He qualifies as a      constitutional lawyer and scholar. In fact, Senator Byrd      shared with another the first ``We the People'' award      presented by the National Constitution Center to a      constitutional scholar, who had demonstrated his love of, and      concern for, the United States Constitution.       (Holding up a copy of the Bible.) Senator Byrd's knowledge      of the Bible, King James version, is stupendous. He can      recite from memory dozens of passages from both the Old and      New Testaments. But more importantly, he and Erma, his      beloved wife of sixty-four years, have shaped their lives to      conform with biblical precepts.       (Holding up a copy of one of Senator Byrd's favorite poems,      ``The Bridge Builder.'') Senator Byrd has an immense      knowledge of English and American literature and has      committed to memory a great store of verse. Two of his      favorite poems are ``The Bridge Builder'' and ``Fence or An      Ambulance.'' Both refer to youth like you. In the first, an      old man has     crossed over a deep and perilous chasm. Although he would      never pass that way again, he stopped to build a bridge to      span the cleft. Upon being asked why, the old man explained:     There followeth after me today,     A youth whose feet must pass this way.     This chasm which was but naught to me     To that fair youth may a pitfall be.       The second of the poems has this wise counsel: ``Better      guide well the young than reclaim them when old.'' The      stewardship which Senator Byrd believes that adults have for      the welfare and development of the young is evident in his      most beloved verses.       (Holding up one volume of four volumes written by Senator      Byrd on ``The Senate, 1789-1989.'') These four volumes are a      virtual encyclopedia of Senate History. There is probably no      person alive who knows the history and parliamentary rules of      the United States Senate better than Senator Byrd.       (Holding up a copy of ``The Senate of the Roman      Republic.'') This volume is a compilation of fourteen      addresses delivered on the floor of the Senate by Senator      Byrd over five and a-half months on the History of Roman      Constitutionalism in opposition to the proposal for a line-     item presidential veto. The important point here is that he      delivered each of these fourteen speeches, which were packed      with names, dates, and complex narratives, entirely from      memory and without recourse to notes or consultations with      staff aides.       The author of the Foreword of ``The Senate of the Roman      Republic'' has described the book and the lectures compiled      these as displaying ``vast learning, prodigious memory, and      single-minded determination.  .  .  .'' And so it is that      Senator Byrd has used his beautiful mind to accumulate vast      learning, to develop a prodigious memory, and to challenge      himself at all times with a single-minded determination.       But it has not been his mind, or his learning, or his      memory that has endeared Senator Byrd to the people of West      Virginia. Their affection of him is attributable to his      public service and to his sincere interest in their lives and      concern for their welfare. No member of the United States      Congress or of the Senate of the Roman Republic has served      his other constituency with more distinction than has Senator      Byrd.       We have talked about Senator Byrd's great mind, his      learning, his memory, his discipline, his determination, his      public service, and his interest in people, all superb      attributes of which we stand in awe. Yet there is one trait      which I have not mentioned. Senator Byrd referred to it in a      speech he gave last week on the floor of the Senate.       After cajoling his colleagues that the business of the      Senate requires more than a three-day work week, Senator Byrd      said that he would just as soon be in the Senate ``as to be      at home on Saturday mopping the floor.'' ``Yes,'' Senator      Byrd said, ``I mop the bathroom. I mop the kitchen floor. I      mop the utility room. I vacuum. I dust. I even clean the      commodes around my house.'' Add then Senator Byrd added, ``It      is good for me. It keeps me humble.''       Humility is the eighth, and perhaps the finest,      characteristic of our Senator Byrd. And so I implore, you,      our guest science campers, to use your good minds with      humility. If mopping floors will help you to be humble, then      mop floors.       Senator Byrd has been a long-time supporter of the National      Youth Science Camp in West Virginia and has sponsored this      luncheon for many years. Will you please join with me in      applauding Senator Byrd as a way of expressing our gratitude.                          ____________________
