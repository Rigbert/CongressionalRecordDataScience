 Res. 192                Whereas many college presidents rank alcohol abuse as the      number one problem on campus;       Whereas alcohol is a factor in the 3 leading causes of      death for individuals aged 15 through 24 (accidents,      homicides, and suicides);       Whereas more than any other group, college students tend to      consume large numbers of drinks in rapid succession with the      intention of becoming drunk;       Whereas 84 percent of college students report drinking      alcohol during the school year, with 44 percent of all      college students qualifying as binge drinkers and 19 percent      of all college students qualifying as frequent binge      drinkers;       Whereas alcohol is involved in a large percentage of all      campus rapes, violent crimes, student suicides, and      fraternity hazing accidents;       Whereas heavy alcohol consumption on college campuses can      result in drunk driving crashes, hospitalization for alcohol      overdoses, trouble with police, injury, missed classes, and      academic failure;       Whereas the second-hand effects of student alcohol      consumption range from assault, property damage, and unwanted      sexual advances, to interruptions in study or sleep, or      having to ``babysit'' another student who drank too much; and       Whereas campus binge drinking can also lead to the death of      our Nation's young and promising students: Now, therefore, be      it       Resolved,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This resolution may be cited as ``The Collegiate Initiative      To Reduce Binge Drinking Resolution''.     SEC. 2. SENSE OF THE SENATE.       It is the sense of the Senate that, in an effort to change      the culture of alcohol consumption on college campuses, all      institutions of higher education should carry out the      following:       (1) The president of the institution should appoint a task      force consisting of school administrators, faculty, students,      Greek system representatives, and others to conduct a full      examination of student and academic life at the institution.      The task force should make recommendations for a broad range      of policy and program changes that would serve to reduce      alcohol and other drug-related problems. The institution      should provide resources to assist the task force in      promoting the campus policies and proposed environmental      changes that have been identified.       (2) The institution should provide maximum opportunities      for students to live in an alcohol-free environment and to      engage in stimulating, alcohol-free recreational and leisure      activities.       (3) The institution should enforce a ``zero tolerance''      policy on the illegal consumption of alcohol by its students      and should take steps to reduce the opportunities for      students, faculty, staff, and alumni to legally consume      alcohol on campus.       (4) The institution should vigorously enforce its code of      disciplinary sanctions for those who violate campus alcohol      policies. Students with alcohol or other drug-related      problems should be referred to an on-campus counseling      program.       (5) The institution should adopt a policy of eliminating      alcoholic beverage-related sponsorship of on-campus      activities. The institution should adopt policies limiting      the advertisement and promotion of alcoholic beverages on      campus.       (6) Recognizing that school-centered policies on alcohol      will be unsuccessful if local businesses sell alcohol to      underage or intoxicated students, the institution should form      a ``Town/Gown'' alliance with community leaders. That      alliance should encourage local commercial establishments      that promote or sell alcoholic beverages to curtail illegal      student access to alcohol and adopt responsible alcohol      marketing and service practices.
