 President, Chairman Enzi suggests that this is just a ``technical corrections amendment.'' Actually, that is not quite accurate.  At a time when the United States spends more on defense than the next 12 countries combined, amazingly, thisamendment paves the way for a $91 billion increase in defense spending in fiscal year 2018.  This amendment would renew the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act and throw up to 32 million Americans off of the health insurance they currently have, increase premiums for older workers, and make even more harmful cuts to Medicaid.  This amendment includes a provision requiring the use of so-called dynamic scoring, or what President George H.W. Bush appropriately referred to as voodoo economics, allowing the Republicans to claim that their massive tax breaks for the rich will pay for themselves.  At a time when the cost of college education is skyrocketing, this amendment calls for dramatic cuts to student financial aid.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.
