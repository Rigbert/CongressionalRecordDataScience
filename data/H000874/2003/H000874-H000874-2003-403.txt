The gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young) and the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) have worked diligently not only on the substance of what is in the supplemental, but also in upholding the position of the House as it relates to the balance of power between the executive department and the legislative department as set forth in the Constitution of the United States.  As a matter of fact, when we started our consideration of the supplemental, the first thing the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young) did was to read article I and appropriate provisions of the Constitution. I think all of us in this body can be appreciative of the fact that the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young) and the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) have taken the position that I think is appropriate for our institution, as well as for our country, and I share the majority leader's view.  We appreciate their efforts.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?
