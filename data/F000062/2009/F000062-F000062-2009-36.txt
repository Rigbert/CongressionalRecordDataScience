 All the residents got very upset because this is not an isolated community, and they began to call, and we worked out a solution--to use contraception, actually, to cull the herd.  But I do not know whether that is going to work. I think the Senator pointed out a good situation where the Park Service has to be more sensitive when it does some of these things.  I thank the Senator for the efforts he has made--and successful ones.
