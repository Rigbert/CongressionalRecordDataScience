 President, we all know the budget cannot be balanced by waiving a magic wand. Reducing a $200 billion budget deficit will impose real pain on American families. The painful cuts would be worth it, however, if through shared sacrifice, we brought our fiscal house in order.  I am disappointed I cannot endorse the budget resolution. While I support balancing the budget, I cannot support the priorities the majority imposes to try to get us there in 7 years. The Republican plan will impose too much pain on too many families. Those who will suffer the most under this Republican budget resolution will be middle class families across America. From preschool education to nursing home care for the elderly, middle-class families will bear the biggest burden in overcoming our Nation's budget deficit.  This budget, though not signed into law, will set the stage for the appropriations and budget reconciliation battles later this year. This resolution sets the Federal Government on course to cut vital services for American families across the country. This is a course I cannot accept. This is how families will be hurt:  Medicare: The $270 billion cut over the next 7 years is the largest Medicare cut in history. Yet middle-income families will carry the burden--97 percent of all Medicare spending go to families with annual incomes of $50,000 or less.  Education: The resolution will cut $40 billion over the next 7 years, cutting back on Pell grants, student loans, and Head Start. Nearly one half of all Pell grant recipients have annual incomes of less than $10,000. The elimination of the forbearance of in-school interest will force students to carry higher debt just as they enter the work force. This will hurt the young as they struggle to get on their feet.  Medicaid: The resolution's $182 billion cut could force 8 million to lose Medicaid coverage by 2002, more than an 18-percent reduction over the next 7 years.  Earned Income Tax Credit: The resolution reverses the EITC coverage for childless workers adopted in 1993. This provision only partially compensates these workers for the five payroll tax increases they have been forced to accept during the 1980's. The cut will force low-income workers with incomes below the poverty level to pay a higher tax burden next April.  We have heard a great deal that the budget resolution represents a glide path toward a balanced budget. However, I am afraid this budget resolution is more of a crash landing than a glide path.  By contrast, the administration has challenged the path of the majority in Congress, offering a slower path to balance in exchange for a reduction in the cuts for important Federal programs. When the President announced his proposal, he was criticized by Republicans for its economic assumptions. However, the Republican plan assumes an unprecedented 11 consecutive years of economic growth to justify its harsh cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs.  As we start down the path the majority lays out today, we will need to continue to review both the plan and the timeline the resolution adopts to balance the budget. The value of balancing the budget in 7 years will be measured by the economy the cuts will help to create in each of those 7 years and every year afterward. The Federal budget must address our national economic needs and not weaken an already fragile economy.                   State Economy Cannot Take the Cuts  Mr. President, the California economy is beginning the painful process of emerging from its longest recession since the Great Depression. While the rest of the country suffered as well, California's recession was both longer and more severe than the rest of the Nation.  California's unemployment rate is nearly 3 percent higher than the national average.  More than 1.28 million Californians are out of work. In fact, California has 17 percent of all the unemployed workers in America.  To these burdens, the Republican budget resolution will impose more than $50 billion in additional budget cuts for California for Medicare, Medicaid, and the earned income tax credit alone, during the next 7 years. I cannot support these additional burdens for California families on our already strained economy.                       Medicare and Medicaid Cuts  Mr. President, this budget resolution imposes its biggest cuts on health care programs for the elderly and those most in need of Federal assistance. The $450 billion in cuts from Medicare and Medicaid go too far, too fast, without any assurances that our health care system and the economy will not be significantly undercut. Health care spending represents more than one-seventh of the Nation's total economy. We cannot make the sweeping changes proposed without imposing significant burdens on families, medical providers, hospitals, and State and local governments.  We all know that Medicare and Medicaid spending cuts are necessary. The real questions are how much to cut, how to make sure the cuts are distributed fairly, and how to make sure the cuts can work?  The proposed resolution cuts over $450 billion out of Medicare and Medicaid over the next 7 years--more than 60 percent of the $1.3 trillion in cuts represent Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, or other entitlements. The impact of these cuts would affect California enormously--more than almost every other State.  The Health Care Finance Administration suggests the $270 billion in Medicare cuts may cause over $35 billion in total cuts to California hospitals and patients over the next 7 years.  Despite having only 9.5 percent of the Nation's Medicare population, California would pay for over 13 percent of the Medicare cuts.  The alarming trend is repeated when we turn to Medicaid. The Kaiser Commission on the Future of Medicaid issued a new Urban Institute report that projects that California and just five other States would bear over 40 percent of the total Medicaid budget cuts, and cost-saving measures would cut at least 5 million additional people off of Medicaid nationwide.  Total California Medicaid funding are expected to be reduced by nearly $20 billion over 7 years.  The Medicaid cuts will force States to spend more, undercut the efforts of our safety net hospitals, increase the numbers of uninsured persons, and shift even more costs to the private employer-based health care system.                        Education and Investment  Mr. President, U.C.L.A.'s Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy reports the principal threat to job and income growth in California is the lack of a strategy to establish priorities and fund critical public investments. The center reconfirmed previous studies, calling for investment in education and infrastructure to strengthen the economy. I agree--only by investing in the next generation through education, we can provide for a stronger future.  Yet the Republican budget resolution cuts discretionary and mandatory programs for education by $40 billion, the largest education cut in U.S. history. The resolution will cut support for education at all levels, including elementary, secondary, and higher education. This budget resolution will lead to cuts in student loans for 4 million students, making it more difficult for families to send children to school and adding to the debt students will carry for years.  We cannot move forward unless we invest in our most important resource--our children. Only by carefully investing, can we build a stronger, more capable and competitive nation. These cuts will leave us less able to prepare for the future.                               Conclusion  Mr. President, the priorities we spend our scarce dollars on are just as critical as how much we spend. I am very concerned these budget cuts could damage an already strained economy and fail to prepare our next generation for the competitive world of the future, weakening our long-term economic goals.  Congress needs to carefully consider cuts in spending because the value of balancing the budget in 7 years will be measured by the economy the cuts will help to create. Regaining our full economic strength in California will take years. We cannot take economic recovery for granted and we must work to maintain economic vitality in an increasingly competitive global economy. I will work to ensure Congress takes the right action to strengthen the economy and create jobs, without igniting another round of economic strains for California businesses and families.  I am concerned this budget resolution will not protect families or provide opportunity and could worsen our current fragile economic state. I cannot support deficit reduction which imposes such a heavy cost on those least able afford it.
