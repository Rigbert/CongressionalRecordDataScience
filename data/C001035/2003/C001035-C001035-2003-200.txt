While many Americans have experienced the inconvenience of a temporary blackout or brownout, frequent power outages and high energy prices for the citizens of North Haven and Vinalhaven have imposed significant financial burden and uncertainty on the community.  The placement of the cables on the sea floor, in combination with their old age, means that the lines are susceptible to damage from rough seas and fishing activity. Blackouts resulting from a severed or damaged cable not only incapacitate local businesses, but also disable the Water Districts, hampering their ability to maintain adequate water supplies to the towns' residents.  Due to the complex nature of working underwater, repairing the undersea cables is both expensive and time consuming. Fox Islands Electric Cooperative currently carries $2.7 million in debt owed to the Rural Utilities Service and estimates that replacement of the submarine cables will cost $7 million dollars. While the islands' electricity costs have always been above average due to its remoteness and small population, frequent disruptions and repairs have raised electric rates even further for the citizens of North Haven and Vinalhaven. As the distinguished chairmen and distinguished ranking member continue their work on the fiscal year 2003 Omnibus Appropriations bill in conference, I would greatly appreciate consideration that may be given to Fox Islands Electric Cooperative.
