The Senator from Rhode Island, who has been speaking about the lack of emergency, the lack of crisis in the gun industry, and the fact that this is certainly not emergency legislation--I don't believe it is even wise legislation for us to consider--the Senator from Rhode Island is a graduate of West Point and a former officer in the U.S. Army. I would like to ask the Senator, who serves on the Armed Services Committee, as he has read these Army Times articles which raise questions about why the U.S. Senate would give up on the Department of Defense authorization bill for our troops, leave it behind and move to this bill, the special interest bill to protect the gun industry from their liability for their own wrongdoing, I would like to ask the Senator, what kind of impact can this have on the morale of the men and women who read about the Senate leaving this important legislation?
