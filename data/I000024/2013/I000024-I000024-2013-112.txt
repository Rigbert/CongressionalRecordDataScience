President, first of all, let me thank my friend the distinguished Senator from Ohio for including me in his unanimous consent request. I will briefly speak about an amendment.  We all understand that the issue is going to come before this body to send activity into Syria. I am very much opposed to any kind of force in Syria, but if it happens, we want to be sure there is some protection there. So I have an amendment that even if my amendment passes, I will still oppose the effort of this President to send activity into Syria, and I believe it would precipitate a war.  My amendment is very simple. If the President takes military action against Syria, sequestration of our Armed Forces would be delayed for 1 year. We are talking about the fiscal year where we would take another $52 billion out of our military.  What Asad has done and continues to do is reprehensible, but the United States can't afford another war given the current state of our military. The threats from Syria and the Middle East are not emerging threats. These threats have been around for decades. We knew they were there. There is nothing new about them. Yet the readiness capabilities of our military continue to be decimated by drastic budget cuts.  Sixteen Air Force combat flying squadrons have been grounded. We finally, after 3 months, put them back in the air again, and right now we know it costs more to get them back in a state of readiness than the money we saved from grounding them for 3 months. Our naval fleet has been reduced to historically low levels, the end strength of our ground forces has been cut by more than 100,000 personnel, and hundreds of thousands of DOD civilian employees have been furloughed. Just in my State of Oklahoma, in one of my installations, 14,000 civilian employees have been furloughed.  We can't have it both ways--continuing to cut the funding of our military while still expecting to meet our national security requirements. As military readiness and capabilities decline, we accept greater risk, and, as I have always said, risk equals lives. Every time we have a hearing, we have our combatant commanders come in and talk about the risks. Risk means lives. As I have always said, risk equals lives, and allowing these cuts to continue while proposing to send our forces into harm's way is immoral and reprehensible.  Over the last week I have heard a lot from the President and his administration about how any action in Syria will be limited. I suggest there is no such thing as limited war. Once we decide to strike, we can't predict where it will end or how the situation might escalate. Let's not forget that we have troops currently on the ground in Jordan and Turkey, marines guarding our Embassies, and sailors and airmen stationed around the region. We have already heard that Iran is ordering its terrorist proxies to retaliate by attacking U.S. interests in the region, including our Embassy in Iraq. The State Department has ordered nonessential personnel to evacuate our Embassy in Lebanon. The threats to our forces are real.  I wish to read for my colleagues excerpts from a letter that was written by two ladies, Rebekah Sanderlin and Molly Blake. These are spouses of two of our servicemen. They are responding--much more eloquently than I could ever hope to--to the immense hardship our military is enduring under sequestration and to the misguided belief that a military strike on Syria can be done in isolation--that it won't affect our troops and their families.  I ask unanimous consent that the entire letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              An Open Letter to CNN Reporter Barbara Starr            [From The Huffington Post, posted Sept. 4, 2013]       Dear Ms. Starr: We are writing to let you in on a secret.      It's a big one--so get to a fresh page in your reporter      notebook and have your pen poised and ready.       You told your viewers last Thursday that there was ``no      question'' that the military could afford to go into Syria      and that you ``don't think it's really going to affect      military families at all.''       Here's some inside information for you: There is no such      thing as a person-less war. Our military cannot afford for      Americans to forget that wars and battles and military      strikes are fought by troops, that troops are people, and      that those people have families.       In our military communities this summer we couldn't even      afford to pay federal employees for a five-day work week.      Military families can't get doctors' appointments and can't      get the counseling services needed to grapple with the      problems we already have, problems largely created by almost      12 years of war. And while Congress was busy sending a      warning letter to the president to ensure they get to sign      off on whether or not we go to war, they managed to ignore      military families when the sequester hit. Today clinic hours      are being slashed--along with pretty much every other service      military families need. Walking around our communities      lately, it doesn't look like we can afford much of anything--     and certainly not a whole new war.       And that's just taking `afford' literally.       Figuratively, the picture is even grimmer. An entire      generation of military kids have grown up with a parent they      know primarily through Skype. Couples are trying to piece      together marriages that have been badly fractured by more      years spent apart than together. We grew hopeful that better      days were coming as we watched the end of the Iraq war, and      we're thrilled that the end of our involvement in Afghanistan      is nigh, and yet now all of cable news is breathless and      giddy with talk of war in Syria.       You boast, in your bio, that you have exclusive access to      Lt. Gen. Russel Honore and you've interviewed several      secretaries of defense and other important people at the CIA.      You may very well have Sec. Hagel on speed dial--but that      doesn't give you the right to toss around your thoughts on      how military families may or may not be affected by military      action. Not until you've stood in our shoes for longer than a      three-minute live shot.       You see, Barbara, there's no such thing as `no boots on the      ground.' We in the military community sigh and shake our      heads when we hear talk like that from the people on TV.      Perhaps you consider a relatively small number of troops to      be the same as zero--but we don't. We know that each of those      service members is somebody's somebody.       As journalists, we like to show both sides of the story. So      we would like to also voice our thanks. For your careless      words have aimed a giant floodlight on the military-civilian      divide. Blue Star Families Director of Research and Policy,      Vivian Greentree said it best:       We hear a sense of angst in our membership and throughout      the military community. How can we be in the middle of the      fall out of sequestration--furloughs, program cuts, loss of      mission readiness--we have families who can't get medical      appointments. They are all wondering how they will manage if      the situation in Syria continues to escalate. They wonder how      will it affect them. Not, if it will affect them. But, how.       ``That statement, in all its small-minded glory, captures      the civilian-military divide more clearly than any survey      ever could.''       And maybe someday we will be able to fight whole wars      without using a single human . . . And Rosie the Robot will      clean our kitchens while we tackle our morning commutes in      flying cars. But today, in 2013, we can't have a `surgical      strike' without someone saying where to drop the bombs or      where to aim those missiles. And those planes that drop the      bombs? The destroyers that carry the missiles? They have      pilots, captains and crews. All humans. Even the ``unmanned''      drones have human pilots, and the psychological wear and tear      on them is staggering. Planes take off from airfields in      foreign lands or from aircraft carriers, both of which are      staffed by thousands of American somebodies, just like those      destroyer ships. At every turn in a military operation you      will find people. Intel analysts, linguists, flight crews,      and cooks. Even war plans, regardless of whether they were,      as you stated, ``on deployment anyway'' rely on thousands of      people who will be pulled to a new duty, which causes      reshuffling far and wide in the military community.       And this, most definitely, affects military families.       The big question is, as you said, ``will it work?'' and, as      we learned from the most recent wars, it bears recalling that      things don't always go as planned. But that's not the only      question. Do not kid yourself, Barbara, and don't you dare      kid the viewers who trust your reporting.           Sincerely,                                Rebekah Sanderlin and Molly Blake,                                                 Military Spouses.
