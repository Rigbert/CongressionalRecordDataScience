President, it is my honor and pleasure to inform my fellow Senators that this year marks the 21st anniversary of Community Food Resource Center, a New York City organization that has been a leader in the fight for improved nutrition and economic well-being for all Americans.  CFRC's first project in 1980 was a school breakfast campaign. Since then, CFRC has been instrumental in shaping and promoting child nutrition programs. Because of CFRC's efforts, for example, New York City became the first major city to implement universal school meals on a large scale.  I became familiar with CFRC because of my work on the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee. I have come to admire and respect the organization and its dedicated staff, and I feel honored to have had the chance to work with them. Whatever the issue, I can always count on CFRC to focus on the needs of those whose voices are rarely heard in the Capitol.  I would like to highlight just a few of CFRC's many innovative programs. Its Community Kitchen of West Harlem provides meals to more than 600 people nightly. Its CookShop program encourages schoolchildren to eat more fruits and vegetables. Its senior dinner programs use school cafeterias after hoursto provide nutritious meals, social activities and an intergenerational program.  CFRC is also a leading advocate for government policies assisting low-income individuals and families. At a time when Food Stamp participation is declining nationwide, CFRC's Food Force project sends outreach workers with laptop computers to community-based sites to pre-screen thousands of needy New Yorkers. With TANF reauthorization approaching, CFRC's Welfare Made A Difference National Campaign is challenging the stereotypes that led to passage of the 1996 welfare law.  CFRC is not only committed to making a difference, it is also effective. Each year, tens of thousands of New Yorkers benefit from CFRC's programs, and its advocacy has made a difference to millions of Americans. I hope that 21 years from now, this country no longer needs groups like CFRC. But if there are still those among us who are poor or hungry, I hope that CFRC is still here keeping their needs in the national conscience.                          ____________________
