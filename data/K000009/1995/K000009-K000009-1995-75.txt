Chairman, that is what I would like to do. I want to say, first of all, that I think that the work that the gentleman from California [Mr. Lewis] did in helping us to restore the health education scholarships for nurses, for occupational therapists, and so forth, a $10 million program that has existed since the early 1980's, was right for America and it was the proper thing to do with some of the dollars that were given to our committee when other committees worked out their bottom line numbers.  On this particular one, as I mentioned, I am not blaming the gentleman personally for this. I am exceedingly disappointed in the Rules Committee based on what happened.  Mr. McINNIS. Regular order.
