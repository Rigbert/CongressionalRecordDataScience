President, in the midst of all the confusion and anxiety of the last week, we are going to be asked to vote on the confirmation of three judges that I think should be looked at very carefully.  First is the nomination of William Fletcher to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Groups are in opposition due to a Law Review article in which he stated that judicial discretion trumps legislative discretion when a legislature fails to act.  Presently, Fletcher's mother is sitting on the Ninth Circuit, which is historically the most liberal and activist court in the United States. Over the last 3 years, the Supreme Court overturned the Ninth Circuit more than any other.  In a book review, about which Mr. Fletcher was questioned before the committee, he stated that political circumstances outweigh a literal reading of the Constitution. In short, the Constitution is what Judge Fletcher says it is. Judge Fletcher is an extremist and should not be confirmed.  Nomination of Richard Paez to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals: In an outrageous ruling in 1997, Judge Paez ruled that an American company could be liable for human rights abuses committed by their partners in another country.  Paez has shown a bias against religious and conservative groups. In one of the most publicized cases Paez heard as a District Judge was the 1989 trial of Operation Rescue leader Randall Terry. Paez became upset with some of the pro-life language Terry used and ``stormed off the bench.'' Additionally, he angrily warned the defendants that their Bible would be confiscated if they continued to wave or consult it.  While a sitting District Judge, Paez gave a speech at UC-Berkeley's law school in which he called California's Proposition 209 an ``anti-civil rights initiative.'' In that speech, he also said, ``legal action is essential'' to ``achieving the goal of diversifying the bench.'' He characterizes himself as a ``liberal.'' Judge Paez is an extremist and should not be confirmed.  Lastly, and briefly, the nomination of Timothy Dyk to the Federal Court: While in private practice, Mr. Dyk, successfully fought the FCC's ban on indecent programming to protect children.  He has sat on the board of People for the American Way, and while working as an attorney for People for the American Way, he successfully defended a county school board that forced students to read materials their parents believed violated their deeply held religious beliefs. A member of Mr. Dyk's legal team called the concerned parents ``somehow less important'' and said ``the enemy was really not'' the plaintiffs ``but [Rev. Jerry] Falwell.''  I believe that Mr. Dyk is also an extremist and should not be confirmed in his nomination.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
