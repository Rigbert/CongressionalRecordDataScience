President, I wish to recognize an inspirational artist, entrepreneur, and philanthropist from my State, Gracie Schram, who has been awarded the 2016 Nation Federation of Independent Business Owners Young Entrepreneur Award.  Miss Schram, of Leawood, KS, is the founder and owner of Gracie Schram Music, an entertainment company that provides live performance, speaking engagements, original music, recordings, and merchandise.  At the young age of 10, she was introduced to the reality of underprivileged children in Haiti and Africa. Inspired to do good, she was determined to improve the living conditions of so many she hadn't even met.  She went on to write and produce several albums, the proceeds of which led to the building of two fish ponds in Africa and an orphanage in Haiti. This is an extraordinary accomplishment. When asked why she has chosen to help those in need, her response was, ``I was just a kid who wasn't willing to wait for somebody else to change the world.''  I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Miss Schram on her outstanding achievements. We wish her nothing but the best for her future entrepreneurial and educational endeavors.                          ____________________
