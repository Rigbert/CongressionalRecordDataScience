 President, I am pleased to have lent my support to H.R. 1757, the 1998-99 State Department authorization bill, which passed last night. There is much that I support in this bill, and I wanted to take a few minutes today to discuss this bill and my vote.  With its provisions to reorganize America's foreign policy institutions and to press for reform at the United Nations I think it is fair to say that this bill is one of the most far-reaching and important bills that we will consider this Congress.  For well over a decade the United States has been steadily reducing the amount of money it devotes to international affairs agencies and programs. When current figures are adjusted for inflation, the cuts in recent years have been significant--50 percent since 1984.  I was pleased when the administration requested a much-needed increase in funds for international affairs in the 1998 budget request. And I am pleased that this bill has, on the whole, preserved those funds.  The international affairs budget authorized in this bill will go a long way toward righting the inequities of American international affairs spending of the past decade, and toward creating an efficient framework to support America's global leadership in the millennium to come.  Just as important as authorizing funds for the conduct of American foreign policy, this bill also takes an historic step in working with President Clinton and Secretary Albright to create a new foreign affairs structure for the 21st century.  Many of our current foreign policy institutions were created during the cold war, with specific missions and goals in mind.  The reorganization plan put forward by the administration and supported by this bill reflects the need to preserve the unique skills and capabilities of each of the current agencies with the requirement that our institutional arrangements reflect the new demands guiding the conduct of U.S. foreign policy.  By the end of 1999 the result of this bill will be a new streamlined foreign policy structure, drawing on the best people and practices of the old agencies, and fully capable of meeting the new challenges of the 21st century.  Most importantly, from my perspective, this bill preserves some flexibility for the administration in its implementation of the President's plan.  I opposed the reorganization plan we considered in the last Congress, because it denied the President the flexibility he needs to carry out our foreign affairs. This reorganization plan suffers from no such flaw.  I would also like to take a little time to express my support for the plan to repay the United Nations the arrears our Nation owes it and for reform of the United Nations that is contained in the bill before us, S. 903.  I support this package of repayment of arrears and reform benchmarks for one simple reason: because I believe a strong and effective United Nations is fundamentally important to the national interest of the United States.  I am an unabashed supporter of the United Nations. Now that our colleague, Senator Claiborne Pell, has retired, I believe I am the only Member of this body to be in attendance at the founding of the United Nations in my hometown of San Francisco 52 years ago. I was not a delegate, as was Senator Pell--I was a bit younger then--but I am proud that I was able to help the host city celebrate that important occasion.  As mayor of San Francisco, I had the honor and privilege of presiding over the 40th anniversary celebrations in 1985, and 2 years ago, I traveled with many of my colleagues to San Francisco for the 50th anniversary celebrations.  These milestones mean a great deal to me, not because of their historical interest so much as because of their significance in the life of the United States. My own belief is that if the United Nations did not exist, we would have to invent it.  I am not among the United Nations' major detractors. I do not believe for 1 minute that the United Nations is somehow out to impose its will on the United States, or to intrude on our sovereignty. I reject outright the paranoid fantasies of those who warn of the specter of U.N. taxation or a U.N. army, or the U.N. leading inexorably toward world government.  The United Nations serves American interests each and every day. Through the U.N. High Commission for Refugees, it feeds and clothes homeless refugees in time of war. Through U.N. development programs, it helps the poorer nations of the world develop theirinfrastructures. It provides a forum for negotiating multilateral agreements on arms control, protecting the environment, and other matters that affect all nations.  The U.N. specialized agencies also address problems that know no political borders. The World Health Organization fights diseases like AIDS that destroy the lives of those they afflict, and, if left unchecked, threaten countless others. The International Labor Organization helps keep track of forced labor and child labor, leading to multilateral efforts to improve working conditions around the world.  Perhaps most importantly, the United Nations helps promote peace and security in trouble spots around the world. The United Nations is probably best known for peacekeeping. While Americans often remember the debacles of Bosnia and Somalia, few realize that U.N. peacekeepers are helping maintain peaceful borders and facilitate peaceful transitions in such places as the Golan Heights, Macedonia, Angola, and Kuwait.  The United Nations also enables the United States to cooperate with our allies to carry out missions that are important to U.S. and international security. With U.N. approval, the United States led the nations of the world to expel Saddam from Iraq in Operation Desert Storm. The United Nations continues to enforce sanctions on Iraq and monitor Iraqi weapons programs.  Because all of these operations require the approval of the U.N. Security Council, the United States, which has a veto on that Council, must approve them. These operations are never forced down our throats. To the contrary, our leadership role and our veto allow us to leverage the United Nations to conduct operations that are in our interests, but with the burden shared among our allies.  For all of these reasons, I value the United Nations and believe it is imperative that we help it regain a sound financial footing. The United Nations' current financial difficulties are threatening to render it unable to implement many of its most important programs. And the biggest portion of the United Nations' shortfall is directly attributable to the United States' failure to pay its arrears.  So the payment of these arrears is no trivial matter. It is the best--perhaps the only--way to ensure the United Nations' survival as a force for international peace and security in the post-cold-war era.  Now, I share the view of the Senator from Indiana, who rightly pointed out that our payment of these arrears is not voluntary. It is an obligation under treaty commitments, signed and ratified according to our Constitution.  But I also recognize something else. The political reality dictates that if we are to pay any arrears to the United Nations, they must be accompanied by a package of reform benchmarks.  Over 4 months ago, the majority leader convened a working group of House and Senate authorizers and appropriators, Republicans and Democrats, to work with the administration on resolving the arrears question.  As the ranking member of the International Operations Subcommittee, I was involved in this task force from the beginning, and my staff attended virtually all of the subsequent meetings, until Senator Helms and Senator Biden began the detailed endgame negotiations.  In the very first meeting of this task force, Secretary of State Albright came to discuss the administration's proposal, which was essentially for Congress to appropriate all of the arrears--$1.021 billion--up front, and to attach no conditions to their payment.  In the room were a number of leading Republican authorizers and appropriators, as well as the majority leader. As I recall, the only Democrats in the room for much of the meeting were the distinguished ranking member of the House International Relations Committee, Lee Hamilton of Indiana, and myself.  Even then, Mr. Hamilton and I--two strong supporters of the U.S. role in the United Nations--told the Secretary of State that, as sympathetic as we were to the need to pay these arrears, the administration's proposal did not stand a chance. We said it then, and I say it here today: The votes are not there for repaying our arrears without reform benchmarks.  So the negotiations commenced, and they continued through literally hundreds of hours. Both sides have made significant concessions. The administration, which wanted to pay all the arrears up front, certainly has. Anyone who saw the early Republican proposals, which called for payment of only a portion of the arrears, over 5 years, and with many more, potentially unachievable benchmarks, knows that the distinguished Senator from North Carolina has given a lot.  But the final result of these talks is a package that calls for a tough, but achievable, series of reforms to be implemented by the United Nations over the next 3 years, while the United States pays off $819 million in U.N. arrears, a figure that is the Administration's bottom line. These reforms include greater oversight of budgets and personnel, phasing out obsolete programs, and, perhaps most importantly, a reduction in the U.S. share of the assessed budget from 25 to 20 percent.  From the beginning, I felt that 3 years was about the right length of time for this package, and I argued that in the task force. It is long enough to give us some leverage to ensure the reforms are enacted, but not so long that the other member States do not believe it is credible that we will pay our debts.  Make no mistake, achieving these reforms will take a great deal of work. Some of them, such as the reduction of the U.S. share of the budget, which the other member States must agree to, will require our U.N. Ambassador to employ all of his negotiating skills. Others will require the committed effort of the Secretary General, Kofi Annan--a man I believe is genuine in his desire for real reform.  I acknowledge that this process is not perfect, and that there will be resentment among other nations who feel that Congress is unilaterally dictating what should be multilateral decisions. I understand that.  But these arrears must be paid. And the political reality is that our choice is either to pay these bills in this fashion, over 3 years, while working with the United Nations for reforms, or not to pay them at all. That, to me, is an easy choice. I want to pay our arrears and strengthen the United Nations.  In addition to the two major achievements of U.N. reform and State Department reorganization, this bill also contributes to furthering American interests in the world in a myriad of smaller, though not less significant, ways. Let me provide three such examples.  This bill authorizes funds which will go to the International War Crimes Tribunal, and which will help assure that those who committed genocide and rape in Rwanda and Bosnia are brought to justice.  It lends our support to the work of the Asia Foundation, which, through innovative public-private partnerships is able to leverage Federal resources to effectively promote U.S. political, economic, cultural, and security interests throughout the Pacific rim.  And this bill authorizes funds which will go to support vitally needed infrastructure and new information technology at our embassies and missions.  I have been to many of the crumbling and inadequate State Department facilities throughout the world, and can attest from first-hand experience the importance of these efforts.  As I stated earlier, it is my belief that this bill, with its United Nations and reorganization provisions, takes a significant step in the right direction on several critical issues which Congress has been wrestling with for the past several years. Moreover, the cooperation and hard work of the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee on this bill, also marks, I believe, a return to a spirit of bipartisan cooperation on foreign policy. I am proud to have been able to cast my vote in support of this bill.                          ____________________
