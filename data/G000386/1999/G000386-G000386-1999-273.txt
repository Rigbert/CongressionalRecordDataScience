 President, I rise today to discuss an issue which affects children across the country.  Brachial plexus injuries (BPI), also known as Erb's palsy, occur when the nerves which control the muscles in the shoulders, arms and hands are injured. Any or all of the nerves which run from the spine to the arms and hands may be paralyzed. Often this injury is caused when an infant's brachial plexus nerves are stretched in the birth canal.  What is devastating about BPI is that the children will have paralyzed arms and hands which may be misshapen or extending out from the body at unnatural angles. This can retard a child's physical development, making everyday tasks such as coloring, drawing, dressing and going to the bathroom, which their peers can perform with no trouble, almost impossible. The feeling in the children's arms and hands is similar to how a non-paralyzed person's arm feels when he or she sleeps on it. This numbness leads to more serious injuries--toddlers and young children will accidentally or purposely burn or mutilate themselves because they lack feeling in their extremities. Some children can undergo expensive surgery and therapy and, though never fully recovering, can regain some normal function of their arms and hands. However, many children suffer permanent, debilitating paralysis from which they never fully recover.  On Thursday, October 21, I sponsored a meeting between members of the United Brachial Plexus Network (UBPN), surgeons, occupational therapists and experts from the Social Security Administration to discuss why so many families with children with brachial plexus injuries were being turned down for Supplemental Security Income despite seeming to meet the qualifications for such payments as laid out in the Social Security Administration handbook.  The Social Security Administration gave a presentation explaining the statutory qualifications for receiving SSI. Their presentations were followed by presentations by surgeons and therapists explaining how children with BPI function and why they feel children paralyzed by BPI should be eligible for SSI payments because of their disability.  Most moving were the presentations made by children with BPI and parents of BPI children. These courageous people talked about their daily lives and the difficulties children with BPI must endure in attempting to perform everyday tasks.  I want to commend UBPN board member Kathleen Kennedy from my home state of Iowa, Iowa State Senator Kitty Rehberg and Sharon Gavagan, who also sits on the board for UBPN, for their hard work and dedication in organizing the meeting between the UBPN and the Social Security Administration. I want to thank the surgeons and therapists who traveled from Texas to make presentations. I also want to commend Susan Daniels, Kenneth Nibali of the Social Security Administration and the experts from SSA for their willingness to travel from Baltimore to participate in the meeting. I am encouraged by their willingness to consider issuing new guidelines to the personnel in the SSA field offices regarding brachial plexus injuries.  We must work to ensure that everyone who meets the guidelines for receiving SSI has the opportunity to apply for the benefits and be given a fair hearing. I look forward to seeing the new guidelines from SSA, and I am eager to continue working with the Social Security Administration on this issue.                          ____________________
