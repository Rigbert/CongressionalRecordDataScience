 Ladies and gentlemen, we have come a far pace. The majority of this House has just voted to do for Americans what a hundred years of Presidents have asked for. We are on the cusp of a great victory for America and for Americans. This motion is inconsistent with reconciliation, a process that 72 percent of the time was pursued by the other party. They know that this motion is not in order and they know this motion would not have support in the Senate, so they are indirectly trying to kill this bill. However, as well, I think they well misstate the case.  I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.                              {time}  2300
