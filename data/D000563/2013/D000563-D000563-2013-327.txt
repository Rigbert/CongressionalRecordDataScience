President, I am honored today to pay tribute to myfriend David Vite on his retirement from the Illinois Retail Merchants Association, IRMA. He spent 35 years with the Illinois retailers, helping businesses across the State of Illinois engage with government and better serve their communities.  David has a long history of service. After serving in the Army, he went to college in Wisconsin and graduated from the University of Wisconsin at LaCrosse. This must be where he developed his affinity for the Green Bay Packers. In all of the time David spent in Illinois, he never adopted our very own Chicago Bears. He remains to this day a loyal Packers fan.  Early in his career, David became the Executive Director of the Woodstock Chamber of Commerce and oversaw community developments in Woodstock, IL. By 1978, David had joined the Illinois Retail Merchants Association as a field representative. Within 3 years, the Association had promoted him to Vice President of Government Affairs and not long after that, David Vite took over as President.  As President, David was determined to help resolve the challenges facing Illinois retailers and at the same time to create opportunities for them. He provided training for his members to help them promote sales. He created a school-to-work training program to help cultivate the next generation of retail leaders. He led an effort to publish a manual to help merchants become more environmentally friendly. And throughout his tenure, he was the voice for business as Illinois policymakers addressed dilemmas in unemployment insurance, worker's compensation, and sales taxes.  I can't thank David enough for the support he helped build across Illinois for the Marketplace Fairness Act. I am proud to say that in May, the Senate passed this bill by a vote of 69-27, helping to level the playing field for retailers in Illinois and across the country. With David's help, we were able to communicate with retailers in every corner of Illinois to better understand the need and urgency for tax fairness legislation.  I would like to thank David for his leadership and many contributions over his decades of work with communities and business. Illinois retail has been lucky to have had such a strong, good-willed advocate. I wish him the very best in his retirement.                          ____________________
