Speaker, it is with profound respect and admiration that I stand before you today to honor Mr. Bill Masterson, Jr., for his remarkable success as Publisher of The Times Media Company of Northwest Indiana, as well as for his devotion to professional and ethical business and community leadership. Bill was named Publisher of the Year 2012 by Editor & Publisher, a monthly international publication covering the newspaper industry. Bill will be honored at a reception sponsored by the Northwest Indiana Forum on Thursday, November 29, 2012, at the Briar Ridge Country Club in Schererville, Indiana.  Bill Masterson, Jr., was named Publisher of the Year 2012 by the Editor & Publisher editorial board. Publishers from across the nation, and as far as Germany and Nigeria, were nominated by their employees and peers for this prestigious honor. In this era of expanding technology and economic difficulty, the newspaper industry has been forced to make significant adjustments in order to compete with the revenue, marketing, and demographic challenges facing traditional ink-on-paper media. For his ability to think outside the box and his innovative approach to shift the role of the local newspaper within the community of Northwest Indiana, Bill certainly exemplifies the qualities of a true leader and is a worthy recipient of this award.  Bill's publishing career spans twenty-five years. In 2006, Mr. Masterson became Publisher of The Times Media Company of Northwest Indiana and was recently promoted to Vice President of Publishing for Lee Enterprises, Incorporated, the parent company of The Times. While he will continue to serve as Publisher of The Times Media Company of Northwest Indiana, in his new position, Bill and three other vice presidents will oversee print and digital operations for Lee Enterprises in twenty-three states. Under his leadership at The Times, Bill has been able to increase revenue while avoiding major staff cuts. He has cultivated an environment of innovation and continues to provide high-quality content to readers.  The changing role of the local newspaper within the community motivated Mr. Masterson to create ``One Region: One Vision,'' which strives to improve the quality of life for the people of Northwest Indiana. The movement was launched five years ago and brings together local business, political, and community leaders in order to promote positive change within the community. The program has led to urban revitalization, a bimonthly mayor's roundtable discussion, the establishment of a health care council, and it has helped to increase community involvement and awareness. Bill also serves on the executive board of directors for the Barden of Gary Foundation and the Boys and Girls Clubs of Northwest Indiana, where he initiated a campaign to raise funds for a new Boys and Girls Club and community center in Gary, Indiana. To date, the campaign has raised more than $5.5 million.  Bill Masterson is the epitome of an excellent person of business. He innately understands and actively lives the words spoken by Jacob Marley in A Christmas Carol: ``Mankind was my business. The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance, and benevolence, were, all, my business.'' We are fortunate that he walks among us.  Bill's exceptional dedication to his field and to his community is exceeded only by his devotion to his amazing family. Bill and his beloved wife, Julie, have six wonderful children and three grandchildren.  Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask that you and my other colleagues join me in congratulating Bill Masterson, Jr., on being named Publisher of the Year 2012. For his unwavering commitment to improving the quality of life for the people of Northwest Indiana and his remarkable career with The Times Media Company of Northwest Indiana, Bill serves as an inspiration to us all.                          ____________________
