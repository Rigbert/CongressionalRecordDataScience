 President, I want to take a moment to lament the too early death on December 19, after a four-year long battle with breast cancer, of a former staff member and friend, Linda Nersesian, and to offer my heartfelt sympathy to her husband Robert Rae Gordon; her two children, nine year old George Raeburn Gordon, and six year old Louise Grace Gordon; her parents, Elsie Louise Nazarian and Serop S. Nersesian; her brother Robert S. Nersesian; and the many, many friends and associates in the Congress and in Washington who will miss her greatly.  Linda served in the Senate for six and one-half years, from August 4, 1980 to January 5, 1987. She began her Senate career in the office of Senator Dole where she worked on energy and environmental issues. Linda left Senator Dole's office in April of 1981 to join my staff as a staff attorney on the Subcommittee on Agency Administration of the Judiciary Committee, which I then chaired. On the Subcommittee, Linda worked on a number of my highest legislative priorities. She consistently demonstrated initiative, intelligence, and savvy.  When I became Chairman of the Subcommittee on Aging of the Labor and Human Resources Committee at the beginning of the 98th Congress in 1983, the strong leadership qualities that Linda consistently demonstrated in her work on the Administrative Practices Subcommittee made her the perfect choice to serve as chief counsel and staff director of the Subcommittee on Aging. In that capacity, she organized the office, recruited a staff, and oversaw the work of the Subcommittee through 1983. She was also responsible for advising me on major bills relating to pharmaceutical drugs which were then under consideration by the Committee.  In late 1983, Linda once again seemed the perfect choice for a position of major responsibility, this time as the chief counsel and staff director of the Subcommittee on Administrative Practice and Procedure. In that capacity, she was responsible for the child Pornography Act. She also worked on what became the 1986 amendments to the False Claims Act and the Equal Access to Justice Act. And she worked on defense procurement fraud. These were among my highest legislative and oversight priorities at that time.  After serving as chief counsel of the Subcommittee until January 21, 185, Senator Dole asked Linda to be the assistant secretary of the Senate. She served in that capacity until January 5, 1987, when she left the Senate to become legislative counsel to the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association. In due course, Linda again assumed greater responsibility, becoming the Association's vice president for government relations, a position she held until she left to build her own consulting firm, the Columbia Consulting Group.  Mr. President, Linda Nersesian was a unique and remarkable individual. Herpersonal qualities of drive, decisiveness, intelligence, common sense, persistence, and good humor were evident to all who came in contact with her. It was easy to have confidence in Linda; she always knew what to do. Her manifest talents invariably led her to be entrusted with positions of responsibility. She contributed much in the time given to her. She will be greatly missed.                          ____________________
