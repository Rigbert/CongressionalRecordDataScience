 President, in 1986, Congress made it unlawful for employers to knowingly hire or employ individuals who are not eligible to work in the United States. Identity theft and counterfeit documents have made a mockery of this law.  Under current law, if the documents provided by an employee reasonably appear on their face to be genuine, the employer has met its obligation to review the worker's documents. This is why Congress created a pilot program, known as the Basic Pilot program, to help employers verify the work eligibility of its new hires.  This program has allowed employers to check records maintained by the Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration. It was successful, and in 2003, Congress made the program available in all 50 States.  Now known as E-Verify, this nationwide program is free for employers and accessible via the internet. This program has been a valuable tool for those who want to hire a legal workforce. Employers like it. In fact, according to Westat, a private statistical survey research corporation that conducted a survey last year, 97 percent of employers found E-Verify user-friendly, and 92 percent said the program was effective. Employers also reported that ``E-Verify takes the guess work out of determining the validity of documents, provides immediate results, offers reassurance that the company is not hiring unauthorized workers, and helps them to show a good faith effort to comply with the law.''  So, today, along with several colleagues, I am introducing legislation to permanently authorize and expand the E-Verify program. My bill, the Accountability Through Electronic Verification Act, will ensure that employers can rely on this program while holding them accountable for their hiring practices.  My bill would make E-Verify a staple in every workplace. It would pave the way to modify and simplify the I-9 process required today. It would increase penalties on employers who hire people unauthorized to work in the country. Employers would be required to check the status of current employees within three years, and would allow employers to run a check prior to offering a job, saving that employer valuable time and resources. Employers will also be required to re-check those workers whose authorization is about to expire, such as those who come to the United States on temporary visas.  As Congress considers the reauthorization of E-Verify this year, I hope my bill will be a starting point for discussion. We need to enhance and expand the program so that our immigration laws are being upheld. I hope my colleagues will consider joining me in making E-Verify a permanent part of our immigration laws.                                 ______                                       By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Burr):  S. 1035.
