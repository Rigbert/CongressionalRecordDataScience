 Let me just add, Jesse and Dot Helms were good friends of Elaine's and mine and good friends of a lot of other people in the Senate on both sides. There are a significant number of our conference planning to attend the funeral tomorrow. I thank the majority leader for his accommodation of those requests by having the votes on Wednesday morning. At Dot Helms' request, I will be doing one of the eulogies tomorrow at the funeral, and I will have more to say about the life of my good friend Jesse Helms when I get back. But I wish to echo the remarks of the majority leader about what a fine gentleman he was.  If you took a poll around here of the pages and the people who work in the Capitol about who was the most popular Member, I expect Jesse Helms would have won it--which would surprise an awful lot of people in the press and out in America who thought of Senator Helms as sort of a fierce individual. In fact, in person, he was as gentle, as accommodating, and as friendly as anybody I have ever met. We all will miss Jesse Helms a great deal.  I thank the majority leader for giving me an opportunity to make some comments at this point about our good friend Jesse Helms.                          ____________________
