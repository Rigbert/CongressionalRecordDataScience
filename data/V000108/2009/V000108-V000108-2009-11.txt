 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2187, the 21st Century Green High-Performing Public Schools Facility Act and commend Representative Chandler as well as the Chair of the full committee, Mr. Miller, and Subcommittee Chair Kildee, for their wonderful work on this measure in ensuring that our students have the most healthy and environmentally friendly schools possible.  Particularly I am most pleased that language is included in this measure that requires the use of American-made iron, steel and manufactured goods. Last year, similar language was included in the legislation as well.  Last year in April the Congressional Steel Caucus held hearings on imported steel and their substandard nature in many instances relative to safety. If we are going to be using steel-related products for schools, we ought to ensure that those schools are safe. This measure does that.  In addition to ensuring American-quality steel is used to make sure that those students have a safe and healthy environment, it provides a second critical stimulus, and that is to help maintain and create jobs in the domestic steel industry that is losing them at an alarming rate. Last week, steel production across this country was at 42 percent, compared to 91 percent just a year ago.  If school construction projects provided under this act are to be truly safe for our children, the steel used should be made in America. If it is to be beneficial to the American economy to create jobs, the steel we use in this bill should be made in America. Again, I particularly thank the Chair and Chair of the subcommittee for their endeavorto make sure this provision was included.                              {time}  1245
