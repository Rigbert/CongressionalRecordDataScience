Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2607, the Commercial Space Transportation Competitiveness Act of 1999, provides a 5-year extension for what is commonly referred to as indemnification. This extension is necessary to protect space transportation companies from uninsurable levels of liability and to enhance the international competitiveness of the American companies. The current indemnification provision expires at the end of this year, so we need to move quickly in order to get this extension enacted before the end of the year.  H.R. 2607 also includes a reporting provision on whether the current risk-sharing regime should be modified. The report calls for separate sections from the Federal Government, the U.S. space transportation providers and customers, the insurance industry and the general public. This report will provide the basis for Congressional hearings and public debate in the future and should provide the framework for the new regime in plenty of time before this extension expires in 2004.  The bill also includes authorizations for the Office of Commercial Space Transportation and the Office of Space Commercialization, and requires a report on the objectives, activities and plans of the Office of Space Commercialization.  In short, this is a straightforward bill. It only contains, one, the indemnification extension; two, a report on how indemnification might be structured in the future; three, authorizations for two small commercial space offices; and, four, a section requiring a GAO report.  I strongly support this bill, and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of it.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
