 I say to my friend from Nevada, yesterday morning--and I normally speak at about an octave higher than this; I am coming out of a bout of bronchitis--I came back to be here at 10 o'clock because we were going to be on the bill. Instead, we had morning business, I believe, until about 4 o'clock in the afternoon. That is 6 hours. That is what it would have taken to finish the bill, especially after the work of the Senator from Nevada, and others, in clearing out so many of the Republican and Democratic amendments to get them accepted or voted on.  I understand we are waiting for the other body to get the appropriations bill over here. I would think between now and normal suppertime today we could finish this bill, if people want to. We are willing to move on our side. We are willing to have our amendments come up.  I see the distinguished Senator from California on the floor. She has waited some time. She has been here several days waiting with an amendment. She has indicated she is willing to go ahead with a relatively short period of time. The Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, has said the same. We are ready to go, and I wish we would.  As I stated earlier, I would have liked very much to get this done. I would actually like very much to finish all the items we have. I wish we could have finished a couple weeks ago. I want to go to Vermont. I want to be with my family. It was snowing there yesterday, as I am sure it was in parts of the State of the distinguished Presiding Officer. I see the distinguished Senator from Maine on the floor. I expect it did in her State.
