S.-India relations by passing the conference report on H.R. 5682, the Henry J. Hyde United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act of 2006. Enactment of this legislation brings us much closer to the day when India will resume peaceful nuclear commerce, despite its status as a state that has nuclear weapons and has never been a state party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. It will help bring India into the global nuclear nonproliferation system. It also helps to remove a major irritant in the relations between our two countries.  This bill is a tremendous victory for U.S.-India relations. And it increases the prospect for stability and progress in South Asia and the rest of the world.  It has become cliche to speak of the U.S.-India relationship as a bond between the world's oldest democracy and the world's largest democracy--but this cliche is also a fact. Shared political values are the foundation for our relationship, a firm belief in the dignity of man and the consent of the governed.  Senator Lugar and I yield to no one in our commitment to nuclear nonproliferation. We have taken great care, in this legislation, to protect the role of Congress and of the international institutions that enforce nuclear nonproliferation.  This legislation was the result of hard compromises--compromises between our two countries and between Congress and the executive branch. The end result, however, was overwhelming bipartisan support, in both the House and the Senate. That level of broad, solid, bipartisan buy-in was absolutely essential when crafting legislation with such long-term impact on vital American interests.  I want to pay special tribute tonight to the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Lugar of Indiana, for his tremendous contribution to securing that broad, bipartisan consensus. The administration originally proposed legislation that would have effectively taken away the power of Congress to review an agreement for nuclear cooperation with India, and Senator Lugar was under great pressure to accept that proposal. He did not do that. Instead, he held four hearings--three open and one closed--that allowed all sides to express their views and that enabled Senators from both parties to raise their concerns with the approval procedure that the administration had proposed. Then he and I worked to craft a Senate bill that passed by a vote of 16-2 in committee and 85-12 on the floor of the Senate.  Senator Lugar performed a signal service to our country when he added title II to this legislation, the implementing legislation for the U.S. Additional Protocol with the International Atomic Energy Agency. It is fitting that this legislation has been combined with the India nuclear bill, since part of the nuclear deal is for India to negotiate its own Additional Protocol with the IAEA. It will also be a notable benefit to U.S. nuclear nonproliferation policy when the United States finally ratifies its Additional Protocol, giving our country greater credibility as it presses other countries to allow the IAEA to increase its inspections of their nuclear programs. Ratification of the U.S.-IAEA Additional Protocol was long delayed, and Senator Lugar's leadership on this issue was absolutely vital to this final, successful conclusion.  In conference with the House of Representatives, Senator Lugar and I once again worked for a measure that could gain broad support from the Senate. We worked with the House conferees to craft a bill that embodied the best ideas from each house of Congress. At the same time, we worked with the Administration to reach agreement on a wide range of issues, without sacrificing the principles that each house had written into its legislation. We and the other conferees chose substance over rhetoric. The result is a conference report that will command the same broad, bipartisan support today that was demonstrated in the Senate 3 weeks ago.  I would like also to acknowledge the staff members who have contributed to the success of this legislation. On the Senate side, the Foreign Relations Committee was most ably served by Ken Myers III, Thomas Moore, Edward Levine and Brian McKeon. Mr. Stephen Rademaker of the majority leader's staff was also an important contributor to our efforts. On the House side, the conferees were most ably served by Douglas Seay, David Fite and David Abramowitz, among others.  The U.S.-India agreement is much more than just a nuclear deal. I believe historians will see this as part of a dramatic and positive departure in the U.S.-India relationship that was begun by President Clinton and continued by President Bush.  In a time when relationships between states are critically important in shaping the world in which we live, no relationship is more important than the one we're building with India. There is still much to be done in India, as a stable and secure India is very much in America's national interest. We should work to help India increase its energy production, combat terrorism, and guard against epidemics of infectious diseases. We should help both India and Pakistan to ease tensions between their countries and, someday, to walk back from the nuclear precipice. And India should continue its progress toward the front rank of world leaders, and especially of leaders in combating the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. Enactment of this bill today helps both countries to keep moving on the path of cooperation for a better world.  In conclusion, I would like to turn to an issue raised recently by some experts, whether the legislation before us, by citing a particular IAEA document, might undermine the principle of perpetuity of safeguards in India. My view is that the IAEA document makes a real contribution to our understanding of safeguards perpetuity.  The document cited by this legislation appears in section 104(b)(2), the second determination that the President will have to make when submitting a U.S.-India agreement for nuclear cooperation to the Congress. It is an IAEA Board of Governors memo cited as GOV/1621 of 20 August 1973. We have been given permission to publish this document, so I will ask that it be printed in the Record at the end of these remarks.  The Board of Governors memo makes clear that safeguards on nuclear material will extend until that material no longer has any possible nuclear weapons use, or until it is exchanged with an equal amount of previously unsafeguarded material, or until it leaves the country--in which case safeguards may continue elsewhere. In other words, if you move some imported fuel or equipment to a new location, that location becomes subject to safeguards.  The memo also makes clear that safeguards on ``nuclear material, equipment, facilities or non-nuclear material'' supplied to a nuclear facility will apply as well to fissile material ``produced, processed or used in or in connection with'' a safeguarded facility. In other words, any fissile material produced by a safeguarded facility becomes subject to safeguards even after it leaves that facility. Until that output no longer has any possible nuclear weapons use, safeguards follow it; that is a real example of perpetuity of sanctions.  At the same time, perpetuity does not mean that a facility will be subjectto safeguards until the end of time. A facility can be decommissioned so that it, too, no longer has any possible nuclear weapons use. Or, if the only reason for safeguards is that the facility has imported equipment or material, removal of all such equipment or material from the facility could render it eligible for removal from safeguards. Thus, India's reprocessing plant is safeguarded when it handles spent fuel from imported uranium, but not when India is using it to reprocess spent fuel made from domestic uranium. That is the way safeguards have worked for years in India.  The Government of India has announced that eight more of its existing power reactors will be declared as civil and opened to IAEA inspection. India would gain great credibility if it were to let those reactors be inspected even if they use domestic nuclear fuel. Indian officials have suggested, however, that they may insist upon the right to remove those reactors from safeguards if foreign fuel supplies are cut off, and the safeguards agreement that India negotiates with the IAEA may allow for that. There is precedent for such an arrangement, in states that do not have full-scope safeguards, and it would be up to the IAEA Board of Governors, of which the United States is a member, to decide whether that arrangement was permissible in this case. It would be up to Congress and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, of course, to consider whether that sort of safeguards arrangement was sufficient to warrant authorizing peaceful nuclear commerce with India. And it would be up to the executive branch to determine whether to authorize a particular export to India, in light of the safeguards that would govern the facility for which the export was requested.  India has also said that many new power reactors will be put under IAEA safeguards. If those reactors are foreign-built, like the Tarapur reactor, there will be no way that they can be withdrawn from safeguards unless they are decommissioned. If they are domestic designs but use some foreign equipment, there will be no way to withdraw them from safeguards without first removing the foreign equipment. And if foreign equipment should be used in one of the eight domestically built reactors that are put under safeguards, then that equipment, too, would have to be removed before that reactor could be removed from safeguards.  As a matter of principle, then, perpetuity in safeguards applies more to material and equipment than it does to a whole facility, unless that facility is foreign-built. In practice, however, the only reactors that India might pull out of its safeguards regime would be the eight newly-safeguarded ones, and I believe that the only time that this might occur would be if India were to come under sanctions because of improper nuclear activities or weapons proliferation. In such a case, the regime for nuclear cooperation with India would likely be collapsing anyway.  The material follows.                               SAFEGUARDS   (b) The Formulation of Certain Provisions in Agreements Under the Agency's Safeguards System (1965, as Provisionally extended in 1966 and                                  1968)                   Memorandum by the Director General       (1) A substantial number of Governors have urged that there      should be a greater degree of standardization than in the      past with respect to the duration and termination of such      agreements as may henceforth be concluded under the Agency's      Safeguards System (1965, as Provisionally Extended in 1966      and 1968) for the application of safeguards in connection      with nuclear material, equipment, facilities or non-nuclear      material supplied to States by third parties. To achieve      this, it is recommended that the following two concepts      should be reflected in these agreements:       (a) That the duration of the agreement should be related to      the period of actual use of the items in the recipient State;      and       (b) That the provisions for terminating the agreement      should be formulated in such a way that the rights and      obligations of the parties continue to apply in connection      with supplied nuclear material and with special fissionable      material produced, processed or used in or in connection with      supplied nuclear material, equipment, facilities or non-     nuclear material, until such time as the Agency has      terminated the application of safeguards thereto, in      accordance with the provisions of paragraph 26 or 27 of the      Agency's Safeguards System.       A short exposition with respect to the application of these      concepts is annexed hereto.       (2) The proposed standardization would appear likely to      facilitate the uniform application of safeguards measures. It      is furthermore to be noted that the combined operation of the      two concepts would be consistent with the application of the      general principle embodied in paragraph 16 of the Agency's      Safeguards System.                     REQUESTED ACTION BY THE BOARD       (3) In bringing this matter to the Board's attention, the      Director General seeks the views of the Board as to whether      it concurs with the two concepts set out in paragraph 1      above.                                  ____                                 ANNEX       (1) In the case of receipt by a State of source or special      fissionable material, equipment, facilities or non-nuclear      material from a supplier outside that State, the duration of      the relevant agreement under the Agency's Safeguards System      would be related to the actual use in the recipient State of      the material or items supplied. This may be accomplished by      requiring, in accordance with present practice, that the      material or items supplied be listed in the inventory called      for by the agreement.       (2) The primary effect of termination of the agreement,      either by act of the parties or effluxion of time, would be      that no further supplied nuclear material, equipment,      facilities or non-nuclear material could be added to the      inventory. On the other hand, the rights and obligations of      the parties, as provided for in the agreement, would continue      to apply in connection with any supplied material or items      and with any special fissionable material produced, processed      or used in or in connection with any supplied material or      items which had been included in the inventory, until such      material or items had been removed from the inventory.       (3) With respect to nuclear material, conditions for      removal are those set out in paragraph 26 or 27 of the      Agency's Safeguards System; with respect to equipment,      facilities and non-nuclear material, conditions for removal      could be based on paragraph 26. A number of agreements      already concluded have prescribed such conditions in part, by      providing for deletion from the inventory of nuclear      material, equipment and facilities which are returned to the      supplying State or transferred (under safeguards) to a third      State. The additional provisions contemplated would stipulate      that items or non-nuclear material could be removed from the      purview of the agreement if they had been consumed, were no      longer usable for any nuclear activity relevant from the      point of view of safeguards or had become practicably      irrecoverable.       (4) The effect of reflecting the two concepts in agreements      would be that special fissionable material which had been      produced, processed or used in or in connection with supplied      material or items before they were removed from the scope of      the agreement, would remain or be listed in the inventory,      and such special fissionable material, together with any      supplied nuclear material remaining in the inventory, would      be subject to safeguards until the Agency had terminated      safeguards on that special fissionable and nuclear material      in accordance with the provisions of the Agency's Safeguards      System. Thus, the actual termination of the operation of the      provisions of the agreement would take place only when      everything had been removed from the inventory.
