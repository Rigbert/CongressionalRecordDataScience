 President, I will be happy to respond to the questions of the Senator from Alaska. I did come to the floor this morning at 9:30 and did object to the motion to proceed. We then did work out an agreement that the bill would begin to be debated at noon.  At that time, I was here on the floor and ready to debate and was not able to say anything until the 2:30 rollcall vote. Since that time, obviously, there has been an exchange among several Senators.  I do have a statement I want to make. I do have a great deal of information I want to submit for the Record, and I want to be able to bring my side out on this argument. I know there are a number of other Senators who also wish to present their points of view on this. The Senator from California, Senator Boxer, does, and I know the Senator from Oregon, Senator Hatfield, has a statement. Several other Senators have indicated to me that they would like the opportunity to debate this bill.  I also have been told there are a number of amendments that people wish to bring forward on this bill.
