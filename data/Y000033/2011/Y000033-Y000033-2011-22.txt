Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  This bill would transfer title to 422 acres of land from the Fish and Wildlife Service to the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission. The commission has been effectively managing this property since 1998 under a Memorandum of Understanding with the Service, and they have been providing anglers with 150,000 channel catfish each year. Both the State and the Obama administration testified in support of this conveyance, and I note that Congress has previously conveyed 10 national fish hatcheries to various States and municipalities.  I urge the adoption of this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.
