 President, if I could follow on in the same vein in order to associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished Democratic leader, knowing Senator Baucus, I bet he is so busy that he probably didn't even realize he was casting his 10,000th vote. I know it is a very major accomplishment; very few Members do that.  I congratulate him. That signifies a lot of hard work in and of itself, but I think of the really hard work that Senator Baucus does working as a member of the Senate Committee on Finance--sometimes as chairman, sometimes as ranking member--and, more importantly, not just working hard but working in a cooperative way to get things done.  I honor him. I didn't know anything about it. I am glad to hear about it. He should be recognized, and I thank him for the cooperation he has given to me over the years.  I yield the floor.
