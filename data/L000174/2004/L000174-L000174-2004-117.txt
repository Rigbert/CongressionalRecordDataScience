We have had long discussions on some of these efforts. He knows the Senator from Kentucky and I have been trying to work out as nonpartisan a bill as possible on these issues. His sense of morality and concern--I say it in the best sense of the word--has been very helpful. All 100 of us live a comfortable life. None of us go hungry except by choice. Some of us do that off and on for whatever reason. But it is only by choice. We have people in parts of the world we have been talking about who cannot even be fed by choice. They starve to death. They have no choice.  On these amendments, what the Senator from Kansas and the Senator from Kentucky and I, the Senator from New Jersey, the Senator from Ohio, and others have tried to do is let them know in this country, the wealthiest, most powerful Nation on earth, there are people who know they are starving, they know they are dying, they know this goes beyond a question of politics. This is a question of morality, deepest moral sense of human beings to make sure we feed them. I commend him for his work.
