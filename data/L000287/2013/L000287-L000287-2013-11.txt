Speaker, I want to thank my friends, Congresswoman Sewell and Congressman Bachus.  It is true that I grew up in Alabama, and I represent Georgia, but Alabama is in my blood.  I want to thank the two of you for bringing this resolution forward to honor these four beautiful little girls killed by a bomb while attending Sunday school on September 15, 1963, at the Sixteenth Street Baptist church.  On that Sunday, when I heard about the bombing that morning, I traveled to the city of Birmingham and stood outside of the church with my friend and my coworker, Julian Bond. We stood and we looked at the church. Later, I had an opportunity to attend the funeral of three of the little girls.  That bombing took place 18 days after Martin Luther King, Jr., had stood here in Washington and said: ``I have a dream, a dream deeply rooted in the American Dream.''  That was a sad day. It tore out the essence of our hearts. But we didn't give up. We didn't become bitter. We didn't become hostile. We continued. Because of what happened in Birmingham, it inspired us to go to Selma to fight for the right to vote.  I think we're doing the right thing today by honoring these four littlegirls. They must be looked upon as those who gave their very lives, gave their blood to help redeem the soul of America and move us closer to a beloved community.  I wonder sometimes why, what, and how. We're a different country and we're a better country because they gave their all.
