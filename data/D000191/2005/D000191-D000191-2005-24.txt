  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, well, just in time for the holidays, the Republicans have prepared a bevy of treats known as tax cuts favoring those who earn over $300,000 a year. One of the most delectable is a 60 percent tax cut in the tax on stock dividends for millionaires. It costs $13 billion in revenue foregone, unfortunately. But with new found concern about the deficit, the Republicans are going to pay for that tax cut for the millionaires by raising fees and interest rates on students who are struggling to get an education.  What a sweet trade. More tax cuts for billionaires as they trickle down on the students who are struggling to live the American dream.                          ____________________[Page H11225]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                              SWEET TRADE  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
