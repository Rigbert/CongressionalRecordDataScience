President, last year when I voted to support passage of the Homeland Security Act, HSA, I voiced concerns about several flaws in the legislation. I called for the Administration and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to monitor implementation of the new law and to craft corrective legislation in the 108th Congress. One of my chief concerns with the HSA was a subtitle of the act that granted an extraordinarily broad exemption to the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, in exchange for the cooperation of private companies in sharing information with the government regarding vulnerabilities in the nation's critical infrastructure.  Unfortunately, the law that was enacted undermines Federal and State sunshine laws permitting the American people to know what their government is doing. Rather than increasing security by encouraging private sector disclosure to the government, it guts FOIA at the expense of our national security and public health and safety.  On March 16, we mark Freedom of Information Day, which falls on the anniversary of James Madison's birthday. Madison said, ``A popular government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or tragedy or perhaps both.'' As a long-time supporter of open government, I believe we must heed Madison's warning and revisit the potentially damaging limitations placed on access to information by the HSA.  I rise today to introduce legislation with my distinguished colleagues Senator Levin, Senator Jeffords, Senator Lieberman, and Senator Byrd to restore the integrity of FOIA. I want to thank my colleagues for working with me on this important issue of public oversight. This bill protects Americans' ``right to know'' while simultaneously providing security to those in the private sector who voluntarily submit critical infrastructure records to the newly created Department of Homeland Security, DHS.  Encouraging cooperation between the private sector and the government to keep our critical infrastructure systems safe from terrorist attacks is a goal we all support. But the appropriate way to meet this goal is a source of great debate--a debate that has been all but ignored since the enactment of the HSA last year.  The HSA created a new FOIA exemption for ``critical infrastructure information.'' That broadly defined term applies to information regarding a variety of facilities--such as privately operated power plants, bridges, dams, ports, or chemical plants--that might be targeted for a terrorist attack. In HSA negotiations last fall, House Republicans and the administration promoted language that they described asnecessary to encourage owners of such facilities to identify vulnerabilities in their operations and share that information with the Department of Homeland Security, DHS. The stated goal was to ensure that steps could be taken to ensure the facilities' protection and proper functioning.  In fact, such descriptions of the legislation were disingenuous. These provisions, which were eventually enacted in the HSA, shield from FOIA almost any voluntarily submitted document stamped by the facility owner as ``critical infrastructure.'' This is true no matter how tangential the content of that document may be to the actual security of a facility. The law effectively allows companies to hide information about public health and safety from American citizens simply by submitting it to DHS. The enacted provisions were called ``deeply flawed'' by Mark Tapscott of the Heritage Foundation in a November 20, 2002 Washington Post op-ed. ``Too Many Secrets,'' Washington Post, November 20, 2002, at A25. He argued that the ``loophole'' created by the law ``could be manipulated by clever corporate and government operators to hide endless varieties of potentially embarrassing and/or criminal information from public view.''  In addition, under the HSA, disclosure by private facilities to DHS neither obligates the private company to address the vulnerability, nor requires DHS to fix the problem. For example, in the case of a chemical spill, the law bars the government from disclosing information without the written consent of the company that caused the pollution. As the Washington Post editorialized on February 10, 2003, ``A company might preempt environmental regulators by `voluntarily' divulging incriminating material, thereby making it unavailable to anyone else.'' ``Fix This Loophole,'' Washington Post, February 10, 2003, at A20.  The new law also 1. shields the companies from lawsuits to compel disclosure, 2. criminalizes otherwise legitimate whistleblower activity by DHS employees, and 3. preempts any state or local disclosure laws.  The Restore FOIA bill I introduce today with Senators Levin, Jeffords, Lieberman, and Byrd is identical to language I negotiated with Senators Levin and Bennett last summer when the HSA was debated by the Governmental Affairs Committee. Senator Bennett stated in the Committee's July 25, 2003 mark up that the administration had endorsed the compromise. He also said that industry groups had reported to him that the compromise language would make it possible for them to share information with the government without fear of the information being released to competitors or to other agencies that might accidentally reveal it. The Governmental Affairs Committee reported out the compromise language that day. Unfortunately, much more restrictive House language was eventually signed into law.  The February 10 Post editorial called the Leahy-Levin-Bennett language ``a compromise that would accomplish the reasonable purpose'' of ``encouraging companies to share information with the government about infrastructure that might be vulnerable to terrorist attack without such broad harmful effects.'' Id. The Post editorial was titled, ``Fix This Loophole,'' which is exactly what my colleagues and I hope to accomplish with the introduction of this bill. Id.  The Restore FOIA bill would correct the problems in the HSA in several ways. First, it limits the FOIA exemption to relevant ``records'' submitted by the private sector, such that only those that actually pertain to critical infrastructure safety are protected. ``Records'' is the standard category referred to in FOIA. This corrects the effective free pass given to industry by the HSA for any information it labels ``critical infrastructure.''  Second, unlike the HSA, the Restore FOIA bill allows for government oversight, including the ability to use and share the records within and between agencies. It does not limit the use of such information by the government, except to prohibit public disclosure where such information is appropriately exempted under FOIA.  Third, it protects the actions of legitimate whistleblowers, rather than criminalizing their acts.  Fourth, it does not provide civil immunity to companies that voluntarily submit information. This corrects a flaw in the current law, which would prohibit such information from being used directly in civil suits by government or private parties.  Fifth, unlike the HSA, the Restore FOIA bill allows local authorities to apply their own sunshine laws. The Restore FOIA bill does not preempt any state or local disclosure laws for information obtained outside the Department of Homeland Security. Likewise, it does not restrict the use of such information by state agencies.  Finally, the Restore FOIA bill does not restrict congressional use or disclosure of voluntarily submitted critical infrastructure information. The HSA language was unclear on this point, and even the Congressional Research Service could not say for certain that members of Congress or their staff would not be criminally liable. Homeland Security Act of 2002: Critical Infrastructure Information Act, February 29, 2003, CRS Report for Congress, Order Code RL31762, at 14-15.  These changes to the HSA would accomplish the stated goals of the critical infrastructure provisions in the HSA without tying the hands of the government in its efforts to protect Americans and without cutting the public out of the loop.  The Administration has flip-flopped on how to best approach the issue of critical infrastructure information. The Administration's original June 18, 2002, legislative proposal establishing a new department carved out an FOIA exemption, in section 204, and required non-disclosure of any ``information'' ``voluntarily'' provided to the new Department of Homeland Security by ``non-Federal entities or individuals'' pertaining to ``infrastructure vulnerabilities or other vulnerabilities to terrorism'' in the possession of, or that passed through, the new department. Critical terms, such as ``voluntarily provided,'' were undefined.  The Judiciary Committee had an opportunity to query Governor Ridge about the Administration's proposal on June 26, 2002, when the Administration reversed its long-standing position and allowed him to testify in his capacity as the Director of the Transition Planning Office.  Governor Ridge's testimony at that hearing is instructive. He seemed to appreciate the concerns expressed by Members about the President's June 18 proposal and to be willing to work with us in the legislative process to find common ground. On the FOIA issue, he described the Administration's goal to craft ``a limited statutory exemption to the Freedom of Information Act'' to help ``the Department's most important missions [which] will be to protect our Nation's critical infrastructure.'' (June 26, 2002 Hearing, Tr., p. 24). Governor Ridge explained that to accomplish this, the Department must be able to ``collect information, identifying key assets and components of that infrastructure, evaluate vulnerabilities, and match threat assessments against those vulnerabilities.'' (Id., at p. 23).  I do not understand why some have insisted that FOIA and our national security are inconsistent. Before the HSA was enacted, the FOIA already exempted from disclosure matters that are classified; trade secret, commercial and financial information, which is privileged and confidential; various law enforcement records and information, including confidential source and informant information; and FBI records pertaining to foreign intelligence or counterintelligence, or international terrorism. These already broad exemptions in the FOIA were designed to protect national security and public safety and to ensure that the private sector can provide needed information to the government.  Prior to enactment of the HSA, the FOIA exempted from disclosure any financial or commercial information provided voluntarily to the government, if it was of a kind that the provider would not customarily make available to the public. Critical Mass Energy Project v. NRC, 975 F.2d 871 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (en banc). Such information enjoyed even stronger nondisclosure protections than did material that the government requested. Applying this exception, Federal regulatory agencies safeguarded the confidentiality of all kinds of critical infrastructure information, like nuclear power plant safety reports (CriticalMass, 975 F.2d at 874), information about product manufacturing processes and internal security measures (Bowen v. Food & Drug Admin., 925 F.2d 1225 (9th Cir. 1991), design drawings of airplane parts (United Technologies Corp. by Pratt & Whitney v. F.A.A., 102 F.3d 688 (2d Cir. 1996)), and technical data for video conferencing software (Gilmore v. Dept. of Energy, 4 F. Supp.2d 912 (N.D. Cal. 1998)).  The head of the FBI National Infrastructure Protection Center, NIPC, testified more than five years ago, in September, 1998, that the ``FOIA excuse'' used by some in the private sector for failing to share information with the government was, in essence, baseless. He explained the broad application of FOIA exemptions to protect from disclosure information received in the context of a criminal investigation or a ``national security intelligence'' investigation, including information submitted confidentially or even anonymously. [Sen. Judiciary Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism, and Government Information, Hearing on Critical Infrastructure Protection: Toward a New Policy Directive, S. HRG. 105-763, March 17 and June 10, 1998, at p. 107]  The FBI also used the confidential business record exemption under (b)(4) ``to protect sensitive corporate information, and has, on specific occasions, entered into agreements indicating that it would do so prospectively with reference to information yet to be received.'' NIPC was developing policies ``to grant owners of information certain opportunities to assist in the protection of the information (e.g., by `sanitizing the information themselves') and to be involved in decisions regarding further dissemination by the NIPC.'' Id. In short, the former Administration witness stated:       Sharing between the private sector and the government      occasionally is hampered by a perception in the private      sector that the government cannot adequately protect private      sector information from disclosure under the Freedom of      Information Act, FOIA. The NIPC believes that this perception      is flawed in that both investigative and infrastructure      protection information submitted to NIPC are protected from      FOIA disclosure under current law. (Id.)  Nevertheless, for more than five years, businesses continued to seek a broad FOIA exemption that also came with special legal protections to limit their civil and criminal liability. That business wish list was largely granted in the Homeland Security Act.  At the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing with Governor Ridge, I expressed my concern that an overly broad FOIA exemption would encourage government complicity with private firms to keep secret information about critical infrastructure vulnerabilities, reduce the incentive to fix the problems and end up hurting rather than helping our national security. In the end, more secrecy may undermine rather than foster security.  Governor Ridge seemed to appreciate these risks, and said he was ``anxious to work with the Chairman and other members of the committee to assure that the concerns that [had been] raised are properly addressed.'' Id. at p. 24. He assured us that ``[t]his Administration is ready to work together with you in partnership to get the job done. This is our priority, and I believe it is yours as well.'' Id. at p. 25. This turned out to be an empty promise.  Almost before the ink was dry on the Administration's earlier June proposal, on July 10, 2002, the Administration proposed to substitute a much broader FOIA exemption that would (1) exempt from disclosure under the FOIA critical infrastructure information voluntarily submitted to the new department that was designated as confidential by the submitter unless the submitter gave prior written consent, (2) provide limited civil immunity for use of the information in civil actions against the company, with the likely result that regulatory actions would be preceded by litigation by companies that submitted designated information to the department over whether the regulatory action was prompted by a confidential disclosure, (3) preempt state sunshine laws if the designated information is shared with state or local government agencies, (4) impose criminal penalties of up to one year imprisonment on government employees who disclosed the designated information, and (5) antitrust immunity for companies that joined together with agency components designated by the President to promote critical infrastructure security.  Despite the Administration's promulgation of two separate proposals for a new FOIA exemption in as many weeks, in July, Director Ridge's Office of Homeland Security released The National Strategy for Homeland Security, which appeared to call for more study of the issue before legislating. Specifically, this report called upon the Attorney General to ``convene a panel to propose any legal changes necessary to enable sharing of essential homeland security information between the government and the private sector.'' (P. 33)  The need for more study of the Administration's proposed new FOIA exemption was made amply clear by its possible adverse environmental, public health and safety affects. Keeping secret problems in a variety of critical infrastructures would simply remove public pressure to fix the problems. Moreover, several environmental groups pointed out that, under the Administration's proposal, companies could avoid enforcement action by ``voluntarily'' providing information about environmental violations to the EPA, which would then be unable to use the information to hold the company accountable and also would be required to keep the information confidential. It would bar the government from disclosing information about spills or other violations without the written consent of the company that caused the pollution.  I worked on a bipartisan basis with many interested stakeholders from environmental, civil liberties, human rights, business and government watchdog groups to craft a compromise FOIA exemption that did not grant the business sector's wish-list but did provide additional nondisclosure protections for certain records without jeopardizing the public health and safety. At the request of Chairman Lieberman for the Judiciary Committee's views on the new department, I shared my concerns about the Administration's proposed FOIA exemption and then worked with Members of the Governmental Affairs Committee, in particular Senator Levin and Senator Bennett, to craft a more narrow and responsible exemption that accomplishes the Administration's goal of encouraging private companies to share records of critical infrastructure vulnerabilities with the new Department of Homeland Security without providing incentives to ``game'' the system of enforcement of environmental and other laws designed to protect our nation's public health and safety. We refined the FOIA exemption in a manner that satisfied the Administration's stated goal, while limiting the risks of abuse by private companies or government agencies.  This compromise solution was supported by the Administration and other Members of the Committee on Governmental Affairs and was unanimously adopted by that Committee at the markup of the Homeland Security Department bill on July 25, 2002. The compromise which I now introduce as a free standing bill would exempt from the FOIA certain records pertaining to critical infrastructure threats and vulnerabilities that are furnished voluntarily to the new Department and designated by the provider as confidential and not customarily made available to the public. Notably, the compromise FOIA exemption made clear that the exemption only covered ``records'' from the private sector, not all ``information'' provided by the private sector and thereby avoided the adverse result of government agency-created and generated documents and databases being put off-limits to the FOIA simply if private sector ``information'' is incorporated. Moreover, the compromise FOIA exemption clearly defined what records may be considered ``furnished voluntarily,'' which did not cover records used ``to satisfy any legal requirement or obligation to obtain any grant, permit, benefit (such as agency forbearance, loans, or reduction or modifications of agency penalties or rulings), or other approval from the Government.'' The FOIA compromise exemption further ensured that portions of records that are not covered by the exemption would be released pursuant to FOIA requests. This compromise did not provide any civil liability or antitrust immunity that could be used to immunize bad actors or frustrate regulatory enforcement action, nor didthe compromise preempt state or local sunshine laws.  Unfortunately, the version of the HSA that we enacted last November jettisoned the bipartisan compromise on the FOIA exemption, worked out in the Senate with the Administration's support, and replaced it with a big-business wish-list gussied up in security garb. The HSA's FOIA exemption makes off-limits to the FOIA much broader categories of ``information'' and grants businesses the legal immunities and liability protections they have sought so vigorously for over five years. This law goes far beyond what is needed to achieve the laudable goal of encouraging private sector companies to help protect our critical infrastructure. Instead, it ties the hands of the federal regulators and law enforcement agencies working to protect the public from imminent threats. It gives a windfall to companies who fail to follow federal health and safety standards. Most disappointingly, it undermines the goals of openness in government that the FOIA was designed to achieve. In short, the FOIA exemption in the HSA represents the most severe weakening of the Freedom of Information Act in its 36-year history.  In the end, the broad secrecy protections provided to critical infrastructure information in this bill will promote more secrecy, which may undermine rather than foster national security. In addition, the immunity provisions in the bill will frustrate enforcement of the laws that protect the public's health and safety.  Let me explain in greater detail. The FOIA exemption enacted in the HSA allows companies to stamp or designate certain information as critical infrastructure information, or ``CII,'' and then submit this information about their operations to the government either in writing or orally, and thereby obtain a blanket shield from FOIA's disclosure mandates as well as other protections. A Federal agency may not disclose or use voluntarily-submitted and CII-marked information, except for a limited ``informational purpose,'' such as ``analysis, warning, interdependency study, recovery, reconstitution,'' without the company's consent. Even when using the information to warn the public about potential threats to critical infrastructure, the bill requires agencies to take steps to protect from disclosure the source of the CII information and other ``business sensitive'' information.  The law also contains an unprecedented provision that threatens jail time and job loss to any government employee who happens to disclose any critical infrastructure information that a company has submitted and wants to keep secret. These penalties for using the CII information in an unauthorized fashion or for failing to take steps to protect disclosure of the source of the information are severe and will chill any release of CII information--not just when a FOIA request comes in, but in all situations, no matter the circumstance. Criminalizing disclosures not of classified information or national security related information, but of information that a company decides it does not want public--is an effective way to quash discussion and debate over many aspects of the government's work. In fact, under the HSA, CII information is granted more comprehensive protection under Federal criminal laws than classified information.  This provision of the law has potentially disastrous consequences. If an agency is given information from an internet service provider, ISP, about cyberattack vulnerabilities, agency employees will have to think twice about sharing that information with other ISPs for fear that, without the consent of the ISP to use the information, even a warning might cost their jobs or risk criminal prosecution.  This provision means that if a Federal regulatory agency needs to issue a regulation to protect the public from threats of harm, it cannot rely on any voluntarily submitted information--bringing the normal regulatory process to a grinding halt. Public health and law enforcement officials need the flexibility to decide how and when to warn or prepare the public in the safest, most effective manner. They should not have to get ``sign off'' from a Fortune 500 company to do so.  While the HSA risks making it harder for the government to protect American families, it makes it much easier for companies to escape responsibility when they violate the law by giving them unprecedented immunity from civil and regulatory enforcement actions. Once a business declares that information about its practices relates to critical infrastructure and is ``voluntarily'' provided, it can then prevent the Federal Government from disclosing it not just to the public, but also to a court in a civil action. This means that an agency receiving CII-marked submissions showing invasions of employee or customer privacy, environmental pollution, or government contracting fraud will be unable to use that information in a civil action to hold that company accountable. Even if the regulatory agency obtains the information necessary to bring an enforcement action from an alternative source, the company will be able to tie the government up in protracted litigation over the source of the information.  For example, if a company submits information that its factory is leaching arsenic in ground water, that information may not be turned over to local health authorities to use in any enforcement proceeding nor turned over to neighbors who were harmed by drinking the water for use in a civil tort action. Moreover, even if EPA tries to bring an action to stop the company's wrongdoing, the ``use immunity'' provided in the HSA will tie the agency up in litigation making it prove where it got the information and whether it is tainted as ``fruit of the poisonous tree''--i.e., obtained from the company under the ``critical infrastructure program.''  Similarly, if the new Department of Homeland Security receives information from a bio-medical laboratory about its security vulnerabilities, and anthrax is released from the lab three weeks later, the Department will not be able to warn the public promptly about how to protect itself without consulting with and trying to get the consent of the laboratory in order to avoid the risk of job loss or criminal prosecution for a non-consensual disclosure. Moreover, if the laboratory is violating any state, local or federal regulation in its handling of the anthrax, the Department will not be able to turn over to another Federal agency, such as the EPA or the Department of Health and Human Services, or to any State or local health officials, information or documents relating to the laboratory's mishandling of the anthrax for use in any enforcement proceedings against the laboratory, or in any wrongful death action, should the laboratory's mishandling of the anthrax result in the death of any person. The law specifically states that such CII-marked information ``shall not, without the written consent of the person or entity submitting such information, be used directly by such agency, any other Federal, State, or local authority, or any third party, in any civil action arising under Federal or State law if such information is submitted in good faith.'' [H.R. 5710, section 214(a)(1)(C)]  Most businesses are good citizens and take seriously their obligations to the government and the public, but this ``disclose-and-immunize'' provision is subject to abuse by those businesses that want to exploit legal technicalities to avoid regulatory guidelines. The HSA lays out the perfect blueprint to avoid legal liability: funnel damaging information into this voluntary disclosure system and pre-empt the government or others harmed by the company's actions from being able to use it against the company. This is not the kind of two-way public-private cooperation that our country needs.  The scope of the information that is covered by the new HSA FOIA exemption is overly broad and undermines the openness in government that FOIA was intended to guarantee. Under this law, information about virtually every important sector of our economy that today the public has a right to see can be shut off from public view simply by labeling it ``critical infrastructure information.'' Prior to enactment of the HSA, under FOIA standards, courts had required federal agencies to disclose 1. pricing information in contract bids so citizens can make sure the government is wisely spending their taxpayer dollars; 2. compliance reports that allow constituents to insist that government contractors comply with federal equalopportunity mandates; and 3. banks' financial data so the public can ensure that federal agencies properly approve bank mergers. Without access to this kind of information, it will be harder for the public to hold its government accountable. Under the HSA, all of this information may be marked CII information and kept out of public view.  The HSA FOIA exemption goes so far in exempting such a large amount of material from FOIA's disclosure requirements that it undermines government openness without making any real gains in safety for families in Vermont and across America. We do not keep America safer by chilling Federal officials from warning the public about threats to their health and safety. We do not ensure our nation's security by refusing to tell the American people whether or not their federal agencies are doing their jobs or their government is spending their hard earned tax dollars wisely. We do not encourage real two-way cooperation by giving companies protection from civil liability when they break the law. We do not respect the spirit of our democracy when we cloak in secrecy the workings of our government from the public we are elected to serve.  The argument over the scope of the FOIA and unilateral executive power to shield matters from public scrutiny goes to the heart of our fundamental right to be an educated electorate aware of what our government is doing. The Rutland Herald got it right in a November 26, 2002 editorial that explained: ``The battle was not over the right of the government to hold sensitive, classified information secret. The government has that right. Rather, the battle was over whether the government would be required to release anything it sought to withhold.''  We need to fix this troubling restriction on public accountability. Exempting the new Department from laws that ensure responsibility to the Congress and to the American people makes for a tenuous start not the sure footing we all want for the success and endurance of this new Department. I urge my colleagues to support the Restoration of Freedom of Information Act of 2003.  I ask unanimous consent to print the editorials I mentioned and several letters of support of the Restore FOIA bill in the Record.  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Restoration of Freedom of Information Act (``Restore FOIA'') Sectional                                 Analysis       Sec. 1. Short title. This section gives the bill the short      title, the ``Restoration of Freedom of Information Act''.       Sec. 2. Protection of Voluntarily Furnished Confidential      Information. This section strikes subtitle B (secs. 211-215)      of the Homeland Security Act (``HSA'') (P.L. 107-296) and      inserts a new section 211.       Sections to be repealed from the HSA: These sections      contain an exemption to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)      that (1) exempt from disclosure critical infrastructure      information voluntarily submitted to the new department that      was designated as confidential by the submitter unless the      submitter gave prior written consent; (2) provide civil      immunity for use of such information in civil actions against      the company; (3) preempt state sunshine laws if the      designated information is shared with state or local      government agencies; and (4) impose criminal penalties of up      to one year imprisonment on government employees who      disclosed the designated information.       Provisions that would replace the repealed sections of the      HAS: The Restore FOIA bill inserts a new section 211 to the      HSA that would exempt from the FOIA certain records      pertaining to critical infrastructure threats and      vulnerabilities that are furnished voluntarily to the new      Department and designated by the provider as confidential and      not customarily made available to the public. Notably, the      Restore FOIA bill makes clear that the exemption covers      ``records'' from the private sector, not all ``information''      provided by the private sector, as in the enacted version of      the HSA. The Restore FOIA bill ensures that portions of      records that are not covered by the exemption would be      released pursuant to FOIA requests. It does not provide any      civil liability immunity or preempt state or local sunshine      laws, and it does not criminalize whistleblower activity.       Specifically, this section of the Restore FOIA bill      includes the following:       A definition of ``critical infrastructure'': This term is      given the meaning adopted in section 1016(e) the USA Patriot      Act (42 U.S.C. 5195c(e)) which reads, ``critical      infrastructure means systems and assets, whether physical or      virtual, so vital to United States that the incapacity or      destruction of such systems and assets would have a      debilitating impact on security, national economic security,      national public health or safety, or any combination of those      matters.'' This definition is commonly understood to mean      facilities such as bridges, dams, ports, nuclear power      plants, or chemical plants.       A definition of the term ``furnished voluntarily'': This      term signifies documents provided to the Department of      Homeland Security (DHS) that are not formally required by the      department and that are provided to it to satisfy any legal      requirement. The definition excludes any document that is      provided to DHS with a permit or grant application or to      obtain any other benefit from DHS, such as a loan, agency      forbearance, or modification of a penalty.       An exemption from FOIA of records that pertain to      vulnerabilities of and threats to critical infrastructure      that are furnished voluntarily to DHS. This exemption is made      available where the provider of the record certifies that the      information is confidential and would not customarily be      released to the public.       A requirement that other government agencies that have      obtained such records from DHS withhold disclosure of the      records and refer any FOIA requests to DHS for processing.       A requirement that reasonably segregable portions of      requested documents be disclosed, as is well-established      under FOIA.       An allowance to agencies that obtain critical      infrastructure records from a source other than DHS to      release requested records consistent with FOIA, regardless of      whether DHS has an identical record in its possession.       An allowance to providers of critical infrastructure      records to withdraw the confidentiality designation of      records voluntarily submitted to DHS, thereby making the      records subject to disclosure under FOIA.       A direction to the Secretary of Homeland Security to      establish procedures to receive, designate, store, and      protect the confidentiality of records voluntarily submitted      and certified as critical infrastructure records.       A clarification that the bill would not preempt state or      local information disclosure laws.       A requirement for the Comptroller General to report to the      House and Senate Judiciary Committees, the House Governmental      Reform Committee and the Senate Governmental Affairs      Committee the number of private entities and government      agencies that submit records to DHS under the terms of the      bill. The report would also include the number of requests      for access to records that were granted or denied. Finally,      the Comptroller General would make recommendations to the      committees for modifications or improvements to the      collection and analysis of critical infrastructure      information.       Sec. 3. Technical and conforming amendment. This section      amends the table of contents of the Homeland Security Act.                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 10, 2003]                           Fix This Loophole       The Homeland Security law enacted last year contains a      miserable provision that weakens important federal regulation      and public access to information. Congress should act soon to      repair the damage.       The goal of the provision was reasonable enough:      encouraging companies to share information with the      government about infrastructure that might be vulnerable to      terrorist attack. Fearing public disclosure, companies have      been reluctant to share information on vulnerabilities at,      say, power plants or chemical factories. So under the law,      any such ``critical infrastructure'' information that      companies voluntarily provide to the government is exempted      from disclosure to the public, litigants and enforcement      agencies.       But the law defines ``information'' so broadly that it will      cover, and thus keep secret, virtually anything a company      decides to fork over. A company might preempt environmental      regulators by ``voluntarily'' divulging incriminating      material, thereby making it unavailable to anyone else.      Unless regulators could show they had obtained the material      independently, it would be off limits to them. And the law      prescribes criminal penalties for whistle-blowers who make      such information public. The collective impact will be to put      in the hands of a regulated party the power, simply by      turning over information, to shield that information from      legitimate law enforcement purposes and from public      disclosure.       Sens. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) and Robert F. Bennett (R-     Utah) had negotiated a compromise that would accomplish the      reasonable purpose without such broad harmful effects. It      should be restored before the government finds its hands      tied--and the public finds itself out of the loop--on      important regulatory matters.                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 20, 2002]                            Too Many Secrets                           (By Mark Tapscott)       Why does the White House sometimes seem so determined to      close the door on the people's right to know what their      government is doing? Even some of us who admire the      leadership of President Bush in the war on terrorism would      like to know.       Admittedly, insisting that the public's business be done in      public isn't a popular cause these days. Recent surveys show      that many Americans are willing to trade significant chunks      of their First Amendment rights for the promise of greater      security in the war on terrorism. Such surveys must gladden      the hearts of Bush administration     officials who--presumably unintentionally--undermine measures      such as the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).       Consider just three examples from the past year: Section      204 of the White House's original proposal to establish a      Department of Homeland Security, White House Chief of Staff      Andrew Card's March 2002 directive that agencies restrict      access to ``sensitive but unclassified'' information, and the      administration's claim of executive privilege to keep secret      information regarding President Clinton's infamous midnight      pardons.       The administration's Section 204 proposal exempted from      FOIA disclosure any information ``provided voluntarily by      non-federal entities or individuals that relates to      infrastructure vulnerabilities or other vulnerabilities to      terrorism.'' One need not be a Harvard law graduate to see      that, without clarification of what constitutes such      vulnerabilities, this loophole could be manipulated by clever      corporate and government operators to hide endless varieties      of potentially embarrassing and/or criminal information from      public view.       Subsequent negotiations in the Senate with the White House      resulted in compromise language that takes care of some of      the major problems, but in the rush to final passage, the      Senate has accepted the House version of the legislation,      which, being virtually identical to the administration's      original version, remains deeply flawed in this regard.       The Card memo was issued when public anger over the Sept.      11, 2001, massacre was still intense. Despite the fact that      the memo failed to define what constitutes ``sensitive but      unclassified'' information, agencies responded by removing      thousands of previously public documents from FOIA      disclosure. The Pentagon, for example, estimated recently      that approximately 6,000 Defense Department documents were      removed from public view. Who now outside of government can      verify that any of those documents contained information that      could help terrorists?       Few would argue that the Section 204 proposal and the Card      memo do not address legitimate national security needs in the      war against terrorism. But to date, nobody has produced a      single example of vital information that could not have been      properly exempted from disclosure under the current FOIA,      which is backed by 25 years of detailed case law. Instead,      the administration offers vague language that invites abuse.       Finally, there are those pardons, which provoked a national      outcry when first reported. President Clinton had pardoned      140 people, including his Whitewater partner Susan McDougal,      his brother Roger (convicted on cocaine-related charges) and      international fugitive Marc Rich, wanted by the Justice      Department for allegedly conspiring with the Iranian      government in 1980 to buy 6 million barrels of oil, contrary      to a U.S. trade embargo.       It is doubtful that the full facts behind the pardons will      ever be known as long as the administration refuses to      disclose nearly 4,000 pages related to the former president's      actions. The Bush administration has taken a similar position      on documents related to former attorney general Janet Reno's      controversial decision not to appoint a special counsel to      investigate possible Clinton administration campaign finance      illegalities.       There was a time when at least one senior Bush      administration official thought the FOIA essential because      ``no matter what party has held the political power of      government, there have been attempts to cover up mistakes and      errors.'' That same official added that ``disclosure of      government information is particularly important today      because government is becoming involved in more and more      aspects of every citizen's personal and business life, and so      access to information about how government is exercising its      trust becomes increasingly important.''       So spoke a young Illinois Republican congressman named      Donald Rumsfeld, in a floor speech on June 20, 1966,      advocating passage of the FOIA, of which he was a co-sponsor.

In order to better serve the goal of improving      public safety and security, we support efforts to fix the      Homeland Security Act by clarifying the scope of the      information protected and removing provisions that overly      restrict the government's ability to use the information.       Senators Leahy (D-VT), Levin (D-MI), Jeffords (I-VT),      Lieberman (D-CT), and Byrd (D-WV) will soon introduce      legislation entitled the Restoration of Freedom of      Information Act of 2003 (``Restore FOIA'') addressing these      concerns, using bipartisan language developed last year by      the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. The Restore FOIA      solution would:       Clarify the FOIA exemption to be more consistent with      established law.       Remove the restrictions on the government's ability to act      as it sees fit in response to the information it receives.       Preserve whistleblower protections by removing unnecessary      criminal penalties.       The information provisions currently within the Homeland      Security Act of 2002 do not accomplish the goal of the law--     empowering the government to protect citizens using private-     sector information which is ``voluntarily'' shared and      identifies potential vulnerabilities to terrorist attacks.      The current language could have devastating effects on the      work of the government to protect public health, safety and      security, as well as government accountability. It is      essential that these problems in the Homeland Security Act be      fixed immediately before they become too firmly entrenched in      the law.

Susan Collins,     Chair, Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate,          Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Orrin Hatch,     Chair, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs,          U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, U.S.          Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Collins, Hatch, Lieberman, and Leahy: The      Homeland Security Act of 2002 was a very important      legislative accomplishment that responded to new challenges      facing our country.       On the path to passage of the Act, however, certain      sections, particularly Section 214, dealing with Critical      Infrastructure Information, left a number of journalistic      organizations concerned that broad categories of      information--particularly information that relates to the      public's health and safety--would unnecessarily be shielded      from public view.       Thus, we support efforts to clarify the language in favor      of essential openness, which, in fact, will also resolve      potential barriers that restrict the government's own use of      information provided by companies. The ``Restoration of      Freedom of Information Act of 2003'' would substitute      bipartisan language developed last year by the Senate      Government Affair Committee for that which was enacted into      law. This bill would:       Clarify the FOIA exemption to be more consistent with      established law, while still protecting records on critical      infrastructure vulnerabilities submitted to the Department of      Homeland Security by private firms.       Remove the restrictions on the government's ability to act      as it sees fit in response to the information it receives.       Preserve whistleblower protections by removing unnecessary      criminal penalties.       It is important for both citizens and the government      process that these changes in law are made quickly.       Thank you for your consideration.           Sincerely,         American Society of Magazine Editors; American Society of            Newspaper Editors; Associated Press Managing Editors;            Freedom of Information Center, University of Missouri            School of Journalism; Magazine Publishers of America;            National Federation of Press Women; National Newspaper            Association; National Press Club; Newsletter &            Electronic Publishers Association; Newspaper            Association of America; Radio-Television News Directors            Association; Reporters Committee for Freedom of the            Press; Society of Professional Journalists.                                  ____                            Let Freedom Ring                        (By Maurice J. Freedman)       What if you want to find out if toxic chemicals are buried      under your child's schoolyard? How could you tell if your      veterans' benefits hinged on proving you were exposed to      biohazards during a top-secret mission? Or perhaps a      candidate for your city council wants to better understand      formerly classified plans for emergency evacuation.       These days, it's possible, with considerable patience,      determination, and a few clicks of a mouse, to file a request      for answers to questions like these and a broad range of      government information that are critical to our lives, work,      health and well being.       But like registering to vote, in some places and for some      people, this precious freedom hasn't always been so easy to      exercise.       The main tool for such fact-finding, the Freedom of      Information Act, known as FOIA, which we honor each year on      the anniversary of James Madison's birthday, was first      enacted on July 4, 1966. Before that, any-one who wanted to      get records from the federal government had to establish his      or her legal right to examine those records. That was      expensive, time-consuming and a barrier for countless      legitimate requests for information on issues from whether      the nuclear reactor downwind had a record of safety      violations to how the Nixon administration tried to deport      John Lennon as detailed in his FBI files.       With FOIA, the burden shifted to government agencies,      requiring them to meet these requests unless they fell within      a handful of specific national security exemptions. Indeed,      since then, any decision by an agency to withhold a document      could be challenged in federal court.       From John Lennon's or Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s FBI      files to record of debates on whether to use nuclear weapons      in Vietnam, FOIA requests now run the gamut of what we need      to know about what our government is doing with our tax      dollars in our name. Whether it's internal NASA memos about      space shuttle safety or exchanges among federal officials      about Japanese internment camps during World War II, our      right to know about the deliberations and actions of our      federal government is a cornerstone of American democracy.       In 1974, in reaction to Watergate, Congress moved to      strengthen FOIA. Unwilling to let our country be run more      like a closed corporation than an open, democratic society,      this change allowed courts to order the release of documents,      even when the President said they couldn't be made public.       Our system of representative democracy depends on the free      flow of information produced, collected and published by our      government and available to the public so we can participate      as an informed electorate.       Since the early 19th century, libraries have served as      depositories for the written record of our nation's      development and gateways to the decisions of its leaders,      thus assuring public access to government information. Today,      21st-century librarians are committed to ensuring the      public's right to know is protected in the electronic age. As      organizers, navigators and providers of government      information that serves the public, we help file FOIA      requests and otherwise support freedom of information @ your      library.       Many Americans depend on access to information collected,      organized and disseminated by the federal government--from      farmers and health care professionals, to journalists and      veterans, community interest groups to local and state      government officials, and indeed, all voters.       Americans come to libraries to find Census and other      statistics; to help plan new business and marketing      strategies; to research environmental issues and hazards,      laws and regulations; and to learn about job opportunities      from government and other employment lists.       The ongoing transition to predominantly electronic      transmission of federal information offers both promise and      problems for the public in this realm. Information that is      only in electronic form quickly appears on--and as quickly      disappears from--Web sites. There is often no one charged      with capturing, preserving or making electronic data      available to future generations, as well as those, who for a      variety of reasons, cannot access or work with electronic      information.       True national security is built on a vibrant democracy and      a well-informed citizenry, not a culture of secrecy. Said      James Madison, on whose birthday we make Freedom of      Information Day, ``Knowledge will forever govern ignorance,      and a people who mean to be their own governors must arm      themselves with the power which knowledge gives.'' Although      he wrote in response to abuses by Britain's King George III,      his warnings ring equally true today.       Every country has hospitals, police and schools. But only      free countries allow the free flow of ideas. Free libraries      are the hub of public access to government information.      Challenges to an informed citizenry range from the complexity      and inequality in information technology to illiteracy,      limited information literacy skills and unequal access to      education and information resources.       Thankful for our freedoms, we must do our best as we      prepare to fight halfway around the world to ensure that we      continue to guard with unrelating vigilance the right to know      here at home.
