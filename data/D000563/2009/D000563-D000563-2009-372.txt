President, tomorrow, Chairman Tom Harkin will lead the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee in the markup of a food safety bill, S. 510, the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act. I introduced this bill with Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire and a broad coalition of Senators from both sides of the aisle. I thank those Senators--especially the late Senator Ted Kennedy, who joined as a cosponsor of the bill, and Senators Dodd, Burr, Isakson, Alexander, Klobuchar, and Chambliss--for joining me to fight for America's food safety. Since we introduced this bill, a number of other Members have signed on, including Senators Hatch, Gillibrand, Tom Udall, and Senator Burris. We are pleased to have their support.
