 President, I rise today to honor an outstanding American whose tireless work helped bring to national attention the matter of gay civil rights. Jean O'Leary represented the ideals of a truly integrated society, a Nation that saw equality for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people of this world. On June 4, 2005, my dear friend, Jean O'Leary died at the age of 57, in her home in San Clemente, CA. Her passing is a great loss to her family and she will be missed by all who knew her. I offer my deepest condolences to her family and am joined by the thousands of Californians, as well as those throughout the country, who have benefited from her work to end the injustices that segregate this great Nation. Jean O'Leary's was a light, a remarkable voice in an area that needed a champion. Her legacy will live on through the passion and energy she gave to the gay rights movement.  Jean Marie O'Leary lived a life of extraordinary accomplishments. Born in Kingston, NY, but raised mostly in Ohio, Ms. O'Leary attended parochial schools from third grade through high school and in 1966 joined the Sisters of the Holy Humility of Mary to become a nun. Many were surprised by her decision which contradicted her independent and rebellious nature. Years later she revealed that she wanted to become a nun because she ``wanted to do something special, to have an impact on the world.''  Jean O'Leary left the covenant in 1971, returning to New York where she immersed herself in the gay rights movement. She was a member of the Gay Activists Alliance, founder of the Lesbian Feminist Liberation, co-executive director of the National Gay Task Force, and head of the National Gay Rights Advocates where she helped bring visibility to the movement.  In 1977, Ms. O'Leary through her close friendship with Midge Costanza, an advisor to President Jimmy Carter, organized the first-ever meeting of gay rights advocates in the White House. This historic gathering of gay and lesbian leaders spurred a national discussion to review and begin to correct the antigay policies by Federal Government agencies. President Carter later appointed her to the National Commission on the Observance of International Women's Year where she negotiated the inclusion of gay and lesbian rights on the commission's conference held in Houston. In her work as a Democratic Party activist, O'Leary was a pillar of strength and support that helped advance the rights of gay men and lesbians, women and people living with HIV and AIDS.  Truly, she lived up to her dreams to shape the world. In a career that spanned 35 years, I remember Ms. O'Leary as an exception activist, a woman with a soft-spoken, charming, and compassionate nature that shown through in her tremendous ability to pioneer an issue that involves millions worldwide.  Jean O'Leary was an exemplary American who worked to improve the life of all persons in the Nation. She was an outstanding individual, a close and trusted friend, and an inspiration to this Nation. We will all miss her spirit and passion, and our thoughts go out to her family and friends.                          ____________________
