Mr. Chairman, I insert into the Record an exchange of letters between myself and Chairman Pombo regarding H.R. 3.                                         House of Representatives,                                       Committee on Resources,                                    Washington, DC, March 9, 2005.     Hon. Don Young, Chairman,     Committee on Transportation, and Infrastructure, Rayburn HOB          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I have reviewed the text of H.R. 3, the      Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users, as ordered      reported from the Committee on Transportation and      Infrastructure on March 2, 2005. I believe that the Committee      on Resources has a substantial jurisdictional interest in      many provisions of this important legislation including      streamlining of procedures under the National Environmental      Policy Act and resolving confusion on highway construction      and section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act       Further, this Committee maintains jurisdictional interests      in provisions affecting recreational trails, highways on      federal public lands (including national parks, Indian lands      and public domain forest lands), the National Scenic Byways      Program, projects to benefit wildlife, highway safety as it      applies to Indian country.       Recognizing that this historic bill is scheduled to be      considered by the House of Representatives this week, and      noting the strong spirit of cooperation and coordination your      staff has shown mine in the development of this bill, I will      forego seeking a sequential referral of H.R. 3 to the      Committee on Resources. Waiving the Committee on Resources'      right to a referral in this case does not waive the      Committee's jurisdiction over any provision in H.R. 3 or      similar provisions in other bills. In addition, I ask that      you support my request to have the Committee on Resources      represented on the conference on this bill, if a conference      is necessary. Finally, I ask that you include this letter in      the Congressional Record during consideration of the bill.       Following your mark-up of H.R. 3, I want to acknowledge      your efforts on the bill's environmental provisions, many of      which touch upon Committee on Resources jurisdiction. I      commend your efforts to streamline the environmental review      process under the National Environmental Protection Act as      well as Section 4(f) procedures. However, I do have serious      concerns about the provision dealing with the pilot program      for mass transit in National Parks. This provision address      issues that lie squarely within the jurisdiction of the      Committee on Resources and should be addressed in that      context. Moreover, the bill passed last year by the Senate,      S. 1075, contained a number of troubling provisions that I      feel should not be included in any version of transportation      legislation. These provisions include language relating to      the Endangered Species Act and programs to address invasive      species. Thank you for not including these provisions in your      bill.       I appreciate your leadership and cooperation on this bill      and I look forward to working with you to see that H.R. 3 is      enacted into law soon.           Sincerely,                                                 Richard W. Pombo,     Chairman.                                  ____         House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and            Infrastructure,                                   Washington, DC, March 10, 2005.     Hon. Richard W. Pombo, Chairman,     Committee on Resources, Longworth HOB, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC 20515       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter of March 9,      2005, regarding H.R. 3, the Transportation Equity Act: A      Legacy for Users. Your assistance in expediting consideration      of the bill is very much appreciated.       I agree that there are provisions in the bill that are of      jurisdictional interest to the Committee on Resources and I      agree that by foregoing a sequential referral the Committee      on Resources is not waiving its jurisdiction.       I would be pleased to support the representation of your      Committee in any conference on H.R. 3 on matters within the      jurisdiction of the Committee on Resources. And, as you have      requested, I will include this exchange of letters in the      Record. Thank you for your cooperation and your continued      leadership and support in surface transportation matters.           Sincerely,                                                        Don Young,                                                         Chairman.                                       ____
