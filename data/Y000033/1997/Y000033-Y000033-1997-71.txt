Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to remind the people that it is not the government, it is this Congress, the House of the people, not the government. Number two, they say, why have we not done it before? We have not because we have some people that believed in one world that were chairmen of the committee and subcommittee chairmen who never allowed us to have this on the floor of the House.  Now I am the chairman of this committee. This is the right thing to do for America, for the people of America. It is our responsibility under the Constitution. They may not believe in the Constitution, but I do. They may believe in one world, but I do not. I believe in the sovereignty of the United States of America.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri [Mrs. Emerson].
