I am prepared to disclose that, and I think most Members are.  So I say to the Senator from Vermont, shutting down the government to keep the American people--40 million uninsured people--away from the opportunity under the Affordable Care Act is hardly the kind of work we want to be part of.  I thank the Senator from Vermont for his leadership on so many issues, and I thank him for coming here today in personal witness to the need for good medical care, even for Senators.
