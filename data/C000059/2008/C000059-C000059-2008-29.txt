Timilie was a remarkable woman who was deeply devoted to her family and community.  Timilie was born on November 19, 1940, in Safford, Arizona where she attended Safford High School as well as The University of Arizona. She moved to the City of Riverside in 1969. For the past fourteen years Timilie worked as the Project Coordinator for the Greater Riverside Chamber of Commerce. Her duties included organizing meetings for ten committees including agendas, notification, reports, minutes, and wanted information. She maintained and produced all correspondence for the President of the Chamber, kept and scheduled his calendar, answered phones and dispensed information to chamber callers. She also put together and choreographed weekly luncheons with major Riverside industries, Chamber Board, and local government officials. Timilie staffed the community leaders ``Monday Morning Group'' activities and ``Leadership Riverside'' program and managed schedules, meetings, files, correspondence, and logistics.  Before her job with the Chamber of Commerce, Timilie worked for the University of California, Riverside Office of Alumni and Parent Relations. Timilie handled everything from welcoming new students to serving as an advisor the Student Alumni Association. Timilie also previously worked for the United Way of the Inland Valleys, Riverside and for the American Heart Association, Riverside County Chapter.  Timilie was a valued member of the community and she will be sorely missed. She was a great mother, daughter, grandmother, companion and friend. Timilie is survived by her life partner of 15 years, Paul McAdam; sons, Lenny and Chris; daughters in-law, Vickie and Debbie; mother, Isabel Nelson; brother, Story Nelson; and 5 grandchildren. My thoughts and prayers are with her family and friends.  Timilie will always be remembered for her ready smile, her positive attitude and the joy she brought to the people around her. Thank you and God Bless.                          ____________________
