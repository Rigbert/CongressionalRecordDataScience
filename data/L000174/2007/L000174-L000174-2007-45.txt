President, I hope we can quickly reach a point where Senators on both sides are willing to finish speaking. Obviously, I am not going to ask to cut off anybody's time. As soon as there is no Senator seeking recognition, I will move again to yield back all time on this vote and all time on the judge's vote, so we can go to both those votes back to back.
