 President, I rise today to offer a tribute to Kentucky State Senator David Williams,as sincere congratulations for 15 years of service in the General Assembly and as encouragement for many more years of accomplishments and victories still to come.  David is one of the sharpest politicians and smartest people I know. His long-time passion for politics and desire to serve Kentucky is evidenced in his hard work in the Kentucky Senate--and in his perseverance getting there. David's strong convictions about issues and principles important to Kentuckians have helped him become a prominent figure in the State legislature, but his climb to the top was not an easy one. David lost his first campaign for public office when he ran for county judge-executive, and has often faced tough opposition in the Senate. To his credit, David has remained committed to his constituents and to the values they elected him to represent.  When he was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives 15 years ago, David was a country lawyer from Burkesville, Kentucky. His sharp mind and peerless rhetorical skills were evident right from the start, and helped David eventually come to lead the now-Republican Majority in the Senate.  As a fellow public servant, I know first-hand the kinds of commitments and sacrifices that have to be made in order to effectively serve a constituency. Clearly, David has demonstrated his willingness to take on that responsibility, and has been an example through his ability to handle the daily demands of being a Senate leader. Additionally, he is a great family man. David's wife Elaine has surely been a great support and encouragement to him, and deserves commendation for her tireless work in the field of education, as the instructional supervisor for Cumberland County Schools. David is also devoted to his parents, Lewis and Flossie Williams, of Cumberland County. David's father served as Cumberland County clerk for nine consecutive terms, and was a high school principal and basketball coach when David was growing up. His parents' work in education and politics gave David a solid background that has prepared him well for his current leadership role in the State Senate, and will certainly continue to inspire him in future endeavors.  David, on behalf of my colleagues and myself, thank you for your fifteen years of service to the 16th district and to the people of Kentucky. I have every confidence in your ability to lead the State Senate, and know that your best days are yet to come.  Mr. President, I ask that an article which ran in the Louisville Courier-Journal on September 5, 1999, be printed in the Record.  The article follows:          [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, Sept. 5, 1999]                  Williams Gets Closer to Senate Peak                            (By Tom Loftus)       Burkesville, KY.--David Williams began learning hard      political lessons at a young age.       In the second grade he lost an election ``for some kind of      class favorite'' by a single vote. ``At that time I was      chivalrous enough to vote for my opponent,'' Williams said.      ``I decided I wasn't going to do that again.''       It wasn't the last election Williams would lose, yet come      away a bit the wiser--and with his passion for a career in      elective office undiminished.       Today, after serving 15 years in the General Assembly--many      of those years in a minority faction of the minority      Republican Party--David Williams stands as perhaps the most      powerful member of the General Assembly.       This summer's defections of two Democratic senators to the      GOP gives the Republicans a majority in the Senate for the      first time ever--making Minority Leader Williams into      Majority Leader Williams, and likely Senate President      Williams.       So when the legislature convenes in January, the Senate      will be led by this 46-year-old lawyer from Burkesville, a      man described as smart and articulate by some, cocky or      condescending by others.       Williams calls himself a compassionate conservative. Many      Democrats consider him their favorite Republican senator.       At his core, he's a man who lives government and politics.       ``We can't get him out to golf; he really doesn't have any      time-consuming hobbies.'' said Cumberland District Judge      Steve Hurt.       ``He has always been fascinated by the political process.      He's the kind of guy who sits up at night watching `Hardball      with Christ Matthews' and C-SPAN.''       In January, Williams plans to play a little hardball of his      own.       Last week he said he'd exercise the majority's rightful      power to bounce Louisville Democrat Larry Saunders as Senate      president.       ``I want the majority of the members of the Kentucky state      Senate to choose the president they feel most comfortable      with,'' Williams said.       ``And if it happens to be David Williams, I would be most      proud to serve in that position.''                political aspirations run in the family       Williams runs a one-man law practice in his hometown of      Burkesville, county seat of the predominantly Republican      Cumberland County. He and his wife, Elaine, who is      instructional supervisor for the Cumberland County schools,      live in a house valued on tax rolls at $225,000. They have no      children. Williams is the only child of Lewis and Flossie      Williams, who still live in the house where David grew up.       The family regularly attended Burkesville United Methodist      Church, and Williams' parents put a high value on the      importance of a good education. Lewis Williams was a      principal and basketball coach who, after losing his first      campaign for county clerk, won nine consecutive elections for      that office without opposition.       ``We went to Lincoln Day dinners when I was a small boy. I      heard (U.S. Sen.) John Sherman Cooper, (Fifth District      Congressman) Tim Lee Carter, (U.S. Sen.) Thruston Morton and      all those folks,'' Williams said. ``I grew up in the      courthouse. After school and on Saturdays I'd hang out there      when I was a kid. And I was actively involved in the local      party when I was 15 or 16 years old.''       At Cumberland County High School, Williams was the senior      class president, lettered in baseball, and was captain of the      football team. His quotation next to his photo in the 1971      yearbook is: ``The scales of justice can only be balanced by      the weight of involvement.''       Williams said he particularly liked playing football. He      was a center on offense and a tackle on defense. ``If I had      been a step quicker I could have played college ball,'' he      said. (Hurt, who quarterbacked the 1971 Cumberland County      team, suggested Williams would have to have been a bit more      than one step quicker.)       In fact, though he and his wife like to fish and keep a      pontoon boat on Dale Hollow Lake, their favorite pastime is      college sports. As a legislator he takes advantage of the      chance to buy two tickets to University of Kentucky and      University of Louisville football and basketball games. He      travels to most UK football games on the road and attends      postseason basketball tournaments when UK plays.       ``The football season is something I really enjoy,'' he      said. ``I usually try to catch U of L when I can. I'm one of      those rare people who like both UK and U of L.''       Williams is a graduate of both.       After high school, he and his then-girlfriend Elaine      Grubbs, went on to UK. They dated off-and-on through college.       At UK Williams was true to his high school yearbook      quotation. Among other things he was in the student senate      and ran for student body president--the clean-shaven frat boy      who ran against an opponent he describes as ``long-haired and      hippie-ish.'' Williams lost.       After graduation, Williams enrolled at the U of L Law      School. He married Grubbs after his first year there.       Williams said he could have studied law at UK but wanted to      broaden his experience. And he liked Louisville.       ``My closest relatives live in Louisville--aunts and uncles      on my father's side of the family--and I visited Louisville      often as a boy,'' Williams said. ``I lived in Louisville      during some of the summers when I was growing up because when      my dad was a teacher, he would go to Louisville and roof      houses on construction crews and make good money in the      summer. .  .  . We would go up and live with relatives.''                    Lessons learned through setbacks       After law school, Williams returned to Burkesville to      practice law and--at age 25--ran for county judge-executive.      His opponent was incumbent Harold E. ``Barney'' Barnes--a      Democrat who had been appointed by Gov. Julian Carroll when      the elected judge died in office. Williams lost.       ``It taught me some interesting political lessons about      incumbency,'' Williams recalled. ``When the governor and the      local judge have an unlimited amount of blacktop and things      like that, it can have a big effect.''       But in 1984 Williams ousted state Rep. Richard Fryman of      Albany, a fellow Republican. Two years later he succeeded      retiring Sen. Doug Moseley of Columbia and has been re-     elected to the state Senate three times since--the last two      times without opposition.       During his Senate tenure, though, Williams was twice      rejected by the voters in years when his Senate seat was not      up for re-election.       In 1992 he won a Republican primary for the U.S. Senate but      was drubbed in the general election by popular incumbent      Democrat Wendell Ford, who won with 64 percent of the vote.       But perhaps the nadir of Williams' political career came      the following year.       While stewing in a minority faction of the Senate      Republican caucus, Williams decided to try to be a prosecutor      and ran for commonwealth's attorney in his home four-county      district. He lost.       But he never considered dropping out of politics.       ``I didn't think any of the losses were due to my lack of      ability or people not liking     me,'' he said. ``I'm no Lincoln, but even Lincoln got beat      two or three times.''       Longstanding alliances within the small Senate Republican      caucus had largely kept Williams out of a leadership position      there. But the number of Senate Republicans grew during the      1990s.       During the 1998 session, after the Republican minority had      grown to 18 senators, Williams was part of (but he insists      did not lead) an attempt to oust Sen. Dan Kelly's Republican      leadership team--a coup that failed when Republican senators      voted 9-9.       After the 1998 elections changed the make-up of the caucus,      Williams finally had the votes he needed to win election as      Senate Republican leader.       And defections of two Democratic senators to the GOP mean      he's likely to become Senate president.                     A mix of attorney and preacher       Williams said Kentuckians can expect him to take generally      conservative stands on most issues.       ``But I don't hate government,'' he said. ``I'm not a      person who is afraid to use government to effect change. . .      . I come from an area of the state that has needs. I've grown      up and lived with people who have needs. I've grown up in      areas that needed roads, that needed schools.''       In fact, in 1990 Williams was one of only three Senate      Republicans who voted for the Kentucky Education Reform Act,      which included a massive tax increase.       ``I voted for it because the school districts in rural      Kentucky did not have adequate resources, the students there      did not have adequate opportunity,'' Williams said. ``I'm not      unalterably wed to every aspect of the Kentucky Education      Reform Act. . . . But I still feel like I cast the right      vote.''       Besides his support of KERA, Williams is known in the      legislature for his long fight to win funding for a resort      lodge at Dale Hollow, his advocacy of workers' compensation      law reform (which Gov. Paul Patton pushed through in 1996),      and helping to increase state spending on adult education.       Williams is better-known, though, for his skill as a      debater. ``David Williams is and has always been one of the      most articulate members of the Senate,'' said Senate      Democratic Leader David Karem of Louisville. ``There's a      wonderful mix of the courtroom attorney and the traditional      Kentucky preacher in the way he delivers his speeches from      the floor.''       Williams said Republicans are inclined to oppose two ideas      Patton has floated this year as ways of raising state      revenue--raising the gas tax and expanding legal gambling.       But he said he's not prepared yet to slam the door on      either idea. ``We haven't seen a bill yet,'' he said.       And if Williams succeeds in leading the Senate, might he      make another race for statewide office?       Williams said he has no plans to seek higher office, though      he's not ruling out the possibility.       Sen. Tom Buford, R-Nicholasville, said Williams could be a      strong candidate for governor in 2003. ``He hasn't said      anything,'' Buford said. ``But I would watch that.''                          ____________________
