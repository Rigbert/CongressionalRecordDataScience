Speaker, it is with great pride and enthusiasm that I wish to congratulate an exceptional group of Northwest Indiana educators. The Indiana State Teacher's Association will present these outstanding individuals with the 2002-2003 Crystal Apple Award for excellence in education during a banquet on Wednesday, May 7, 2003 in Schererville, Indiana. This year's recipients are: Darlene M. Vassil, Linda Johnson, Estelle Becke, Judith Thayer, Renee Kouris, James Crist, and Sherry Peters.  Darlene Vassil is a 22-year veteran of art education, and she effectively uses this wealth of experience to enrich the lives of her students. She was awarded a grant from the Indiana Department of Education to develop an electronic portfolio program so that her students can learn to enhance creativity through technology. Darlene's enthusiasm and dedication for her work led to her involvement in the Fine Arts and Music Education (FAME) organization. She was instrumental in the organization of the Northwest Indiana FAME Festivals Imaginarium for the past two years, and has been responsible for various art displays from other cultures being brought to her community.  Linda Johnson has served in the Hanover Community School Corporation for 28 years, and her dedication and professionalism is unsurpassed. She has taught students at various grade levels throughout the elementary and intermediate system. She currently teaches fifth grade at Lincoln Elementary and will retire after the school year is completed. Known for her intelligence and wisdom, Linda is a source of advice for both her students and her peers. Her devotion and humor will be greatly missed.  Estelle Becke began her career as an elementary school teacher in the Highland school system, and currently teaches seventh grade geography. She is a bold, strong, and loyal person who has a passion for both her subject area and her craft. Estelle has sponsored her school's Geography Bee, and has also emceed the school-wide event. She has spent her career teaching her students tolerance for those from diverse cultures and backgrounds.  Judith Thayer has dedicated 30 of her 34\1/2\ years of teaching to the Lake Central School Corporation. She currently teaches fourth grade at Kolling Elementary School in St. John, Indiana. Her efforts and excellence in the classroom have undoubtedly contributed to the status of Kolling as one of Indiana's Four Star Schools. Although Judith has a principal's certificate, she chooses to be in the classroom because of her love for the students.  Renee Kouris has touched the lives not only of her theater students, but also the lives of those who watch their performances. Her compassion for her students and her desire to include every student in her productions has made Renee one of the most popular teachers at Munster High School. Last year, her theater class participated in a state-wide competition and placed second for the original work that they wrote, produced, and presented. Her ability to challenge students and faculty while remaining humorous, compassionate, and sincere makes her an excellent choice for the 2002-2003 Crystal Apple Award.  James Crist is known for his ability to connect with students in a way that few other teachers are able to duplicate. He directs the Pupils Reached by Individual Direct Education (PRIDE) program, which reaches out to students who have difficulty adapting to standard teaching methods. He teaches them to take pride in themselves and their work. James promotes fairness, acceptance, and stability to students who otherwise would have given up on their education. His adaptability to meet the needs of his students is remarkable, and we are deeply indebted to him for his dedication to his pupils.  Sherry Peters uses her work ethic, dedication, and creative spirit to improve her teaching methods and effectiveness. She does not simply rely on her lesson plans from previous years, but she constantly updates her materials and evaluates her methods in an attempt to reach her pupils. She has the ability to understand her students and connect with them in the classroom, and she uses this ability to take them far beyond their previous limitations. She uses creative strategies to enrich the lives of her students, and the seniors at Lowell High School have elected her the Most Influential Teacher on many occasions.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating these tremendous educators as they accept the 2002-2003 Crystal Apple Award from the Indiana State Teacher's Association. Their tireless dedication to enriching the minds of today's youth is invaluable, and I am proud to represent these outstanding teachers in Congress.                          ____________________
