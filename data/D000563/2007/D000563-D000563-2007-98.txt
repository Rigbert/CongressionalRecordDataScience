President, we are all aware of the current healthcare crisis in our nation. Health care spending continues to rise at an unsustainable rate, constituting 16 percent of the Federal budget. Health care costs have increased 78 percent since 2001, more than 4 times the pace of prices and wages.  One reason for the rise in costs and spending is the increase in chronic disease. Heart disease, cancer, and diabetes are the leading causes of death and disability in the U.S. They also account for 70 percent of all deaths in the U.S., or 1.7 million people each year. These diseases also make life harder for the 1 of 10 Americans who are living with them. The irony, of course, is that chronic diseases are both preventable and manageable.  The quality of our healthcare has not changed substantially despite the fact that we live in the wealthiest country in the world with the best researchers and medical doctors at our fingertips. At a time when both health care costs and chronic illnesses are on the rise, we need a better way to provide care.  Changing the delivery of care is a controversial topic, but it is a topic that has gained more traction in recent months. Last week, the New York Times published an article titled, ``A Model for Health Care That Pays for Quality.'' The article described a new model for healthcare, and I quote here, ``to identify the best primary care doctors and to steer patients their way. Those doctors, in turn, would be paid for more services than are currently reimbursed under typical health plan payments for office visits. The idea is to encourage doctors to meet with patients for more than a few minutes during an office visit and to also compensate them, or nurse coordinators, for communicating with patients by phone and e-mail outside office hours.'' This is an approach to delivering care that national physician groups and patient advocacy organizations call the medical home.  A medical home is something that those of us who have it take for granted. We see the same doctor, in the same setting, for extended periods of time. Our medical history is in one place, and even if we are seeing specialists or different doctors in the same practice, there is continuity in decisions about our health care. This is a medical home.  But many people do not have this luxury. Think about people who move from place to place, whose home lives are less than stable, who don't have health insurance, whose medical care is sporadic. For these members of our community, each visit to a clinic or an emergency room means starting over again.  So, everyone should have access to a medical home. A medical home is not only a place, but an approach to providing comprehensive primary care that respects, and responds to, individual patient preferences and needs and helps patients develop relationships with their providers.  It sounds easy, but it requires some changes and creative thinking and, perhaps most importantly, it requires a commitment by local providers to work together. The medical home model makes sense for improving health care for everyone. It is a model of care that makes sense for stretching our limited Federal health care dollars.  States like Illinois and North Carolina are already seeing progress with implementing the medical home model. Illinois Health Connect is a new program at the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services that uses the medical home model to deliver primary and preventive care for children and adults covered through the All Kids program. This emphasis on coordinated and ongoing care is leading to better health outcomes, and it's saving money.  Community Care of North Carolina launched a medical home model in 1998, through nine physician-led networks. North Carolina started by creating medical homes for 250,000 Medicaid enrollees. Today, it is a State-wide program that has saved the state at least $60 million in Medicaid costs in 2003 and $120 million in 2004.  Cost savings is not the only benefit. Several studies show that the medical home approach improves quality of care. Early analyses are finding that having regular access to a particular physician through the medical home is associated with earlier and more accurate diagnoses, fewer emergency room visits, fewer hospitalizations, lower costs, better care, and increased patient satisfaction. Many studies conclude that having both health insurance and a medical home leads to improved overall health for the entire population, which brings down the cost of care and reduces health care disparities.  Today, I am proud to be joined by my colleague Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina to introduce the Medical Homes Act of 2007. This bill would make it easier for other states to implement a medical home model, much like Illinois and North Carolina have. Congress passed a medical home demonstration project for Medicare last year. The Medical Homes Act of 2007 would do this for Medicaid and SCHIP beneficiaries by making Federal funding available for a demonstration project in 8 States to provide care through patient-centered medical homes.  The approach we propose requires a per-member, per-month care management fee to help pay for participating doctors and provides initial start-up funding for participating States. The startup funds are used for the purchase of health information technology, primary care case managers, and other uses appropriate for the delivery of patient-centered care.  If patients, provider, payers, and the government work together to create a system that values the patient more than payments and the health outcome of the patient more than the number of patients seen, we can really change the way primary care is provided. I urge my colleagues to support the Medical Homes Act of 2007 and help stabilize healthcare delivery for low-income and elderly Americans.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2376       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Medical Homes Act of 2007''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) Medical homes provide patient-centered care, leading to      better health outcomes and greater patient satisfaction. A      growing body of research supports the need to involve      patients and their families in their own health care      decisions, to better inform them of their treatment options,      and to improve their access to information.       (2) Medical homes help patients better manage chronic      diseases and maintain basic preventive care, resulting in      better health outcomes than those who lack medical homes. An      investigation of the Chronic Care Model discovered that the      medical home reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease in      diabetes patients, helped congestive heart failure patients      become more knowledgeable and stay on recommended therapy,      and increased the likelihood that asthma and diabetes      patients would receive appropriate therapy.       (3) Medical homes also reduce disparities in access to      care. A survey conducted by the Commonwealth Fund found that      74 percent of adults with a medical home have reliable access      to the care they need, compared with only 52 percent of      adults with a regular provider that is not a medical home and      38 percent of adults without any regular source of care or      provider.       (4) Medical homes reduce racial and ethnic differences in      access to medical care. Three-fourths of Caucasians, African      Americans, and Hispanics with medical homes report getting      care when they need it in a medical home.       (5) Medical homes reduce duplicative health services and      inappropriate emergency room use. In 1998, North Carolina      launched the Community Care of North Carolina (CCNC) program,      which employs the medical home concept. Today CCNC includes      14 networks, that include all Federally qualified health      centers in the State, covering 740,000 recipients across the      entire State. An analysis conducted by Mercer Human Resources      Consulting Group found that CCNC resulted in $244,000,000 in      savings to the Medicaid program in 2004, with similar results      in 2005 and 2006.       (6) Health information technology is a crucial foundation      for medical homes. While many doctor's offices use electronic      health records for billing or other administrative functions,      few practices utilize health information technology      systematically to measure and improve the quality of care      they provide. For example, electronic health records can      generate reports to ensure that all patients with chronic      conditions receive recommended tests and are on target to      meet their treatment goals. Computerized ordering systems,      particularly with decision-support tools, can prevent medical      and medication errors, while e-mail and interactive Internet      websites can facilitate communication between patients and      providers and patient education.
