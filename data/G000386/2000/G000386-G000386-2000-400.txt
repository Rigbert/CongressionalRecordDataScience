 President, I have an opportunity to avoid one vote by sending to the desk a modified amendment. It is amendment No. 2762. So I send it to the desk and ask unanimous consent that the amendment be modified and that the modified amendment be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table. If necessary, I ask unanimous consent to lay the pending amendment aside.
