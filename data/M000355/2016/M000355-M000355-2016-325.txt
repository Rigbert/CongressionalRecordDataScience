 President, over the weekend, several incidents that appear to be acts of terrorism left dozens injured and many across the country shaken. While we are thankful that no loss of life has been reported, we also know that the injured will face a difficult road to recovery and healing. Our prayers are with each of them and all of those affected in this trying time.  Authorities acted expeditiously to uncover the facts, and just hours ago they captured a suspect in connection to the New York and New Jersey bombings. We thank them for their swift actions and continued efforts to keep Americans safe. Although an arrest has now been made, there is still much we do not know about these incidents, including whether there was involvement of a terrorist organization overseas. Investigators are continuing their work even as we speak, and we are monitoring that situation closely as it unfolds.  No matter the motive behind these incidents, it is clear that we must do everything we can to bolster security measures and counter the threats facing our homeland. These acts are very real reminders of the national security threats and challenges that we face both from beyond our borders and from within. Ensuring the safety of all Americans remains our top priority, so we will continue to do our part in working with our intelligence community, military leaders, and our law enforcement personnel in their efforts to protect the American people.                          ____________________
