 That is why we acted yesterday. I am hopeful the Senate will act as well, but I am even more hopeful that President Obama will follow the principles incorporated in yesterday's legislation.  With TARP funds already beginning to take effect, and with these new safeguards in place, I ask my colleagues to release the remaining funds.  Votes like these are never easy, and I understand we can rationalize that our vote will have no effect, whether we approve or disapprove the resolution of disapproval. But we need to stand with, frankly, President Bush and President Obama, two leaders elected by our country, in different elections, who have both said to us, This program may not be something we want to do, but it is something that we must do.  And, because of that, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the resolution of disapproval.  I am pleased to yield to my friend, the gentlelady from North Carolina.
