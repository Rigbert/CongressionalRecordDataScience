President, I am delighted to join with my friend and colleague, Senator Johnson, in introducing the Veterans' Higher Education Opportunities Act of 2000. This legislation will provide our veterans with expanded educational opportunities at a reasonable cost. Endorsed by the 47-member Partnership for Veterans Education, our legislation provides a new model for today's GI bill that is logical, fair, and worthy of a nation that values both higher education and our veterans.  The original GI bill was enacted in 1944. As a result of this initiative, 7.8 million World War II veterans were able to take advantage of postservice education and training opportunities, including more than 2 million veterans who went on to college. My own father was among those veterans who served bravely in World War II and then came back home to resume his education with assistance from the GI bill.  Since that time, various incarnations of the G.I. Bill have continued to assist millions of veterans in taking advantage of the educational opportunities they put on hold in order to serve their country. New laws were enacted to provide educational assistance to those who served in Korea and Vietnam, as well as to those who served during the period in-between. Since the change to an all-volunteer service, additional adjustments to these programs were made, leading up to the enactment of the Montgomery G.I. Bill in 1985.  The value of the educational benefit assistance provided by the Montgomery G.I. Bill, however, has greatly eroded over time due to inflation and the escalating cost of higher education. Military recruiters indicate that the program's benefits no longer serve as a strong incentive to join the military; nor do they serve as a retention tool valuable enough to persuade men and women to stay in the military and defer the full or part-time pursuit of their higher education until a later date. Perhaps most important, the program is losing its value as an instrument for readjustment into civilian life after military service.  This point really hit home for me when I recently met with representatives of the Maine State Approving Agency (SAA) for Veterans Education Programs. They told me of the ever increasing difficulties that service members are having in using the G.I. Bill's benefits for education and training.  For example, the Maine representatives told me that the majority of today's veterans are married and have children. Yet, the Montgomery G.I. Bill often does not cover the cost of tuition to attend a public institution, let alone the other costs associated with the pursuit of higher education and those required to help support a family.  In fact, in constant dollars, with one exception, the current G.I. Bill provides the lowest level of assistance ever to those who served in the defenseof our country. The basic benefit program of the Vietnam Era G.I. Bill provided $493 per month in 1981 to a veteran with a spouse and two children. Twenty years later, a veteran in identical circumstances receives only $43 more, a mere 8% increase over a time period when inflation has nearly doubled, and a dollar buys only half of what it once purchased.  To address these problems, we are offering a modern version of the Montgomery G. I. Bill. This new model establishes a sensible, easily understood benchmark for G.I. Bill benefits. The benchmark sets G.I. Bill benefits at ``the average monthly costs of tuition and expenses for commuter students at public institutions of higher education that award baccalaureate degrees.'' This commonsense provision would serve as the foundation upon which future education stipends for all veterans would be based and would set benefits at a level sufficient to provide veterans the education promised to them at recruitment.  The current G.I. Bill now provides nine monthly $536 stipends per year for four years. The total benefit is $19,296. Under the new benchmark established by this legislation, the monthly stipend for the this academic year would be $975, producing a new total benefit of $35,100 for the four academic years.  Mr. President, today's G.I. Bill is woefully under-funded and does not provide the financial support necessary for our veterans to meet their educational goals. The legislation that we are proposing would fulfill the promise made to our nation's veterans, help with recruiting and retention of men and women in our military, and reflect current costs of higher education. Now is the time to enact these modest improvements to the basic benefit program of the Montgomery G.I. Bill.  I urge all members of the Senate to join Senator Johnson and myself in support of the Veterans' Higher Education Opportunities Act.                                 ______                                       By
