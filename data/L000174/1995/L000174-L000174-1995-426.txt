President, I want to bring to your attention that June is National Dairy Month.  Earlier this month I was in Vermont during the Enosburg Falls Dairy Festival in Franklin County, VT, home of some of the finest dairy farms and dairy products in America.  June 1, 1995, was Dairy Day in Montpelier, the State capital. There was a grand celebration with cows on the State house lawn and a milking contest. It was the first chance for Vermont's new agriculture commissioner, Leon Graves, a dairy farmer himself, to show his expertise. And while the celebration is light hearted and fun, there is a serious side to it.  In Vermont we stop and take the time to celebrate the importance of dairy farmers in our State and the importance of milk in our lives. In Vermont we pay tribute to the men and women of America who get up so early in the morning to milk the cows and bring us the safest, most wholesome supply of milk in all the world. I think we should pay tribute here in Washington, too.  We should also remember how important dairy products are to American culture and to the diet of Americans.  Little League games just would not be the same without the promise of a trip to the drive-in for a cone after the game. The Indy 500 winner still drinks milk in victory lane and cookouts would not be the same without a sizzling burger topped by a slice of cheddar.  More important than the enjoyment we get from dairy products, is the nutrition we get from dairy products. There are some who try to hurt the image of milk and others who distort the truth about the nutritional value of milk, but the facts cannot be denied.  Milk is a nutrient dense food that is an important part of the American diet. Milk and dairy foods supply 75 percent of the calcium in the U.S. food supply as well as substantial amounts of riboflavin, protein, potassium, vitamin B 12, zinc, magnesium, and vitamins A and B 6. Some might argue that calcium can be gained through fortified foods or taking calcium supplements. While these alternatives can supply calcium, research has shown that people who have low calcium intakes also have low intakes of several other nutrients which can be supplied by dairy foods. A recent report from the National Institutes of Health recommends that ``the preferred source of calcium is through calcium rich foods such as dairy products.''  Adequate calcium intake is especially critical for young women. Building optimal bone mass before age 30 is one of the best ways to prevent osteoporosis later in life. Increasingly, we see young women failing to get the calcium they need. In addition, nutrients from dairy products are keys to preventing high blood pressure, which increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, and renal failure.  Many Americans are becoming more conscious about their diets. It is important that people not eliminate nutritious foods such as dairy foods from their diets as they attempt to reduce fat intake. A wide array of dairy foods come in low fat and nonfat versions, while delivering the same amount of nutrients. Research has shown that people can increase dairy food consumption to recommended levels without gaining weight or increasing blood cholesterol.  I will not talk about policy or politics today except to add we need to keep the importance of dairy products in mind as we consider changes to our nutrition programs. And we need to remember the hard working men and women who bring us nature's most perfect food as we craft our dairy policy this year during the farm bill.  I do not often rise to talk about commemorative days, weeks, or months. But I hope my colleagues will join with me in raising the awareness of Americans about good nutrition and expressing our appreciation to America's dairy farmers for their hard work.                          ____________________
