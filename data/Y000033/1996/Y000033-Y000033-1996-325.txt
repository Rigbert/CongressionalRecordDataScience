Mr. Speaker, on May 15, 1996 the House Resources Committee held an oversight hearing on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's baiting regulations under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. One of our witnesses was George Reiger of Locustville, VA who is the conservation editor of Field and Stream. An avid reader of his monthly column, I was honored to hear this man with outstanding conservation and private property rights credentials give one of the more blunt and informative statements ever made before a congressional committee.  George Reiger and I both remember the day when Federal wildlife law enforcement agents and policies were more practical and less confrontational. Mr. Reiger's testimony stated, ``I've seen Federal law enforcement agents increasingly pursue policies that have done little or nothing to increase the flocks, but which have succeeded in driving many ordinarily law-abiding hunters from the field, including landowners who once invested considerable assets in migratory bird management, but who are now no longer willing for fear of violating a law no one understands.''  I urge my colleagues to read Mr. Reiger's testimony to learn about problems associated with the current baiting regulations and possible ways to improve this situation. Testimony by George Reiger, Conservation Editor of Field & Stream, at  the Congressional Hearing on Migratory Bird Baiting Regulations, May                                 15, 1996       My name is George Reiger. I've been conservation editor of      Field & Stream for 22 years. During that time, I've watched      languid leadership in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service      improvise management policies that brought most migratory      birds, and ducks in particular, to historic population lows.      At the same time, I've seen Federal law enforcement agents      increasingly pursue policies that have done little or nothing      to increase the flocks, but which have succeeded in driving      many ordinarily law-abiding hunters from the field, including      landowners who once invested considerable assets in migratory      bird management, but who are now no longer willing for fear      of violating a law no one understands.       The Migratory Bird Treaty Act gives the Federal Government      the right to tell sportsmen when they can hunt migratory      birds and how many per day or season they can shoot, but not      the time of day, gauge of shotgun or other, what are normally      considered, ethical options. Such matters should be for      sportsmen's clubs and personal conscience to determine.       Unfortunately, we live in a legalistic society, and lawyers      have little faith in the power of personal conscience. As a      result, and beginning in the 1920s, we've created a spectrum      of moralistic rules to regulate migratory bird hunters which      have little, if any, value for scientific management of the      birds. The most arbitrary and capricious of these rules      concern baiting. Incredibly, the Fish and Wildlife Service      is now considering expanding these rules to include      [quote] ``the manipulation of native vegetation in wetland      habitats'' [end quote]. Thus, pasture owners in the      Southeast who have been burning hydric soil areas for more      than 130 years to attract snipe for hunting may shortly be      prosecuted for doing so under federal law. Likewise, duck      hunters in the West who cut cattails and bulrush in order      to open up holes in the marsh and to provide themselves      with material for making blinds could be charged with      baiting.       Although career opportunism undoubtedly underlies some      abuses by federal law enforcement agents, I'm willing to give      most agents the benefit of the doubt by assuming their      excessive zeal is a function of their having watched the Fish      and Wildlife Service underwrite the collapse of continental      duck populations in the 1980s and now claim that only      partially recovered stocks are so fully recovered that we can      shoot them at daily rates exceeding those we had even in the      1950s, when we really had ducks.       One result has been a no-warning law enforcement policy.      Agents stake out allegedly      baited ponds and fields and then wait until the maximum      number of ducks or doves are killed before beginning to write      summonses. Shouldn't the agents themselves be liable for      prosecution when they have the authority to stop illegal      shooting but do nothing until the worse-case scenarios are      acted out?       Since many of the people cited for baiting are hunting as      guests and are not even aware of the subtle difference      between ``feeding,'' which is legal, and ``baiting,'' which      is illegal, they often give up hunting, and the conservation      dollars they once generated through their purchase of hunting      licenses, bird stamps and excise taxes on firearms and      ammunition is lost to wildlife management. Adding insult to      injury, the reputation of hunters gets another kick in the      head every time a sensational headline about a ``baiting      bust'' hits the evening news.       That's why I recommend that Congress replace the deadend      policies of the Fish and Wildlife Service with a requirement      that federal agents must notify landowners of properties      managed for wildlife in advance of the hunting season when      there is some question of baiting. To prevent these federal      agents from shutting down properties willy-nilly, they must      work with and have the approval to post a property off-limits      to hunters by a state conservation officer. If bait is merely      dumped out after the season begins, state or federal agents      will continue to have the right to cite such obvious      violations.       This prevention-oriented approach would have several      positive results:       First, the policy constitutes genuine conservation; SWAT      team and commando tactics do not. With few, if any, innocent      bystanders caught up in stings, the hunting tradition will be      better served and its wellspring of conservation dollars      better preserved.       Second, by avoiding confrontation and headlines, federal      agents would recover some measure of the respect they've lost      among many sportsmen.       Third, a policy of prevention will ultimately result in      fewer baiting violations, because the states will develop a      clearer interpretation of the rules than federal agents, many      of whom feel they have no need to maintain good relations      with local citizens.       For too many decades, hunters have been haunted by baiting      regulations in which they've borne a burden of strict      liability. It's long past time, both for the sake of hunting      as well as for the birds themselves, to make diplomacy the      number one priority of wardens and to shift the burden of      proof and intent back to the government where it belongs.       Thank you.                          ____________________
