  First, I am happy to hear the Senator from North Carolina mention the prescription drug program has to be within the context of a fiscally sound budget process. I agree with that. But I think that is very much an argument for a piece of legislation that is permanent as the tripartisan plan is, as opposed to a sunsetted provision coming from the other side of the aisle that is $370 billion as opposed to $595 billion, the latter being the figure from the other side of the aisle. Just basically getting more for your money in the sense that CBO has scored the tripartisan program as the only program that brings down drug prices because of competition and the efficiency with which they are delivered as opposed to the program on the other side of the aisle that is very much a partisan plan as opposed to our bipartisan plan that drives up the price of drugs according to the CBO, which is our nonpartisan scoring arm.  Also, for the benefit of the Senator from Massachusetts who is still here and my colleague from the State of Iowa who is not here, I go back to the assets test. I think they think they have something. But the point of the matter is, they do not. We have heard these repeated objections to the assets test for low-income benefits in our bill as if it is something new. That is a red herring. There has been an assets test for low-income Medicare populations since 1987, and I happen to know that these programs passed by overwhelming margins--under the qualified Medicare beneficiary program as one example, as a specified Medicare beneficiary program as a second--and these programs have passed overwhelmingly with the support of my Democrat friends on the other side of the aisle.  I think that is injecting an argument into the program that is not legitimate. Current law excludes from the test the home and property it is on, a car that is necessary. I can also say it happened to be in the 1999 Clinton Medicare bill--that included an assets test as well.
