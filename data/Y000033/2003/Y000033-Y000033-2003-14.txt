Madam Chairman, if the gentleman is referring topage 35, the Bluefin and the M/V Coastal Merchant, I do believe this applies as long as it is retroactive. We do not go back and disown them. We have to probably allow them to continue to operate as American-flagged vessels, these two vessels. There are only two vessels mentioned in the bill.
