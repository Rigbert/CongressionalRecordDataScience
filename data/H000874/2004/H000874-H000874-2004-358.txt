Leader, let me correct for the record because I was in error, it is my understanding that Mr. Kahn has been told, who is our chief clerk on the Budget Committee. I am sure that the gentleman from South Carolina now knows. I thank the leader for his comment. I wanted to clarify that, that we have received, apparently, notice.  Is it the majority leader's thought in light of the fact that we will be leaving next Friday for a 2-week break, district work period, that the conference report will be returned to the House next week? Would it be the gentleman's expectation that we might take up the conference report next week?  Mr. DeLAY. Certainly we would like to reach an agreement with the Senate prior to our district work period. For that reason, Members really should anticipate a very long workweek next week, because we would want to give the House and Senate negotiators all the time that they need in order to hopefully get this done and passed by both Houses before we leave next week. I know that is asking a lot of Members, but it would be nice if we could get the budget done before we break for the district work period.
