President.  I will conclude by saying this: We owe it to the victims and their families and to the American people and the American taxpayers to get honest answers about what went wrong with Katrina, and to put people in charge to make certain that we don't waste the billions of dollars that are going to be spent in this reconstruction effort. Putting Karl Rove in charge makes no sense whatsoever. He has no resume and no skills other than running political campaigns. If he is being put in place to protect the President politically, that decision does not serve the best interests of the American people nor the victims of Hurricane Katrina.  It is time to get to the bottom of this. If Congress will not have an honest investigation of what happened with Hurricane Katrina, we need to have this nonpartisan, independent commission like the 9/11 Commission to answer the questions about what went wrong and to make certain that we don't replicate those mistakes in the expenditure of these funds in the future.  I yield the floor.
