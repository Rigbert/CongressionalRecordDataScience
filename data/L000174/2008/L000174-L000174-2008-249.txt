President, I wish to thank my good friend, the Senator from Tennessee. As the Senator knows, he came to chat with me about this nominee. I was not aware of him. But as soon as he did, I pulled the file, looked at him, and I think we put him on for a hearing very shortly thereafter.  I thank the Senator from Tennessee. I have respected his opinion and hisviews for years, whether he was in the Cabinet or here, and was happy to in this case. I also wish to thank him for the kind words he said about me, as well as those of Senator Isakson and Senator Lincoln and Senator Pryor.  Mr. President, I have a longer statement to make, but I understand the distinguished Republican leader wishes to speak.  I ask unanimous consent that I yield to the distinguished leader without losing my right to the floor, if that is agreeable to him.
