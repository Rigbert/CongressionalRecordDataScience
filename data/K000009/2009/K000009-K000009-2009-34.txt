Speaker, America faces a vital decision to improve health care for all, both its quality and affordability. But follow the money. Ask yourself, Who's making the big bucks off the current arrangement? Aren't you tired of all those expensive medicine ads on TV? If you weren't sick before you watch them you're sick afterwards.  Pharmaceutical companies are the third most profitable industry in our country. They don't even manufacture most of those medicines here anymore. They outsourced them long ago. And their CEOs grab millions of dollars a year in salaries and bonuses from our middle class that's struggling more each year just to pay for insurance. And the insurance companies? They're raking in your health insurance dollars too. They don't deliver an ounce of care, but they've become the ninth most profitable industry in our country. Go to any state capital. Who owns the highest buildings in those towns? Insurance companies. That says it all. America needs quality, affordable health care, not insurance and pharmaceutical kingdoms.                          ____________________
