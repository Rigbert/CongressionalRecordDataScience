President, I am going to speak in favor of the commonsense amendment brought to us by Senators Bingaman and Feinstein. Before I do, though, if I could make a couple personal comments.  I have been in the Senate for 31 years. I came at a time when there was a real effort for Republicans and Democrats to work together, and for White Houses to do so. I have been here during the administrations of President Ford, President Carter, both terms of President Reagan, President George H.W. Bush, both terms of President Clinton, and now into the second term of President George W. Bush.  I have seen terrific majority leaders in both parties, leaders in both parties. Senator Mansfield, Senator Scott, Senator Byrd, Senator Baker, Senator Dole, Senator Mitchell, obviously Senator Daschle. I think of all the times they would work so closely to bring people together.
