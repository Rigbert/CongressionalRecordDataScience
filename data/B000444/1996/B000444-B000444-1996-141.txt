 President, the city of Washington, DC, is blessed this week with the presence of some of the most dedicated people in America--its teachers. Each state's Teacher of the Year is visiting Washington to be honored for their top notch work in educating our children.  As a husband of a teacher, I know how some people view the teaching profession. I have heard all of the jokes. And, I have read the articles--including some recent ones--deriding the Nation's teaching force and claiming that teachers are the root of our educational problems.  Well, Mr. President, the Teachers of the Year that are here this week should dispel those myths. These teachers are simply among the best and the brightest our Nation has to offer.  For most of us, there was at least one teacher along the way who touched us, who motivated us, who inspired us. A teacher who was more than just a body at the blackboard. For students in the Indian River School District in my State of Delaware, one of those teachers is Darryl Hudson. He is Delaware's Teacher of the Year, and I want to congratulate him and take just few minutes to honor him.  Mr. Hudson--named the top teacher among over 6,000 public school teachersin Delaware--teaches seventh grade science at Sussex Central Middle School in Millsboro, DE. And, although I have never experienced his teaching first hand, I think the biggest testament about what he does in the classroom comes from what his fellow teachers say about him. They talk admiringly of the energy he brings to school each day, of his dedication to educating all children, and of the uplifting inspiration he provides to staff, parents, and most importantly, the students.  But, as is the case with many teachers, Mr. Hudson's involvement in and dedication to education go beyond the classroom. He is a cooperative teacher for Salisbury State University students, a member of the New Directions Educator Corps, and a Mentor for a Wilmington College student.  I should also note that we in Delaware are proud that Mr. Hudson is a product of our own higher education system. In fact, he and I are both Fightin' Blue Hens. For my colleagues who do not know, that means we are both graduates of the University of Delaware. He received his masters degree from Wilmington College. And, at the same time he is teaching seventh graders--a daunting task in and of itself, in my view--he continues to pursue his own education at Salisbury State University just across the Delaware border in Maryland.  Mr. President, a moment ago, I mentioned the way in which a teacher has inspired almost every one of us. And, to give you a perfect illustration of the power of a teacher to mold a mind and build a citizen, Mr. Hudson--a teacher--was himself inspired by a teacher. He says that his sixth grade teacher had more influence on him than anyone else outside his immediate family. And, now, he is having that same influence on countless others.  Again, I want to congratulate Darryl Hudson on his selection as Delaware Teacher of the Year.                          ____________________
