 Randy Smith, the longtime executive director of the London-Laurel County Chamber of Commerce, died on November 19, 2010, at the age of 52 years old. For almost 17 years, Randy led the chamber and the entire community toward a stronger, fast-growing future. More than promoting the local businesses in the area, Randy dedicated his professional life to advancing the untapped potential and unique splendor of his community. He had the skills, personality, and intelligence to accomplish nearly everything he undertook--from creating some of the best civic events and festivals in the Commonwealth, to building a stronger chamber membership at a time when many small businesses are struggling.  There is no doubt that Randy's good humor will be deeply missed by all who knew him. But let there also be no doubt that Randy's record of accomplishment and legacy in Laurel County will never fade. The tenacity with which he fought his cancer for more than a year displayed the same trademark character that I have seen in him during our friendship of over a decade. No matter the issue, Randy Smith could be counted on to handle the challenge with the utmost integrity.  It is with a saddened heart that I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering the life and accomplishments of one of the Commonwealth's true unsung heroes. I would further ask that my colleagues join me in expressing our deepest sympathies to his wife Kim and their children Logan, Cameron, and Brianna. I would also like to share my sympathies with Randy's parents, Earl and Rosie Smith, as well as his brothers and sister, Phil and Eddie Smith and Sharon Benge.  The Sentinel Echo recently published a story remembering the life of Randy Smith and I ask unanimous consent that the text of that article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:                 [From the Sentinel Echo, Dec. 3, 2010]                  Randy Smith Loses Battle With Cancer                     (By Nita Johnson/Staff Writer)       Laurel County, Ky.--Long-time London-Laurel County Chamber      of Commerce Executive Director Randy Smith lost his battle      with cancer Friday morning, leaving a legacy of dedication to      his community.       Ironically, Smith died the day of the 2010 Christmas on      Main events--a celebration he was instrumental in starting in      1994, the first year he was named the Chamber's executive      director.       According to his brother Phil, Smith died just after noon      on Friday. He had been undergoing treatment for cancer at      M.D. Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas in      Houston since Nov. 2.       ``There was a medical team there waiting for him to undergo      radiation three days after we got here,'' Phil Smith said.      ``The treatments were to be completed Nov. 18 and Randy did      OK. He was getting around on a walker, went outside and was      doing well.''       But on Nov. 17, things took a turn for the worse.       ``Randy had a lung biopsy on Nov. 17 and it was very      challenging to him physically,'' Phil added. ``We were going      to come home on Nov. 18, with our reservations to fly out at      2:20 p.m. Randy was ready to roll but around lunchtime he      started having some shortness of breath. By that afternoon he      was in ICU (Intensive Care Unit) and diagnosed with      aspiration pneumonia. He was really struggling. He spent two      weeks and a day in ICU but his cancer was advanced and with      the pneumonia and becoming septic while in ICU, it was more      than his body could handle.''       Randy Smith's wife, Kim, children, parents, two brothers      and their families were with him on Friday. Most of them had      been there since Thanksgiving.       Randy Smith began having health complications in the spring      of 2009. In August 2009 he was diagnosed with lung cancer and      later on, with bone cancer. But his fighting spirit prevailed      throughout his illness--a trait that Phil Smith said enabled      his brother to fight the disease as long as he did.       ``Randy was a battler with his condition. He's always been      competitive and up for a challenge,'' Phil said. ``I guess he      saw the finish line God offered more rewarding than the      finish line here.''       His competitiveness is what many attribute to Smith's      success with the Chamber of Commerce, said Holbert Hodges,      who was president of the Chamber when Smith became a board      member.       ``I asked Randy to become a director and that's how he      became involved with the Chamber, as a board member/     director,'' Hodges said. ``He was the heart and soul of the      Chamber. He did a lot of things for this community and for      people, a lot that he didn't want people to know about. He      was dedicated, a hard worker, a good family man. When help      was needed, Randy was always the first in line. He had all      the traits necessary to represent the Chamber and was the      steadying force behind its success.''       Hodges said hearing of Smith's passing caused many memories      to surface.       ``I'm just sitting here having memories of Randy,'' Hodges      said from his office on Friday afternoon. ``We worked      together through many good and bad times and he was the      steadying force. His energy level amazed me. He's going to be      missed.''       Hodges said Smith was the driving force behind the annual      Christmas on Main celebration.       ``We wanted it to be more than just a parade and we came up      with the idea to set up bleachers in front of the courthouse      for choruses and choirs and to involve the schools and      churches,'' Hodges said. ``We wanted it so kids and      grandparents and parents and aunts and uncles could come out.      It was very successful.''       Under Smith's leadership, the Chamber of Commerce sponsored      many other events. The annual Red, White and Boom      Independence Day celebration was instituted under Smith's      helm at the Chamber. The annual Chamber banquet, which      honored a local teacher from the elementary, middle and high      school levels along with local business people, received      great acclaim.       The Chamber also sponsored job fairs, career fairs, and      most recently, the ``Women in Business'' awards. Though some      of those programs have changed or are now under management by      the Chamber's Ambassador Club and the London Downtown      organization, Smith was the man who pushed these events to      success.       Willie Sawyers, Sentinel-Echo publisher and Chamber of      Commerce board member, knew Smith since elementary school and      worked on various committees involved with the Chamber of      Commerce.       ``Randy and I are the same age. We went to school together,      played basketball for many years and served on the Chamber      together,'' Sawyers said. ``We had a lot of personal      conversations about dreams and goals for our community. I      will greatly miss those conversations with him.       ``Many of the good things happening right now in London and      Laurel County are directly attributable to Randy's dedication      and enthusiasm.''       This sentiment was seconded by London City Mayor Troy      Rudder, who tearfully praised Smith and his contributions to      the city and county.       ``We are extremely sad for the loss of Randy,'' Rudder      said. ``He has been very influential in the growth and      prosperity of this city. Randy was one who was always willing      to work or volunteer. When it came to this community, Randy      was always the first one in line.''       ``My heart goes out to his family and this city is deeply      saddened,'' he added.       Funeral arrangements are incomplete, and will be announced      later.                          ____________________
