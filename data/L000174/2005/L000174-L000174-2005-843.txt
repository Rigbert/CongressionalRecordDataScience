These proud, strong, and intelligent men and women of the 86th Brigade were activated for service in the Middle East. In some of the most moving series of events I have experienced as Senator, these Vermonters separated from loved ones at various sendoff ceremonies all across the State. They formed into ranks and marched off for training and, eventually, for war. In mobilizing for service, they joined almost 200 members of Vermont's Green Mountain Boys who just returned from their yearlong deployment to Iraq. Watching over this moving sendoff and standing as a strong, intelligent, and assuring presence was the Adjutant General of the State of Vermont, MG Martha Rainville.  Superbly carrying out her responsibilities as Vermont's senior military leader, General Rainville has ensured that these units, as well as any deploying Vermont Guard company, squadron, or detachment, have had the best preparation possible. She always tries to make certain that the Vermont National Guard has the resources to carry out any mission, whether at home or abroad. At the same time, General Rainville has a special empathy for her soldiers and airmen, working to comfort them during the inevitable pains of family separation.  I am very proud that General Rainville has recently been reelected by the Vermont Legislature to the position of Vermont Adjutant General and that, late last year, she was recognized as Vermonter of the Year by the Burlington Free Press, one of Vermont's largest circulation newspapers. General Rainville is a consummate professional, skilled leader, and caring human being. She has had a noticeable effect on the readiness of the 4,000 members of the Vermont National Guard and has become a critical part of the leadership of the entire National Guard, one of our Nation's most cherished institutions. These recognitions are representative of all the Guard members, families, and employers from Vermont who are making huge sacrifices for the war efforts.  Martha Rainville assumed the position of Adjutant General of the State of Vermont in 1997. She gained valuable experience and understanding of the military from her service as a commander of the maintenance unit of the 158th Fighter Wing of the Vermont Air National Guard. When she stood up and said she was ready to take the reigns of the entire Guard, she promised to bring a fresh approach to tackling the Guard's tasks and challenges.  From the first day, General Rainville has brought a careful yet energetic approach to her position. She pays close attention to the day-to-day operations of the Vermont Guard, yet gives her commanders the flexibility to do the job right. This ability to balance small details with a sense of the larger picture has enabled the Vermont National Guard to respond so well to its real-world missions after September 11. From 24-hour air patrols to increasing security along the northern border to deploying for the war in Iraq, the Vermont Guard has responded well due in part to General Rainville's leadership.  Vermont Adjutant General Martha Rainville is a credit to the National Guard, the State of Vermont, and the country as a whole. I am so proud to have seen her move through the ranks in Vermont and assume her critically important role. I know she will continue to provide strong leadership to our proud citizen-soldiers, and I believe she deserves our gratitude, our congratulations, and our thanks.                          ____________________[Page S1862]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]               VERMONT ADJUTANT GENERAL MARTHA RAINVILLE
