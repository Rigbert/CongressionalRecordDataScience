President, I wish to commend Coastal Ridge Elementary School in York, ME, on being named a 2015 National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence. This year, Coastal Ridge Elementary was one of only 335 schools across the country and one of only two schools from Maine to receive this prestigious recognition of high accomplishment by the U.S. Department of Education.  Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon Schools Award honors schools that are either academically superior in their States or that demonstrate significant gains in student achievement. The schools singled out for this national recognition are models of high educational standards and accountability.  This award recognizes Coastal Ridge Elementary as a model of excellence and high achievement. The students' success can be attributed to the school's focus on creating a healthy climate where adults model respect and selflessness. Principal Sean Murphy noted that while the award is based on exemplary test scores in math and reading, the school's emphasis on the arts, sciences, and social development has contributed to the students' overall achievement.  I am pleased that the U.S. Department of Education has selected Coastal Ridge Elementary School for this well-deserved honor and congratulate not only the students, but also the administrators, teachers, staff, and parents on this outstanding achievement. Together, they are making a difference in the lives of hundreds of students by helping them become energetic learners and engaged citizens.                          ____________________
