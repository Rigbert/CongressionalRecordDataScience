  Mr. McCAIN. Was the Senator aware that Senator Dole, former majority leader, has just announced his support of the treaty with the changes that have been made, which the Senator from Delaware was able to achieve in this agreement? I think this is a very important expression of support and one that I feel will be very much respected by our colleagues on both sides of the aisle.  Also, I was curious, for purposes of the time, how much longer the Senator from Delaware statement will be?
