 It all happens to be reflected in the budget debate of the last 4 days, the amendments offered by the other side, the absence of a comprehensive balanced budget alternative from the other side. And I think it will be demonstrated by the overwhelming vote for a balanced budget tomorrow.  Now, the President of the United States, on the other hand, missed the boat. His party is still standing on the dock. He stranded them there. He asked them to wait there until he could catch up with the ship out at sea, but it is too late. We Republicans have a vision and we have a plan to steer this country to the safe waters.  I ask, where is theirs? Where is their comprehensive alternative plan to balance the budget? Where is their coherent vision? Where is theirs?  It is lacking. I yield the floor.
