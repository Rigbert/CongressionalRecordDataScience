President, I want to associate myself with what the distinguished Senator from Oregon has said. My concerns--and they will be in my full statement about Mr. Pompeo--are his suggestions in the past of sweeping authority for the government to collect bulk information on all Americans; that is, every American in this room, every American in this city, and every American in this country. We have strong bipartisan legislation that we have worked for years on, trying toget Republicans and Democrats across the political spectrum to set into law what the rules should be. His statements show that he wants to throw it all overboard. So I have concerns.  Mr. President, our intelligence agencies have an enormous task ahead.
