 President, I rise today to submit a resolution to establish ``Endangered Species Day'' on March 8, 2006. I am submitting this resolution with Senators Chafee, Clinton, and Crapo whose co-sponsorship I greatly appreciate.  Additionally, I want to commend my constituent Mr. David Robinson for suggesting the establishment of an ``Endangered Species Day.'' I have appreciated his hard work and dedication. Individuals like Mr. Robinson do make a difference.  The designation of an ``Endangered Species Day'' provides a multitude of opportunities for young people, students, and the general public to learn more about endangered species in both our country and abroad. It is my hope that establishing an ``Endangered Species Day'' encourages schools, civic organizations, agencies, and businesses to educate the general public about the threats to and our efforts to restore these precious species in our midst. I believe that ``Endangered Species Day'' will foster increased communication and awareness about many of the most endangered species by encouraging such activities as school field trips to the zoo or attending a lecture at the local library.  With the recent discovery of the once thought to be extinct Ivory-billed Woodpecker in Arkansas and the Mount Diablo Buckwheat in California, I think this is an opportune moment to highlight the success of many of our conservation efforts. For example, in my home State of California, I am especially proud of the conservation and management efforts that have helped significantly restore populations of California condor, winter run chinook salmon, the least Bell's vireo songbird, and the California gray whale.  Despite these success stories, we need to be aware that more needs to be done. At this time, we have more than 1,000 species in the U.S. and abroad, which are designated as ``at risk'' for extinction. One small step is to increase awareness about the seriousness of the circumstances facing many of these endangered species and educating the public about these species.  I am introducing this bill with the hope that ``Endangered Species Day'' can spark the wonder and interest in our youth to continue the conservation efforts we have begun but still are far from finishing.                          ____________________[Page S9308]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]   SENATE RESOLUTION 219--DESIGNATING MARCH 8, 2006, AS ``ENDANGERED    SPECIES DAY'', AND ENCOURAGING THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES TO    BECOME EDUCATED ABOUT, AND AWARE OF, THREATS TO SPECIES, SUCCESS   STORIES IN SPECIES RECOVERY, AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROMOTE SPECIES                          CONSERVATION WORLDWIDE
