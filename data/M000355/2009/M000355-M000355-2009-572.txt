 President, I rise today to honor a well-respected Kentuckian, Mr. David Stevens. Mr. Stevens's outstanding dedication to public service is truly immeasurable, as is his devotion to our Commonwealth.  Recently the Lexington Herald-Leader in Lexington, KY, published a story about Mr. Stevens. The story highlights not only the major initiatives he took as a Lexington-Fayette urban county councilman, but the keen sense of humor that contributed to his significant presence in Kentucky. Mr. Stevens's noteworthy pursuit as a public servant is a true testament of his devotion to not only Kentucky, but his loyalty to our great Nation.  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Mr. David Stevens as a true patriot and Kentuckian whose dedication to his city will be long remembered. I further ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, Dec. 15, 2008]      Modest Stevens' Impact Seen In Smoking Ban, Sunday Drinking                            (By Michelle Ku)       David Stevens isn't exactly a household name in Lexington,      but the modest man's work has had a huge impact on the city.       Thanks largely to Stevens, Lexingtonians can drink a little      longer on Sundays but can't light up a cigarette inside a      workplace.       Stevens, 79, leaves the Urban County Council this month      after 15 years.       He has served three terms as an at-large councilman and one      term as the District 5 representative. He chose not to seek      re-election for his district seat.       He has been involved in many of the major initiatives in      Lexington over the last 15 years.       Stevens pushed to extend the hours of Sunday alcohol sales      and expanded who was eligible to sell. He helped develop the      city's farmland preservation program, the Town & Gown      Commission and ethics code.       But what he will be most remembered for is the passage and      implementation of Kentucky's first smoke-free law. Since      Lexington's was passed in 2003, 20 other Kentucky communities      have enacted some type of a smoke-free law or regulation.       Stevens is probably the most significant Lexington figure,      said former Vice Mayor Mike Scanlon.       ``If you look at any councilman who has ever served, or any      mayor who's ever served, I don't think that there's anybody      who's going to leave a bigger footprint on Lexington than      David Stevens.''       Stevens' departure will leave very large shoes to fill      because of his institutional knowledge of Lexington dating      back to the writing of the city-county charter, Scanlon said.      ``The council changes all the damn time, but the government      is going to be changing because David's leaving.''       Last month, the council approved the first revision to      Lexington's smoking ban.       Stevens engineered the revision, which extended the ban to      all workplaces, not just those open to the public, and closed      a loophole that had allowed smoking in bingo halls.       ``Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights calls Lexington's law      the shot heard round the world,'' said Ellen Hahn, director      of the Kentucky Center for Smoke-Free Policy. ``It was so      landmark because this region, including the other tobacco      states, really lagged behind the rest of the country.''       Many people think the smoking ban was his biggest      accomplishment while on council, Stevens said. While it      certainly got the most attention, ``the other things are of      equal importance.''       The parks master plan he worked on with former Councilwoman      Sandy Shafer was important even though the city has never      been able give parks enough funding, Stevens said.       Much of his work on council was done with a vision for      Lexington that's 50 years out, said Councilwoman Linda      Gorton. ``That was obvious when he helped write the charter      and helped with merger. It will take that long for much of      his beautification efforts on the city's corridors to grow.''       In addition to the legislation he sponsored, Stevens will      be remembered for his dry wit. He has a penchant for      delivering a well-timed one-liner.       For example, during Stevens' final budget and finance      committee meeting last Tuesday, the council discussed the      city's projected budget shortfall in the next fiscal year.       ``I will be happy to forgo any salary for next year,''      Stevens said to a round of chuckles.       Stevens plans to remain active in the community and city      government despite his retirement from the council.       He wants to continue his work on the corridors committee,      including a project to add sidewalks to Tates Creek Road from      Lakewood Drive to New Circle Road. Neighbors are opposed to      the idea.       ``I'm determined to get those sidewalks down Tates Creek,''      he said.       Also, he wants to complete a project he began several years      ago to document discussions that took place on the commission      that drafted the city's charter. He had the audio tapes from      those meetings transcribed, but still has to review the tapes      to identify the speakers, he said.       Outside of city government, Stevens will continue on as the      president of the Blue Grass Council of the Boy Scouts of      America and board chairman of the Kentucky Blood Center. He      also wants to finish fund-raising for a children's garden at      the Arboretum on Alumni Drive.       His one regret while on the council was not pushing as hard      as he could have for a dedicated tax for the parks      department. When parks explored the idea six years ago,      Stevens was running for his third term as an at-large      councilman.       ``I thought if I spent all my time working on the parks      referendum, I might not get re-elected,'' Stevens said. ``I      feel kind of bad about that. I let the people in the parks      down.''       Being on the council is a lot like playing a game of golf,      Stevens said.       ``When you play a game of golf, you're only going to hit      three or four perfect shots out of the 70 in every round,''      he said. ``It's the same on the council, you know, you're not      going to hit every one just right.''                          ____________________
