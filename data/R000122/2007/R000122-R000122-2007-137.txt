President, it has been a remarkable process putting this bill together, principally because of the staff of the subcommittee on both sides. I wish to particularly thank Christina Evans, B.G. Wright, and Chad Schulken for the majority, and Dennis Balkham, Chris Heggem, and Yvonne Stone for the minority for their hard work and cooperative effort to produce this bill.  I believe the 2008 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill is an excellent piece of legislation, one that is needed now, not later. It is needed to fund programs that are crucial to our national defense, to the defense of the Nation, and to the well-being of our veterans. I hope and urge that the Senate quickly pass this bill.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
