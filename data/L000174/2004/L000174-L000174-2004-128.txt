President, for the advice of my colleagues, I have been notified that the majority leader wishes to go soon to the Foreign Operations appropriations bill. The floor manager for the majority will be Senator McConnell of Kentucky. I will floor manage for the Democratic side. Obviously, it will be up to the distinguished majority leader when the bill will actually be laid down. I just wanted to notify colleagues, I have been informedwe are about to go to it. I would hope as most of the issues on it have been worked out on a bipartisan fashion that we could move quickly. I know Senators may have amendments, but if we do soon go on this bill and allow Members to bring forward their amendments on this side, I would urge them to let us know what, if any, there are so we could seek time agreements once the bill is laid down.  I see the distinguished senior Senator from Ohio on the floor.  I wanted to make the observation that once the leader turns to this bill, I would hope Members, certainly on our side of the aisle--I would use the privilege of having been here 30 years to urge Members of the other side of the aisle--would speak to the appropriate leaders if they have amendments and see if there are things that can be worked out without a rollcall or can be worked out with a time agreement.  I yield the floor.
