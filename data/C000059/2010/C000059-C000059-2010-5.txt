Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the American people, and we deserve an answer about these out-of-control spending policies coming here out of Washington, D.C.  The House has failed to produce a budget. No plans for any appropriation bills, no markups. There's no plan on how the majority will spend America's taxpayers' hard-earned money for this fiscal year, or next fiscal year.  American families, if they don't budget and pay the bills, there are real consequences. Unfortunately, the majority continues to turn a blind eye to future consequences as they push spending to a record $3.8 trillion in fiscal year 2011 and widen the deficit to a record $1.5 trillion this year.  House Republicans stand ready to make tough choices in order to rein in spending. Just last week we introduced a measure on the House floor to cut $2.5 billion in expanded welfare. The program was selected by almost a half a million Americans through the innovative YouCut initiative.  The American people have spoken. Stop the spending frenzy, budget for the future, and return fiscal sanity to Washington.                          ____________________
