Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, if we had entertained my unanimous consent request, we could have accomplished all that the gentleman from Oregon, the chairman of the committee, just discussed.  I will remind you that the reason Democrats voted against it was because you took the money for children's health out of children's health. You decreased the prevention trust fund by some $6 billion which had, in part, inoculation for children against disease. We thought robbing from Peter to pay Paul was not a good policy to pursue.
