President, my fellow Members of the U.S. Senate have heard me say this before, but today I have reason to say it again: Vermonters are some of the most innovative and hardworking people in this country. The U.S. Small Business Administration recently highlighted one of these great individuals when it named Rick Cochran of the Mobile Medical International Corporation in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, as the 2011National Small Business Person of the Year.  Mr. Cochran deserves this recognition for his many years of hard work building a successful small business that provides mobile, combat-ready shelter systems both in the U.S. and abroad. In collaboration with the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the U.S. Air Force, and others, Mr. Cochran and his team provide quality medical services to the many dedicated men and woman worldwide who put their lives at risk in the military. Mr. Cochran has also deployed mobile surgical units across the globe to developing countries, giving third world countries cost-effective mobile access to modern medical facilities.  From an otherwise nondescript industrial building in St. Johnsbury, Mobile Medical has touched the lives of thousands of people from across the globe. Whether the company is shipping units to the Middle East, deploying units with National Guard soldiers, or quickly delivering aid to communities devastated by natural disasters here at home, the men and women who have engineered and manufactured these mobile medical facilities have found a novel and cost-effective way to deliver state-of-the-art medical care in some of the world's most challenging environments. Just last week, I learned that Mobile Medical had already deployed mobile healthcare facilities to assist in the recovery efforts in Joplin, MO, following the catastrophic weather that left hundreds dead and thousands more injured.  Mr. Cochran and his staff have improved the lives of others both abroad and locally, as their business has created hundreds of job opportunities for Vermonters in our rural Northeast Kingdom. As a longtime supporter of Mobile Medical, I was pleased to see this locally owned business recognized for the great work it has done in Vermont and across the globe.  I continue to be proud of the many small businesses thriving across Vermont. And today I am especially proud of the work of one small business that has succeeded both financially and socially Mobile Medical International Corporation of St. Johnsbury, VT. I wish Rick and his business continued success in the future. I also ask that the May 20, 2011, U.S. Small Business Administration announcement of this award be printed in the Record.  The information follows:  Vermont Manufacturer of Mobile Health Care Units Is National Small                       Business Person of the Year                         [Friday, May 20, 2011]       Washington.--When Rick Cochran was working with five      employees in his basement in Walden, Vt., his dream was to      find a way to provide advanced medical care to underserved      areas, and build a company that could deliver it.       Today, the Vermont manufacturer of state-of-the-art mobile      healthcare and diagnostic units was named 2011 National Small      Business Person of the year by Karen Mills, Administrator of      the U.S. Small Business Administration. Mills made the      announcement during ceremonies at SBA's celebration of      National Small Business Week in Washington, D.C.       First runner-up is Deborah Carey, president and founder of      the New Glarus Brewing Company, in New Glarus in southwestern      Wisconsin. Second runner-up is Leigh Kamstra, owner and chef      of Roma's Ristorante in Spearfish, S.D., north of the Black      Hills.       ``The innovation, inspiration and determination shown by      Rick Cochran and his employees have elevated his company,      Mobile Medical International, to a level that is above and      beyond the norm,'' said Mills. ``These are the qualities that      make small businesses such a powerful force for job creation      in the American economy and in their local communities. Rick      had a dream and he persisted--creating jobs, winning the      loyalty of his team, and filling a need in the marketplace      that has taken Mobile Medical from his basement to a      worldwide stage. We are especially proud that when Rick      Cochran's company needed financing, he turned to the U.S.      Small Business Administration, and the SBA was able to help      him.       ``I applaud Rick and his team, and I applaud the runners-up      and their staffs, and all of the state small business persons      of the year who are here today,'' Mills said. ``We are all      grateful for their contributions to our economy. They are      magnificent examples of the character of America's most      successful entrepreneurs.''       The National Small Business Person of the Year and runners-     up were selected from among the state winners in 50 states,      the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands,      and Guam. All are being honored this week in Washington,      D.C., as part of National Small Business Week. The awards      were announced at today's National Awards Luncheon, sponsored      by Sam's Club at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel.       For Cochran the road began when he left a job at an      advanced medical equipment provider to establish his first      venture, Outpatient Services of America, a consulting firm      specializing in planning and developing ambulatory surgery      centers. His plan evolved in 1994, when he researched and      created an initial design for a mobile surgery unit and      established Mobile Medical International, working from his      basement with a staff of five. By 1995, he had the capital,      and by 1996, he had his prototype.       At first, he provided temporary solutions for hospitals      undergoing renovations, but he was able to expand the      business into broader commercial, military, and emergency      response applications worldwide. During one rough patch in      1999, much of his core team--inspired by Cochran's      perseverance, optimism and faith--worked without pay when      financing ran dry and the company nearly closed its doors.      They were reimbursed later, when the company rebounded. The      company also secured financing support from three SBA-backed      loans in 1997, 2005 and 2008.       MMI's products include mobile surgical hospitals built into      a semi-sized tractor-trailer and an inflatable hospital ward      that fits into a trailer pulled by a Humvee. To date, MMIC      has 22 mobile healthcare units in its product line, including      Mobile Breast Care Centers, Mobile Intensive Care, Mobile      Laboratory/Pharmacy, Mobile CT Scan/Dental/Ophthalmology,      Mobile Ophthalmology and Mobile Endoscopy Units.       Today, MMI's staff has grown to 54, and net income--just      $9,835 in 2008--rose in 2010 to $1.68 million on gross      revenues of more than $14 million.       First runner-up Carey developed her business plan for the      New Glarus Brewing Company while her husband Dan, a master      brewer, gathered the materials, grains and equipment needed      for start-up. In 1993 they negotiated to lease a warehouse in      New Glarus, exchanging the lease for stock in the company.      They sold their home and raised $40,000 in seed money, yet      still needed more cash to fund the startup. Carey pitched her      story to local newspapers, and the media attention brought in      $200,000 from investors.       In the early days, the couple worked hard to establish the      brewery's reputation for consistent quality beers. Carey      based her plan on developing a very loyal customer base. She      set up beer tasting classes along with offering brewery      tours, and the brewery started to take off, attracting notice      from distributors. New Glarus Brewing Company has grown to 50      full-time employees, has registered growth in profits of 123      percent from 2007 to 2009, and is Wisconsin's number one      micro-brewery relative to sales volume.       Kamstra, the second runner-up, had been eyeing an old,      dilapidated stone building that had stood empty while she was      a college student attending Black Hills State University. She      didn't know exactly at the time how or why, but she knew      somehow her future would be in that building.       After earning a degree in business and 10 years in banking,      Kamstra changed course and earned a degree in culinary arts      at the Colorado Institute of art. In 1999, with the help of      an SBA-guaranteed loan, Kamstra leased the old dilapidated      building, refurbished it and opened Roma's Ristorante. When      the old building proved too small, Kamstra adapted, securing      another SBA-backed loan in 2010 to finance construction of a      new building, with more space. Since then, sales have nearly      doubled and staff has increased from 11 to 35.                          ____________________
