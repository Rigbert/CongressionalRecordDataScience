I would hope that the leadership of this institution does not pull something like that and allows our Members a vote. The gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley), one of our outstanding new Members of this House, the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), who has been a champion on senior issues, certainly in the other body Senator Jim Jeffords, who tried to work with the administration on the safety provisions to make sure that we have like product being brought in here, all these fine Members need to be heard. And we need to bring the weight of their influence and intelligence to bear on a free vote on this floor, not have it buried or altered in some committee room here that none of us have access to.  I would hope that the leadership of the institution hears us and gives us an opportunity to bring these prescription drugs to the American people at affordable prices. I will just tell the gentleman last week when I was doing food shopping at my local supermarket, the cashout clerk told me that every week she has people that come by there and they have to separate out their prescription drugs from their food, and they have to put food back on the counter because they cannot afford to buy both. This should not be happening in the United States of America.
