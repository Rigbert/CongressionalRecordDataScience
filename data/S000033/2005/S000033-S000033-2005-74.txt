 Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Chairman, the issue here is a simple one: We cannot compromise the air safety of the United States of America to the lowest bidder, whose main function in life is profiteering rather than protecting the needs of American air travelers.  Equally important, we cannot turn our backs on the promises made to 2,500 Federal employees in terms of their pensions. If we turn our backs on them, we are turning our backs on millions of American workers whose pensions can also be slashed. Let us protect Federal employees. Let us pass this amendment.
