President, I am delighted to join with the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, my dear friend Senator Lieberman, in rising today in support of the Presidential Appointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act of 2011.  First, let me join Senator Lieberman in commending Senators Schumer and Alexander for their leadership on this bill. Senator Alexander, in particular, has worked so hard on this issue. In fact, I am convinced we would not be where we are today without his persistent leadership. He deserves great credit for his patience and his dogged determination to bring this bill and this issue to the floor. Senators Reid and McConnell also deserve great credit. They made the commitment in January to make reform of the nominations process a priority.  Finally, I wish to recognize Senator Lieberman, the chairman of the committee, on which I have the privilege of being the ranking member. He and I have also been part of what has truly been a bipartisan effort to craft this bill. It is an effort we need to see more often in this Senate if we are to tackle and actually solve the many problems facing our Nation.  This bill before us addresses shortcomings in the process of confirming Presidential appointees without diminishing the constitutional roles of the President or of the Senate. The fact is this is a very modest bill that takes limited but much needed steps to reform the confirmation process. When we look at the full-time positions that now require Senate confirmation, this bill would eliminate only approximately 85 full-time positions, a truly modest number. These positions were selected because either they do not have significant policymaking authority or funding responsibilities or report directly to a Senate-confirmed official.  To be clear, not included in these numbers are almost 3,000 officer corps positions that would no longer require Senate confirmation under this bill. But let me quickly explain exactly what those officer positions are, because when many people hear the words ``officer positions,'' they are going to think the Department of Defense and that would raise the issue of civilian control of the military. Let me say these are not military or Department of Defense positions. Rather, they are members of the Public Health Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Corps of the Department of Commerce.  Apart from these officer corps positions, more than 83 percent of all currently confirmed positions and more than 90 percent of all the full-time positions will continue to require Senate approval under this bill. Let me emphasize that again because, unfortunately, there is some misinformation about this bill. More than 90 percent of the full-time positions in the Federal Government that have required Senate confirmation will continue to require Senate approval under our bill. Furthermore, nothing in this bill limits the ability of Congress to create new Senate-confirmed positions in the future. It may be that there is a new department created someday or a new position that is very important. The Senate can choose to exercise its will to make those new positions subject to Senate confirmation.  The companion standing order reported by the Rules Committee proposes that some additional 240 positions go through a new expedited confirmation process. Although that resolution is not now before us, it will be, I hope, shortly after we conclude our work on this bill. So I wish to explain briefly what the process would be under that resolution.  That expedited process would still require nominees to respond to all committee questionnaires and would stillprovide the opportunity for closer scrutiny of a nominee if requested by a single Senator--any Senator. The confirmation process must be thorough enough for the Senate to exercise its constitutional duty, but it should not be so onerous as to deter qualified people from public service, particularly when they are being asked to serve as a part-time member of an advisory board.  A letter from three of our former colleagues, one House Member and two Senators, put it well. The bipartisan Policy Center in endorsing this bill sent us a letter that is signed by former Congressmen and Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman, Senator Pete Domenici, and Senator Trent Lott, who of course served as the majority leader of the Senate. Here is what they said, and here is what we heard over and over at the hearing Senator Lieberman and I conducted before our committee. This is the bipartisan Policy Center's conclusion:       Many public spirited people are discouraged from serving in      appointed office because of the length and the extreme      adversarial nature of the confirmation process.  This is an issue the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs has been working to address for a long time. In fact, in 2001, when Senator Fred Thompson chaired the committee, we held two hearings focusing on the state of the Presidential appointment process. As a result of those hearings, the committee reported favorably reform legislation. A few of the provisions of that bill were later incorporated into the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, which I, along with Senator Lieberman, authored.  Let me give our colleagues some more background, some of which has been covered by the chairman of the committee but I think is important to repeat to counter some misimpressions about this bill that somehow it undermines our constitutional obligations. In fact, the Constitution, in the appointments clause, makes the appointment of senior Federal executive officers a joint responsibility of the President and the Senate. The President determines who in his judgment is best qualified to serve in the most senior and critical positions across the executive branch of our government. Then we, the Senate, exercise our independent judgment to determine if these nominees have the necessary qualifications and character to serve our Nation in these important positions of public trust. But at the same time, the Constitution envisions the appointment of lesser officers by the President alone. Specifically, the Constitution provides that ``Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.'' So that process is spelled out in the Constitution.  The National Commission on the Public Service, commonly known as the Volcker Commission, gathered some very illuminating statistics. They differ a bit from some of the statistics the chairman has given because he is using CRS, but what they show is the enormous increase in the number of positions that are now subject to Senate confirmation and approval.  When President Kennedy came to office, he had just 286 positions to fill that had the titles of Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Under Secretary, Assistant Secretary, and Administrator. But using those titles, there were only 286 when President Kennedy assumed office. By the end of the Clinton administration, there were 914 positions with those titles. Today, according to the Congressional Research Service, there are between 1,200 and 1,400 positions in total that are appointed by the President that require the advice and consent of the Senate. Too often, that large number of positions requiring confirmation leads to long delays in vetting, nominating, and confirming these appointees.  I would also point out that there is a great expense that goes along with this process. Having an FBI background check is expensive. Having our congressional investigators do their own vetting process is expensive. And many a nominee will tell you how expensive it is for the nominee to go through this process. The result of the length of this process is that administrations can go for months without key officials in these many agencies. That is why you will find there is bipartisan support from previous administrations urging us to finally tackle this issue.  The 9/11 Commission found that ``[a]t the sub-cabinet level, there were significant delays in the confirmation of key officials, particularly at the Department of Defense,'' in 2001. It was not until 6 months after President Bush took office that he had his national security team in place. Our enemies take note of that fact. That is what the 9/11 Commission found. And it creates a national security vulnerability that terrorists can and have exploited. We have seen that in the United States, we have seen that in Madrid, that when there is a change in administration, it is a particularly difficult time, particularly if we do not have our appointees in place.  As I have mentioned, Senators Schumer and Alexander have been the bipartisan authors of this bill, which has been cosponsored not only by Senator Lieberman and myself but by members of the leadership of the Senate on both sides of the aisle. But I believe, of all members of the working group, Senator Alexander may have the best perspective. In fact, I believe he does have the best perspective because he is one of the few Members of the Senate who have served as a Cabinet Secretary and as a Senator. He has endured the nominations process himself, and I am sure he will explain what he went through in his comments later, but he will talk about how long it was, that it was 9 months before he had a chief financial officer. It took him 6 months, I believe, to be confirmed, and he could not get his team in place because the process was so bogged down.  The nominations reform bill we take up today removes only 203 positions out of an estimated 1,200 to 1,400 from the Senate confirmation requirement, and most of those positions are part-time advisory board members. I would ask my colleagues, should the Senate really spend its time and its resources confirming 10 part-time members of the National Institute for Literacy Advisory Board? I am not in any way denigrating the work of this board or the people who are willing to serve on it. I am just suggesting that I do not think that board requires our confirmation. What about the National Board of Education Sciences or the National Museum and Library Sciences Board, which has 20 part-time members, all of whom have to be confirmed by the Senate?  Again, I would point out there is a cost involved for my colleagues, and that involves everyone here who is concerned about the amount of money we are spending in the Federal Government. There is a cost to an FBI background investigation. There is a cost to having a sufficient number of staff to go out and do the kinds of background checks and vetting that we do. There is a cost to the nominees involved, who have to fill out all these forms, who have to be very careful that they are divesting themselves of certain assets. And it makes sense for the Office of Government Ethics, which already has a system in place to check for those kinds of conflicts, to not have its work duplicated, and that is what happens now far too often.  This legislation will free the Senate and enable us to focus on those nominees whose jobs are absolutely critical to our Nation, who do have significant policy responsibility, who do have significant control over Federal funds, and that will make a difference. It will also enable the Senate to spend more time on the critical work of how can we best create more jobs in this country, how can we reduce our unsustainable $14 trillion debt, how can we strengthen our homeland security, and how can we conduct more effective oversight of the executive branch. Isn't it a better use of our time to be holding oversight hearings to examine the enormous duplication the Government Accountability Office has found across government that wastes hundreds of millions, perhaps billions of taxpayer dollars, rather than spending our time worrying about the confirmation of 20 part-time members of the National Museum and Library Services Board?  Over the years, our committee has continued to hear from experts on the executive nominations process. In April of this year, we received a letter from the bipartisan Commission to Reform the Federal Appointments Process, which is chaired by our former colleagues, Senators Frist and Robb, aswell as we have heard from the former Director of Presidential Personnel for the Bush administration, Clay Johnson, and the former Chief of Staff for the Clinton administration, Mack McLarty. They wrote--and I think this puts it well--that ``[m]ost everyone agrees the federal appointments process is broken.'' They underscored that the bill before us will help the next administration ``to put in place very early in its first year the . . . people that the new Department heads need to get off to a fast start . . . working effectively with Congress.''  I hope we can agree to undertake the modest reforms we have included in this bill. I hope we do not let this legislation and the Rules Committee resolution get caught up in the turf battles and the power struggles that too often sink good government initiatives in this body. This bill is a step in the right direction and a step we should take together by an overwhelming margin.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, if they have not already been printed in the Record, that letters endorsing the bill from the Bipartisan Policy Center, the Partnership for Public Service, Senator Fred Thompson, former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci, and former Senators Bill Frist and Chuck Robb be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                     Bipartisan Policy Center,                                    Washington, DC, June 21, 2011.     Re S. 679 and S. Res. 116--Support.       To Legislative Directors: As former senators and      presidential appointees of both parties, we fully support the      Senate's efforts to improve the nomination and confirmation      process by reducing the number of political appointees who      require senate confirmation, forming a commission to make      recommendations for a more efficient financial disclosure and      background check process, and streamlining the senate      confirmation process for nominees to advisory boards and      commissions.       The problem and the solution are truly bipartisan.      Presidents of both parties and senates controlled by both      parties have seen the increasing difficulties in the      presidential appointment and senate confirmation process.      With each recent presidency, the length of time to select,      nominate and confirm appointees has lengthened. [Many public      spirited people are discouraged from serving in appointive      office because of the length and extreme adversarial nature      of the process.]       In S. 679 and S. Res. 116, the Senate proposes modest      improvements in the system. These bills will not alter the      fundamental character of the appointment and confirmation      process. The president will continue to make nominations and      the senate will exercise its advise and consent role for      hundreds of appointments. But for some lower level nominees,      the senate confirmation process will be eliminated or      streamlined and the financial disclosure and background check      process will be simplified and improved.       Beyond these immediate measures, we hope that in the future      the Senate will continue to work to improve the confirmation      process by coordinating senate committee financial disclosure      forms with executive branch disclosure forms. And we      encourage consultation between the executive and legislative      branches to find ways to limit the use of the recess      appointment power.       S. 679 and S. Res. 116 are small and important steps in the      right direction. We encourage the Senate to pass these two      measures.           Best Regards,     Secretary Dan Glickman,       Senior Fellow, BPC.     Senator Pete Domenici,       Senior Fellow, BPC.     Senator Trent Lott,       Senior Fellow, BPC.                                  ____                               Partnership For Public Service,                                    Washington, DC, June 20, 2011.     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Susan Collins,     Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Lieberman and Collins: I commend you, as      Chairman and Ranking Member of the Homeland Security and      Governmental Affairs Committee, for your leadership in moving      forward legislation to streamline the presidential      appointments process. S. 679, the Presidential Appointment      Efficiency and Streamlining Act, and S. Res. 116 will      contribute to better, more effective government by reducing      the number of presidential appointees subject to Senate      confirmation and doing much to fix a broken nominations      process that takes too long, is too complex and discourages      some of our nation's best talent from serving.       This legislation is urgently needed, and I applaud you for      your efforts to ensure our federal government has the right      talent in place to face our nation's many challenges. The      Partnership for Public Service strongly supports S. 679 and      S. Res. 116 and urges their swift passage.       Very best wishes.           Sincerely,                                                        Max Stier,     President and CEO.                                  ____                                    Hermitage, TN, April 12, 2011.     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,     Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental          Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Susan Collins,     Ranking Republican Member, Committee on Homeland Security and          Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Joe and Susan: In 2001, when I was Chairman of the      Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, we held hearings      reviewing the nominations process and potential options for      reforms. President George W. Bush had been in office 10      months and only about 60 percent of the government's top      political jobs had been filled--which created national      security concerns.       That's why I want to commend you for your work on the      Presidential Appointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act of      2011 which would eliminate the need for Senate confirmation      of approximately 200 relatively low level positions. We tried      to fix this problem when I was chairman, and it still needs      to be done.       My experience was that our confirmation process led to      substantial delay and extraordinary expense for nominees as      they are vetted beyond what is necessary even for the least      sensitive positions. I believe that this will result in an      increasingly narrow pool of potential public servants who are      more likely to be wealthy, and already live in the      Washington, DC, area.       In 1960, President Kennedy had 286 positions to fill in the      ranks of Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Under Secretary,      Assistant Secretary, and Administrator and by the end of the      Clinton Administration there were 914 positions with these      titles. Reform would not diminish oversight. It would make      oversight more effective.       Comprehensive reforms throughout the presidential      appointment process are needed so that the Senate can spend      its time focusing on senior nominations and on major      priorities such as national defense and tackling our budget      problems.       The Senate should take its advice and consent powers      seriously, but the number of nominations have grown and      expanded over time--much like the rest of the federal      government. I hope your committee will take quick action on      this legislation and send the bill to the full Senate for its      consideration.           Sincerely,     U.S. Senator Fred Thompson.                                  ____                                            Frank C. Carlucci,                                         McLean, VA, June 1, 2011.     Hon. Harry Reid,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles Schumer,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.     Hon. Lamar Alexander,     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Reid, McConnell, Schumer and Alexander: I am      writing to commend you for your leadership and bipartisan      approach to tackling one of the great challenges facing our      government--presidential appointments and nominations reform.      There is little dispute that the current nominations process      has grown too cumbersome and complicated, and the number of      political appointees is too large. S. 679, the Presidential      Appointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act, and S. Res. 116      are a promising show of progress, and I encourage all      Senators to support this bipartisan legislation.       As former Secretary of Defense (under President Reagan), I      know the importance of having high quality leaders in place      within an agency. Leaving positions vacant indefinitely as      appointees wait to be confirmed is not smart management, and      is frankly a threat to our national security. We need strong      leaders installed quickly in agencies to ensure our      government is ready to meet the many challenges it faces. S.      679 and S. Res. 116 together present a common-sense solution      that preserves the important role of the Senate in confirming      key nominees, but unburdens the process by relieving the      advice and consent requirement for less critical positions.       Congress would be wise to act now, before the politics of      the next election cycle get in the way of practical reforms      to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our federal      government. I urge the Senate to swiftly pass both S. 679 and      S. Res. 116 to ensure our government has its senior leaders      in place within agencies to carry out critical missions.           Sincerely,     Frank Carlucci.                                  ____                                                    June 17, 2011.     Senator Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: We write today to encourage your      support for the Presidential Appointment Efficiency and      Streamlining Act of 2011 (S. 679). Having served in the      Senate and participated in this process firsthand, we believe      this bill would constructively improve the federal      appointments process, which we all know is broken.       We believe that this bill will dramatically improve      government operations, especially in the first months of a      new administration. S. 679 will make it possible for a new      administration to more quickly put into place the roughly 70      vital communication and operations personnel needed by      department heads to effectively work and communicate with      Congress, the public, and federal employees.       S. 679 will create more time and capacity for the Senate      within an administration's early months to confirm or deny      the appointment of senior-most, operational and policy-making      officials, whose qualifications clearly warrant Senate      scrutiny.       Importantly, S. 679 will create a working group to develop      a specific plan to improve the efficiency, manner and speed      with which background data are collected from potential      nominees. The goal is to streamline and better coordinate the      now cumbersome process whereby the FBI, Office of Government      Ethics, and the Senate receive and consider a nominees'      information; vetting would begin sooner, critical especially      in the first few months of a new administration. Furthermore,      the unnecessary and duplicative data-gathering burden on the      individual nominee can be reduced significantly. The      Executive Branch will similarly develop a plan to accelerate      the process by which they receive nominees' background      information, so that nominees can be submitted for Senate      approval in a more timely fashion.       We believe the Act does not diminish the institutional      influence or Constitutional duties of the Senate, as it will      retain the power to advise on and consent to the appointment      of some 1200 policy-making and senior officials, including      those officials to whim the subject positions of S. 679      report. Through the use of hearings, reports to congress,      Inspector General and GAO reports, the Senate will continue      to hold responsible offices accountable for performance      expectations, regardless of whether or not the appointed      individuals in those offices are confirmed by the Senate. The      Senate will still maintain the high performance standards      sought for all government functions and programs.       Moreover, in no way does the Act diminish the stature of      appointed positions that will no longer require Senate      confirmation, a process which we all know makes it more      difficult to attract highly qualified candidates. Currently a      number of comparable positions are Senate confirmed in one      agency, yet not in another. We believe there is no evidence      to suggest those appointees requiring Senate confirmation are      more qualified and talented than those having the same job at      other agencies only not requiring Senate confirmation.       It is noteworthy that leaders from both parties have come      together to develop this legislation to improve the working      of the Senate confirmation process and markedly improve      government operations, especially in the first year of a new      administration. We highly encourage you to join Senators      Reid, McConnell, Schumer, Alexander, Lieberman and Collins to      pass S. 679 to make the Senate confirmation process more      effective.           Respectfully yours,     William H. Frist, M.D.     Charles S. Robb.
