 Speaker, I want to announce today the reintroduction of the Oral Health Promotion Act, a bill I previously sponsored in the 107th Congress. I will reintroduce this bill tomorrow and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me as original cosponsors on this important legislation.  Mr. Speaker, oral health care in the United States is in a sad state of decay. Congress cannot neglect it any longer. While the number of Americans without private health insurance of any kind is staggering enough at over 45 million, the number of Americans without private or public dental insurance is more than two times that figure. One hundred and eight million Americans--at last count--had no dental insurance at all: no coverage for emergency services, no coverage for fillings, no coverage for braces, no coverage for check-ups. Amazingly, despite great advances in oral health sciences, the Surgeon General has reported that tooth decay has become the single most common chronic childhood disease--five times more common than asthma and seven times more common than hay fever.  What does our neglect of oral health cost us? Surveys have shown that dental problems cause children to miss more than 51 million hours of school and adults to miss more than 164 million hours of work each year. That's a lot of lost education, lost productivity and lost pay. And let's be clear--lack of access to dental care does not strike evenly across the socioeconomic spectrum. According to the U.S. Surgeon General:  Poor children suffer twice as many cavities as their more affluent peers, and their disease is more likely to be untreated.  Poor children suffer nearly 12 times more restricted-activity school days than children from higher-income families. (In my own state, which is doing a lot better than the national average on many oral healthcare indicators, a recent study found that 23 percent of children in grades 1-3 experienced 82 percent of all decay found.)  Medicaid has not been able to fill the gap in providing dental care to poor children: Fewer than one in five Medicaid-covered children received a single dental visit in a recent year-long study period.  For each child without medical insurance, there are at least 2.6 children without dental insurance.  For every adult 19 years or older with medical insurance, there are three without dental insurance.  Obviously, there are a lot of factors at play in this problem. But when it comes down to what we can do to increase access to dental care for the largest number of people, the solution, I think, already exists. While many other dental providers close the door to Medicaid and uninsured patients, often because they do not receive adequate reimbursement for the services they provide, Federally Qualified Community Health Centers provided dental services to millions and millions of them last year. Currently, over 1,000 community, migrant, and homeless health centers serve over 15 million people in 3,600 urban and rural communities in every State and territory.  It is clear that focusing on expansion of the dental care infrastructure through these and similar community-based providers will get us the biggest bang for our buck. Community health centers--which serve all patients in their communities regardless of their ability to pay--are on the front lines of getting dental care to those who are least likely to get it, namely those on Medicaid and those with no insurance at all. A lot of praise has been showered on this successful program for many years and from both sides of the aisle, including from President Bush, and rightly so. Now I think we really need to put our money where our mouths are and fund the creation of more dental care infrastructure based on the community health care model.  That is why I am introducing the ``Oral Health Promotion Act'' to address our national crisis in access to dental care. This bill will make a serious commitment to developing a dental health care infrastructure across our country and expand access to high-quality, affordable dental and health care for all Americans. It will:  (1) Create a $140 million fund for the workforce, capital and equipment needed to establish or expand oral health services at community health centers, school-based dental centers (and other community-based sites) across the country;  (2) Provide states with an enhanced federal match (FMAP) for agreeing to cover full adult dental benefits under the Medicaid program;  (3) Require that State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) coverage include dental benefits for children;  (4) Authorize and provide additional funding for states to provide dental services under SCHIP as a supplement to other health coverage;  (5) Create incentives for states to pay market-based reimbursement for dental services under SCHIP and Medicaid and to cover the Medicaid level of dental benefits under SCHIP.  I urge my colleagues to join me as original cosponsors of this important legislation, which I will introduce tomorrow.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Pages E130-E131]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]            REINTRODUCTION OF THE ORAL HEALTH PROMOTION ACT                                 ______                                                           HON.
