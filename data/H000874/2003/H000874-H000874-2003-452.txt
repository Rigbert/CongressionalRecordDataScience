So there are those complications.  Would the gentleman inform me as to what the intent would be, either before the 6:30 suspension votes or after?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will yield, Mr. Speaker, I would suspect that certainly, with the gentleman's agreement, that we could start the process around 5 or 5:30 and wait on the votes until we have finished voting on the suspensions; or we could start the debate on the motion to instruct after the vote on the suspensions. We will be glad to work with the gentleman on how we do that, whatever is most convenient to the Members.
