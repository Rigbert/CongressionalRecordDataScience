The reason I mention it, this is a critical part of the legislation. It is nice to say, and we should say, my cosponsor of the Sarbanes bill, which I think is superb--we should say we should have better accounting methods, we should say we should have more accountability, but we have a lot of these executives who have proven by their past behavior they are not going to do squat unless they think they are going to go to jail for what they do.  The Leahy-McCain, et al, amendment makes it very clear that these people are going to face jail terms if they loot the pension funds, if they defraud their investors, if they defraud the people of their own company. And I might suggest if the Senator from Texas agrees, there ought to be real penalties; let's vote on Leahy-McCain. Let's vote on it, not divide it up. If he believes there is something he may want to do better--such as shield some of these people with a shorter statute of limitations or with a more restrictive statute of limitations--he has every right to do whatever he wants to shield these people. But bring it up as a separate amendment and let the Senate vote up or down on that.  When I look at places such as Washington State alone where the pension funds of firefighters and police lost $50 million because of the fraud of the leaders of Enron, I don't feel too sympathetic. We already have a very short statute of limitations in here anyway. We ought to at least have that so people might be able to recover some of the money they have lost, if it is at all possible, instead of just a few executives going up and building their $50 million mansions and hiding it there.  There ought to be some way for the people who lost their pensions, lost their live savings, to get it back. We ought to have criminal penalties for those who did this in the first place so they end up in the slammer.
