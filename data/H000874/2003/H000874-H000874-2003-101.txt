Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the majority leader. I appreciate the information the gentleman has given us. Essentially, we will be meeting Tuesday night and Wednesday next week.  The gentleman did not mention the Iraq supplemental, I do not believe. I would like to know because, obviously, that is a matter of great concern to every Member of this body and to the American people, when the gentleman expects to consider that supplemental appropriation on the floor. And additionally, can the gentleman assure Members that we are going to have a full consideration and fair process to consider this bill on the floor, a process that will allow a full debate so that Members will have the ability to address all of their concerns? They may well want to support it, but I think the Congress and the American people want to know exactly what we are doing.  I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. The gentleman from Florida (Chairman Young) of the Committee on Appropriations has informed me that he plans to proceed with regular order. He also plans under that regular order to circulate the supplemental appropriations bill with committee members on Monday. Then he plans to hold a markup next Thursday and, assuming things go according to plan, the bill will lay over the requisite number of days, and we should be able to bring it to the floor the following week, the week of October 13, I believe.                              {time}  1445
