 President, it is a distinct privilege to recognize my friend, Henderson County Sheriff Ed Brady, who is celebrating 50 years of a remarkable law enforcement career. Throughout his distinguished service, Ed has answered the call of duty and protected Kentucky families and communities. I am proud to join his family, colleagues, and friends in marking this golden anniversary.  Ed began his career in law enforcement as a dispatcher with the Kentucky State Police. He joined the department while in college, attending classes all day before working the dispatch's third shift overnight. It certainly wasn't easy, but the experience showed Ed's work ethic and steadfast commitment to the public's safety.  Although his father was a Kentucky State Police Trooper, Ed never thought he would be one himself, but after a few years as a dispatcher, he heard the calling to leave the office and enter the academy. As the youngest member of his class--and for a time the youngest trooper in Kentucky--Ed focused diligently on his training to get the experience he needed to excel. For 22 years, Ed worked for the Kentucky State Police, earning a reputation for his leadership and service.  Ed remembers his decision to leave the Kentucky State Police was among the hardest of his entire life, but he was presented with an offer too good to turn down. The City of Henderson, Ed's hometown, asked him to lead their police force as its chief. Although it was a major shift from his previous job, he was ready to hit the ground running. In fact, he was sworn-in as the Henderson Chief of Police only hours after turning in his State trooper badge.  As the new police chief, Ed knew he had to work to earn the trust of both his law enforcement colleagues and the Henderson community. To address the former, he invested a great deal of time into hearing from his new officers and building relationships. To gain the respect of the citizens of Henderson, Ed implemented community policing practices. He and his officers went directly into previously underserved areas in a coordinated effort with the city government. He organized more bicycle and foot patrols and a committee focused on minority relations.  Looking back on his career, Ed called the transformation of this area of Henderson his proudest accomplishment because, in his words, ``We gave people back their neighborhood.''  After more than a decade and half as a successful chief, Ed was on the lookout for a new challenge. He wanted to get back to his rural-policing roots and decided to run for Henderson County Sheriff. Since his first election and for the last 12 years, he has done just that. As Sheriff, Ed leads his deputies with distinction.  Over the years, I have worked with Ed on a number of projects in our Commonwealth, including to deliver critical resources to bolster the work of local law enforcement. It is an honor to call him a dear friend. To celebrate his golden anniversary in law enforcement, Ed's family and colleagues surprised him with an event in his honor. He certainly deserves our recognition for his dedication to his community and his years of leadership in Kentucky. I would also like to recognize his wife Amy, an impressive public servant in her own right. As Henderson County's jailer, Amy is the other half of this remarkable team. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in marking this wonderful occasion and wishing Ed and Amy many more successful years to come.                            ____________________
