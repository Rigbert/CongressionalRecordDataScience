President, I am pleased to cosponsor this resolution on Macedonia, with my friend from Kentucky, Senator McConnell.  Macedonia stands out as the country in the Balkans which, until recently, avoided the bloodshed and destruction that engulfed the rest of the former Yugoslavia throughout much of the past decade. In Macedonia, ethnic Macedonians and Albanians have lived peacefully together.  But recently, a small number of Albanian fighters have resorted to violence. Some have demanded a separate Albanian state. Others are interested in nothing more than control over smuggling routes in and out of Macedonia. Still others are from Kosovo, and are using Macedonia as a staging ground to focus international attention on their grievances in Kosovo.  But there are others who have taken up arms who represent the aspirations of the larger community of ethnic Albanians in Macedonia, who have been the victims of discrimination in their own country, or what is now Macedonia, for generations.  Albanians comprise approximately one third of the population of Macedonia, but they hold only a fraction of government positions. There are no public institutions of higher learning where Albanian language is taught or spoken. Albanians are not recognized in Macedonia's Constitution.  The ethnic Albanian's grievances are legitimate, and must be addressed. The ethnic Macedonians also have rights, which must be respected.  Recently, the leaders of a coalition government, representing ethnic Macedonian and Albanian political parties, have met to try to find a political settlement of the conflict. Both sides have acknowledged that there is no military solution, and that a civil war would be devastating for the country. But after a week of negotiations they have made little progress, and the talks have reportedly reached an impasse. That is unacceptable. There is no other way to avoid a wider war than through dialogue. The United States has offered support, but not as vigorously as I believe it should. The leaders of the European Union have also invested considerable time and energy in search of peace.  NATO is prepared to assist in implementing a peace agreement, as it should, but the parties in Macedonia need to recognize that the United States will not intervene militarily, nor will we finance a war on behalf of either side. To think otherwise would be both unrealistic and pointless. The United States would support a political settlement that upholds the rights of all citizens of Macedonia, regardless of ethnicity, and which preserves the political and geographical integrity of the country.  This resolution calls attention to the importance of the situation in Macedonia, for the Balkans region, for Europe, and for the United States. This is a solvable problem, and it would be unforgivable if, what is still a relatively low intensity, localized conflict, erupted into full-scale civil war. The administration needs to give this precarious situation far more attention than it has thus far. We have an ambassador there who is doing his best, but it is not enough. Higher level diplomacy is needed, and it is needed urgently.                          ____________________
