 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by a high school student from Brattleboro High School in Vermont, who was speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       Ms. Mishra: Good morning, Congressman Sanders. I have come      here today to speak about the issue of sweatshops.       The dictionary defines a sweatshop as a factory where      workers work long hours for low wages under unwholesome      conditions. You know as well as I that this type of work      exists today and it is being used by many rich and famous      companies. I would like to focus on one particular company,      Disney, and its factories in Haiti.       Disney exploits thousands of people in Haiti every day. It      hires the Haitian people to work in its sweatshops, paying      them only 28 cents an hours, requiring them to strive toward      fairly impossible quotas and keeping them from ever being      able to change their conditions.       How much responsibility does a company like Disney have for      the wellbeing of its employees? According to the United      States government the responsibility is large. Corporate      codes of conduct guarantee the human rights of any person      working for a U.S. company be it in the U.S. or abroad.       Trade benefits are given to Disney by the U.S. and Haiti on      the condition that there is respect for human rights, but      while Disney enjoys the tax exemptions, it doesn't live up to      its part of the bargain. 28 cents an hour is not a living      wage. Disney knows this, its manufacturers know this. While      it may indeed be the minimum wage in Haiti, we must ask      ourselves is it enough for a person to survive?       If you believe as does Disney that it is not an essential,      that it is an essential part of everyday life to eat, that      education isn't important and that diseases such as malaria      and dysentery can be fought off without even medicines then      28 cents is more than enough. But if you would agree that      living on sugar water, going to bed hungry and being in      constant debt is unfair and not right, then you would side      with the Haitian workers.       The average Haitian Disney employee after paying off all      her debts she possibly can comes home to her family with      little more than $3 in her pocket. Keep in mind that the     cost of living in Haiti is just about the same as it is in      the U.S. Imagine having to survive on $3 a week, 44 cents a      day. 44 cents cannot buy a can of Campbell's soup, it cannot      buy the $2 used pair of shoes that one of your children is in      desperate need of.       The Haitian workers are not being extravagant in their      requests, asking for a 30 cent pay raise from 28 to 58 cents      an hour. Right now the workers are receiving less than one      half of one percent in the total cost of the merchandise they      make, earning 7 cents for every $11.99 pair of Pocohontas      pajamas they sew. If granted their request they would be      earning 9 cents out of every $11.97 pair of pajamas they sew;      that is a two cent difference. This would still leave Disney,      the contractors and Walmart with over 99 percent of the      profit.       Disney can afford to give a pay rise for its Haitian      workers. It pays its CEO, Michael Eisner over $10,000 an      hour; $10,000 compared to 28 cents. It would take a worker in      Haiti sewing Disney clothes 14 and a half years to earn what      Michael Eisner earns in one hour, and 29,000 years to earn      what he earns in one year.       Finally, raising the wages of the Haitian workers would not      only be beneficial to the workers themselves but to U.S.      residents as well. A person earning 28 cents an hour who      cannot even afford to feed her own family cannot afford to      buy products made in the U.S.       I urge you, Congressman Sanders to look into the dealings      of Disney in Haiti; I urge you to put pressure on companies      such as Disney to stop the use of sweatshops; I urge you to      get Disney to live up to its responsibilities as an employer.      The Haitian people deserve better.       In the case of Disney I know that in Grand Rapids there is      a factory and Disney moved its company overseas and a lot of      people in Grand Rapids lost their jobs. They had been working      there for 20 years, as much as 20 years, and now they are      without jobs, working at McDonald's or whatever they can      find.       The problem is so immense and when I was researching I      found that our tax money is going towards helping executives      and business people in Haiti continue these sweatshops and I      think that needs to be stopped. And I think that even though      we have laws, the corporate codes of conduct, et cetera, they      are not being followed, so we need people to watch out over      these companies because obviously these companies are not      doing it themselves.       Citizens, consumers can watch what they are buying if they      see something made from Disney, look at where it is made, and      if it is made in Haiti you know these people are working for      so long and have such hard hours and they are not earning      anything. They do not even have enough food to eat. You have      to consider that. The clock is really nice, but do you really      want to support a sweatshop in Haiti?                               ____________________
