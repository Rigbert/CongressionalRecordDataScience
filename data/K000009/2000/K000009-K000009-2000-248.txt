Chairman, I include the following GAO report for the Record.   United States General Accounting Office, Report to Congressional                                RequestersOccupational Safety and Health.--Government Responses to Beryllium Uses                                and Risks                              May 19, 2000                        Congressional Requesters       Over the last 50 years, federal policymakers and scientists      have attempted to both capitalize on the advantages of      beryllium and address health and environmental risks.      Beryllium is a strong and lightweight metal that generates      and reflects neutrons, resists corrosion, is transparent to X      rays, and conducts electricity. It is also a hazardous      substance.       Among the organizations that have played key roles in      responding to the risks associated with beryllium are the      Departments of Defense, Energy, and Labor. The Departments of      Defense and Energy are the federal agencies that have most      commonly used beryllium. Defense procures components      containing beryllium for a variety of weapon systems from      private contractors. Energy operates federal facilities      (including nuclear weapons production facilities) that use      beryllium, and it has responsibility for protecting federal      and contract workers at these facilities. Energy has      identified at least 17 facilities that use or have used      beryllium, and it estimates that about 20,000 current and      former workers at these facilities were exposed or      potentially exposed to beryllium from the 1940s to the      present. The Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and      Health Administration has overall responsibility for      protecting the health and safety of workers in most      workplaces throughout the United States, including those that      use beryllium.       This report responds to your request for information on      beryllium as a hazardous material and on the health and      safety controls over its use. As agreed with your offices,      this report (1) provides information on beryllium's uses and      risks and (2) describes selected key events that illustrate      the evolution of the federal government's response to risks      posed by beryllium. To respond to the second question, we      identified and summarized key events from the 1960s through      the 1990s involving actions by the Departments of Defense and      Energy and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.      Appendix I describes the objectives, scope, and methodology      for this review.                            results in brief       Lightness, strength, and other attributes have made      beryllium useful in a wide array of products, such as      aircraft, spacecraft, X-ray equipment, and nuclear weapons.      However, beryllium is considered hazardous. Health effects      from high exposure to beryllium particles were first noted in      the early 20th century. Beginning in the 1940s, scientists      linked exposure       From the 1960s to the 1990s, Defense, Energy, and the      Occupational Safety and Health Administration took a number      of actions to assess and to respond to risks associated with      exposure to beryllium. In reviewing selected key events, we      noted that the agencies took the following steps to reduce      risks from exposure to beryllium: discontinued testing of      rocket propellant containing beryllium, assessed beryllium      exposure standards, limited worker exposure to beryllium,      established health surveillance measures, and proposed      compensation for workers who have chronic beryllium disease.      The key events are as follows:       Defense discontinued testing beryllium in rocket fuel by      1970, due in part to concerns about meeting air quality      requirements.       The Occupational Safety and Health Administration proposed      a more stringent worker exposure standard for beryllium in      1975 based on evidence that it was carcinogenic in laboratory      animals. The proposal generated concerns about the technical      feasibility of the proposal, impact on national security, and      the scientific evidence supporting the proposed change.      According to Occupational Safety and Health Administration      officials, the agency discontinued its work on the proposal      in the early 1980s in response to other regulatory priorities      such as lead, electrical hazards, and occupational noise. In      1998, the agency announced that it would develop a      comprehensive standard for beryllium by 2001       Energy improved working conditions at its facilities and      implemented medical testing for its current and former      workers during the 1980s and 1990s after new cases of chronic      beryllium disease were identified during the 1980s. From 1984      through 1999, 149 Energy workers have been diagnosed with      definite or possible chronic beryllium disease.       In 1999, Energy issued a rule that established new worker      safety controls, such as increased use of respirators and      assessing hazards associated with work tasks, for its      facilities that use beryllium. Energy also proposed a      compensation program for Energy workers affected by chronic      beryllium disease, which has been introduced as legislation      in the Congress.       The Departments of Defense, Energy, and Labor provided      written or oral comments on our report and generally      concurred with the information presented. They suggested      technical changes, and Labor officials also emphasized that      the hazard information bulletin on beryllium cited in the      body of this report was a significant effort to protect      worker health.                        Beryllium Uses and Risks       In the 1920s and 1930s, beryllium was used for a variety of      purposes, including as an additive for alloying with copper      and other metals in manufacturing, as an ingredient in      fluorescent lamps, and for other purposes. Today, beryllium      is used in nuclear reactor and weapons parts; aircraft,      spacecraft, and missile structures and parts; military      vehicle structures and parts; electronics; auto parts;      lasers; X-ray equipment; dental prosthetics; and other      consumer products. In some of these products, substitutes for      beryllium can be used (e.g., titanium, stainless steel, and      some forms of bronze and aluminum). However, Energy and      Defense officials state there is no substitute for beryllium      in key nuclear components or in weapons for which lightweight      and strength are critical.       According to U.S. Public Health Service reports, people are      exposed to extremely low levels of naturally occurring      beryllium in the air, in many foods, in water, and in soil.      The highest exposures to beryllium tend to occur in the      workplace. Occupational exposure to beryllium occurs when it      is extracted from ore; when the ore is processed into      beryllium metal; and when this metal is made into parts      (e.g., machined, welded, cut, or ground). Today, beryllium is      used in many applications outside of the Defense and Energy      industries.       Health effects from high exposure to beryllium particles      were first noted in the early 20th century. Beginning in the      1940s, scientists linked exposure to beryllium with an      inflammatory lung condition now called chronic beryllium      disease, which is often debilitating and, in some cases,      fatal.       Research on the biomedical and environmental aspects of      beryllium is extensive.\3\ According to the National Jewish      Medical and Research Center (a nonprofit institution devoted      to respiratory, allergic, and immune system diseases),      beryllium primarily affects the lungs. The disease occurs      when people inhale beryllium dust, and it can develop even      after workers have been out of the beryllium industry for      many years. There are three main types of adverse health      effects associated with beryllium exposure:       Chronic beryllium disease is caused by an allergic-like      reaction to beryllium. Even brief exposure to very low levels      can lead to this disease, which often has a slow onset and      involves changes to lung tissue that reduce lung function.      The first evidence of what was to be called chronic beryllium      disease was identified in 1946. More recent studies indicate      that reaction to beryllium depends on the type of beryllium      and the work task.\4\ According to the National Jewish      Medical and Research Center, the disease occurs in 1 to 16      percent of exposed people, with the level of exposure that      poses risk and the precise mechanisms of disease not yet well      characterized.       Acute beryllium disease (symptoms lasting less than 1 year)      results from relatively high exposure to soluble beryllium      compounds (i.e., compounds that can be at least partially      dissolved). This disease usually has a quick onset and      resembles pneumonia       National and international organizations have identified      beryllium metal and compounds as carcinogenic to humans.      Studies involving workers in plants with high exposure during      the 1940s showed subsequent increases in mortality. The      magnitude of the risk from current occupational exposure      levels is not known, but may be minimal.         KEY EVENTS IN THE FEDERAL RESPONSE TO BERYLLIUM RISKS       The following illustrative key events involving Defense,      Energy, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration      (OSHA) document concerns and actions taken regarding      beryllium exposure risks. The events include (1) Defense's      decision to discontinue testing beryllium in rocket fuel by      1970, (2) OSHA's efforts in the 1970s and since 1998 to lower      the exposure limits, (3) Energy's steps to improve working      conditions and medical screening in the 1980s and 1990s, and      (4) Energy's 1999 rule on beryllium worker safety.     Defense discontinued testing of beryllium rocket propellant       Defense discontinued testing of rocket propellant      containing beryllium by 1970 due to the potential risk of      public exposure to hazardous levels of beryllium particles      released in rocket exhaust. According to an August 1969 Air      Force report, the Air Force and Advanced Research Projects      Agency began development of beryllium rocket propellant in      1959. Experiments in the 1960s showed that rocket payloads      could be increased 10 to 30 percent by using beryllium powder      in propellant. Research and development efforts later      expanded to include other Defense agencies and the National      Aeronautics and Space Administration.       As military and civilian agencies experimented with      beryllium in rocket fuel, they also pursued concerns about      beryllium's potential risks. For example, an August 1962      manufacturer's internal memorandum stated that officials      planned a visit from the Navy propellant plant at Indian      Head, Maryland, to discuss health and safety concerns in      handling beryllium powders at a test facility for solids fuel      propellants. When testing began to involve firing large      rocket motors that would release potentially hazardous levels      of beryllium particles into the air, concerns expanded to      include the general population in the vicinity of test      facilities.       In 1966, the U.S. Public Health Service requested the      National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council to      study the toxicity and hazards of beryllium propellant and      its compounds and to recommend air quality criteria. The      resulting March 1966 council report recommended a range of      less stringent limits for atmospheric contamination. The U.S.      Public Health Service concluded that release of any form of      beryllium above 75 micrograms per cubic meter of air could be      hazardous, and it did not adopt the council's recommendation      to change the release limit.       According to a 1985 Air Force report, as a result of the      U.S. Public Health Service decision, all beryllium propellant      and motor testing has been discontinued since 1970. Following      the U.S. Public Health Service decision, Defense issued a      directive in 1967 that in effect curtailed open-air firing of      beryllium-fueled rocket motors. The directive required that      the release of beryllium in all open-air firings fall within      the 75 microgram contamination limit, that exhaust from      rocket motors be filtered to meet the 75 microgram limit, or      that firings be conducted outside the continental limits of      the United States. According to the August 1969 Air Force      report, this directive severely limited development of      beryllium-fueled rocket motors. The report also indicated      that the 75 microgram contamination limit could not be met,      the equipment needed to filter exhaust to meet the 75      microgram limit was not available, and firing at remote      locations was expensive. The Environmental Protection Agency,      which is today responsible for air quality standards,      continues to limit such releases to the 75 microgram level.     OSHA actions to revise exposure standards       In 1971, OSHA adopted a beryllium standard developed by the      American National Standards Institute to control exposure to      beryllium in the workplace. OSHA subsequently began efforts      to determine whether this standard should be revised.       In a 1975 Federal Register notice outlining its proposal,      OSHA cited several issues raised by the revised standard,      including OSHA's decision to treat beryllium as a substance      that posed a carcinogenic risk to humans based on laboratory      animal data, the technical feasibility of achieving the      proposed exposure limits, and the methods of monitoring      airborne concentrations of beryllium. It solicited comments      from the public and received about 150 written comments and      40 requests for a public hearing. As a result, from August      through September 1977, OSHA held an informal rulemaking      hearing and heard testimony from 46 individuals representing      business, government, labor, and academia. Some commenters      questioned whether there was sufficient scientific evidence      to support a revision, whether employers (particularly      beryllium producers) could comply with lower exposure limits      with existing technology, and whether the cost of complying      with the proposed standard was excessive.       In 1978, while government panels were considering the      sufficiency of scientific evidence, the Secretaries of Energy      and Defense questioned the impact of the proposed standard on      the continued production of beryllium, which was important      for national defense. August 30, 1978, letters from the      Secretary of Energy to the Secretary of Labor and the      Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare noted that the      proposed standard would place a heavy burden on the two      primary beryllium producers in the United States, who might      stop producing beryllium. Specifically, the letter stated      that ``Clearly,     cessation of beryllium metal and/or beryllium oxide      production is unacceptable and would significantly degrade      our national defense effort.'' The Secretary agreed that      workers' health was paramount, but believed that the      scientific questions warranted an independent peer review.      The Secretary of Defense--in November 1978 letters to the      Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Health, Education,      and Welfare--echoed the Energy Secretary's concerns about      national security and the scientific evidence.       The first government panel reviewed human cancer studies,      but documents did not show whether or how the panel's review      was concluded. The Secretary of Health, Education, and      Welfare formed a second panel in 1978 to address three      questions. The questions were as follows: (1) Are the animal      studies credible in showing beryllium carcinogenicity       The second panel's consultants generally agreed that (1)      beryllium was an animal carcinogen, (2) no good information      existed on cancer involving beryllium-copper alloy, and (3)      epidemiological evidence was suggestive of an association      between beryllium exposure in the workplace and human lung      cancer (however, the data were only suggestive because of      alternative explanations for this association). In a 1978      report to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare,      the U.S. Surgeon General and the Assistant Surgeon General,      who oversaw the panel and reviewed the scientific evidence,      stated that the conclusion that beryllium was an animal      carcinogen required the Department of Health, Education, and      Welfare to recommend standard setting and that more      definitive answers were needed regarding the last two      questions.       Representatives from Defense, Energy, and OSHA met to      discuss the proposed OSHA standard in 1979. Concerns included      national security, technical feasibility, and the scientific      evidence. OSHA continued its efforts to finalize the standard      and prepare a draft rule at least through July 1980.      According to OSHA officials, work was discontinued in the      early 1980s because of other regulatory priorities such as      lead, electrical hazards, and occupational noise.       In 1998, OSHA announced that it was developing a      comprehensive standard on occupational exposure to beryllium.      In its announcement, the agency cited evidence of chronic      beryllium disease associated with beryllium exposure below      the 2 microgram limit, a new beryllium sensitivity test, and      conclusions that beryllium is a human carcinogen. Officials      from OSHA expect to propose a standard in 2001.       To develop information for this standard, OSHA contracted      with a private firm and has obtained preliminary data on      industries that use beryllium. It also issued a hazard      information bulletin on beryllium exposure in September 1999      to alert employers and employees about the potential hazards      of beryllium and to provide guidance on work practices needed      to control exposure.     Energy improved working conditions and medical screening          following new disease cases in the 1980s       Two Energy facilities that have large numbers of beryllium-     related workers are Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site      in Golden, Colorado, and the Oak Ridge Y-12 Plant in Oak      Ridge, Tennessee. Rocky Flats produced beryllium metal parts      for nuclear weapons from 1958 through 1998, but no longer has      any production role and is expected to be closed. Some      workers at Rocky Flats may encounter beryllium during the      environmental cleanup process at the facility. The Y-12 Plant      produces nuclear weapons parts from beryllium powder and has      other roles in the nuclear weapons program that may expose      workers to beryllium. Overall, as of March 2000, Energy had      identified at least 17 facilities that use or have used      beryllium. Energy's preliminary estimate is that       According to Energy documents, from the 1970s through 1984,      the incidence of chronic beryllium disease appeared to      significantly decline at Energy facilities. This apparent      reduction, along with the long latency period for the      disease, led Energy to assume that chronic beryllium disease      was occurring only among workers who had been exposed to high      levels of beryllium decades earlier, such as in the 1940s.      However, in 1984 a new case of chronic beryllium disease was      diagnosed in a worker employed in 1970 at Energy's Rocky      Flats facility. Several additional cases were diagnosed among      Rocky Flats workers in the following years, raising questions      about the adequacy of worker protection measures. In      response, Energy investigated the working conditions at Rocky      Flats and made improvements to ventilation in 1986 and also      improved working practices. Energy also instituted medical      screening programs for beryllium workers at risk of      developing chronic beryllium disease, making use of new      medical advances such as a new blood test. In addition,      Energy improved its practices for monitoring worker exposure.     Energy's Actions at Rocky Flats       After the new case of chronic beryllium disease was      diagnosed in June 1984, Energy's Albuquerque Operations      Office, which oversaw Rocky Flats, conducted an investigation      of working conditions at the plant's beryllium machine shop      to identify factors contributing to the disease case. The      investigation, reported in October 1984, identified      ventilation problems in the beryllium machine shop and      hazards from performing certain operations outside of      ventilation hoods, which are designed to collect and filter      out airborne beryllium particles. The investigation also      found that the affected worker had repeatedly been exposed to      beryllium at levels greater than the permissible exposure      limit of 2 micrograms per cubic meter of air (averaged over      an 8-hour period).       During the 1984 investigation, the Rocky Flats facility      began taking air samples from workers' ``breathing zones''      for the first time, using sampling devices placed on workers'      shirts or lapels. Previously, the facility had used ``area      monitoring,'' in which sampling devices were placed on      beryllium machines or other fixed locations in the work area.      Exposed levels measured by personal breathing zone sampling      were generally found to be higher than those measured by area      samplers. Several reasons could account for the differing      monitoring results, according to a 1996 research study and      Energy officials. Fixed area monitors were not always well-     placed to represent breathing zones.\18\ Also, fixed area      monitors placed on or near machines may not capture exposures      resulting from the use of hand-held tools or poor practices,      such as shaking out cloths used to clean machines.       Following the investigation, Rocky Flats remodeled the      ventilation system, eliminated most operations outside      ventilation hoods, imposed procedures for cleaning tools and       A second evaluation at Rocky Flats was conducted by the      National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, at the      request of a union's local chapter. This evaluation, which      was completed in May 1986 before the ventilation remodeling      was completed, concluded that a health hazard existed from      over-exposure to beryllium in the beryllium machine shop. The      Institute recommended that Rocky Flats routinely use personal      breathing zone sampling, conduct all beryllium machining      under exhaust ventilation, and conduct medical monitoring of      beryllium-exposed workers.     Improved Medical Testing       During the late 1980s, medical advances allowed for earlier      and easier detection of chronic beryllium disease and      sensitivity to beryllium. Beryllium sensitivity is an immune      system reaction, similar to an allergic reaction, which can      occur in some persons exposed to beryllium and that indicates      an increased risk of developing chronic beryllium disease. A      blood test for sensitivity, known as the beryllium lymphocyte      proliferation test, was refined during the late 1980s.      Another new diagnostic device, the flexible bronchoscope (a      tubular lighted device), provided a less invasive means for      examining the lungs for signs of chronic beryllium disease.       Energy and the National Jewish Medical and Research Center      first began using the newly-developed blood test on a trial      basis to identify workers sensitivity to beryllium at rocky      flats in 1987. Beginning in 1991, Energy established medical      screening programs for many additional current and former      Energy employees, using this blood text. For those identified      as having sensitivity to beryllium, Energy offered follow-up      medical exams to determine whether chronic beryllium disease      was present. Medical testing was provided in phases, due to      the funding levels available, according to an official in      Energy's Office of Occupational Medicine and Medical      Surveillance. Specifically, blood testing for current and      former Rocky Flats workers began on a routine basis in 1991,      for current Oak Ridge workers in 1991, for former Oak Ridge      workers in 1993, and for former workers at several other      facilities where workers could have been exposed to beryllium      in 1996 and 1997.       From 1984 through December 31, 1999, a total of 13,770      current and former workers (or about 69 percent of the      estimated 20,000 workers who may have been exposed to      beryllium) had been screened for definite or possible chronic      beryllium disease. Through this testing, 149 Energy workers      have been diagnosed with chronic beryllium disease. The      Assistant Secretary for Environment, Safety, and Health      states that of the 149 workers, 89 have been diagnosed with      chronic beryllium disease and another 60 have     Improved exposure monitoring       During the 1990s, Energy also expanded the use of personal      breathing zone monitoring at its facilities. For instance,      the Y-12 Plant at Oak Ridge took only 148 personal breathing      zone samples prior to 1990, but took 1,448 personal breathing      zone samples from 1990 through 1996. According to plant      officials, beginning in January 1998 and continuing through      fiscal year 1999, the Y-12 Plant sampled every beryllium      worker on every shift and reported the results back to the      workers the following day. More than 7,900 personal breathing      zone samples were collected during this period, according to      the plant's Industrial Hygiene Manager. The purposes of this      monitoring effort were to make workers more aware of safety      practices through immediate feedback, to identify any      practices needing improvement, and to address the monitoring      requirements states in a 1997 Energy notice on chronic      beryllium disease prevention (described below). The      Industrial Hygiene Manager for the Y-12 Plant told us that      the plant plans to continue using personal breathing zone      sampling routinely, sampling every worker in some locations      and using a statistically based sampling approach in      locations where more extensive data have already been      gathered.     Energy established a rule on beryllium worker safety in 1999          and proposed a beryllium worker compensation program       Energy issued a rule in December 1999 establishing      regulations to reduce beryllium exposure levels among its      workforce, to reduce the number of workers exposed to      beryllium, and to provide medical testing for exposed and      potentially exposed workers. This rule on chronic beryllium      disease prevention applied to federal, contractor, and      subcontractor employees at Energy facilities where there is      actual or potential exposure to beryllium. Energy has      identified 17 facilities affected by the rule. These      facilities have a total of about 8,100 workers who currently      are associated with beryllium activities. According to      officials in Energy's Office of Environment, Safety, and      Health, each Energy facility is currently evaluating how it      is affected by the new requirements in the rule. This review      may result in identifying additional facilities that are      affected by the rule. Several actions by Energy, such as a      survey of its facilities to identify those with beryllium      uses, preceded development of the final rule. In addition, in      November 1999, the Secretary of Energy announced a      legislative proposal to provide compensation for Energy      workers who have contracted chronic beryllium disease or      beryllium sensitivity.     Steps preceding issuance of DOE's rule       In 1996, Energy surveyed the contractors that manage and      operate its facilities concerning the extent of beryllium      usage and the estimated numbers of workers exposed to      beryllium. Following the survey, in July 1997, Energy issued      a notice to its offices     Energy's rule on chronic beryllium disease prevention       Energy's December 1999 rule on chronic beryllium disease      prevention includes a number of provisions designed to reduce      beryllium exposure among its workers. First, the rule adopts      OSHA's permissible exposure limit (currently 2 micrograms per      cubic meter averaged over an 8-hour period) or a more      stringent limit that may be promulgated by OSHA in the      future. Second, the rule establishes an action level that is      one-tenth of the permissible exposure limit, at which level      certain controls must be implemented. Controls required when      exposure reaches the action level include using respirators      and protective clothing, periodically monitoring beryllium      levels, setting annual goals for exposure reduction, and      limiting work area access to authorized personnel. The rule      requires that periodic monitoring occur at least quarterly      and that facilities use personal breathing zone monitoring.      In addition, some controls are required for any beryllium      work, regardless of the exposure level. These include      assessing hazards before beginning work tasks involving      beryllium, providing safety training to workers, and      providing respirators to any beryllium worker who requests      one.       Energy's rule includes two other types of beryllium limits.      First, the rule establishes limits for beryllium particles on      surfaces such as floors, tables, and the exterior of      machinery. Surface sampling must be conducted routinely, and      specified housekeeping methods must be used to keep beryllium      dust below the limits. Second, the rule sets limits called      release criteria for beryllium-contaminated equipment or      items. One limit is set for releasing equipment and items to      other facilities that perform beryllium work. A second, more      stringent level is set for releasing equipment and items for      re-use outside of Energy facilities or in non-beryllium areas      of Energy facilities.       Energy's rule requires that medical surveillance be      provided, on a voluntary basis, to all current workers with      known or potential exposure to beryllium. Beryllium workers'      annual health evaluations are to include blood tests for      beryllium sensitivity and a physical examination emphasizing      the respiratory system. These health evaluations are to be      provided at no cost to workers. If medical opinions so      indicate, employers at Energy facilities must offer to remove      workers from beryllium work and exposure. Individuals removed      from beryllium work must be provided the opportunity to      transfer to other work for which they are qualified or can be      trained in a short period. If a position is not available,      employers must provide such workers with their normal      earnings, benefits, and seniority for up to 2 years.     Worker compensation proposal       In November 1999, the Administration transmitted a      legislative proposal to the Congress to provide compensation      for current and former Energy workers with chronic beryllium      disease. The proposal covers employees of Energy and its      predecessor agencies, Energy contractors and subcontractors,      and beryllium vendors who sold beryllium to Energy. According      to Energy officials who helped develop the proposal,      employees of beryllium vendors were included because (1)      Energy's contracts with vendors through the early 1960s      generally required them to apply the same worker safety      provisions that Energy used in its own facilities and (2) the      vendors manufactured beryllium parts to government      specifications and for the sole use of the government.      Affected workers would be eligible to receive reimbursement      for medical costs, assistance for impairment or vocational      rehabilitation, and compensation for lost wages. Workers with      sensitivity to beryllium could also be reimbursed for medical      costs involved in tracking their condition. In an      announcement regarding this proposal, the Secretary of Energy      noted that the proposal would reverse Energy's past practice      of opposing and litigating most worker health compensation      claims. The Administration's proposed legislation was      introduced in the House and the Senate in November 1999. Two      other bills concerning compensation for beryllium workers      have also been introduced in the House and are pending.     Agency comments and our evaluation       We provided the Departments of Energy, Labor, and Defense      with a draft of this report for their review and comment.      They generally agreed with the information in the report and      provided technical changes, which we incorporated as      appropriate. Energy's written comments are in appendix II. An      official of the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of      Defense for Environmental Security orally concurred with the      information in our report and suggested changes to clarify      data on air monitoring and medical testing. An official of      Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration orally      concurred with the information in our report and suggested      changes to clarify terminology and to expand data on      beryllium as a human carcinogen.       We will provide copies of this report to the Honorable      William S. Cohen, Secretary of Defense; the Honorable Bill      Richardson, the Secretary of Energy; the Honorable Alexis      Herman, the Secretary of Labor; and other interested parties.

More specifically, we were asked to examine key events      at the Departments of Energy and Defense and at Labor's      Occupational Safety and Health Administration.       To obtain information on beryllium uses and risks, we      reviewed documentation such as agency studies and reports and      interviewed officials at Energy, Defense, Labor, and the      Occupational Safety and Health Administration headquarters.      We reviewed current and archived data and reports from the      U.S. Public Health Service; the National Jewish Medical and      Research Center, Denver, Colorado; Brush Wellman, Inc. (one      of     two producers of beryllium in the United States)      headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio; and the Lovelace      Respiratory Research Institute, Albuquerque, New Mexico.       We selected key events during the 1960s through 1990s      involving Energy, Defense, and Labor to illustrate agency      responses to beryllium uses and risks. For each event, we      screened current and archived records for documentation such      as agency hearing records, studies, correspondence, and      reports; we interviewed agency officials to identify agency      positions; and we followed up on agency officials' interviews      with other parties, to ensure the accuracy of our report.       For Energy, we contacted headquarters staff in the Offices      of Environment, Safety and Health; the General Counsel;      Defense Programs; Science; and Nuclear Energy, Science and      Technology; and field staff from Defense facilities,      including Rocky Flats, Colorado; Oak Ridge Y-12 Plant,      Tennessee; Los Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico; and      Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, California. We      obtained data on exposure sampling; working conditions;      medical screening efforts; workplace controls; policy,      practices, and procedures; and the rule, proposed      legislation, and associated history.       For Defense overview information, we contacted staff from      the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Environmental      Security; the military service headquarters; the U.S. Army      Center for health Promotion and Preventive Medicine, Aberdeen      Proving Ground, Maryland; the Navy Environmental Health      Center, Norfolk, Virginia; the Air Force Institute for      Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health Risk Analysis,      Brooks Air Force Base, Texas; and selected subordinate      commands. Regarding beryllium rocket fuel, we also visited      the Air Force Research Laboratory, Edwards Air Force Base,      California. We obtained background information from the      headquarters of the National Aeronautics and Space      Administration, its Langley Research Center, and the Chemical      Propulsion Information Agency, Columbia, Maryland.       For Labor, we interviewed current and former staff from the      Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and health      Administration and the Department of Health and Human      Services' National Institute for Occupational Safety and      Health. We obtained and examined the complete transcript of      the August-September 1977 informal hearing on beryllium, as      well as key documents available from hearing records and      related archive files.       This report was reviewed for classification by an      authorized derivative classifier at Energy and was determined      to be unclassified. We conducted our review from June 1999      through April 2000 in accordance with generally accepted      government auditing standards.                                  ____                              Appendix II                 Comments from The Department of Energy                                              Department of Energy                                   Washington, DC, April 27, 2000.
