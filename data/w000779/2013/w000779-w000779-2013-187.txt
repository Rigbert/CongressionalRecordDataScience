President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that the Injunction of Secrecy be removed from the following treaties transmitted to the Senate on April 22, 2013, by the President of the United States:  Convention on the Conservation and Management of High Seas Fishery Resources in the South Pacific Ocean, Treaty Document No. 113-1; Convention on the Conservation and Management of High Seas Fisheries Resources in the North Pacific Ocean, Treaty Document No. 113-2; and amendment to the Convention of Future Multilateral Cooperation in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries, Treaty Document No. 113-3.  I further ask that the treaties be considered as having been read the first time, they be referred with the accompanying papers to the Committee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed, and that the President's messages be printed in the Record.
