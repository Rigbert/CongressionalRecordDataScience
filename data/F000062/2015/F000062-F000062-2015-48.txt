 President, I would like to respond to that because we have been told that for the industries that support this bill, this amendment is a bill killer, and the opposition to it has come in far and wide. We have 52 industrial associations in business, finance, banking, petroleum, waterworks, railroads, public power, real estate, and retail--52 associations that are on your desk--supporting it. In particular, the health industry has weighed in against this amendment.  We accomplished the purpose in our bill in a way that is acceptable. Please vote no.  I yield the floor.
