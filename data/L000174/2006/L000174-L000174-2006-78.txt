Many Vermont families, including mine, frequently travel to Canada to visit family members living there or to spend a weekend in the beautiful cities of Montreal or Quebec City. Similarly, our Canadian friends enjoy many Vermont treasures, including our ski resorts and our own ``great lake,'' Lake Champlain. In 2003, more than 2 million Canadians visited Vermont, spending $188 million while here.  Additionally, Vermont has a number of small towns along the border that depend on access to neighboring Canadian towns. In some cases, these towns share emergency assistance, grocery stores, and other basic services. Residents sometimes cross the border on foot several times a day just to conduct routine business. Other northern border States enjoy similar trade and tourism benefits with Canada and could face significant downturns in their economies if this law is not implemented properly.  At a cost of about $100, passports are an expensive hardship for many, especially families would not otherwise travel abroad. The proposed PASS Card is a less costly alternative but also raises a number of new concerns, including issues of privacy and effectiveness. On top of that, DHS and State are still arguing over what technology to embed in the card. I find it highly unlikely that the State Department will be able to process the flood of requests for passports and PASS cards that will come from this initiative by the deadline when key decisions have still not been made.
