Perhaps it will be of some comfort to the Senator from Ohio to know that the language in this regard was suggested to our committee by Senator Roberts and comes from his bill. There is very strong language regarding the issue the Senator has raised.  Mr. DeWINE. I appreciate that. If my colleague could answer this: In a real-world situation, when we are dealing with satellites--and we will not go into the countries on the floor--if a decision had to be made in a matter of hours, if we need this information and we need to move from here to there, could that be ordered? I am using the word ``ordered.'' I am not talking about consultation or prayer together. I am talking about ordering it. Can that be ordered? Can this person order this to be done, saying it will be done, I don't care what anybody else says?
