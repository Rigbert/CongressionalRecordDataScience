Speaker, I also wanted to mention that Congressman Stokes' beautiful wife, Jeanette, who was at his side through all his years of service; his daughters, Angela, Shelley, Lori; his son, Chuck; and seven grandchildren.  What an amazing family--the Stokes family has made many contributions to Ohio and to our country, but I think Jeanette and Congressman Stokes are proudest of the children and grandchildren that they have raised. They have represented the family well during this most difficult time.                      Honoring Speaker Jim Wright
