Mr. Chairman, I am deeply troubled and anguished by what is happening in Bosnia.  We all share the pain and the suffering. We have seen the horror. Women are raped, children are brutalized, and young men are taken away to an uncertain fate--often death.  These people of Bosnia are part of the family of humankind. When they bleed, we bleed. When they suffer, we suffer. When they are slaughtered and killed, something dies in all of us.  What is happening in this part of the world is an affront to all humanity. We--as the community of nations--cannot, and we must not, stand by in the face of this carnage.  I--like everyone else--have watched in anguish as the United Nations failed to defend the safe areas in Bosnia.  But I know that the British and French have troops in Bosnia. Lifting the embargo is not so simple or clear. We will send troops to help remove the U.N. forces if we lift the arms embargo.  How many of us are prepared to send American troops--our young men and women--to Bosnia to fight in this conflict?  A vote for this resolution is a vote to send American troops into Bosnia. Every member of this body must know this. This vote is not a free vote. This vote has consequences.  The question is not whether to stop the violence. We all want to stop the violence. The question is how to stop the violence. Will unilaterally lifting the embargo bring peace to this region? Or will it spread the conflict and increase the toll of death and destruction?  We must strengthen our resolve to defend innocent men, women, and children. But we cannot act alone.  We must give this fresh plan a chance. The U.N. must allow NATO to defend the safe areas.  Mr. Chairman, we all are frustrated. All of humanity is crying out for a solution to this conflict. This vote is our attempt to act, to do something.  But we must not move this way. We must strengthen our U.N. mission. If it does not work, then later we may have to act on our own.  American willingness to work with the community of nations is at stake. Our allies have troops on the ground--they are in harm's way.  Mr. Chairman, I stand here with a heavy heart--I want to do what is right. I want to end the genocide.  I have thought long and hard about this vote. I have searched my soul and conscience, and I have concluded now is not the time to unilaterally lift the arms embargo. It will not help stop the killing. It will not end the bloodshed.  We must urge the United Nations to stop the violence--to stop the Serbian aggression. We must protect the innocent people of Bosnia. We must protect the safe areas.  Now is not the time to get lost in a sea of despair. With our allies, we have taken a stand against Serbian aggression. Now we must be strong in that stand. Mr. Chairman, I will oppose this resolution.                              {time}  1400
