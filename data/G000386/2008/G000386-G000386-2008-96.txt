 I have come to follow up on that speech of 2 days ago to talk about the recent history of speeches that were made in past Presidential elections and the tax policy that was associated with those speeches and in another day or two, come to the floor to speak about the different tax policies between Senator Obama on the one hand and Senator McCain on the other hand.  History is very important. Elections have consequences. Policy coming out of an election has consequences and eventually affects real people. The impact upon the voter of past elections, what people said in those elections, what happened after the election in policy, ought to be things people are taking into consideration for the upcoming Presidential election. As to that speech I gave 2 days ago, I want to go back and remind my colleagues of a couple of comments I made at that particular time.  At various times during the past 25 years, we have had times when Democrats have controlled both the Presidency and the Congress. There have been times when the Democrats have controlled Congress and we had a Republican President. And there have been times when we have had both a Republican President and a Republican Congress. Tax cuts or tax increases have resulted from that. And you find a pretty good pattern of when you have both a Democratic Congress and a Democratic President that you have big tax increases, as is the case in 1993--if you remember the big tax increase of 1993.  Then there are periods of time when we have had a Republican President and a Republican Congress and you can see tax decreases--very deep decreases in taxes. Then you have a period of time in here where there was a little flurry--some tax cuts, some tax increases--when we had a Republican President and a Democratic Congress.  So elections do have consequences. Another chart that would show it a little better and more specifically would be this thermometer chart, where we have it very clear that when you have times when you have a Democratic President and a Democratic Congress, you have some of the biggest tax increases in history. And that would be this figure. There are times we have had a Republican President and a Democratic Congress with some tax increases but a little bit less. There are times we have had a Democratic President and a Republican Congress with slight tax decreases.  When you have a Republican President, a Republican Senate, and a Democratic House, you have some tax decreases but not very much. Then you have times when you have a Republican President, a Democratic Senate, and a Republican House, and you have tax decreases but not by very much. Then you have times when you have a Republican President and a Republican Congress and you have deep tax cuts.  So what this chart shows--this thermometer--over the last 25 years, is that if you have Republican Presidents and Republican Congresses you have deep tax cuts. When you have Democrats controlling both the Presidency and the Congress, you have very rapid tax increases. So elections do have consequences.  I want to go now to a period of time of a specific election and the tax consequences that came as a result of that election. But I think you have to realize that the relationship is clear from the past 25 years: the more relative power Democrats have, the higher the probability of a tax increase. So Americans will need to think long and hard about campaign promises of tax relief as they consider their choices in this Presidential election. The reason is that history shows very clearly, if Democrats obtain the White House and control of Congress, taxes are certain to go up. And not just go up on the wealthy but across the board.  Today, I would like to follow up last week's discussion. This week, I want to focus on a campaign season most like this one and take a look at how the victors in that campaign used their taxing power once sworn in. The period I am thinking about is 16 years ago. Well, in 16 years you can learn a lot from history, and I think people ought to be reminded of it.  But before I get into details, I would like to say that I hope this election doesn't go the same way that it did 16 years ago because President Bill Clinton was elected. I want people to be clear that I am pulling for a Republican colleague, Senator McCain, to defeat another one of our Senate colleagues, Senator Obama.  So let's turn the clock back to this time 16 years ago, and I have another chart. This chart considers the story of Rip Van Winkle, which I think is very appropriate during this period of time. You know the story about Rip Van Winkle. He was a person who slept for 20 years. Here is the chart showing Rip Van Winkle.  If you round up just a little bit, it is almost 20 years since that 1992 campaign, and you will see from this chart those events from a while ago might have led to a form of tax hike amnesia.  If we go back to the 1992 campaign--and I will show you eventually how this is pretty appropriate to the campaign coming up--in 1992, you find a very charismatic, a very likable, a very articulate young Governor from Arkansas barnstorming across the country. Bill Clinton was 46 years old, facing a 47th birthday in mid-August. He was widely acknowledged as the most talented public speaker on the Presidential scene since Ronald Reagan.  America had been in a recession at that time. Although it was not reported until after the election, which is something you might expect from our liberal media, the American economy had recovered in the latter half of 1992, but it was not officially announced until the day after the 1992 election, when all of a sudden the recession was over, just because of the election. But all during that election, reading the media, you would always be reminded about the recession we were in. But magically, election day 1992, 1 day later, and the recession was over.  The charismatic Democratic Presidential candidate promised to focus, in his words, ``like a laser beam'' on the economic ills that Americans worried about. In a key speech on June 21, 1992,this ``different kind of a Democrat'' laid out his economic plan. He called the plan ``Putting People First.'' I am going to focus in a laser-like way on then-Governor Clinton's tax agenda that he announced for that 1992 campaign.  In that speech, candidate Clinton was very critical of the marginal tax rate relief that President Reagan had put into effect. To quote candidate Clinton:       For more than a decade, this country has been rigged in      favor of the rich and the special interests.  And we still hear that today.       While the very wealthiest Americans get richer, middle-     class Americans pay more to their government and get less in      return. For 12 years, the driving idea behind American      economic policy has been cutting taxes on the richest      individuals and corporations and hoping their new wealth      would ``trickle down'' to the rest of us.  That is a quote from his speech of June 21, 1992.  As a relief from this version of the middle-class squeeze, candidate Clinton proposed middle-income tax relief, and here is what he said:       Middle class tax fairness. Virtually every industrialized      nation recognizes the importance of strong families in its      Tax Code. We should too. We will lower the tax burden on      middle class Americans by forcing the rich to pay their fair      share. Middle class taxpayers will have a choice between a      children's tax credit and a significant reduction in income      tax rate.  Now, doesn't all of this sound very familiar to speeches that are going on this year? I have quoted from a June 21, 1992, speech given by candidate Clinton, but you would think that you are hearing exactly the same thing this year.  Now, let's get down to basic facts. The definitions of rich and middle class are always open. They probably vary from candidate to candidate and everything with intellectual honesty and where you might set rich and where you might set middle class. A person who is rich in Mason City, IA, might be middle class in New York City.  An irony I continue to notice around here relates to this point. It seems as if the politicians from the highest income, highest cost of living, highest taxed States seem to be the most obsessed with raising taxes on their Presidential candidate's definition of the rich. In this case, I am referring to a single person who makes $125,000, or double it for a married couple to $250,000. That seems to be the dividing line between the rich and other people, according to the 2008 Democratic Presidential candidate.  Now, is $250,000 a rich family in Manhattan? Is $250,000 a rich family in San Francisco? Is $250,000 a rich family in Chicago? Is $250,000 a rich family in Boston? By the definition of Senators from those areas, I guess I would have to say it is. Do those families in those cities know they are rich and that their Senators think they pay too little tax?  But I digress. In candidate Clinton's economic plan that was announced on June 21, 1992, the rich were--put another way--the top 2 percent income earners in the United States. On September 8, 1992, candidate Bill Clinton said:       The only people who will pay more income taxes are the      wealthiest 2 percent, those living in households making more      than $200,000 per year.  By definition, you would think under candidate Clinton's plan that everybody below that level of 2 percent, or $200,000, is either middle class or low income. Now, remember what I said that he said--the only people who will pay more income taxes are the wealthiest 2 percent--because I am going to show you, after being sworn in, how that turned out to be a heck of a lot more people than the wealthiest 2 percent.  On January 20, 1993, President Clinton was inaugurated. Democrats retained their solid majority, 56 to 44, in this body. Although losing 9 seats in the U.S. House, the Democrats retained a heavy majority of 258 to 176. Once elected, the Democratic White House and the Democratic Congress converted the campaign economic plan, as you would expect them to, into a legislative blueprint. A key feature of the program, the middle-class tax cut, was thrown to the side.  On January 14, 2003, at a press conference, President-elect Clinton stated:       From New Hampshire forward, for reasons that absolutely      mystify me, the press thought the most important issue in the      race was a middle-class tax cut. I never did meet any voter      who thought that.  Now, how do you reconcile the contents of the economic plan and the shift in position after the election? Pulitzer Prize winning author Bob Woodward--who I think has a great deal of respect among most people of the Senate--wrote a comprehensive book about the first part of the Clinton administration. It was titled ``The Agenda.'' Mr. Woodward, of the Washington Post, described it this way:       While Clinton continued to defend his middle-class tax cut      publicly, he privately expressed the view to his advisers      that it was intellectually dishonest.  That is Woodward saying that, not Chuck Grassley. The late journalist, Michael Kelly, in an article in the New York Times, explained how the newly elected President planned to ``escape'' from his middle-class tax cut campaign promise. Here is what Mr. Kelly wrote, in part:       [T]he President built himself an escape hatch a little less      than a month before Election Day. Every time Clinton said      ``I'm not going to raise taxes on the middle class,'' he      always added the phrase ``to pay for my programs,'' said a      chief political adviser to the President, who spoke on      condition of anonymity. He never, never, said just, ``I will      not raise taxes on the middle class.'' He always said ``I      will not raise middle-class taxes to pay for my      programs.''  Madam President, I want to have Mr. Kelly's article printed in the Record. I ask unanimous consent to do that.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Jan. 26, 1993] Political Memo; Re-examining the Fine Print On Clinton's Tax Promises                           (By Michael Kelly)       At a time when the public has repeatedly shown its distaste      for the maneuvers and machinations of politics, President      Clinton's White House is banking on a five-word loophole to      save it from voter outrage should Mr. Clinton propose a      broad-based energy tax.       During the campaign, Mr. Clinton promised tax cuts for the      middle class. Now Mr. Clinton and his chief economic advisers      are backing away from the tax cut and strongly hinting that      an energy tax will hit the middle class the hardest.       ``They campaigned on a middle-class tax cut and then four      days into a new Administration the chief economic spokesman      is talking about a middle-class tax increase,'' said Robert      S. McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal      research group. ``That's a flip-flop.''       Although Vice President Al Gore and Treasury Secretary      Lloyd Bentsen have mentioned the possibility of an energy tax      in recent interviews, the President and his advisers insisted      today that their economic plan was still under discussion and      that no decision had been made.       Still some Clinton advisers say they are not worried about      public outrage. They say the President built himself an      escape hatch a little less than a month before Election Day.       ``Every time Clinton said `I'm not going to raise taxes on      the middle class,' he always added the phrase ``to pay for my      programs,'' said a chief political adviser to the President,      who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``He never, never,      said just, 'I will not raise taxes on the middle class.' He      always said `I will not raise middle-class taxes to pay for      my programs.' ''       By this logic, the adviser said, Mr. Clinton's legalistic      construct was a ``distinction with a difference'' that allows      him ``the opportunity he now has'' to raise taxes without      incurring voter wrath.       But of late that sort of politics-by-loophole has not been      playing well.       In 1990, President George Bush signed an agreement with      Congress that obliged him to break his ``read my lips''      campaign promise of 1988 not to raise taxes. Mr. Bush and his      advisers reasoned that voters had never taken his promise      seriously in the first place and would forgive its being      breached. The voters reacted with far more anger than      understanding, and Mr. Bush never regained their trust when      the economy turned sour.       In recent weeks, the gulf between Washington's view of what      constituted acceptable behavior and that of many voters was      again demonstrated in the matter of Zoe Baird. Mr. Clinton      pressed forward with his choice of Ms. Baird as Attorney      General despite the disclosure that she had once hired      illegal aliens. Mr. Clinton and his advisers figured      voters would forgive Ms. Baird what they considered a      small transgression in an otherwise impressive career.       The voters, recalling Mr. Clinton's emotional promises to      run a Government for the ``people who pay their taxes and      play by the rules,'' saw him as trying to give a break to a      rich woman who had done neither and forced Ms. Baird's      withdrawal. Some See a Liability.       Mr. Clinton's aides know full well that Mr. Bush's mistake      helped cost him his job. But they still contend that Mr.      Clinton is protected by his escape clause. ``People won't get      away with saying Clinton promised that     he was not going to raise taxes and then did,'' the adviser      said. ``He had many opportunities to make a `read my lips'      statement, and he did not.''       Some outside the Clinton camp disagree strongly with that      logic, however.       Kevin Phillips, a Republican political analyst who charted      the rise of middle-class anger in the late 1980's and spared      no criticism of Mr. Bush's broken promises, said: ``At the      most recent count, only 800,000 Americans were lawyers, and I      don't think the 248 million or so who are not lawyers are      going to buy a caveat stuck on in the middle of a passionate      plea to the middle-class voters that they should vote for him      because he was going to save them. Talk about reading his      lips.''       Mr. Clinton introduced the escape clause on taxes for the      middle class before a national audience in an Oct. 19      Presidential debate in Richmond. ``I will not raise taxes on      the middle class to pay for these programs,'' he said. `Very      Conscious Decision'       Listeners without the benefit of law-school training might      have taken that as a pledge to not raise taxes on the middle      class. But the President's adviser said Mr. Clinton had      purposefully used, and reiterated, the phrase ``for these      programs'' to allow himself a way out of what careless voters      might have thought they had been promised.       ``It was a very conscious decision on his part,'' the      adviser said. ``I can tell you this from strategy sessions      and debate prep sessions. The idea of a flat-out promise of      `I will not raise taxes on the middle class, period,' was      rejected by the President. He refused to allow himself to be      boxed in that way.''       The matter of the escape clause illustrates a larger point      about Mr. Clinton that has become increasingly Obvious: It is      always wise to read the fine print. The fine print of Mr.      Clinton's promise on the tax cut for the middle class was      quite different from the broad thrust of his oratory on the      subject.       For a year, the Democrat campaigned on a platform of      economic renewal in which the Federal deficit could be halved      in four years rather painlessly by raising taxes on rich      people and foreign corporations and by improving the way      Government programs are managed.       In ``Putting People First,'' Mr. Clinton's often-touted      plan for American renewal, the candidate promised: ``We will      lower the tax burden on middle-class Americans by asking the      very wealthy to pay their fair share. Middle-class taxpayers      will have a choice between a children's tax credit or a      significant reduction in their income-tax rate.''       On July 13, speaking to reporters in New York, Mr. Clinton      said flatly, ``I'm not going to raise taxes on the middle      class,'' according to reports by The Chicago Tribune and the      Reuters news service. On the same day, in an interview shown      by Cable News Network, he said, ``I don't think we should      raise middle-class individuals' taxes, because their income      went down and their tax rates were raised'' in the 1980's.       But in the fall campaign, when his words were scrupulously      followed by a larger audience, Mr. Clinton took more care.      After the Richmond debate, he regularly re-stated the      position that his promise to the middle class was only that      he would not raise their taxes ``to pay for these programs.''
