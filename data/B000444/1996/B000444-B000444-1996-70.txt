 President, I think it is a mistake, but in fact the Congress has agreed--any subsidy would end by the year 2001. The only reasonable way for that to occur, Mr. President, is if in fact we are able to get that half-cent trust fund set up. But whether we get that or not, in the year 2001 this is gone. I think Amtrak made a mistake agreeing to that, to be completely honest with my friend. But that is the answer to the question.  The drop-dead date is the year 2001. In my view, they will not make it--to be completely candid with my friend--they will not make it unless they get that half-cent trust fund.  Mr. McCAIN. I yield myself an additional 30 seconds.
