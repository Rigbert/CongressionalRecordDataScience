Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 6213, the No More Solyndras Act, as I believe it serves as a critical step in correcting the glaring missteps of the Department of Energy's failed loan guarantee program. Through a lack of due diligence, and apparent political pressure, the Obama Administration risked tax dollars in companies whose failures should have been foreseeable. Congress must learn from thesemistakes and ensure that future tax dollars are not wasted.  I am greatly troubled that several of the initial recipients of the section 1705 loan guarantee program have declared bankruptcy. The most high profile of these was Solyndra, the California solar company that received $535 million in loan guarantees, but DOE also bet wrong by supporting Beacon Power, Ener 1, and Abound Solar. After Solyndra's failure, Congress investigated how DOE was awarding its money. We found that DOE ignored obvious deficiencies in these companies' business structures and rushed much of the decision making process in the name of political expedience. To put it bluntly, DOE attempted to pick winners and losers and it failed miserably.  When news of this reckless use of tax dollars became public, my constituents were rightfully outraged. In a time of record debt, DOE's gambling with tax dollars on shaky companies is indefensible. The American people expect more from their government. However, in an apparent disregard for its history of failures, DOE is insisting that it will continue to consider loan guarantees, putting millions more tax dollars at risk.  The No More Solyndras Act takes the necessary steps to protect the American taxpayer. By sunsetting DOE's loan guarantee authority, we are shielding taxpayers from future losses associated with these risky loans. Further, greater transparency and ensuring no subordination of tax dollars are important to providing taxpayer protection. While I would like for more aggressive legislation that would end the loan guarantee program altogether, I believe the No More Solyndras Act is needed to begin correcting the flaws of the DOE program.  The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5-minute rule.  In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on Energy and Commerce, printed in the bill, it shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 112-31. That amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read.  The text of the amendment in the nature of a substitute is as follows:                               H.R. 6213       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``No More Solyndras Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress makes the following findings:       (1) President Obama took office amidst a weak economy and      high unemployment, yet he remained committed to advancing an      expansive ``green jobs'' agenda that received substantial      funding with the passage of the American Recovery and      Reinvestment Act of 2009, commonly known as the stimulus      package.       (2) The stimulus package allocated $90 billion to various      green energy programs, and related appropriations provided      $47 billion for loan guarantees authorized under title XVII      of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 16511 et seq.).       (3) Such title XVII authorized the Secretary of Energy to      issue loan guarantees for projects that avoid, reduce, or      sequester air pollutants or greenhouse gases and employ new      or significantly improved technologies compared with      commercial technologies in service at the time the guarantee      is issued.       (4) Loan guarantees issued under such title XVII were      required to provide a reasonable prospect of repayment and      were expressly required to be subject to the condition that      the obligation is not subordinate to other financing.       (5) The stimulus package expanded such title XVII by adding      section 1705 to include projects that use commercial      technology for renewable energy systems, electric power      transmission systems, and leading-edge biofuels projects and      by appropriating $6,000,000,000 in funding to pay the credit      subsidy costs for section 1705 loan guarantees for projects      that commence construction no later than September 30, 2011.       (6) The Department of Energy, since the enactment of the      stimulus package, has issued loan guarantees under such title      XVII for 28 projects totaling $15,100,000,000 under the      section 1705 program, and, according to the Government      Accountability Office, issued conditional loan guarantees for      four projects totaling $4,400,000,000 under the section 1705      program and four projects totaling $10,600,000,000 under the      section 1703 program.       (7) Three of the first five companies that received section      1705 loan guarantees for their projects, Solyndra, Inc.,      Beacon Power Corporation, and Abound Solar, Inc., have      declared bankruptcy.       (8) The bankruptcy of the first section 1705 loan guarantee      recipient, Solyndra, Inc., could result in a loss to      taxpayers of over $530,000,000.       (9) The investigation of the Solyndra loan guarantee by the      Committee on Energy and Commerce has demonstrated that the      review in 2009 of the Solyndra application by the Department      of Energy and the Office of Management and Budget was driven      by politics and ideology and divorced from economic reality      where the Department of Energy ignored concerns about the      company's financial condition and market for its products.       (10) Despite an express provision in such title XVII      prohibiting subordination of the United States taxpayers'      financial interest, the Department of Energy restructured the      Solyndra loan guarantee in February 2011, resulting in the      taxpayers losing priority to Solyndra's investors in the      event of a default.       (11) The Inspector General of the Department of the      Treasury concluded that it was unclear whether the Department      of Energy's consultation requirement with the Secretary of      the Treasury on the Solyndra loan guarantee was met; that the      consultation that did occur was rushed with the Department of      the Treasury expressing that ``the train really has left the      station on this deal''; and that no documentation was      retained as to how the Department of the Treasury's serious      concerns with the loan guarantee were addressed.       (12) The Government Accountability Office concluded that      the Department of Energy Loan Guarantee Program under title      XVII has treated applicants inconsistently; that the      Department of Energy did not follow its own process for      reviewing applications and documenting its analysis and      decisions, increasing the likelihood of taxpayer exposure to      financial risk from a default; and that the Department of      Energy's absence of adequate documentation made it difficult      for the Department to defend its decisions on loan guarantees      as sound and fair.       (13) A memorandum prepared for the President dated October      25, 2010, from Carol Browner, Ron Klain, and Larry Summers,      principal advisors to the President, noted the risk presented      by loan guarantee projects because most of the projects had      little ``skin in the game'' from private investors.       (14) A January 2012 report conducted at the request of the      Chief of Staff to the President concluded that the portfolio      of projects the Department of Energy included in the loan      program were higher risk investments that private capital      markets do not generally invest in.       (15) The Department of Energy's section 1705 program has      expired but the Department of Energy has announced that it      will continue to consider applications for loan guarantees      under the section 1703 program.       (16) The Department of Energy has approximately      $34,000,000,000 in remaining lending authority to issue new      loan guarantees under the section 1703 program.     SEC. 3. SUNSET.       (a) No New Applications.--The Secretary of Energy shall not      issue any new loan guarantee pursuant to title XVII of the      Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 16511 et seq.) for any      application submitted to the Department of Energy after      December 31, 2011.       (b) Pending Applications.--With respect to any application      submitted pursuant to section 1703 or 1705 of the Energy      Policy Act of 2005 before December 31, 2011:       (1) No guarantee shall be made until the Secretary of the      Treasury has provided to the Secretary of Energy a written      analysis of the financial terms and conditions of the      proposed loan guarantee, pursuant to section 1702(a) of the      Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 16512(a)).       (2) The Secretary of the Treasury shall transmit the      written analysis required under paragraph (1) to the      Secretary of Energy not later than 30 days after receiving      the proposal from the Secretary of Energy.       (3) Before making a guarantee under such title XVII, the      Secretary of Energy shall take into consideration the written      analysis made by the Secretary of the Treasury under      paragraph (1).       (4) If the Secretary of Energy makes a guarantee that is      not consistent with the written analysis provided by the      Secretary of the Treasury under paragraph (1), not later than      30 days after making such guarantee the Secretary of Energy      shall transmit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce and      the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House      of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural      Resources of the Senate a written explanation of any material      inconsistencies.       (c) Transparency.--       (1) Reports to congress.--Not later than 60 days after      making a guarantee as provided in subsection (b), the      Secretary of Energy shall transmit to the Committee on Energy      and Commerce and the Committee on Science, Space, and      Technology of the House of Representatives and the Committee      on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate a report that      includes information regarding--       (A) the review and decisionmaking process utilized by the      Secretary in making the guarantee;       (B) the terms of the guarantee;       (C) the recipient; and       (D) the technology and project for which the loan guarantee      will be used.       (2) Protecting confidential business information.--A report      under paragraph (1) shall provide all relevant information,      but the Secretary shall take all necessary steps to protect      confidential business information with respect to the      recipient of the loan guarantee and the technology used.     SEC. 4. RESTRUCTURING OF LOAN GUARANTEES.       With respect to any restructuring of the terms of a loan      guarantee issued pursuant to title XVII of the Energy Policy      Act of 2005, the Secretary of Energy shall consult with the      Secretary of the Treasury regarding any restructuring of the      terms and conditions of the loan guarantee, including any      deviations from the financial terms of the loan guarantee.     SEC. 5. RESTATING THE PROHIBITION ON SUBORDINATION.       Section 1702(d)(3) of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42      U.S.C. 16512(d)(3)) is amended by striking ``is not      subordinate'' and inserting ``, including any reorganization,      restructuring, or termination thereof, shall not at any time      be subordinate''.     SEC. 6. ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS AND CIVIL PENALTIES.       (a) In General.--Any Federal official who is responsible      for the issuance of a loan guarantee under title XVII of the      Energy Policy Act of 2005 in a manner that violates the      requirements of such title or of this Act shall be--       (1) subject to appropriate administrative discipline      provided for under title 5 of the United States Code, or any      other applicable Federal law, including, when circumstances      warrant, suspension from duty without pay or removal from      office; and       (2) personally liable for a civil penalty in an amount of      at least $10,000 but not more than $50,000 for each      violation.

The CHAIR. No amendment to that amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be in order except those printed in House Report 112-668. Each such amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the report, by a Member designated in the report, shall be considered read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the report, equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question.                 Amendment No. 1 Offered by Ms. DeGette  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in House Report 112-668.  Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:       Page 2, after line 21, insert the following new paragraph:       (6) The Department of Energy estimates that projects funded      under the title XVII program are expected to create 60,000      jobs.       Page 3, lines 13 through 21, amend paragraph (9) to read as      follows:       (9) An investigation by the Subcommittee on Oversight and      Investigation of the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the      House of Representatives determined that the Solyndra loan      determination was based on the best professional judgment of      career Department of Energy and Office of Management and      Budget officials, without political or ideological      interference from Obama Administration political appointees      or career officials.       Page 3, lines 22 through 24, strike ``Despite an express''      and all that follows through ``financial interest,'' and      insert ``Title XVII provides that taxpayer interests cannot      be subordinated in the origination of a loan, but does not      state whether subordination is allowed during restructuring      of a loan. The Department of Energy General Counsel      determined that in such cases subordination was allowed under      the law, and''.       Page 4, after line 14, insert the following new paragraph:       (12) Department of the Treasury officials testified before      the Subcommittee on Energy and Power of the Committee on      Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives on      October 14, 2011, and stated that their consultation on the      Solyndra loan guarantee was not rushed. In interviews      conducted by the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation      of the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of      Representatives, Office of Management and Budget officials      indicated that their review of the Solyndra loan, and the      review of Department of Energy officials, was thorough,      complete, and fair, and based on reasonable economic      assumptions about the company's future.       Page 5, line 12, insert ``This report found that the      portfolio of projects under title XVII was strong, performing      within the risk confines established by the Congress, and      would cost the Government $2,000,000,000 less than initially      expected.'' after ``generally invest in.''.  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 779, the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Colorado.  Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Chairman, sadly, this deeply flawed legislation we are considering today is the result of a political investigation, not a fact-based investigation. The majority has ignored the benefits of the DOE loan program and has consistently ignored evidence uncovered in the investigation that contradicts their predetermined view of events. All you have to do is look at the six pages of partisan findings at the beginning of the bill as proof that this is really just a witch hunt.  What my amendment does is it at least attempts to fix the most egregious parts of the false and misleading legislative findings so that at least the record will attempt to be clear and honest.  The first findings I deal with in my amendment are these findings in paragraph 9 that say:       The review in 2009 of the Solyndra application by the      Department of Energy and OMB was ``driven by politics and      ideology, and divorced from economic reality where the      Department of Energy ignored concerns about the company's      financial condition and market for its products.''  That is so blatantly partisan. Our committee's oversight work found that the Solyndra loan determination was based on thorough, unbiased, and fair analysis of DOE and OMB officials without political or ideological influence from Obama administration political appointees or from career officials.  These findings also ignore the fact that each and every one of the 20 witnesses we questioned in interviews and in hearings told us unequivocally there was no political influence on this loan guarantee, that no corners were cut in the review, and that all decisions were made purely on the merits. Shame on the majority for just putting this blatantly false allegation in these findings.  Mr. Chairman, there are also other findings in the legislation that are inaccurate and should be removed. The findings state that the DOE acted illegally in subordinating the Solyndra loan, and Chairman Stearns talked quite a bit about this in his closing remarks on the substance of the bill. But when looking at the facts, this is simply not the case. What the law says is in the initial granting of the loan guarantee, the government position shall not be subordinated, but DOE's general counsel carefully analyzed the law and determined that subordination in the restructuring would be allowed legally. This opinion was supported by others in the administration, and by outside experts consulted as part of the committee investigation.  Chairman Stearns talks about talking to independent lawyers who said that the subordination was not legal. Sadly, he refused to call any of those lawyers to testify before our committee. Furthermore, he refused to call the lawyers at the Department of Energy or DOJ who had said subordination was legal, despite repeated requests by myself and Chairman Waxman that they should come in.  Here's my question: If subordination was already illegal as the majority claims, why are we considering legislation that makes it illegal? Why doesn'tthe Department of Justice just go and prosecute these people? It just doesn't make sense. That's why my amendment also replaces the misleading findings about subordination with an honest set of facts.  Mr. Chairman, the findings also ignore the important successes of title XVII and the ATVM loan programs. In total, the DOE loan programs are creating 60,000 jobs and saving nearly 300 million gallons of gasoline a year. The title XVII and ATVM programs have supported six power generation projects that are already complete and nine projects that are sending power to the electricity grid. The program is funding one of the world's largest wind farms; the world's largest concentrated solar generation project; the world's largest photovoltaic solar power plant, as we heard from Mr. Waxman; and the Nation's first two all-electric vehicle manufacturing facilities. The programs have allowed private investors to come off the sidelines to invest tens of billions of dollars and create thousands of jobs.  Now, several of my friends on the other side of the aisle, including Chairman Stearns, and my dear friend from Kentucky (Mr. Whitfield), said we should just cede leadership in this to other countries. If other countries like China are investing money, well, too bad for us; we should cede the leadership in solar to them.  I do not think this is the right place for the U.S. to go. For that reason, I believe my amendment should be adopted. Let's have the findings of fact be accurate. Vote ``yes'' on the DeGette amendment.  With that, I yield back the balance of my time.
