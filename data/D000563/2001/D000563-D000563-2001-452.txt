 Mr. President, the American people have had an incredible civics lesson these past few months. No novelist, no playwright, no movie director--not even the creator of the X-Files--could have dreamed up a more intricate, a more convoluted, or more fantastic plot than the one played out in our national political arena in last year's Presidential election.  For weeks on end, it seemed there was only one topic of conversation: Who won the election? And that conversation focused on some of the most arcane aspects of constitutional law.  What if Florida cannot send a slate of electors to the electoral college? What if they send two slates? Are contested elections a State or a national issue? Or for that matter, a county by county issue? Who ultimately decides the results of a disputed election? Congress?
