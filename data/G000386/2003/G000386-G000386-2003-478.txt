 President. I commend my colleagues for their work on this important amendment, which injects much needed flexibility and funding for safety net hospitals that treat especially vulnerable populations. This amendment alleviates pressure on those hospitals and allows ``extremely low-DSH States'' to increase Medicaid DSH allotments to 3 percent in Fiscal Year 2004. Currently, Federal law restricts Medicaid DSH allotments to ``extremely low-DSH States'' to only 1 percent of Medicaid Program costs.  I thank Senators Bingaman and Domenici for their work and for their dogged commitment to the cause. I have supported low DSH improvement legislation in the past, and I am thankful for their leadership on this important issue this year.
