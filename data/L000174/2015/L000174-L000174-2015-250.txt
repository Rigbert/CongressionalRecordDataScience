President, on January 3, the Nation lost a courageous public servant--actually, an icon of the 20th century: Massachusetts Senator Edward William Brooke III. He was 95 years old.  I have had the privilege of serving with more than 350 Senators since Vermonters first elected me to represent them in this Chamber. There is a very special list of those with whom I have served, and it is a privilege to count among those on that special list Senator Edward Brooke. We were both elected representatives of Northeastern States, even though we came from different political parties.  Senator Brooke and I forged a relationship that lasted long after he left Congress. We actually shared a similar start to our careers. As a former State's Attorney, I admired and respected Senator Brooke's legacy as a fearless prosecutor. As Attorney General for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Senator Brooke exposed and fought against political corruption.  He was no stranger to breaking barriers, and he ultimately became the first African American elected in Massachusetts to serve in the United States Senate--a post he held for 12 years.  Senator Brooke was a problem-solver. He wanted to spend his time in the Senate making a difference, not just making pronouncements. He invested his considerable abilities in bridging racial, economic, and political divides to solve the challenges facing the Nation. He was a key, and sometimes crucial, voice along the difficult path toward enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. He spearheaded equal opportunity legislative initiatives from housing, to education, to employment. I think there was no bridge Senator Brooke was unwilling to cross to make lives better.  Senator Brooke is one of the few Senators to receive the Nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He was also the recipient of the Congressional Gold Medal. His service in World War II was recognized with a Bronze Star.  This lifelong public servant dedicated his life to defending the bedrock principles of this country. His legacy of fighting for justice and equality is as important today as ever before. It is a legacy that will always deserve to be remembered and honored.  Marcelle and I feel privileged to have known him and I send my condolences to his wife, Anne, his children, and his grandchildren.                            Lynch Nomination  Mr. President, the New York Times ran an editorial this morning aptly entitled ``The Loretta Lynch Confirmation Mess.'' The editorial writers note:       Of course, as Mr. McConnell readily acknowledged, the delay      [of the vote on Loretta Lynch's nomination] is not simply      about trafficking legislation but a redirection of      Republicans' fury at what they consider Mr. Obama's lawless      actions.  If Republicans are serious about law enforcement, serious about implementing the legislation I hope will pass to combat and prevent human trafficking, they will stop their partisan attacks and allow a vote on Loretta Lynch's nomination. After all, she has a very good record of prosecuting people who are involved in trafficking. You can't say you are in favor of stopping trafficking and then block an Attorney General who has a record of enforcing the trafficking laws.  It has been 19 days since the bipartisan majority in the Senate Judiciary Committee favorably reported her nomination. She has been waiting longer for a floor vote than the five most recent attorneys general combined. She has been waiting for a vote for 19 days. If you took Attorneys General Reno, Ashcroft, Gonzales, Mukasey, and Holder, all of them together were 18 days. For Loretta Lynch it is 19 days.  It has certainly been much longer than for the three men nominated during the last Republican administration or for the incumbent Attorney General nominated by this administration. She has now waited, as I said, longer than the previous five Attorneys General combined.  If we don't vote on her this week, her nomination will have waited on the Senate floor longer than the most recent seven Attorneys General combined. I hope it doesn't come to that. That would show a real disdain for the Department of Justice in its efforts to enforce our laws, to stop trafficking, and to go after terrorists, but it is also beneath the Senate.  Certainly when I was chairman, I did not do that for President Bush's Attorney General nominee when he was in his last 2 years as President. As chairman I moved Judge Mukasey through in a fraction of the time we have taken on Loretta Lynch. I did this even though his nomination was not something I supported and I ultimately voted against it. I moved him forward quickly even though Judge Mukasey was unwilling to state how he felt about President Bush's position on torture and did not seem to have a position on the politicization of his predecessor, or his work with U.S. attorneys, things that set back law enforcement for years. In fact, even though he had no position on most of the issues President Bush was involved in, either through Executive orders or otherwise, he was still moved through in a tiny fraction of the time Loretta Lynch has been pending so far.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the New York Times article I mentioned earlier.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the New York Times, March 17, 2015]                  The Loretta Lynch Confirmation Mess                        (By the Editorial Board)       What does the abortion issue have to do with the prevention      of human trafficking? Nothing.       What do either of those things have to do with Loretta      Lynch, whom President Obama nominated more than four months      ago to succeed Eric Holder Jr. as attorney general of the      United States? Even less.       Yet Ms. Lynch's confirmation as the nation's top law      enforcement officer--which seemed like a sure thing only a      few weeks ago--is being held hostage to last-minute political      mischief.       Ms. Lynch, a supremely well-qualified prosecutor, has      waited far too long to be confirmed. Senate Republicans said      as recently as last week that they would schedule Ms. Lynch's      confirmation vote for this week, but, on Sunday, the majority      leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said that won't happen      until the Senate moves forward on a bipartisan trafficking      bill, which would, among other things, establish a fund for      victims through a fine paid by those convicted of trafficking      crimes.       The legislation, which sailed through committee in      February, stalled last week when Democrats noticed a      provision that would prohibit money in the fund from being      used to pay for abortions. The original Senate bill,      introduced in the last Congress, made no reference to      abortion. Nor did the House's version of the bill, introduced      by Representative Erik Paulsen, a Republican of Minnesota.      ``There is no reason it should be included in these bills,''      Mr. Paulsen said last week of the abortion language. ``This      issue is far too important to tie it up with an unrelated      fight with politics as usual.''       Republicans say they routinely add the abortion language      into many bills and that Democrats should have read more      carefully. Democrats say Republicans operated in bad faith--     not to mention in violation of Senate norms--by      misrepresenting the bill's contents.       This dispute has nothing to do with the needs of the      Justice Department. It is beyond irresponsible to strand the      department without a leader, sowing instability and      uncertainty in an important executive agency.       Mr. Holder announced his retirement in September, to the      evident delight of Republicans who have opposed him from the      start. One would have thought they would be eager to see him      go, yet almost six months later he remains in office because      a replacement has not been confirmed. No one disputes Ms.      Lynch's experience or accomplishments. She currently leads      the federal prosecutor's office in the Eastern District of      New York, and she has received the support of senators of      both parties. The only objection anyone could come up with      was that she might not stand up against President Obama's      policies, an odd criticism to aim at a prospective cabinet      member.       Of course, as Mr. McConnell readily acknowledged, the delay      is not simply about trafficking legislation but a redirection      of Republicans' fury at what they consider Mr. Obama's      lawless actions. Ms. Lynch is ``suffering from the      president's actions,'' he said Sunday, referring to Mr.      Obama's move on immigration policy last November.       This is not the way for Republicans to reassure the country      of their ability to govern now that they control both houses      of Congress. Instead, they could start by ending the delay on      what should be a straightforward floor vote and do the job      Americans elected them to do.
