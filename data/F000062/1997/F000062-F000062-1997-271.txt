 I respectfully direct the Senator to the amendment. It simply says, ``Enact and implement a separate capital budget.''  With every constitutional amendment, as the Senator well knows, the Congress would enact enabling legislation. The Congress would sit down and develop a capital budget if one was desired. My amendment does not mandate one, but if they felt that a capital budget was worthy and desirable and needed by this Nation, they would sit down and discuss the legal parameters and develop the legislation.  All this does is permit it. That is all.
