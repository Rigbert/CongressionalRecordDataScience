 Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman and my colleagues from Maine and New York for putting on this special order, and to say that we in Vermont intend to work with the gentlemen as hard as we can to try to help some of those people who have been hurt. I applaud the gentlemen for all of their efforts.  I think the stories that we heard from Maine and New York State and New Hampshire are certainly repeated in the State of Vermont. I have lived in Vermont for 30 years, and I do not recall seeing a weather disaster to the extent that we experienced in the northern part of our State.  The storm cut electric power to some 30,000 Vermont customers for as long as 10 days. As people know, it gets awfully cold in the State of Vermont. People had to make do as best they could without electricity. As the gentleman from New York indicated, this was an especial problem for our family farmers, who already have more than enough problems to try to contend with. This is just another problem on top of many others.                              {time}  1315  Without electricity to run their milking machines, many farmers obviously were unable to milk their cows. Because cows could not be milked regularly, there was widespread cases of mastitis developing, which is an inflammation of the udder. In some cases the cows died and had to be shipped for slaughter.  Farmers who did not have generators had no way to keep their milk cold and with roads impassable, it was not possible to ship the milk to producers. Thirty-seven dairy farms in Grand Isle County alone lost between 500,000 and 750,000 pounds of milk over the extended power outage.  In my State, and I am sure in upstate New York and in other regions of New Hampshire and Maine, family farmers are struggling very hard right now just to keep their heads above water and just to maintain their farms. This was a blow that they really did not need.  In terms of maple production, and obviously Vermont is well-known for maple syrup production, our maple producers were hit hard as well. Thousands of acres of sugar bushes were destroyed by severe icing. The storm is expected to cause a 10 percent drop in Vermont maple syrup production resulting in losses of millions of dollars to the State.  Farmers were not only hurt, but local communities were hurt. In the City of Burlington, we saw extensive damage to our trees. Burlington has a reputation of being one of the greenest cities in America and there has been substantial damage to our trees.  Utility losses due to down lines and poles total in excess of $10 million, and the estimate is that farm losses totaled nearly that amount as well. But like the representatives from Maine and upstate New York and New Hampshire, Vermonters came together as we have not seen for many, many years, helping each other and doing the best they could to weather the storm.  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues from Maine and the rest of the Northeast to make certain that we do everything that we can to try to help those people and those communities that were hurt. And I want to congratulate my colleagues from Maine for calling this special order.
