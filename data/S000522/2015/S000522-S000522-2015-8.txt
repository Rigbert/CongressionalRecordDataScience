Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.  I just want to thank my dear colleague, Mr. Cohen, and the other members of the taskforce.  This is truly a bipartisan resolution. We all contributed to it. We all care deeply about it. I want him and my other colleagues to know how deeply I respect their efforts, which have been Herculean, to try to end this cruelty that is on the rise in Europe, in the United States, and in other parts. We know in the Middle East it is perhaps as bad as it has ever been; and the diaspora that makes its way into Europe is carrying that hatred with them--not all of them, of course, but a sizable number--presenting more and more challenges.  This is truly a bipartisan effort, and I want to thank Mr. Cohen for his comments.
