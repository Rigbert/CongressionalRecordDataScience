Almost every other program in our bill has taken substantial hits.  We're serious about reducing spending. If we had the additional money, I'm sure the chairman would have added more money in the DERA account in the first place if we had the extra money to do so, because it's an extremely successful program, something that I certainly support. I understand the gentlelady's conviction, but we just don't have the money to take care of this offset, so we have to oppose the amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.
