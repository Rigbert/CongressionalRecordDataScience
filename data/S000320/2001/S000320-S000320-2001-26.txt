 President, the Federal Aviation Administration operates a critical program of proficiency and developmental training for air traffic controllers. It has been demonstrated that this training reduces operational errors and makes the skies safer for the flying public. Over the past several years the Senate Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee has required that the Federal Aviation Administration spend its appropriated funds on the Air Traffic Instructional Services, or ATIS, program and not reprogram these funds to other accounts without approval of the subcommittee. This has worked well in the past and has insured proper expenditure of these funds.  I hope this support for the ATIS program will continue in fiscal year 2002. Is it your understanding that the operational account of the FAA fully funds the budget request for the ATIS program? Do you agree that these funds are to be spent only on this account unless expressly approved by the Subcommittee?
