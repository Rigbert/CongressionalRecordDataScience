 FEINGOLD. Yes, Mr. President. My point exactly. We have tried to adjust this bill to address the concerns of organizations and groups that the Senator from Kentucky has identified. That is our point. Senator McCain and I don't believe we have all the answers. In fact, neither of us love the bill. That is how we were able to come up with a compromise. We heard the concerns of the NEA. We addressed their concerns. They support us now. They no longer support the Senator from Kentucky.  A further attempt that has been made on this issue is to suggest that the American people don't care about this issue, if you look at a poll or any other measure of public opinion that this isn't important to them that we change this big money system. The Senator from Arizona has already done a fine job today of helping to dispel that.  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a publication from the very conservative publication the Weekly Standard from September 22, 1997, entitled ``Republicans Get Some Very Bad News.''  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Weekly Standard, Sept. 22, 1997]                   Republicans Get Some Very Bad News       Republican senators got an unwelcome jolt last week at one      of their usually uneventful Tuesday lunch meetings--a poll      that showed they were in deep trouble. The poll, conducted by      the Republican National Committee during the first week of      September, gave the president his highest positive rating      ever--almost 65 percent. For the first time in Clinton's      presidency more Americans ``strongly approved'' of his      performance than ``strongly disapproved.''       That was not the worst of it. For the first time this year,      the numbers showed that more Americans wanted Democrats to      control Congress than Republicans, and that Democrats were      ahead on the ``generic ballot'' for November 1998. But what      really rattled the senators was that, when asked what issues      they cared most about, Americans had moved one new item into      the first tier along with the old standbys of crime,      education, and the like. The new issue: campaign-finance      reform, which had moved from 2 or 3 percent in previous polls      to double digits as the number one issue of concern.       With John McCain ready to force a confrontation on campaign      reform in the Senate against the wishes of most of his GOP      colleagues, there was a fair amount of senatorial murmuring      about looking for a way to avoid being cast as simple      defenders of the status quo. The politics of campaign-finance      reform could be more interesting over the next few weeks than      most pundits currently expect. And more damaging, considering      that McCain's proposal is a constitutional catastrophe.
