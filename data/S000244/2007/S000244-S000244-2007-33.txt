 This legislation would prevent the federal government or any authority of the federal government from using economic development as a justification for exercising its power of eminent domain.  The protection of private property rights lies at the foundation of American government. As James Madison wrote in the Federalist Papers, ``[G]overnment is instituted no less for the protection of property than of the persons of individuals.''  Two years ago, the Supreme Court held in Kelo v. City of New London that ``economic development'' can be a ``public use'' under the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause. The 5-4 decision has substantially weakened the rights of private property owners by handing the government a raw taking power with negligible accountability to the ``public use'' requirement in the Fifth Amendment's Taking Clause.  The ``public use'' requirement imposed an important limitation on eminent domain power to ensure the government may not force individuals to forfeit their property for the benefit of another private party.  However, Kelo transformed established constitutional principles when it permitted the government to seize the private property of onesmall homeowner and to give it to a large corporation for a private business use in the interest of creating a more lucrative tax base.  The dissenting opinion of that case made clear the far-reaching implications of the decision. Justice O'Connor wrote, ``Any property may now be taken for the benefit of another private party. The government now has the license to transfer property from those with fewer resources to those with more. The Founders cannot have intended this perverse result.'' Houses of worship and other religious institutions that are by their very nature non-profit and almost universally tax-exempt, render their property singularly vulnerable. The NAACP and the AARP faulted Kelo's failing reasoning by stating: ``The takings that result from the Court's decision will disproportionately affect and harm the economically disadvantaged and, in particular, racial and ethnic minorities and the elderly.''  In response, I introduced H.R. 4128, the Private Property Rights Restoration Act of 2005 to restore to all Americans the property rights the Supreme Court took away. H.R. 4128 passed with the clear support of this House with a vote of 376-38. Since the Kelo decision, 41 States have passed laws to rein back eminent domain power. Yet, these laws exist on a varying degree, and the need to ensure that property rights are returned to all Americans is as strong now as it was 2 years ago.  Like H.R. 4128, this year's legislation also establishes a penalty for States and localities that abuse their eminent domain power by denying those States and localities that commit such abuse all Federal economic development funds for a period of 2 years. This legislation sets up a clear connection between the Federal funds that would be denied and the abuse Congress is intending to prevent while providing States and localities with an opportunity to cure any violation by either returning or replacing the improperly taken property before they lose any Federal economic development funds.  Included in this legislation is an express private right of action to ensure access to the State or Federal court and a fee-shifting provision identical to those in other civil rights laws, which allows a prevailing property owner to be awarded attorney and expert fees as part of the costs of bringing the litigation to enforce the bill's provisions. A change in this year's version of the bill includes a provision to protect not only property owners, but also tenants. Tenants who may lose their homes if the government exercises its eminent domain power deserve the same right of action as homeowners. Another improvement to this bill allows the Attorney General to file suit; this will help homeowners and tenants without the means to file a case on their own behalf.  I am very mindful of the long history of eminent domain abuses, particularly in low-income and often predominantly minority neighborhoods, and the need to stop it. I am also very mindful of the reasons we should allow the government to take land when the way in which the land is being used constitutes an immediate threat to public health and safety. I believe this bill accomplishes both goals.  Property rights are civil rights. I urge all my colleagues to join me in protecting property rights of all Americans and limiting the dangerous effects of the Kelo decision on the most vulnerable in society.                          ____________________
