 The      administration supports the committee's aim to achieve an      orderly termination through a phased decommissioning,      beginning in January 2010, and the requirement that      certifications be provided to document that the Loran-C      termination will not impair maritime safety or the      development of possible GPS back-up capabilities or needs.  So the administration has said that the committee is complying with what they have asked us to do which is to terminate the Loran-C program.  The aim of the amendment is unclear to me. What it actually does is strip the Coast Guard of the authority we have provided in the underlying bill to terminate a program that will indeed save taxpayers $36 million a year.  The way the amendment is written, I oppose it because it will take away what the committee has written in here to terminate the Loran-C program, as the President has requested, in a responsible way, to do it in a way that we deal with the mitigation that needs to be done when we remove equipment such as this. The amendment that has been offered will actually strip the Coast Guard of the authority to do just that.  The committee bill does what the Senator is asking us to do. It does it in a timely and responsible way and does terminate the Loran-C program.  I urge colleagues to support the committee amendment that does it in a responsible way.  I yield the floor.
