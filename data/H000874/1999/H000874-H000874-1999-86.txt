Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  I rise in opposition to the Goodling amendment. I would like to think my IQ is above minus 10. I think there is an analogy. Yes, I can buy the stock and yes, I can take the job, or yes, I can join the union or not join the union. If I do not need the job, I can go someplace else.  The fact of the matter is, Beck is included in this legislation, as the gentleman from Connecticut has said, exactly as the court ruled. The fact of the matter is, this legislation is an attempt to make impotent the ability of unions to effectively represent the interests of their members and those whom they represent, members or not.  I would suggest that we defeat this amendment, but I am pleased that the gentleman has decided to withdraw the amendment and that will not be necessary. I know the gentleman feels strongly about his amendment, but we feel equally strongly that this is not an amendment in the best interest of this bill or in the best interest of America's workers.
