Mr. Speaker, we can do both. As the gentleman from Pennsylvania knows, in Alaska we have a bigger caribou herd, more wildlife, a better environment just from the development of Prudhoe. And I say this can happen again in ANWR.  But more than that, if we want to see environmental damage, do not have the energy available and keep being dependent upon those countries overseas.  I keep stressing the fact that now, this year, remember gas was $2 per thousand cubic feet last year; this year, right today, it is $9.42. That means the average home buying gas today, their heating bill will go up 300 percent this winter. And that is a jolt economically, and it also means we are running out of natural gas because we have not been allowed to develop those fields in the lower 48.  So Alaska has got gas and we want to sell it to you, but the fact is we ought to be developing those gas fields in Wyoming, Montana, New Mexico, and, yes, in Pennsylvania, they have gas in Pennsylvania, and go after those fields so we can have it available for the constituents that my colleague and I serve.
