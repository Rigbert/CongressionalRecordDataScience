President, I am very pleased the Senate is poised to pass legislation to increase the number of H-1B visas. The bill that we will pass today is the result of long negotiations. It is significantly improved fromthe version reported from the Judiciary Committee earlier this year.  This is an important step that will allow American employers to compensate for the current shortage in highly skilled employees by hiring such employees from abroad.  Thanks to the efforts of Senators Kennedy, Lieberman, Feinstein, and others, this bill also includes strong education and worker training components. That is going to help American workers and students to erase the skills shortage.  No one on this side of the aisle sees H-1B visas as a permanent solution. It is a stopgap until our renewed commitment to education and training pays dividends. I would like to thank all of those in the corporate world who have supported our efforts on education and training.  Although I am happy about the passage of this bill, I am somewhat disappointed in the severe way in which debate on this bill was restricted.  I had hoped that our consideration of this bill would allow us to achieve other crucially important immigration goals that have been neglected by the majority throughout this Congress.  I had hoped that the Republican majority could agree to at least vote on, if not vote for, limited proposals designed to protect Latino families and other immigrant families.  I had hoped that the majority would consider proposals to restore the due process that was taken away from immigrants by the immigration legislation that Congress passed in 1996.  I thought we could work together to restore some of America's lost luster on immigration issues. That did not happen.  Still, we did have a vote on the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act that showed where the Senate stood on issues of extreme importance to the Hispanic community, Eastern Europeans, and the Liberians. On that vote, regrettably, every Republican voted no. They refused to even consider the amendment. We should have had a vote. Senators should have the political courage to either vote for it, or vote against it.  I hope my Republican colleagues have the chance to reevaluate their position. The President has said he wants Congress to address these issues before we adjourn. Many Democratic Members of Congress and I join him in that view, and we will continue to work to see that this Congress addresses the real needs of real people, whether they be native-born or immigrant.  Both my mother and my wife are first-generation Americans. I think if Congress had taken some of the attitudes toward immigration that some take today when their families were seeking to enter the United States, neither might be in this country.  I agree that we need to increase the number of H-1B visas. The stunning economic growth we have experienced in the past eight years has led to worker shortages in certain key areas of our economy, and I have been involved in promoting efforts to ease those shortages. Last year, I cosponsored the HITEC Act, S. 1645, legislation that Senator Robb has introduced that would create a new visa that would be available to companies looking to hire recent foreign graduates of U.S. master's and doctoral programs in math, science, engineering, or computer science.  Although S. 2045 uses a broader approach, the goals are similar. Allowing workers with specialized skills to come to the U.S. and work for 6-year periods, as the H-1B visa does, helps to alleviate worker shortage. In the recently ended fiscal year, 115,000 such visas were available, and they ran out well before the fiscal year ended. That is why we have to change the law now.  If we do not change the law, there will actually be fewer visas available in fiscal year 2001, as the cap drops to 107,500. This will simply be insufficient to allow America's employers--particularly in the information technology industry--to maintain their current rates of growth. As such, I think that we need to increase the number of available visas dramatically. The bill we will vote on today accomplishes that goal, increasing the number of visas to 195,000 for FY 2001. It also contains a provision that will allow educational institutions to use H-1B visas without counting against the cap, which will greatly help our colleges and universities, which are often on a different hiring schedule than our nation's other employers and have been shut out in the past from obtaining needed visas.  Of course, H-1B visas are not a long-term answer to the current mismatch between the demands of the high-tech industry and the supply of workers with technical skills. Although I believe that there is a labor shortage in certain areas of our economy, I do not believe that we should accept that circumstance as an unchangeable fact of life. We need to make a greater effort to give our children the education they need to compete in an increasingly technology-oriented economy, and offer adults the training they need to refashion their careers to suit the changes in our economy. This bill takes significant steps to improve our education and training programs. Since employers pay a $500 fee for a visa, increasing the number of visas will lead to an increase in revenue generated for worker training programs, scholarships for disadvantaged students, and funding for public-private partnerships to improve science and technology education.  I also want to note that the legislation extends current law's attestation requirements. These requirements force employers to certify that they were unable to find qualified Americans to do a job that they have hired a visa recipient to fill. The Labor Department also retains authority under S. 2045 to investigate possible H-1B violations.  I continue to believe that we could have passed this legislation many months ago. The Judiciary Committee reported S. 2045 more than six months ago, with my support. During this long stretch of inactivity, it has often appeared that the Republican majority has been more interested in gaining partisan advantage from a delay than in actually making this bill law. The Democratic Leader said repeatedly that he wanted to pass a bill, and that although Democratic members did want the opportunity to offer amendments, he was ready to agree to limit debate on those amendments so that we could conclude all work on this bill in a single day. Those offers were rebuffed again and again by the majority.  Months went by in which the Republican majority made no attempt to negotiate with us, time which many members of the majority instead spent trying to blame Democrats for the delay in their bringing this legislation to the floor. At many times, it seemed that the majority was more interested in casting blame upon Democrats than in actually passing legislation. Instead of working in good faith with the minority to bring this bill to the floor, the majority spent its time trying to convince leaders in the information technology industry that the Democratic Party was hostile to this bill, which was always false. Considering that three-quarters of the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee voted for this bill, and that the bill has numerous Democratic cosponsors, including Senator Lieberman, this partisan appeal was not only inappropriate but absurd on its face.  I do regret that we have not made more progress on the longstanding proposals that have been combined now under the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. These provisions had been proposed throughout this Congress, and in some cases in previous Congresses. They are solid, pro-family proposals that would reward immigrants who are working and paying taxes in the United States. But the Republican majority--as has been shown repeatedly on the Senate floor over the past week--refused even to consider these proposals, instead branding them as rewards for illegal immigrants.  Thankfully, the President has taken action to provide temporary protection for the Liberians who faced imminent return to their conflicted nation, and who would have been protected by the LIFA legislation. It is shameful that the Congress has not taken action on the Liberians' behalf, despite the dogged and dedicated efforts of Senator Jack Reed.  I am worried about the things we have not done on immigration issues in this Congress. It is a disturbing but increasingly undeniable fact that the interest of the business community has become a prerequisite for immigrationbills to receive attention on the Senate floor. In fact, we are in the final days of the Congress, and this is the first immigration bill to be debated on the floor. Even humanitarian bills with bipartisan backing have been ignored in this Congress, both in the Judiciary Committee and on the floor of the Senate.  The majority has shown a similar lack of concern for proposals by Senators to restore the due process protections were removed by the passage of the Antiterrorism Death Penalty Act and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act 4 years ago.  There are still many aspects of those laws that merit our careful review and rethinking, including the inhumane use of expedited removal, which would be sharply reformed by S. 1940, the Refugee Protection Act, which I have introduced with Senator Brownback and our 10 cosponsors.  But the Refugee Protection Act has not even received a hearing in the Judiciary Committee, despite my requests as ranking member. This is quite unusual, because every committee I have served upon has honored such requests on the part of the ranking member. When I was chairman, any request made by a ranking member was honored. Indeed, I have never seen anything like this, especially on a bill that has such bipartisan support.  The bill addresses the issue of expedited removal, a process under which aliens arriving in the United States can be returned immediately to their native land at the say-so of low-level INS officers. Expedited removal was the subject of a major debate in this Chamber in 1996. The Senate voted to use it only during immigration emergencies. The Senate-passed restriction was removed at probably the most partisan conference committee I have ever witnessed. The Refugee Protection Act is modeled closely on the 1996 amendment. I hope someday we can pass it. We should.  As a result of the adoption of expedited removal, we now have a system of removing people arriving here either without proper documentation or with valid documents that INS officers suspect are invalid. This policy ignores the fact that somebody who is fleeing a despotic regime is quite often unable to go in and get a passport from the same regime they are trying to flee, either because of religious persecution or some other type of persecution. The only way to get out of there is with a forged passport.  In the limited time that expedited removal has been in operation, we already have numerous stories of valid asylum seekers who were kicked out of country without the opportunity to convince an immigration judge that they faced persecution in their native lands. To provide just one example, a Kosovo Albanian was summarily removed from the United States after the civil war in Kosovo had already made the front pages of America's newspapers. Imagine what happens to such people when they are forced to return to their native lands.  I also urge the Senate to take up S. 3120, the Immigrant Fairness Restoration Act, which was introduced by Senators Kennedy and Bob Graham. This bill would go a long way toward undoing the damage done to due process by the 1996 immigration laws, and the House has already passed related, bipartisan legislation. Among other things, S. 3120 would eliminate the retroactive features of those laws, which have led to the deportation of legal permanent residents who committed relatively minor crimes decades ago. I have sponsored legislation that would at the very least provide due process to those who have served in our Armed Forces, the Fairness for Immigrant Veterans Act, S. 871. This legislation has been endorsed by the American Legion, the Vietnam Veterans of America, and other veterans' groups. The Republican majority has refused to consider even this narrow reform.  As important as H-1B visas are for our economy and our nation's employers, this is not the only immigration issue that faces our nation. Although the legislation we are concerned with today is good legislation, it does not test our commitment to the ideals of opportunity and freedom that America has represented at its best. Those tests will apparently be left for another day, or another Congress.  In closing, I commend our leaders in this matter: Senator Daschle, Senator Harry Reid, Senator Kennedy, and their able staffs. In particular, I would like to thank Andrea LaRue with Senator Daschle, Eddie Ayoob with Senator Reid, Esther Olavarria and Melody Barnes with Senator Kennedy and the Democratic staff of the Immigration Subcommittee, and Tim Lynch with my Judiciary Committee staff. I have not heard thanks from the other side. I thank Senator Abraham and his staff for cooperation in improving the bill and Senator Hatch for allowing the matter finally to proceed to conclusion. I also thank Lee Otis and Stuart Anderson with Senator Abraham and Sharon Prost with Senator Hatch for their hard work on this legislation.                   Visa Waiver Permanent Program Act  In addition to passing S. 2045, the Senate has also agreed to pass H.R. 3767, legislation to make the visa waiver pilot program permanent. We pass this legislation only because Senator Daschle worked with Senator Kennedy and me to make sure that the majority agreed to release its hold on the bill as part of our broader agreement on H-1B legislation. I hope that Senator Daschle's commitment to this bill is appreciated by the thousands of American travelers who benefit from it.  This legislation will achieve the important goal of making our visa waiver program permanent. We have had a visa waiver pilot project for more than a decade, and it has been a tremendous success in allowing American citizens to travel to some of our most important allies for up to 90 days without obtaining a visa, and in allowing citizens of those countries to travel here under the same terms. Countries must meet a number of requirements to participate in the program, including having very low rates of visa refusals. Of course, the visa waiver does not affect the need for international travelers to carry valid passports.  Despite having expressed no substantive objection to this bill, the majority refused to allow this legislation to go forward for months. I note for the record that every single Democratic Senator said they would vote for this bill. Those from the business community and elsewhere who asked about the bill were assured by Senator Daschle, Senator Reid and I that every single Democratic Senator supported this.  Even though the travel industry and the State Department urged Republicans to allow this legislation to pass, and even though the visa waiver pilot program had expired April 30, the majority refused to let this bill go forward. They apparently held the bill to use as leverage to promote unrelated legislation, just a chit to be used whenever it seemed to fix a whim. I am glad they finally have reversed course.  The House passed legislation months ago to make this program permanent, heeding the calls of American tourists and business people who are able to travel to almost 30 other nations with only a passport because of the program. By playing political games, the Senate jeopardized our relationships with the other nations who take part in the program. Thankfully, we have finally moved beyond these games and are set to send this legislation back to the House for final approval.  I would like briefly to note the inclusion of an amendment in the visa waiver bill that is of major importance to my State of Vermont and many other States. This provision extends the EB-5 immigrant investor pilot program, which allows foreign investors to obtain resident status in return for substantial investments in regions that are not sharing in the general American prosperity. In my State, this program is starting to bear fruit--I am happy that we are extending it for an additional three years so that we can ensure that its potential is realized.  In conclusion, I would like to thank Senator Kennedy for all of his work on immigration issues, from H-1B to visa waiver to the countless proposals he has initiated and supported to help immigrant families. He has consistently worked across the aisle with Senators Hatch and Abraham to achieve the best possible solutions to our immigration problems. Immigrants in America should understand they have a devoted ally in the senior Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy. And I thank our Democratic Leader Tom Daschlefor his commitment to getting this matter concluded without additional unnecessary delay. They and their staffs, along with the staff of our Republican counterparts, were instrumental in moving this matter to passage.  I thank all on both sides.
