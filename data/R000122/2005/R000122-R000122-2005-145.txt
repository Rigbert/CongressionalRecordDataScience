President, quickly, Senator Collins and Senator Gregg and I are trying to put more money in the State block grant program. Mr. President, $1 billion will not provide assistance in many States that need it now, Wisconsin and other States that are going to see a very difficult winter. Only by supporting our amendment will we reach all the States, all the people who need it. These cuts, as Senator Harkin suggested, are illusory; they will not be made. Frankly, I don't think it is appropriate, when we are trying to help poor people in the wintertime to heat their homes, we think about offsets; we think about that when we are providing tax cuts for very wealthy Americans.  I urge passage of Reed-Collins and the rejection of the Gregg amendment.
