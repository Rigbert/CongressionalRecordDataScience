 Chairman, the gentleman, is reiterating the point I was making. Yes, there are regulations which are silly; yes; there are regulations which are useless and should be gotten rid of, but the scope of what the gentleman is talking about is not amusing.  Yes, holes in buckets is very funny, gets good laughs, I agree with the gentleman. But cancer and breast cancer, particularly, are very serious problems in America. AIDS is very serious. It is not a laughing matter.  What the gentleman's legislation does is it may deal with the holes in the buckets, fine, but is also preventing the Government from taking measures that will save people from getting cancer. That is not so funny.  Mr. McINTOSH. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman let me make it very clear that this moratorium does not do that. There is the language which the gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Erlich] pointed out, and I pointed it out earlier, and I thank the gentlewoman from New York, [Ms. Slaughter] for pointing out the spelling error, which seriously says regulatory agencies must deal with health and safety threats that pose an imminent danger to human health and safety. That exception would allow regulations that prevent loss of life to go forward.  What we need to do, Mr. Chairman, is to protect the American people from the silly, stupid, needless regulations that not only are humorous, they are very serious in their consequences of costing jobs when companies move overseas or go out of business. They are very serious when consumers have to spend $6,000 a year more to comply with those regulations. I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.
