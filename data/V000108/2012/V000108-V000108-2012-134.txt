Speaker, on November 30, 2012, I was absent from the House and missed rollcall vote 613.  Had I been present for rollcall vote 613, on passage of H.R. 6429, to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to promote innovation, investment, and research in the United States, to eliminate the diversity immigrant program, and for other purposes, I would have voted ``no.''                          ____________________
