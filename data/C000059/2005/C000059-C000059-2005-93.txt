Speaker, my congressional district in Riverside, California is extremely fortunate to have a dynamic and dedicated group of community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give of their time and talents to ensure the well-being of our city and county. These individuals work tirelessly to develop voluntary community action to improve the community's economy, its education, its environment and its overall quality of life. One individual, who is a member of this group, is Captain Ray Cota.  On the 19th of March, Ray will be honored with the Ira. D. ``Cal'' Calvert Distinguished Service Award by the Corona-Norco Family YMCA. The award is given in memory of my father, ``Cal'' Calvert, and his enumerable philanthropic gifts to the community and his efforts to encourage others to serve their community in a similar fashion. The award recognizes Ray for his exceptional devotion to developing community volunteerism.  Ray has been a police officer with the Corona Police Department for over 25 years. Throughout his career, he has been involved in the community and specifically with youth service organizations. He has served as President of the Circle City Kiwanis, helped organize an annual golf tournament that raises money for at-risk youth, and participated in the Corona High Parent Teacher Student Association. Additionally, Ray has served with the Corona Police Activities League, which provides sports and recreational activities to neighborhood youth and seeks to reach out to other deserving youth in the community.  Ray and his wife Rebecca have been married for 21 years. They have a 13 year old son, Raymond, who attends Corona Fundamental Intermediate School.  Ray's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Corona, California. Ray has been the heart and soul of many community organizations and events and I am proud to call Ray a fellow community member, American and friend.                          ____________________
