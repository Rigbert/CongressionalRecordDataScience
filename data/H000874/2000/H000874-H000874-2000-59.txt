Speaker, I am pleased that the gentleman from Maryland yielded me some time. The reason I wanted to take this time is he will not say himself, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cardin) is a member of the Helsinki Commission and has served with the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) and I for many years. There is a no more conscientious, a no more engaged and focused member of the Helsinki Commission than the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cardin). I am pleased that he rises to speak on behalf of this resolution.
