 I was just talking to Representative Lewis. He indicated that two members of his family each lost their homes. I understand that Representative Duncan Hunter also lost his home. So they join literally 1,500 families now who are bereft, without housing, without their home. Really, everything they have built is just gone. Now we find that there are another 44,000 homes in jeopardy. So I very much appreciate the comments of the Senator.                           Amendment No. 1977
