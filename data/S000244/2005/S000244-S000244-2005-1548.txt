Speaker, it is with sadness that I recognize the death of a former colleague and a great Californian, Representative Robert Matsui, who passed away earlier this week.  A third-generation Japanese-American, Bob was born in Sacramento and was just a 6-month-old baby when he and his family were imprisoned at the Tule Lake internment camp following the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Forty years later, he was instrumental in passing the Japanese-American Redress Act, which produced an official apology from the Federal Government for the World War II internment program and offered compensation to victims.  Bob was a quiet and admired Member of Congress. His passion for issues he believed deeply in was respected by his colleagues on both sides of the aisle. He brought dignity and honor to the House of Representatives. Bob was a tax and trade maven on the House Ways and Means Committee, and his knowledge and expertise in these areas will be sorely missed. He was one of a small number of Democrats who pushed for passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement.  First elected in 1978 following his service to the City of Sacramento, Bob and I were in the same freshman class of Congress as I too was elected that year. I got to know, and become very good friends with Bob during the 26 years we served in the House together.  The people in the Sacramento-based 5th district lost a good legislator when Bob passed away on January 1, and he will be missed by his friends and family.  It is with a heavy heart that I say good-bye to Bob. My wife Cheryl and I would like to express our condolences to his wife, Doris, and the entire family, in this time of sorrow and sadness. They will be in our prayers.
