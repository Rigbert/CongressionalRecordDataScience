President, I say to my friend from Kentucky, I said earlier we did it in record time last year. We may break that now. Again, I am perfectly willing to go forward and wrap it up. There may be some who feel otherwise.                   community-based telecommunications  Mr. President, organizations such as the National Telephone Cooperative Association are able to help provide new and innovative methods to bring modern telecommunications service to rural and remote areas around the globe. Such initiatives, particularly those that encompass a grass-roots, community-based approach, are key to economic development, business creation and income generation. They enhance economic stability, create jobs, improve agricultural production and further the development of democratic processes and traditions.  The committee has, in the past, encouraged AID to work with organizations like the National Telephone Cooperative Association to bring modern means of communication to rural areas. Cooperatives foster community involvement and help to build civil society--important steps along the path away from a socialist, government-controlled economy toward a free-market economy. These programs are just the type that we should be promoting in the Ukraine and other NIS states, where any growth in the private sector represents a challenge to the government and encourages sustainable income generation and economic growth on a local level.  Another program that the committee urged AID to support was rural telephone cooperative programs in Poland, which have achieved significant success. The on-going program in the Philippines has also seen success. However, this project is in need of continued participation by AID's country and central programs. AID should also promote the development of telephone cooperatives in Africa. Countries in the Horn, Ghana, and South Africa are poised for developing useful rural telecommunications. There is no doubt that in addition to promoting economic growth, rural citizens in these countries would benefit enormously.  For these reasons, I encourage AID to continue to work with telephone cooperatives in the United States to foster community-based telecommunications programs in the developing countries. I hope that language to this effect can be included in the conference report on this bill.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
