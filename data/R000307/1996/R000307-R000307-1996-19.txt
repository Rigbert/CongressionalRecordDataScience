Speaker, I would like to observe this: I would like to thank the gentleman from California [Mr. Brown] very much for his very kind comments. George Brown has provided more expertise on FIFRA than perhaps any other Member.  The gentleman from Texas [Mr. de la Garza] mentioned the gentleman from Iowa, Mr. Berkley Bedell. I can remember well when we passed a FIFRA reform on the House side. It did not pass the Senate. We had adjourned, and Berkley Bedell had me in tow over on the Senate side trying to find real live Senators to try to get this done. So this one is for Berkley.  I would like to also thank my staff. There are no self-made men or women in public office. It is your friends and staff who make you what you are, more especially Mr. Bill O'Conner, who worked long and hard for Mr. Madigan both when he was the ranking member of the committee and the Secretary of Agriculture.  I would like to mention Mr. Gary Mitchell, who is our staff director, who had the FIFRA responsibilities when I was the ranking member of the subcommittee.  And, more especially, Mr. Dale Moore. Dale is a former rodeo rider, and every time we let the FIFRA horse out of the chute, we could not even saddle him, let alone ride the full 10 seconds to finally get something done. So in this particular case where it is a rodeo of achievement, if you will, I especially want to thank Dale.  It is rare during an even-numbered year when we have had great controversy and strong differences of opinion in this Congress, that we have a situation where the gentleman from Virginia, Tom Bliley, the gentleman from Florida, Mike Bilirakis, and the gentleman from Kansas, Pat Roberts, stood with the gentleman from Texas, Kika de la Garza, the gentleman from Michigan, John Dingell, and the gentleman from California, Henry Waxman, representing the environmental community, the agriculture community, industry, and the administration.  We have done something and we are proud of it. We have 55 different organizations who have signed on with this reform. It is good reform. It is the kind of thing that we should do more of.  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record report language to accompany H.R. 1627 regarding the use of registered pesticides to protect public health and safety, and a letter from the Environmental Protection Agency on the same matter; as well as report language developed to address a concern related to the Endangered Species Act:                 Report Language to Accompany H.R. 1627    Use of Registered Pesticides to Protect Public Health and Safety       The Committee is aware of the potential for situations in      which public health and safety may be compromised by efforts      to protect endangered species. There are commercial      facilities which are part of this nation's food production      and distribution system, such as processing plants,      warehouses, grocery stores, restaurants, etc., which are      located in critical habitat areas where the use of pest      control tools may be prohibited or severely restricted. While      the Committee recognizes the importance of preventing the      destruction of endangered species, it is concerned that      unwarranted actions to protect a species could result in the      unchecked spread of rodent-, insect-, or other pest vector-     borne diseases that could pose serious threats to consumer      and food safety.       The Committee strongly believes that preserving the safety      and wholesomeness of this nation's food supply is paramount.      Managers of food processing and handling facilities, and      public health officials, must be able to take the steps      necessary to control pests that may pose a threat to public      health. The managers of these facilities generally rely on      certified commercial applicators or persons under their      direct supervision who are trained to apply rodenticides and      other pesticides in safe manner, which helps ensure that      these products are only used when and where necessary.       One of the overriding goals of H.R. 1627 is to eliminate      the statutory and regulatory paradoxes that inhibit the      efficient, science-based administration of FIFRA and the      Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Committee believes      this goal should be considered when reforms to other      statutes, such as the Endangered Species Act, are undertaken      to make certain that the safety and wholesomeness of a      consumer's food supply, especially for infants and children,      is adequately protected.       The Committee recognizes this concern can be addressed      rationally in many cases through the cooperative efforts of      federal and state regulatory officials, and is encouraged      that federal and state agencies are examining this issue. For      example, the California Environmental Protection Agency's      Department of Pesticide Regulation states, ``A categorical      exemption for food processing plants and other industrial and      institutional use could probably be made with little, if any,      impact on listed species. In particular, the use of toxicant      inside of buildings or immediately adjacent to buildings does      not seem to pose a hazard to listed species.''       The Committee expects the EPA to investigate this issue and      any related situations where competing regulatory actions by      the Agency, other federal agencies, or state agencies pose a      threat to consumers or the U.S. food supply, and to act      quickly to remedy these situations. In addition, if the EPA      is unable to address the situation in an efficient and fair      manner, the Agency should promptly notify this and any other      committee of appropriate jurisdiction. If resolution is      prohibited because of competing or inconsistent provisions of      law, the Committee also expects the Agency to provide      legislative proposals that may be needed to ensure that the      Administrator has sufficient statutory authority to address      these situations in a common sense, science-based manner.                                                                    ____                                                U.S. Environmental                                            Protection Agency,                                    Washington, DC, July 18, 1996.     Hon. Pat Roberts,     Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, House of Representatives,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your request regarding      clarification of the effect that endangered species      protection measures may have on the use of pesticides to      control pests in food processing or handling warehouses. We      understand that some are concerned that endangered species      protection measures could inappropriately restrict, within      areas designated for the protection of endangered species,      use of certain pesticides. Specifically, a concern was raised      that use of pesticides that are important to control pests      which may damage or contaminate food items may be unduly      limited by endangered species protection measures in the      State of California.       We believe that the federal, state and local agencies in      California responsible for endangered species protection      recognized this concern and have worked with all stakeholders      to appropriately resolve this situation. Furthermore, the      information available to us indicates that pesticide labels      and the state-initiated endangered species plans do not      unnecessarily restrict responsible pesticide use and do      provide for both safe and effective use of pesticides in      these situations.       Obviously, we understand that controlling pests in food      storage and processing facilities can be a significant public      health concern, and we will continue to work with the      appropriate state and federal officials to make sure that      important public health protection measures are not      unnecessarily restricted.       In addition, we stand ready to work with you, members of      your committee, and the state, local and Federal authorities      to resolve legitimate concerns that may arise regarding this      issue. Please let me know if I may be of further assistance.           Sincerely,                                            Lynn R. Goldman, M.D.,     Assistant Administrator.                                                                    ____                                         Food Chain Coalition,                                                    July 23, 1996.     Hon. Thomas J. Bliley, Jr.,     House of Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Congressman Bliley: Last week, representatives of the      Administration, industry and the environmental community      reached compromise agreement on H.R. 1627, ``The Food Quality      Protection Act,'' after several weeks of negotiations. This      bill represents the best opportunity in a decade to modernize      the Delaney Clause and strengthen our nation's food laws.       The House of Representatives is expected today to consider      H.R. 1627, and the Senate has indicated the intention to      quickly follow suit. As Americans working to produce, process      and market our nation's food supply, we urge your support for      this critically important bill.       There is virtually unanimous agreement that an overhaul of      the outdated Delaney clause for pesticide residues is long      overdue. With the very limited number of legislative days      remaining this year, the need for action to accomplish that      objective is now more urgent than ever.       EPA recently proposed disallowing the use of five      pesticides on a number of crops under the Delaney Clause,      even though the agency has repeatedly stated its belief that      those pesticides pose no significant health risk to      consumers. By April 1997, EPA is due to determine whether to      disallow up to 40 additional uses; without corrective action,      farmers could lose the use of a number of safe and effective      crop protection tools that keep the American food supply      abundant and affordable.       The compromise version of ``The Food Quality Protection      Act'' has received bipartisan praise from both the House and      Senate, with key Republican and Democratic leaders stating      that it is their goal to see this legislation signed into law      by the President this     year. We urge its prompt adoption by the House.
