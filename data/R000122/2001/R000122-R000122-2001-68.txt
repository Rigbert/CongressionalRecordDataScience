President, I thank Senator Kennedy for those insightful words and also for his leadership on this legislation. He, along with Chairman Jeffords, has been battling and moving along to try to bring, ultimately, a bill that will improve education in the United States.  I believe, as evidenced by this amendment, that one very pragmatic, practical way to do this is to help local communities acquire library materials for their schools. In fact, I am always amazed that there is any controversy about this issue. It seems to me to be the most obvious complement to the President's program for literacy and also one of those programs which doesn't raise issues of curriculum, doesn't raise issues of local control, doesn't raise issues of any seriousness.  Frankly, I hope that each of my colleagues will recognize that allowing local communities, local school systems to buy books is something we should be doing and not rejecting.  I hope that at 1:45, when the roll is called, we will have the strongest possible support. This is a bipartisan initiative, cosponsored, along with many Senators, by Senators Snowe and Chafee. I hope we can get a good, solid vote for school libraries when this roll is called.  I reserve the remainder of my time and suggest the absence of a quorum.
