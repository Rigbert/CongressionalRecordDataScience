 I want to celebrate another legislative accomplishment the Senate notched last week.  On Thursday, the Senate passed the Taxpayer First Act and sent it to President Trump's desk to become law. This legislation is the most thorough package of reforms to the Internal Revenue Service in 20 years.  Let me say that again. The Senate just passed the most significant reforms to the IRS in two decades. It will create a new, independent process for appeals to ensure taxpayers receive fair treatment. During dispute resolutions, taxpayers will now get access to the same information the IRS has.  There will be more accountability within the IRS when it comes to cyber security, careful management of technology, and overall efficiency. There will be a new streamlined system for addressing identity theft. There will be better procedures for advance notification in the event of an audit or an asset seizure, and there will be new steps to make it easier to file your taxes and supporting documents online.  So this is a significant accomplishment. These reforms will make one of the least appealing annual tasks for hard-working Americans a little bit less painful.  A year and a half ago, the Republican Members of this body joined with House Republicans and President Trump to deliver historic tax cuts and tax reform to the American people. Middle-class families, parents, small business owners, farmers, and job creators across the Nation are keeping more of what they earn and sending less to the IRS.  Now, thanks to this latest achievement, the IRS will be just a little bit easier to deal with as well.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
