Speaker, I am pleased to introduce, H.R. 2413, the Computer Security Enhancement Act of 1999, a bipartisan bill to address our government's computer security needs. Joining me as cosponsors of this important legislation is Mr. Bart Gordon of Tennessee and Mrs. Connie Morella of Maryland, the Chairwoman of the Science Committee's Technology Subcommittee.  The bill amends and updates the Computer Security Act of 1987 which gave the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) the lead responsibility for developing security standards and technical guidelines for civilian government agencies' computer security. Specifically, the bill:  1.  Reduces the cost and improves the availability of computer security technologies for Federal agencies by requiring NIST to promote the Federal use of off-the-shelf products for meeting civilian agency computer security needs.  2.  Enhances the role of the independent Computer System Security and Privacy Advisory Board in NIST's decision-making process. The board, which is made up of representatives from industry, federal agencies and other outside experts, should assist NIST in its development of standards and guidelines for Federal systems.  3.  Requires NIST to develop standardized tests and procedures to evaluate the strength of foreign encryption products. Through such tests and procedures, NIST, with assistance from the private sector, will be able to judge the relative strength of foreign encryption, thereby defusing some of the concerns associated with the expert of domestic encryption products.  4.  Clarifies that NIST standards and guidelines are to be used for the acquisition of security technologies for the Federal Government and are not intended as restrictions on the production or use of encryption by the private sector.  5.  Addresses the shortage of university students studying computer security. Of the 5,500 PhDs in Computer science awarded over the last five years in Canada and the U.S., only 16 were in fields related to computer security. To help address such short-falls, the bill establishes a new computer science fellowship program for graduate and undergraduate students studying computer security; and  6.  Requires the National Research Council to conduct a study to assess the desirability of creating public key infrastructures. The study will also address advances in technology required for public key in technology required for public key infrastructure.  7. Establishes a national panel for the purpose of exploring all relevant factors associated with the development of a national digital signature infrastructure based on uniform standards and of developing model practices and standards associated with certification authorities.  All these measures are intended to accomplish two goals. First, assist NIST in meeting the ever-increasing computer security needs of Federal civilian agencies. Second, to allow the Federal Government, through NIST, to harness the ingenuity of the private sector to help address its computer security needs.  Since the passage of the Computer Security Act, the networking revolution has improved the ability of Federal agencies to process and transfer data. It has also made that same data more vulnerable to corruption and theft.  The General Accounting Office (GAO) has highlighted computer security as a government-wide, high-risk issue. GAO specifically identified the lack of adequate security for Federal civilian computer systems as a significant problem. Since June of 1993, the General Accounting Office (GAO) has issued over 30 reports detailing serious information security weaknesses at 24 of our largest Federal agencies.  The Science Committee has held seven hearings on computer security since I became Chairman in 1997. During the hearings, Members of the Science Committee heard from some of the most respected experts in the field. They all agreed that the Federal Government must do more to secure the sensitive electronic data it possesses.  The Federal Government is not alone in its need to secure electronic information. The corruption of electronic data threatens every sector of our economy. The market for high-quality computer security products is enormous, and the U.S. software and hardware industries are responding. The passage of this legislation will enable the Federal Government, through NIST, to benefit from these technological advances.  I look forward to working with all interested parties to advance the Computer Security Enhancement Act of 1999. In my estimation, it is a good bill, and I am hopeful we can move it through the legislative process in short order.                          ____________________
