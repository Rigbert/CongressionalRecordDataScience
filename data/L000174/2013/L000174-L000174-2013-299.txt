President, I appreciate the words of both Senators from Pennsylvania. I would note there are currently three nominations pending for vacancies in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. All three have the bipartisan support of their home State Senators. All three were reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee 3 months ago. Yet Senate Republicans are permitting votes on only two of them. They are forcing Judge Luis Restrepo to continue to wait for a vote even though he would fill a seat that has been vacant for 4 years.  I mention this because we talk about how things move during this President's tenure as compared to that of his predecessor. At the end of President Bush's second term, I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee and I expedited confirmations of three of his nominees to this same court--three, not just allowing two to go through, as my friends on the other side of the aisle are today--and not having to wait for months and months. Those three were confirmed by voice vote. So you know how long it took, we had reported them out of the Judiciary Committee the day before. They were confirmed along with 7 other district court nominees for a total of 10 that day. We got them out of committee and voted them by voice vote. But now we have seven judicial nominees on the calendar, and Republicans are only allowing us to vote on two of them.  This is just the latest example of Senate Republicans insisting that President Obama play by a different set of rules than they had for President Bush. It was perfectly fine to expedite President Bush's three nominees to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and to confirm them all on the same day, along with seven others. We had Democratic control of the Senate, and we moved them that way. But now with President Obama they refuse to proceed with the seven nominees who are pending on the Calendar. They will not even proceed with the three judicial nominees needed in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.  So let's not talk about how Presidents are treated. I am not sure what it is that is different about President Obama, but his nominees get delayed, delayed, and delayed, unlike--and I use Pennsylvania as an example--where we vote out three, unanimously, of President Bush's nominees on one day and confirm them by voice vote the next day, along with seven others. Here they are refusing to proceed with the sevennominees on the Calendar. They will not even proceed with all three of the judicial nominees for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. There are currently seven vacancies on that court--seven. The Eastern District of Pennsylvania needs judges.  Like the two nominees we will be permitted to vote on today, Judge Restrepo has the support of his Republican home State Senator as well as every single Republican member of the Judiciary Committee. So let's not make him and the people of Pennsylvania wait.  Frankly, there is no good reason Nitza Quinones Alejandro and Jeffrey Schmehl should have waited this long for a vote. There is no good reason why, when half of President Bush's consensus district nominees waited 18 days or fewer after being sent to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee during his first term, these consensus nominees should have had to wait almost 100 days. This contributes to the unprecedented delays and obstruction of President Obama's consensus judicial nominees.  I read comments last week by Judge James Brady of the Middle District of Louisiana expressing concern about what has happened to the judicial confirmation process. Shelly Dick was confirmed this year to that court after months of delay, and the Advocate article noted the ``strain the empty judgeship had on a district overburdened with cases.'' Judge Brady was quoted saying of the confirmation process: ``It's just crazy, and we need to do something about that.'' I could not agree more. Judge Brady added that the delays in the process are ``driving away a lot of really good folks that would make excellent judges because they're saying, `I don't need to go through that process and be in limbo for 18, 20, 24 months.' That's something I'm very, very concerned about.'' We should all share that concern, especially Senators who are looking for district nominees to recommend to the President. I ask that this article, entitled ``Nomination Delays Hurting Courts, Federal Judge Says,'' be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.  The recent assertion by Senate Republicans that 99 percent of President Obama's nominees have been confirmed is just not accurate. He has nominated 237 individuals to be circuit or district judges, and 193 have been confirmed. That is 81 percent. By way of comparison, at the same point in President Bush's second term, June 13 of his fifth year in office, President Bush had nominated four fewer people, but had seen 214 of them confirmed, or 92 percent. That is an apples to apples comparison, and it demonstrates the undeniable fact that the Senate has confirmed a lower number and lower percentage of President Obama's nominees than President Bush's nominees at the same time in their presidencies.  I noted at the end of last year while Senate Republicans were insisting on delaying confirmations of 15 judicial nominees that could and should have taken place then, and that we would not likely be allowed to complete work on them until May. That was precisely the Republican plan. So when Senate Republicans now seek to claim credit for their confirmations in President Obama's second term, they are falsely inflating the confirmation statistics. The truth is that only seven confirmations have taken place this year that are not attributable to those nominations they held over from last year and that could and should have taken place last year. To return to the baseball analogy, if a baseball player goes 0-for-9, and then gets a hit, we do not say he is an all-star because he is batting 1.000 in his last at bat. We recognize that he is just 1-for-10, and not a very good hitter. Nor would a fair calculation of hits or home runs allow a player to credit those that occurred in one game or season to the next because it would make his stats look better.  I was Chairman of the Judiciary Committee for 17 months during President Bush's first term, so I know something about how President Bush's nominees were treated. During those 17 months, 100 of them were confirmed. In the 31 months that Republicans controlled the Senate during President Bush's first term, 105 of his circuit and district nominees were confirmed. That is, it took them almost twice as long to make as much progress as I had as Chairman. Even when Senate Democrats were in the minority, we worked with the Republicans to bring the number of vacancies all the way down to 28. Vacancies have remained near or above 80 for 4 years during the Obama presidency. In the last 4 years, Senate Republicans have never let vacancies get below 72. At this point in the fifth year of the Bush presidency there were 44 vacancies. Today they remain almost double that amount. Despite Senate Republicans who make self-congratulatory statements about ``progress'' this year, we are not even keeping up with attrition. Vacancies have increased, not decreased, since the start of this year.  If President Obama's nominees were receiving the same treatment as President Bush's, Judge Srinivasan would have been the 210th confirmation, not the 193rd and vacancies would be far lower. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has noted that it will require 33 more district and circuit confirmations this year to match President Bush's 5-year total. Even with the confirmations finally concluded during the first 6 months of this year, Senate Republicans have still not allowed President Obama to match the record of President Bush's first term. Even with an extra 6 months, we are still a dozen confirmations behind where we were at the end of 2004.  In addition to the obstruction of circuit and district nominees, I am deeply concerned about the impact of sequestration on our Federal courts. I continue to hear from judges and legal professionals around the country who worry about the impact of these senseless budget cuts, and I share their concern. A recent evaluation of sequestration concluded: ``Its impact on the operation of the [F]ederal courts will be devastating and longlasting.'' Sequestration will exacerbate the delays our courts already face due to persistent understaffing, both for civil and criminal cases. According to the Executive Summary of ``FY 2013 Sequestration Impacts on the Federal Judiciary,'' ``Delays in cases will harm individuals, small businesses, and corporations,'' while the ``cuts to funding for drug testing, substance abuse and mental health treatment of federal defendants and offenders have also been made, increasing further the risk to public safety.'' I ask that the full summary be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.  Judge Nitza Quinones Alejandro has served as a judge on the Court of Common Pleas for the First Judicial District of Pennsylvania since 1991. Prior to being a judge, Judge Quinones worked as a solo practitioner, a staff attorney with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, an Attorney Advisor with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Bureau of Hearings and Appeals, and a staff attorney at Community Legal Services, Inc. When confirmed, Judge Quinones will be the first openly gay Latina judge to serve on the Federal bench. Judge Quinones was also Pennsylvania's first Latina judge.  Judge Jeffrey Schmehl currently serves as the President Judge in Berks County, where he has been an active member of the bench since 1997. Prior to becoming a judge, Judge Schmehl served in various capacities in private practice, including as an associate and partner at Rhoda, Stoudt & Bradley and as a solo practitioner at the Law Offices of Jeffrey L. Schmehl, Esq. While working in private practice, Judge Schmehl was also a Berks County Solicitor from 1989 to 1997. In addition to his experience in private practice, Judge Schmehl has served as an assistant district attorney and as an assistant public defender for Berks County.  I want the Senate to make real progress on filling judicial vacancies so that the American people have access to justice. Before the recess, the minority leader asked during a floor debate when Gregory Phillips, the Wyoming nominee to the Tenth Circuit, would receive a vote.  Majority Leader Reid said: OK, let's vote on him right now.  They said: Well, we are not ready.  I hope the American people were watching, because there should be no ambiguity about this: The only reason the Senate is not voting today on Judge Restrepo, Attorney General Phillips, or the other seven judicial nominees pending on the Calendar is because of Republican refusal to allowsuch votes. They could be voted on today. We ought to do it. These nominees deserve better, and the American people deserve better.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         FY 2013 Sequestration Impacts on the Federal Judiciary                Sequestration and the Federal Judiciary       On March 26, 2013, the President signed Public Law 113-6,      the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of      2013, which provides full-year FY 2013 funding for the      federal government, including the Judiciary. The bill leaves      in place the government-wide sequestration cuts mandated      under the Budget Control Act of 2011.       Sequestration reduces Judiciary funding overall by nearly      $350 million below the FY 2012 discretionary funding. The      impact of sequestration on the Judiciary is compounded by the      fact that the Judiciary has no control over its workload--the      courts must react to the cases which it receives from the      Executive Branch, individuals and businesses--overall, that      workload has not declined. In addition, unlike most Executive      Branch entities, the Judiciary has little flexibility to move      funds between appropriations accounts to lessen the effects      of sequestration. There are no lower-priority programs to      reduce to transfer to other accounts.                 Impact of Sequestration on the Courts       Sequestration places unprecedented pressure on the federal      Judiciary's administration of justice. Its impact on the      operation of the federal courts will be devastating and      longlasting.       To mitigate the impact of sequestration on employees, the      courts have slashed non-salary budgets (training, information      technology, supplies and equipment), which is possible for      one fiscal year, but cannot be sustained into future years.      Even with these reductions, on a national level, up to 1,000      court employees could be laid off, or thousands of employees      could face furloughs before the end of the year. These      staffing losses will come on top of the nearly 2,200      probation officers and clerks office staff the courts have      already lost since the end of July 2011.       Cuts in staffing will result in the slower processing of      civil and bankruptcy cases. Delays in cases will harm      individuals, small businesses, and corporations.       Sequestration has also reduced funding for probation and      pretrial officer staffing throughout the courts, which means      less deterrence, detection, and response to possible resumed      criminal activity by federal defendants and offenders in the      community. In addition, law enforcement funding to support      GPS and other electronic monitoring of potentially dangerous      defendants and offenders has been cut 20%. Equivalent cuts to      funding for drug testing, substance abuse and mental health      treatment of federal defendants and offenders have also been      made, increasing further the risk to public safety.       Security systems and equipment in our Court Security      program have been cut 25% and court security officers' hours      have been reduced. These reductions come at a time of      heightened security resulting from the prosecutor murders in      Texas and the Boston bombings. A high level of security of      judges, prosecutors, defense counsel, jurors and litigants      entering our courthouses must be maintained.    Impact of Sequestration on Representation of Indigent Offenders       For Defender Services, incorporating enacted      appropriations, offset by sequestration, results in a $51      million shortfall in funding below minimum requirements. This      program has no flexibility to absorb such large cuts. It is      almost totally comprised of compensation to federal      defenders, rent, case related expenses (expert witnesses,      interpreters, etc.), and payments to private panel attorneys.      The only way to absorb the $51 million shortfall is to reduce      staffing or defer payments to private panel attorneys.       The Executive Committee examined all aspects of the      account, scrubbed expenses where possible, and approved a      spending plan that will result in federal defender offices      having to cut staff and furlough employees an average of      approximately 15 days. The approved spending plan will also      halt payments to private panel attorneys for the last 15      business days of the fiscal year. This will shift these      expenses to FY 2014, which were not considered as part of the      Judiciary's FY 2014 budget request to Congress, and add to FY      2014 appropriation requirements.       The uncertainty of the availability of federal defender      attorneys and the anticipated suspension of panel attorney      payments will create the real possibility that panel      attorneys may decline to accept Criminal Justice Act      appointments in cases that otherwise would have been      represented by FDOs. Delays in the cases moving forward may      result in violations of constitutional and statutory speedy      trial mandates resulting in criminal cases being dismissed.       Since all non-case related expenses in this account have      already been reduced, the only solution to avoiding these      impacts is for Congress to provide additional funds.                      Supplemental Appropriations       The Judiciary transmitted to the Office of Management and      Budget and the Congress an FY 2013 emergency supplemental      request that seeks $72.9 million to mitigate the devastating      impact of sequestration on defender services, probation and      pretrial services offices, court staffing, and court      security. The request includes $31.5 million for the Courts'      Salaries and Expenses account, and $41.4 million for the      Defender Services account.       Courts' Salaries and Expenses:       $18.5 million will be used to avoid further staffing cuts      and furloughs in clerks of court and probation and pretrial      services offices during the fourth quarter of FY 2013. This      funding will save the jobs of approximately 500 court      employees and avoid 14,400 planned furlough days for 3,300      court employees.       $13.0 million will restore half of the sequestration cuts      to drug testing and substance abuse and mental health      treatment services for defendants awaiting trial and      offenders released from prison.       Defender Services:       $27.7 million is required to avoid deferring payments to      private attorneys for the last 15 business days (3 weeks) of      the fiscal year.       $8.7 million is needed to avoid further staffing cuts and      furloughs in federal defender organizations during the fourth      quarter of FY 2013. This funding will save the jobs of      approximately 50 employees and avoid 9,600 planned furlough      days for 1,700 federal defender organization employees.       $5.0 million is for projected defense representation and      related expert costs for high-threat trials, including high-     threat cases in New York and Boston that, absent      sequestration, the Defender Services program would have been      able to absorb.       Executive branch agencies with criminal justice      responsibilities have had the flexibility and resources to      address their FY 2013 post-sequestration requirements. As a      result, these agencies--which directly impact the workload of      the Judiciary--have been able to avoid furloughs. The      Judiciary has no such flexibility and instead must ask      Congress to approve a supplemental appropriation.                   Cost Containment in the Judiciary       Cost containment is not new to the Judiciary. In 2004, as a      result of an unexpected shortfall in funding, the Judicial      Conference endorsed a cost containment strategy that called      for examining more than 50 court operations for reducing      expenses. Since then, the Judiciary has focused on three that      have the greatest potential for significant long-term      savings: rent, personnel expenses, and information      technology. To date, the Judiciary has cut costs by $1.1      billion.       The Judiciary's approach to cost containment is to      continuously challenge our ways of doing business and to      identify, wherever possible, ways to economize even further.      This can be a painful process as we are often proposing      changes to long established Judiciary customs and practices      and we sometimes face opposition from within. But we are      committed to doing everything we can to conserve resources      and be good stewards of the taxpayers' money.       While cost containment has been helpful during the last      several years of flat budgets, it will not come close to      offsetting the major reductions we face from sequestration.                                  ____          Nomination Delays Hurting Courts, Federal Judge Says                (By Jim Mustian, Advocate staff writer)                    Long delays drive away nominees       U.S. District Judge James J. Brady spoke out Monday against      the increasingly glacial pace of judicial nominations,      calling on U.S. Senate leaders to ``come to their senses''      and recognize the toll a vacant bench has on the court      system.       ``It's just crazy, and we need to do something about      that,'' said Brady, who sits in the Middle District of      Louisiana in Baton Rouge. ``What's happening, in my mind, is      we're driving away a lot of really good folks that would make      excellent judges because they're saying, `I don't need to go      through that process and be in limbo for 18, 20, 24 months.'      That's something I'm very, very concerned about.''       Brady's remarks, made to more than two dozen people      attending a Catholic Community Radio luncheon, came less than      a month after Baton Rouge attorney Shelly Dick was confirmed      as the Middle District's first female federal judge more than      a year after being nominated by President Barack Obama.       Dick's nomination was initially blocked by U.S. Sen. David      Vitter, who had been holding out hope that Obama would lose      to Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. Vitter, R-     La., who said at the time he wanted to ``let the people      speak,'' later withdrew his block and backed Dick's      confirmation after Obama won re-election months later.       Brady did not refer specifically to the delays in Dick's      confirmation, but he alluded to the strain the empty      judgeship had on a district overburdened with cases. Dick      already has been assigned nearly a third of the district's      877 pending civil cases, Brady said.       The federal Middle District of Louisiana includes the      parishes of East Baton Rouge, West Baton Rouge, East      Feliciana, West Feliciana, Pointe Coupee, Iberville,      Ascension, Livingston and St. Helena.       ``Getting a third judge has been a real relief for us,''      Brady said. ``It helps people get their cases decided much      more promptly and, I think, in a much better fashion.''       Delays in judicial nominations due to political differences      have become increasingly common in recent years. During      Obama's first term, the average wait time from nomination to      confirmation was more than six months for nominees to circuit      and district court judgeships, according to a recent report      by the Congressional Research Service.       ``It's gotten to be now that it's almost like you're going      to paint a big bullseye on anyone who's nominated as a      federal judge,'' said Brady, whose own confirmation in 2000      took a little less than a year.       Then-President Bill Clinton nominated Brady for the      judgeship.       Brady suggested that concerns over district court nominees      are often overblown, noting he and his colleagues adhere to      parameters set forth by the higher circuit courts and U.S.      Supreme Court.       ``I don't care if you're a Democratic appointee or a      Republican appointee, you're going to follow those laws, the      precedents that those courts have set,'' Brady said. ``I      don't know of anyone that deliberately goes out and tries to      rule against those precedents.''       Brady's remarks were unusual for a federal judge but were      prompted by the ``unusual times'' gripping the federal      courts, said Carl W. Tobias, a University of Richmond law      professor who is an expert on judicial nominations.       ``An increasing number of judges and other people are very      concerned about the (nomination) process and how long it      takes to move people through it,'' Tobias said. ``You have      Exhibit A with Shelly Dick right there in Baton Rouge.''       Tobias said he was glad to hear of Brady speaking publicly      about the issue.       ``I think it's important for people to understand what's      going on, and nobody knows better than the judges,'' he said.      ``They have to live with it.''
