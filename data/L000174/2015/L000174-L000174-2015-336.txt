President, I want to talk about privacy because privacy is not a partisan issue. It never has been, and never should be. Remember, 30 years ago I was in the minority. The Republicans were in the majority and controlled the Senate. It was then that I worked with my colleagues and led the effort to write the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, ECPA.  It required a lot of education because back then, electronic mail was an emerging technology. The World Wide Web was unimaginable. Electronic data storage was astronomically expensive. No one could have envisioned the way mobile technologies would transform our lives. Yet fortunately many of us in Congress had the foresight to anticipate that these new electronic communications would also need privacy protections.  That was 30 years ago. Look at what has changed since then. Now three decades later, that law is out of date. So today the Senator from Utah, Mr. Lee, and I are reintroducing the Electronic Communications Privacy Act Amendments Act of 2015. We want to bring this law into the 21st century. Our legislation is very straightforward. It ensures that the private information that we Americans electronically store in the cloud gets the same protections as the private information we Americans physically store at home. As it did in 1986, I hope the Senate will come together on a bipartisan basis to support these commonsense protections.  All of us have an expectation that the things we store in our house are private. If law enforcement wants access to them, they have to get the proper search warrants. Today, there seems to be an idea that if they are stored electronically, these rules should not apply.  I believe they should.  The bill Senator Lee and I introduced today protects Americans' digital privacy--in their emails and all the other files and photographs they store in the cloud. It promotes cloud computing and other new technologies by building consumer trust. And it also provides law enforcement agencies with the tools they need to ensure public safety.  I would remind my colleagues that several years ago the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit found that email was fully protected by the Fourth Amendment. It said that ``the Fourth Amendment must keep pace with the inexorable march of technological progress, or its guarantees will wither and perish.'' This bill takes up that challenge.  Obviously we have technologies today that nobody would have dreamed of just a couple of generations ago. But we have a Constitution that has protected this country for well over 200 years, and we hope it will protect it for hundreds of years into the future. We need to make sure our laws keep up with the protections we Americans expect from our Constitution.  First and most importantly, the bill enshrines in statute the fundamental Fourth Amendment warrant requirement for email, texts, and other electronic data. It requires that the government have a criminal search warrant based on possible cause to obtain the stored content of Americans' email and other electronic communications from third-party providers. This ensures that email communications have the same protections as phone calls and private documents stored in your home.  However, the bill's warrant requirement contains an important exception to address emergency circumstances. It explicitly states that it does not affect current authorities under the Wiretap Act or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. And it ensures that law enforcement can continue to investigate corporate wrong-doing by using grand jury subpoenas to obtain emails directly from corporate entities when held on their internal systems.  The second major component of the bill requires law enforcement agencies to promptly notify individuals when the government has obtained their emails through their service providers, but permits a delay of that notice to protect the integrity of ongoing investigations--no different from what we do in other law enforcement matters. The bill would also require service providers to notify the government three days before they inform a customer that the provider disclosed their information to the government.  This is not a Republican or Democratic issue, nor is it liberal or conservative. In fact, Senator Lee and I would note that we have a broad coalition of more than 50 privacy, civil liberties, civil rights, and technology industry groups and leaders from across the political spectrum who have endorsed this reform effort. Support spans from the Heritage Foundation and Americans for Tax Reform, to the Center for Democracy and Technology and the ACLU.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the January 22, 2015, coalition letter in support of the bill.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 January 22, 2015.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Chairman,     Senate Judiciary Committee.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Ranking Member,     Senate Judiciary Committee.       Dear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Leahy: We, the      undersigned companies and organizations, are writing to urge      speedy consideration of Sen. Leahy's and Sen. Lee's ECPA      Amendments Act that we expect will be introduced in the      coming weeks. The bill would update the Electronic      Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) to provide stronger      protection to sensitive personal and proprietary      communications stored in ``the cloud.'' The legislation was      considered and adopted by a voice vote in the Committee in      the 113th Congress.       ECPA, which sets standards for government access to private      communications, is critically important to businesses,      government investigators and ordinary citizens. Though the      law was forward-looking when enacted in 1986, technology has      advanced dramatically and ECPA has been outpaced. Courts have      issued inconsistent interpretations of the law, creating      uncertainty for service providers, for law enforcement      agencies, and for the hundreds of millions of Americans who      use the Internet in their personal and professional lives.      Moreover, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in US v. Warshak      has held that a provision of ECPA allowing the government to      obtain a person's email without a warrant is      unconstitutional.       The ECPA Amendments Act would update ECPA in one key      respect, making it clear that, except in emergencies or under      other existing exceptions, the government must obtain a      warrant in order to compel a service provider to disclose the      content of emails, texts or other private material stored by      the service provider on behalf of its users.       This standard would provide greater privacy protections and      create a more level playing field for technology. It would      cure the constitutional defect identified by the Sixth      Circuit It would allow law enforcement officials to obtain      electronic communications in all appropriate cases while      protecting     Americans' constitutional rights. Notably, the Department of      Justice and FBI already follow the warrant-for-content rule.      It would provide certainty for American businesses developing      innovative new services and competing in a global      marketplace. It would implement a core principle supported by      Digital Due Process, www.digitaldueprocess.org, a broad      coalition of companies, privacy groups, think tanks,      academics and other groups.-       This legislation has seemingly been held up by only one      issue--an effort to allow civil regulators to demand, without      a warrant, the content of customer documents and      communications directly from third party service providers.      This should not be permitted. Such warrantless access would      expand government power; government regulators currently      cannot compel service providers to disclose their customers'      communications. It would prejudice the innovative services      that all stakeholders support, and would create one procedure      for data stored locally and a different one for data stored      in the cloud.       Because of all its benefits, there is an extraordinary      consensus around ECPA reform--one unmatched by any other      technology and privacy issue. Successful passage of ECPA      reform sends a powerful message--Congress can act swiftly on      crucial, widely supported, bipartisan legislation. Failure to      enact reform sends an equally powerful message--that privacy      protections are lacking in law enforcement access to user      information and that constitutional values are imperiled in a      digital world.       For all these reasons, we strongly urge all members of the      Senate Judiciary Committee to support the ECPA Amendments      Act.
