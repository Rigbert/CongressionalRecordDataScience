Speaker, today Maryland mourns the loss of William Coates, thought to be the oldest man in America and certainly someone who made a lifetime of contributions to our state.  Mr. Coates was born in Maryland on June 2, 1889 and lived to see many of our nation's most important moments, including the Wright Brothers' first flight, the Great Depression, two World Wars, the Civil Rights movement and the Space age.  Over the span of his life in our great state, Mr. Coates worked with the Maryland State Highway Department in the 1930s building roads for the state, and as a tobacco farmer on a variety of farms throughout Prince George's County including Claggett Farm in Upper Marlboro.  Mr. Coates leaves behind him a caring family of nine children, 21 grandchildren and 37 great-grandchildren, many of whom still live in Prince George's County. His life, like the times he lived through, will long be fondly remembered by his family and friends and those of us who marveled at his longevity.  William Coates' extended and healthy life is also a tribute to a dedicated investment in medical research. Mr. Coates' life shows us that by investing in research, we can all improve our lives and our health.  William Coates has dedicated a life of service to our state and community, and my thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends.                          ____________________
