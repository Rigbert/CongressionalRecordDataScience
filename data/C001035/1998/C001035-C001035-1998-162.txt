President, today I am introducing the Small Business Paperwork Reduction Act Amendments of 1998, a companion bill to legislation pending in the House of Representatives.  This legislation has five components. First, it requires the Office of Management and Budget to publish annually in the Federal Register and on the Internet all of the Federal paperwork requirements imposed on small business. This will not only serve as a valuable tool for those who must comply with these mandates, but it will also make it far easier for policy makers to monitor, and I would hope check, the growth in the paperwork burden.  Second, under the bill, each agency will have to establish one point of contact to act as a liaison with small businesses on paperwork requirements. In an era when serving the customer has become recognized by the private sector as critical, this is a modest step to ask of our government.  Third, the legislation provides for the suspension of civil fines imposed on small enterprises for first-time paperwork violations, except under certain circumstances, such as when the violation causes serious harm to the public or presents an imminent danger to the public health or safety. In dealing with America's entrepreneurs, we need to move away from a culture that seems to place a higher priority on imposing punishment than on facilitating compliance.  Fourth, in addition to meeting the mandates of the Paperwork Reduction Act, agencies will have to make further efforts to reduce the burden on enterprises with fewer than 25 employees.
