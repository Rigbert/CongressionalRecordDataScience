Speaker, I thank the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn) for his remarks. I want to say that, having known him for a long period of time, there is no doubt in my mind that he has himself been a spark, an inspiration to many, many young people, not only in his home area of South Carolina, but around this country, to see the opportunities available to them.
