President and colleagues, the Senate now has an opportunity to throw the 1990s NAFTA play book into the dustbin of history and begin a new forward-thinking era in trade. This can be a momentous day for creating more economic opportunity for our people, transparency and sunshine and the forward march of American values.  The legislation can help us pry open the booming markets for our exports. It will strengthen the American brand in the fight against trade cheats and bad actors who block our way. It will raise the bar for worker rights, environmental safeguards, and human rights. It will help strip out the excessive secrecy that makes people skeptical about trade. Colleagues, in a sentence, this is how you begin to get trade done right.  I yield the floor and urge support for cloture.                             Cloture Motion
