President, I say to the chairman, who I respect so much, I agree tomorrow we will take 30 minutes equally divided before the vote on this amendment. My hope this evening is, in the span of perhaps 20 minutes, to give a longer statement so it will not be necessary to repeat it tomorrow and save us some time so we can move more quickly. I know the Senator has been extremely patient.
