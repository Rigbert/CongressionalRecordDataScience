 President.  This amendment, as modified, is being cosponsored by Senator Grassley and has been cleared by both sides. This amendment simply requires recipients of TARP funding to meet strict H-1B worker hiring standards to prevent displacement of U.S. workers.  I thank Chairman Baucus for working with me on changes to my original amendment, and I urge its adoption.
