Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding.  Madam Speaker, we are here this week to debate what some might call a simple medical question. Specifically, whether a certain procedure known as partial birth abortion should be left alone as good and permissible medicine, or legally banned as brutality, masquerading as medicine.  This week the 22-year coverup of abortion methods is over. I applaud Chairman Canady for his courage in bringing this very thoughtful legislation to the floor and for exposing this particular abuse of little kids.  For more than two decades the abortion industry has sanitized abortion methods by aggressively employing the shrewdest and most benign euphemisms market research can buy. They have engaged, without question, in coverup.  Throughout the country there have been proposals at the State legislative level for informed consent legislation to provide, before the woman submits to abortion, a clear understanding of the child's humanity. Pictures, anatomically correct, about the child in utero.  NARAL and the Abortion Rights lobby has opposed each and every one of those efforts to inform the woman about the humanity of the unborn child and about any possible deleterious effects that abortion could have on her life. Gov. Bob Casey recently told me that in Pennsylvania, where informed consent is the law, there has been a 13-percent drop in abortions, and Dr. Bernard Nathanson, a former abortionist himself, has said that if wombs had windows, women would run out of abortion clinics, because they would see that the child that they carry is a little baby.  Now we find ourselves in the midst of a sea change regarding how abortion is addressed by this House. This week, in addition to the debates on whether or not the Federal Government should fund abortions, we will, for the first time, begin to debate whether or not a particular heinous method of abortion, partial birth abortions, should continue to be legal in our land.  This is serious business, Madam Speaker. It is therefore especially fitting that this debate in particular should not be about philosophical abstractions like choice, the rights of women and privacy, all of them laudable when considered only in the abstract. This debate, if it is to shed any light on the serious question at hand, if it is to be honest and thereby worthy of this House, must be about the very behavior, the methods themselves, and that is why the descriptions of this type of abortion needs to go forward without being gagged.  Madam Speaker, as the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Canady] pointed out earlier, Dr. Martin Haskell, a medical doctor who unashamedly performs these methods of abortions by the hundreds, unashamedly does this kind of abuse to children, let him describe it in his own words as he told the National Abortion Federation's risk management seminar Abortion Federation's risk management seminar a couple of years ago.  I quote him:       The surgeon introduces a large, grasping forcep through the      vaginal and cervical canals into the corpus of the uterus.      Based upon his knowledge of fetal orientation, he moves the      tip of the instrument carefully toward the fetal lower      extremities. When the instrument appears on the sonogram      screen, the surgeon is able to open and close its jaws to      firmly and reliably grasp a lower extremity. The surgeon than      applies firm traction to the instrument causing a version of      the fetus and pulls the extremity into the vagina.  Dr. Haskell goes on to say:       The surgeon uses his fingers to deliver the lower      extremity, then the torso, then the shoulders, and then the      upper extremities. The skull lodges at the internal cervical      os. Usually there is not enough dilation for it to pass      through. The fetus is oriented dorsum or spine up.       The surgeon then takes a bear of blunt, curved Metzenbaum      scissors in the right hand. He carefully advances the tip,      curved down, along the spine and under his middle finger      until he feels it contact at the base of the skull under the      tip of his middle finger.       The surgeon then forces the scissors into the base of the      skull. Having safely entered the skull, he spreads the      scissors to enlarge the opening.       The surgeon removes the scissors and introduces a suction      catheter into this hole and evacuates the skull contents.      With the catheter still in place, he applies traction to the      fetus, removing it completely from the patient.  Madam Speaker, that clinical description of child abuse is what is in the table and will be debated this week. Whether individuals should be permitted to pull a living child out of her mother's womb and stick a scissors through the back of her head and then suck her brains out until she is dead is the brunt and the crux of this legislation. Should that behavior be legal, or should it be criminal is what we must decide this week.  This week, this legislation will, for the first time ever in this debate in this House or in the Senate, finally say whether or not we will approve or disapprove of legalized abortion, particularly in this method.  It was mentioned earlier by my good friend, Mr. Canady, and also by some other Members during this special order, that one particular nurse saw this and got deathly sick from what she saw. She saw that living child, the heart beating, the feet kicking, the hands grasping and making little fists, and she walked out of there never to go back, and now she has turned State's evidence to bring a witness to the Congress and to the American people about partial birth abortions.  It was pointed out earlier that the American Medical Association's legislative council saw fit to join in supporting this legislation, and shame on the American Medical Association when that recommendation came forward for not saying yes, we will stand for children as we have done so historically, going back to the 1860's and beyond, when they said that abortion takes the life of a baby. Unfortunately, politics intervened with its ugly head and unfortunately, they have now become ``neutral'' on this particular legislation.  The gentleman from Florida [Mr. Canady] is a great leader, and he is bringing this debate to this House, and I hope many people who call themselves pro choice will take a good, hard look at the reality of what abortion actually is.  Madam Speaker, when you look at the methods of abortion, this is one of many that is a heinous act. If you look at D&C abortions where the baby is literally dismembered in utero, not so much different from this method. The suction methods which the other side likes to talk about with all kinds of euphemisms, suction curettage and all of those words they use, clinical words, to kill the baby, usually around the 12th week.                              {time}  2130  Those methods, too, destroy a living growing developing little baby boy or little baby girl.  This legislation is human rights legislation. I hope this whole House, and I know it is hoping against hope because some Members are under instructions from the abortion lobby to oppose it and to speak out against it, but in their heart of hearts, that small still voice will say, that is a crime. That is child abuse.  We need to speak out loudly and clearly because we have an affirmative obligation to protect children from that kind of abuse. I applaud the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Canady] for his leadership. It is a good bill and deserves the support of every Member of this House.
