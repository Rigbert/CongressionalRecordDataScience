Mr. Chairman, in answering the question of the contractual agreement of the forest, it will affect the ability to take trees off that forest. There is no doubt about that. With all due respect to the gentleman from California, I do believe his legal staff will tell him that.  I am going to suggest this issue is not in this bill. This is the first time I believe on this House floor that we have not had a Tongass provision in the committee bill that came to the floor. I never tried to put one in.
