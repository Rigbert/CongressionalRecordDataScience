I thank the gentleman very much for offering that important clarification. I think one of the difficulties is when you have a large number of new Members that are elected, it takes a long time to learn the ropes, and sometimes perhaps people speak out before they check the facts. I think the gentleman's commentary this afternoon is helpful to the country.  Let me say I come down here for a similar reason, and that is to offer a word of caution to Members of the freshman class, especially on the Republican side of the aisle, who this past Friday held a retreat. According to the press accounts, the purpose of the retreat was to reflect on how their best-laid plans for the so-called revolution went awry and to reflect why the American people have turned their backs thus far on their message.  There was an article in my local paper, the Toledo Blade, last Saturday, which I am going to submit for the Record, which talks about the fact that this group of new Members was very concerned after the President's State of the Union that he was able to get his message across to the country, but that their leadership, according to this quote in the newspaper, that their leaders did not understand the importance of what they are calling communication. They were criticizing some of their leaders as too in your face, too extreme, too ideological. In order to help them out of this mess, one of the speakers that was invited to the retreat was the chief executive officer of Scott Paper Company.   When I read down to that point in the article, I knew that I had to come down here today and speak a bit. I would just say to the Members of the new class that rather than seeking political assistance from speakers like this Mr. Dunlap, I think maybe it might be important to have some quiet reflection, more in a spiritual sense, on your own, because when I tell you about this gentleman, I am not so sure you would want to invite him back.  He is one of the most well known chief executive officers in our country, who is referred to as ``Chainsaw Al,'' the meanest boss in America, the country's most notorious employee killer. In his own biography he describes himself as Rambo in pinstripes because of the way that he cut employment and laid off, terminated, thousands of workers at Scott Paper Company, his home company. In fact, the May 1995 issue of Fortune Magazine indicates a reduction in work force at Scott Paper of nearly half. Thousands and thousands and thousands of workers at that particular company were given the pink slip.  Now, if I could give my colleagues some advice, it would be don't listen to Mr. Dunlap. Yet I see that he was invited. Over the last couple of years he has fired over 30,000 people in our country and shipped most of those jobs overseas. Recently he was a party to a merger between Kimberly Clark and Scott Paper, which he ended up coming out of that deal looking pretty good. He made over $100 million on the deal.  I would like to ask Mr. Dunlap, in giving his advice to the new Members, I would like to know what happened to those thousands and thousands of workers that gave their loyal service to Scott Paper? What happened to them?  During the time that all these workers were cut and terminated, Scott Paper enjoyed profits like it had never seen. Well, who would not, when you cut our work force in half? But he benefitted, $100 million.  It is interesting to look at Scott Paper as a company, because it has manufacturing facilities all over the world. I know our listeners and Members of the House here buy their products. Viva paper towels is one you will notice on the shelves, or Scotties facial tissues, or Cottonelle, that you use in the bathroom.  But the company whose products are familiar to us all is cleaning up at the expense of the U.S. taxpayers. Some of the countries that they do business in have the most dirt cheap labor anywhere on the globe. Honduras, gosh, they are a great respect for workers in Honduras. They are shot if they try to earn a decent living down there. Costa Rica, China, Thailand, Malaysis, Taiwan, South Korea. Scott Paper has a huge presence in Mexico. In fact, its Mexican subsidiary, Compania Industrial de San Cristobal, operates five manufacturing facilities in Mexico, and plans for more expansion are under way.  In other words, all these people that got laid off in this country and are terminated coast to coast, they are going to be replaced by workers in Mexico who earn less than $1 an hour. Yet if you go to the store and buy any one of those products from Scott Paper, your prices did not go down. So what happened to the money? Mr. Dunlap took it.  Though the productivity of the workers at Scott even prior to the layoffs was very high and their profits were high, they were not a bankrupt company, workers in Scott Paper's tissue mill in Everett, WA, and I hope there are citizens from Everett, WA who are listening, and other mills across the country, saw their jobs transferred to Mexico already. It is very interesting. In Mexico those workers have no benefits, they have no benefits. The workers in Washington made a living wage. That company really used to stand for something, before ``Chain Saw Al'' got involved.  In January of 1994, Scott employed 33,000 people worldwide. But by December, when he had finished, there were 19,900 people left. Those who did not lose their job last year, imagine what it must be like to come to work every day in that company wondering whether the hatchet is going to fall on your neck in spite of how hard you work, in spite of your loyalty to the company, because every worker in that company knows they can be replaced by a worker in another country where Scott has a plant that earns almost nothing, not even enough to afford to buy Scott's products in the countries where those products are sold and made.  Scott Paper essentially put U.S. employees out of work, and, by building up operations in companies like Honduras and Mexico, the company continues to undercut the wages of this country and the American people.  But, wait. It gets worse. We know prices have not gone down. In fact, prices in the tissue area have been going up for years, at the same time as people like Mr. Dunlap are reaping huge profits while they take advantage of dirt cheap labor elsewhere and put our people out of work in this country. The company does not even have the decency to pass along its cost savings as a result of manufacturing and other companies in the form of price reductions at the shelves when our people go to the supermarkets to shop.  In the last year alone, however, as a result of this kind of shredding of a corporate charter with the American people, where so many of our folks are thrown out of work, its stock price skyrocketed. Wall Street could not be happier, its price value going up over 100 percent.  Now, what happened recently was Kimberly Clark just bought Scott Paper in July of this past year for $6.9 billion. Mr. Dunlap, that is where he managed to get $100 million on the deal, and effectively built a rising stock price on the swelling ranks of jobless people. How would you like to have him live next door to you?  Kimberly Clark is the largest paper product company in Mexico, having invested over $100 million there, and millions more in other countries. It is interesting to see, a gentleman who came into address the new freshmen, who disdains Government, who disdains the laws of this country, benefits so much from Government programs.  In 1994, Kimberly Clark, get ready for this, obtained $9.27 million from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, for insurance. That is an instrumentality of the Government of the United States, paid for by our taxpayers to invest their money in other countries.  In the same year, our Department of Labor certified 636 U.S. employees of Kimberly Clark as approved to receive help, unemployment help, because they were being put out of work because imports were coming in from Scott and Kimberly, the same products from these other countries, putting our workers out of work, and the American people have to pay for the families that have been put out of work by this very same company. Scott Paper, with its presence in Mexico, also had 300 workers. So that is nearly 800 workers just in the past year that we are paying for, unemployed people, that these very same companies put out of work in the United States.  You could say that is a form of corporate welfare, because, on the one hand these companies are using our money to go abroad, insurance through the taxpayers of the United States, and then putting the U.S. work force out of work and having to get the money to pay for those unemployed workers through our Department of Labor. We know Americans are paying for the training of nearly 1,000 workers just over the last year because of the actions of these two companies.  Now, it is amazing, because Mr. Dunlap began working for Scott Paper at the beginning of 1994. The terms of his contract, though hidden from the public, specify a base salary of no less than $1 million per year. While 13,100 workers got pink slips, Scott Paper bought Mr. Dunlap a multimillion-dollar home in Boca Raton, FL, and gave him a $333,000 hiring bonus. I sure hope that the new freshmen did not have to pay him to speak before their group, because he certainly could afford to come on his own.  So I guess what I wanted to point out today, there were articles that were included in Roll Call on Monday talking about some of his comments to that group, where he said, and I can't repeat some of these words, by the way, but I will just leave a blank, where he advised the freshmen, ``Never give up. Never give up. Never let the `blank' get you down. This nonsense about the working people, don't ever apologize for being successful.''  This is the kind of person that is being listened to here in Washington. It says here, and I quote directly,        The sleepy-eyed freshmen were greeted with a take no      prisoners exhortation from Al Dunlap, the chief executive of      the Scott Paper Company, who has been described variously as      the meanest boss in America, the country's most notorious      employee killer.  What an attitude at the end of the 20th century for someone with this kind of rapacious greed to be invited to address Members of the Congress of the United States, which means that they are acquiescing in the actions that he has taken.
