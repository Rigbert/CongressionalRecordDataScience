Speaker, it is with great honor and enthusiasm that I congratulate the members of St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church in Merrillville, Indiana as they celebrate their 90th anniversary. The festivities will begin on Sunday, November 14, 2004 with a special service, followed by a banquet to celebrate this momentous occasion.  Beckoning visitors who are traveling on Interstate 65, the golden domes of St. Sava offer an amazing spectacle. However, it is the interior of the church that the parishioners hold sacred. Built from Indiana limestone in a five-year construction project, the present sanctuary located at 9191 Mississippi Street in Merrillville replaced the original St. Sava Church, built in 1914 in Gary, Indiana, after that church was destroyed by fire. The dedicated members of the church came together to worship at the St. Sava ``small hall'' in Hobart, Indiana while plans were made for their new sanctuary. Undeterred by the loss of their church building, the congregation demonstrated their commitment to each other and to their faith by carrying on with their services at the ``small hall'' for 13 years.  Mr. Speaker, St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church is led in its faith by the Very Reverend Jovan Todorovich. He has been the priest at the church for 35 of its 90 years, and the proud parishioners are thankful for the spiritual and emotional leadership he has provided during that time. Church President Michael Gallich has attended St. Sava since 1946 and is proud that the church has been able to maintain the Serbian traditions and customs that make their church unique. Father Todorovich believes the anniversary can be used to connect the new generation of the church with its past. Because the congregation has been blessed with tremendous leadership and good fortune throughout its history, it is appropriate that the celebration of the church's anniversary will be held near the Thanksgiving holiday.  His Grace Bishop Longin, along with the Very Reverend Todorovich, will serve the Holy Hierarchical Liturgy the morning of November 14, which will be followed by a memorial service to be conducted by representatives of a local American Legion at the adjacent Memorial Park to commemorate the fallen soldiers of all wars. The celebration banquet will conclude the festivities, which will feature St. Sava's folklore group and choir, as well as tamburitza orchestras and kolo bands.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating the congregation of St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church as they celebrate the 90th anniversary of their parish. Blessed with outstanding leadership and unwavering faith, the congregation of St. Sava has enriched Northwest Indiana by bringing the proud and historic Serbian traditions to our community. May God continue to bless the parishioners and the church leaders for many years to come.                          ____________________
