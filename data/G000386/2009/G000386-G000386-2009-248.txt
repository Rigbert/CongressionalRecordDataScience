 President, the first point I wish to make is that with the false claims provisions in the Leahy-Grassley bill, which deals with other provisions as well, but the False Claims Act is essential to accomplishing the overall purposes of the bill, along with other tools to do it--to get rid of fraud. We are trying to just, in this bill, in a very rifle shot way, correct some court opinions that have been detrimental and weaken the False Claims Act. That is all we are trying to accomplish in this bill that deals with bigger things as well.  What Senator Kyl is bringing up is a legitimate subject of discussion because it has been brought up at other times since passage of the False Claims Act 22 years ago. I don't say it is not legitimate to discuss it. But there is broader false claims legislation in the Judiciary, and it ought to be discussed at a time when we have hearings on this subject.
