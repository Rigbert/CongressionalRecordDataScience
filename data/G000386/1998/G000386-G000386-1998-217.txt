 This language is not in the House report. This Senate language directs the Internal Revenue Service to review the legal standards and decisions the IRS utilizes in determining when fitness services and activities of tax-exempt organizations should be subject to unrelated business income tax. The stated intent of this review is to insure that tax-exempt health clubs are not unfairly competing with for-profit health clubs. I am afraid that the effect of this language will be to harm non-profit community organizations. Is this the intent of the language?
