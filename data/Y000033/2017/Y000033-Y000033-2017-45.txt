Mr. Speaker, I had the privilege last Sunday to be an observer in Puerto Rico for the plebiscite and watch the people of Puerto Rico make the decision that they would like to be the 51st State.  I think it is time for this Congress to make the 3,400,000 American citizens part of the United States--in full grandeur, as every one of us have--and have a chance of making sure we can vote for everyone to be part of this.  I think it is time that America should stop colonizing. If I am not mistaken, this is the last Nation that has a colony. The great America of the United States has a colony, and I think it is time that we change that. Vote in Congress to make sure that we have the 51st State.
