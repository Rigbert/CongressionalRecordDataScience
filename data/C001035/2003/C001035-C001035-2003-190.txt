President, pursuant to the requirements of Rule XXVI, Sec. 2, of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the rules of the Committee on Governmental Affairs for the 108th Congress adopted by the Committee on February 5, 2003.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         Rules of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs      RULE 1. MEETINGS AND MEETING PROCEDURES OTHER THAN HEARINGS       A. Meeting dates. The Committee shall hold its regular      meetings on the first Thursday of each month, when the      Congress is in session, or at such other times as the      chairman shall determine. Additional meetings may be called      by the chairman as he deems necessary to expedite Committee      business. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 3, Standing Rules of the Senate.)       B. Calling special Committee meetings. If at least three      members of the Committee desire the chairman to call a      special meeting, they may file in the offices of the      Committee a written request therefor, addressed to the      chairman. Immediately thereafter, the clerk of the committee      shall notify the chairman of such request. If, within 3      calendar days after the filing of such request, the chairman      fails to call the requested special meeting, which is to be      held within 7 calendar days after the filing of such request,      a majority of the committee members may file in the offices      of the committee their written notice that a special      Committee meeting will be held, specifying the date and hour      thereof, and the Committee shall meet on that date and hour.       Immediately upon the filing of such notice, the Committee      clerk shall notify all Committee members that such special      meeting will be held and inform them of its date and hour.      (Rule XXVI, Sec. 3, Standing Rules of the Senate.)       C. Meeting notices and agenda. Written notices of Committee      meetings, accompanied by an agenda, enumerating the items of      business to be considered, shall be sent to all Committee      members at least 3 days in advance of such meetings,      excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays in which the      Senate is not in session. The written notices required by      this Rule may be provided by electronic mail. In the event      that unforeseen requirements or Committee business prevent a      3-day notice of either the meeting or agenda, the Committee      staff shall communicate such notice and agenda, or any      revisions to the agenda, as soon as practicable by telephone      or otherwise to members or appropriate staff assistants in      their offices.       D. Open business meetings. Meetings for the transaction of      Committee or Subcommittee business shall be conducted in open      session, except that a meeting or series of meetings on the      same subject for a period of no more than 14 calendar days      may be closed to the public on a motion made and seconded to      go into closed session to discuss only whether the matters      enumerated in clauses (1) through (6) below would require the      meeting to be closed, followed immediately by a record vote      in open session by a majority of the Committee or      Subcommittee members when it is determined that the matters      to be discussed or the testimony to be taken at such meeting      or meetings--       (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in      the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct      of foreign relations of the United States;       (2) will relate solely to matters of Committee or      Subcommittee staff personnel or internal staff management or      procedure;       (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or      misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing      of an individual, or otherwise expose an individual to public      contempt or obloquy or will represent a clearly unwarranted      invasion of the privacy of an individual;       (4) will disclose the identity of an informer or law      enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating      to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense      that is required to be kept secret in the interests of      effective law enforcement;       (5) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets      of financial or commercial information pertaining      specifically to a given person if--       (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept      confidential by Government officers and employees; or       (B) the information has been obtained by the Government on      a confidential basis, other than through an application by      such person for a specific Government financial or other      benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to      prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such      person; or       (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential      under other provisions of law or Government regulations.      (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever disorder arises      during a Committee or Subcommittee meeting that is open to      the public, or any demonstration of approval or disapproval      is indulged in by any person in attendance at any such      meeting, it shall be the duty of the chairman to enforce      order on his own initiative and without any point of order      being made by a member of the Committee or Subcommittee;      provided, further, that when the chairman finds it necessary      to maintain order, he shall have the power to clear the room,      and the Committee or Subcommittee may act in closed session      for so long as there is doubt of the assurance of order.      (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(d), Standing Rules of the Senate.)       E. Prior notice of first degree amendments. It shall not be      in order for the committee, or a Subcommittee thereof, to      consider any amendment in the first degree proposed to any      measure under consideration by the Committee or Subcommittee      unless a written copy of such amendment has been delivered to      each member of the Committee or Subcommittee, as the case may      be, and to the office of the Committee or Subcommittee, at      least 24 hours before the meeting of the Committee or      Subcommittee at which the amendment is to be proposed. The      written copy of amendments in the first degree required by      this Rule may be provided by electronic mail. This      subsection may be waived by a majority of the members      present. This subsection shall apply only when at least 72      hours written notice of a session to mark-up a measure is      provided to the Committee or Subcommittee.       F. Meeting transcript. The Committee or Subcommittee shall      prepare and keep a complete transcript or electronic      recording adequate to fully record the proceeding of each      meeting whether or not such meeting or any part thereof is      closed to the public, unless a majority of the Committee or      Subcommittee members vote to forgo such a record. (Rule XXVI,      Sec. 5(e), Standing Rules of the Senate.)                            RULE 2. QUORUMS       A. Reporting measures and matters. A majority of the      members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum for      reporting to the Senate any measures, matters or      recommendations. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(a)(1), Standing Rules of      the Senate.)       B. Transaction of routine business. One-third of the      membership of the Committee shall constitute a quorum for the      transaction of routine business, provided that one member of      the minority is present. For the purpose of this paragraph,      the term ``routine business'' includes the convening of a      meeting and the consideration of any business of the      Committee other than reporting to the Senate any measures,      matters or recommendations. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(a)(1),      Standing Rules of the Senate.)       C. Taking testimony. One member of the Committee shall      constitute a quorum for taking sworn or unsworn testimony.      (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(a)(2) and 7(c)(2), Standing Rules of the      Senate.)       D. Subcommittee quorums. Subject to the provisions of      sections 7(a) (1) and (2) of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules      of the Senate, the Subcommittees of this Committee are      authorized to establish their own quorums for the transaction      of business and the taking of sworn testimony.       E. Proxies prohibited in establishment of quorum. Proxies      shall not be considered for the establishment of a quorum.                             RULE 3. VOTING       A. Quorum required. Subject to the provisions of subsection      (E), no vote may be taken by the Committee, or any      Subcommittee thereof, on any measure or matter unless a      quorum, as prescribed in the preceding section, is actually      present.       B. Reporting measures and matters. No measure, matter or      recommendation shall be reported from the Committee unless a      majority of the Committee members are actually present, and      the vote of the Committee to report a measure or matter shall      require the concurrence of a majority of those members who      are actually present at the time the vote is taken. (Rule      XXVI, Sec. 7(a)(1) and (3), Standing Rules of the Senate.)       C. Proxy voting. Proxy voting shall be allowed on all      measures and matters before the Committee, or any      Subcommittee thereof, except that, when the Committee, or any      Subcommittee thereof, is voting to report a measure or      matter, proxy votes shall be allowed solely for the purposes      of recording a member's position on the pending question.      Proxy voting shall be allowed only if the absent Committee or      Subcommittee member has been informed of the matter on which      he is being recorded and his affirmatively requested that he      be so recorded. All proxies shall be filed with the chief      clerk of the Committee or Subcommittee thereof, as the case      may be. All proxies shall be in writing and shall contain      sufficient reference to the pending matter as is necessary to      identify it and to inform the Committee or Subcommittee as to      how the member establishes his vote to be recorded thereon.      (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(a)(3) and 7(c)(1), Standing Rules of the      Senate.)       D. Announcement of vote.       (1) Whenever the Committee by roll call vote reports any      measure or matter, the report of the Committee upon such a      measure or matter shall include a tabulation of the votes      cast in favor of and the votes cast in opposition to such      measure or matter by each member of the Committee. (Rule      XXVI, Sec. 7(c), Standing Rules of the Senate.)       (2) Whenever the Committee by roll call vote acts upon any      measure or amendment thereto, other than reporting a measure      or matter, the results thereof shall be announced in the      Committee report on that measure unless previously announced      by the Committee, and such announcement shall include a      tabulation of the votes cast in favor of and the votes cast      in opposition to each such measure and amendment thereto by      each member of the Committee who was present at the meeting.      (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)       (3) In any case in which a roll call vote is announced, the      tabulation of votes shall state separately the proxy vote      recorded in favor of and in opposition to that measure,      amendment thereto, or matter. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 7(b) and (c),      Standing Rules of the Senate.)       E. Polling.       (1) The Committee, or any Subcommittee thereof, may poll      (a) internal Committee or Subcommittee matters including the      Committee's or Subcommittee's staff, records and budget; (b)      steps in an investigation, including issuance of subpoenas,      applications for immunity orders, and requests for documents      from agencies; and (c) other Committee or Subcommittee      business other than a vote on reporting to the Senate any      measures, matters or recommendations or a vote on closing a      meeting or hearing to the public.       (2) Only the chairman, or a Committee member or staff      officer designated by him, may undertake any poll of the      members of the Committee. If any member requests, any matter      to be polled shall be held for meeting rather than being      polled. The chief clerk of the Committee shall keep a record      of polls; if a majority of the members of the Committee      determine that the polled matter is in one of the areas      enumerated in subsection (D) of Rule 1, the record of the      poll shall be confidential. Any Committee member may move at      the Committee meeting following the poll for a vote on the      polled decision, such motion and vote to be subject to the      provisions of subsection (D) of Rule 1, where applicable.             rule 4. chairmanship of meetings and hearings       The chairman shall preside at all Committee meetings and      hearings except that he shall designate a temporary chairman      to act in his place if he is unable to be present at a      scheduled meeting or hearing. If the chairman (or his      designee) is absent 10 minutes after the scheduled time set      for a meeting or hearing, the ranking majority member present      shall preside until the chairman's arrival. If there is no      member of the majority present, the ranking minority member      present, with the prior approval of the chairman, may open      and conduct the meeting or hearing until such time as a      member of the majority arrives.                rule 5. hearings and hearings procedures       A. Announcement of hearings. The Committee, or any      Subcommittee thereof, shall make public announcement of the      date, time, and subject matter of any hearing to be conducted      on any measure or matter at least 1 week in advance of such      hearing, unless the Committee, or Subcommittee, determines      that there is good cause to begin such hearing at an earlier      date. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 4(a), Standing rules of the Senate.)       B. Open hearings. Each hearing conducted by the Committee,      or any Subcommittee thereof, shall be open to the public,      except that a hearing or series of hearings on the same      subject for a period of no more than 14 calendar days may be      closed to the public on a motion made and seconded to go into      closed session to discuss only whether the matters enumerated      in clauses (1) through (6) below would require the hearing to      be closed, followed immediately by a record vote in open      session by a majority of the Committee or Subcommittee      members when it is determined that the matters to be      discussed or the testimony to be taken at such hearing or      hearings--       (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in      the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct      of foreign relations of the United States;       (2) will relate solely to matters of Committee or      Subcommittee staff personnel or internal staff management or      procedure;       (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or      misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing      of an individual, or otherwise expose an individual to public      contempt or obloquy or will represent a clearly unwarranted      invasion of the privacy of an individual;       (4) will disclose the identity of an informer or law      enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating      to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense      that is required to be kept secret in the interests of      effective law enforcement;       (5) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets      of financial or commercial information pertaining      specifically to a given person if--       (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept      confidential by Government officers and employees; or       (B) the information has been obtained by the Government on      a confidential basis, other than through an application by      such person for a specific Government financial or other      benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to      prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such      person; or       (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential      under other provisions of law or Government regulations.      (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever disorder arises      during a Committee or Subcommittee meeting that is open to      the public, or any demonstration of approval or disapproval      is indulged in by any person in attendance at any such      meeting, it shall be the duty of the chairman to enforce      order on his own initiative and without any point of order      being made by a member of the Committee or Subcommittee;      provided, further, that when the chairman finds it necessary      to maintain order, he shall have the power to clear the room,      and the Committee or Subcommittee may act in closed session      for so long as there is doubt of the assurance of order.      (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(d), Standing rules of the Senate.)       C. Full Committee subpoenas. The chairman, with the      approval of the ranking minority member of the Committee, is      authorized to subpoena the attendance of witnesses or the      production of memoranda, documents, records, or any other      materials at a hearing or deposition, provided that the      chairman may subpoena attendance or production without the      approval of the ranking minority member where the chairman or      staff officer designated by him has not received notification      from the ranking minority member or a staff officer      designated by him of disapproval of the subpoena within 72      hours, excluding Saturdays and Sundays, of being notified of      the subpoena. If a subpoena is dis- approved by the ranking      minority member as provided in this subsection, the subpoena      may be authorized by vote of the members of the Committee.      When the Committee or chairman authorizes subpoenas,      subpoenas may be issued upon the signature of the chairman or      any other member of the Committee designated by the chairman.       D. Witness counsel. Counsel retained by any witness and      accompanying such witness shall be permitted to be present      during the testimony of such witness at any public or      executive hearing or deposition to advise such witness      while he or she is testifying, of his or her legal rights,      provided, however, that in the case of any witness who is      an officer or employee of the government, or of a      corporation or association, the Committee chairman may      rule that representation by counsel from the government,      corporation, or association or by counsel representing,      other witnesses, creates a conflict of interest, and that      the witness may only be represented during interrogation      by staff or during testimony before the Committee by      personal counsel not from the government, corporation, or      association or by personal counsel not representing other      witnesses. This subsection shall not be construed to      excuse a witness from testifying in the event his counsel      is ejected for conducting himself in such manner so as to      prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct or interfere with the      orderly administration of the hearings; nor shall this      subsection be construed as authorizing counsel to coach      the witness or answer for the witness. The failure of any      witness to secure counsel shall not excuse such witness      from complying with a subpoena or deposition notice.       E. Witness transcripts. An accurate electronic or      stenographic record shall be kept of the testimony of all      witnesses in executive and public hearings. The record of his      or her testimony whether in public or executive session shall      be made available for inspection by the witness or his or her      counsel under Committee supervision; a copy of any testimony      given in public session or that part of the testimony given      by the witness in executive session and subsequently quoted      or made part of the record in a public session shall be      provided to any witness at his or her expense if he or she so      requests. Upon inspecting his or her transcript, within a      time limit set by the chief clerk of the Committee, a witness      may request changes in the transcript to correct errors of      transcription and grammatical errors; the chairman or a staff      officer designated by him shall rule on such requests.       F. Impugned persons. Any person whose name is mentioned or      is specifically identified, and who believes that evidence      presented, or comment made by a member of the Committee or      staff officer, at a public hearing or at a closed hearing      concerning which there have been public reports, tends to      impugn his or her character or adversely affect his or her      reputation may:       (a) File a sworn statement of facts relevant to the      evidence or comment, which statement shall be considered for      placement in the hearing record by the Committee;       (b) Request the opportunity to appear personally before the      Committee to testify in his or her own behalf, which request      shall be considered by the Committee; and       (c) Submit questions in writing which he or she requests be      used for the cross-examination of other witnesses called by      the Committee, which questions shall be considered for use by      the Committee.       G. Radio, television, and photography. The Committee, or      any Subcommittee thereof, may permit the proceedings of      hearings which are open to the public to be photographed and      broadcast by radio, television or both, subject to such      conditions as the Committee, or Subcommittee, may impose.      (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(c), Standing Rules of the Senate.)       H. Advance statements of witnesses. A witness appearing      before the Committee, or any Subcommittee thereof, shall      provide 100 copies of a written statement and an executive      summary or synopsis of his proposed testimony at least 48      hours prior to his appearance. This requirement may be waived      by the chairman and the ranking minority member following      their determination that there is good cause for failure of      compliance. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 4(b), Standing Rules of the      Senate.)       I. Minority witnesses. In any hearings conducted by the      Committee, or any Subcommittee thereof, the minority members      of the Committee or Subcommittee shall be entitled, upon      request to the chairman by a majority of the minority      members, to call witnesses of their selection during at least      1 day of such hearings. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 4(d), Standing Rules      of the Senate.)       J. Full Committee depositions. Depositions may be taken      prior to or after a hearing as provided in this subsection.       (1) Notices for the taking of depositions shall be      authorized and issued by the chairman, with the approval of      the ranking minority member of the Committee, provided that      the chairman may initiate depositions without the approval of      the ranking minority member where the chairman or a staff      officer designated by him has not received notification from      the ranking minority member or a staff officer designated by      him of disapproval of the deposition within 72 hours,      excluding Saturdays and Sundays, of being notified of the      deposition notice. If a deposition notice is disapproved by      the ranking minority members as provided in this subsection,      the deposition notice may be authorized by a vote of the      members of the Committee. Committee deposition notices shall      specify a time and place for examination, and the name of the      Committee member or members or staff officer or officers who      will take the deposition. Unless otherwise--specified, the      deposition shall be in private. The Committee shall not      initiate procedures leading to criminal or civil enforcement      proceedings for a witness' failure to appear or produce      unless the deposition notice was accompanied by a Committee      subpoena.       (2) Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition by counsel      to advise them of their legal rights, subject to the      provisions of Rule 5D.       (3) Oaths at depositions may be administered by an      individual authorized by local law to administer oaths.      Questions shall be propounded orally by Committee member or      members or staff. If a witness objects to a question and      refuses to testify, the objection shall be noted for the      record and the Committee member or members or staff may      proceed with the remainder of the deposition.       (4) The Committee shall see that the testimony is      transcribed or electronically recorded (which may include      audio or audio/video recordings). If it is transcribed,      the transcript shall be made available for inspection by      the witness or his or her counsel under Committee      supervision. The witness shall sign a copy of the      transcript and may request changes to it, which shall be      handled in accordance with the procedure set forth in      subsection (E). If the witness fails to sign a copy, the      staff shall note that fact on the transcript. The      individual administering the oath shall certify on the      transcript that the witness was duly sworn in his      presence, the transcriber shall certify that the      transcript is a true record of the testimony, and the      transcript shall then be filed with the chief clerk of the      Committee. The chairman or a staff officer designated by      him may stipulate with the witness to changes in the      procedure, deviations from this procedure which do not      substantially impair the reliability of the record shall      not relieve the witness from his or her obligation to      testify truthfully.                 rule 6. committee reporting procedures       A. Timely filing. When the Committee has ordered a measure      or matter reported following final action the report thereon      shall be filed in the Senate at the earliest practicable      time. (Rule XXVI Sec. 20(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)       B. Supplemental, minority, and additional views. A member      of the Committee who gives notice of his intention to file      supplemental minority or additional views at the time of      final Committee approval of a measure or matter, shall be      entitled to not less     than 3 calendar days in which to file such views, in writing,      with the chief clerk of the Committee. Such views shall then      be included in the Committee report and printed in the same      volume, as a part thereof, and their inclusion shall be noted      on the cover of the report. In the absence of timely notice,      the Committee report may be filed and printed immediately      without such views, (Rule XXVI, Sec. 10(c), Standing Rules of      the Senate.)       C. Notice by Subcommittee chairmen. The chairman of each      Subcommittee shall notify the chairman in writing whenever      any measure has been ordered reported by such Subcommittee      and is ready for consideration by the full Committee.       D. Draft reports of Subcommittees. All draft reports      prepared by Subcommittees of this Committee on any measure or      matter referred to it by the chairman, shall be in the form,      style, and arrangement required to conform to the applicable      provisions of the Standing Rules of the Senate, and shall be      in accordance with the established practices followed by the      Committee. Upon completion of such draft reports, copies      thereof shall be filed with the chief clerk of the Committee      at the earliest practicable time.       E. Impact statements in reports. All Committee reports,      accompanying a bill or joint resolution of a public character      reported by the Committee, shall contain (1) an estimate,      made by the Committee, of the costs which would be incurred      in carrying out the legislation for the then current fiscal      year and for each of the next 5 years thereafter (or for the      authorized duration of the proposed legislation, if less than      5 years); and (2) a comparison of such cost estimates with      any made by a Federal agency; or (3) in lieu of such estimate      or comparison, or both, a statement of the reasons for      failure by the Committee to comply with these requirements as      impracticable, in the event of inability to comply therewith.
