GRAMS. I am not sure, but when you look at couples across the country who are unfairly paying $29 billion or 21 million couples across the country who are unfairly paying about $29 billion a year in taxes--if there are some discrepancies, we should look at all of it. But what we should not do is penalize those families who are paying an average of $1,400 a year more, just because of the way the codes are set up.
