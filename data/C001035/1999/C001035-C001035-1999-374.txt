It is intended to help us shift the paradigm in this country of how we view serious illness. Medicare currently defines terminally ill people as those having no more than 6 months to live. It is often very difficult to predict with any certainty how long exactly a seriously ill person is likely to live. This study will help us to provide better care for that broader category of patients who are terminally ill and have the need for more coordinated care but who may well live longer than a 6-month period.  I thank Senator Enzi and Senator Grassley for their work and joining with me in improving the continuity of care provisions of the bill.  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.
