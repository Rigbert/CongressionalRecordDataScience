 Speaker, some of us have recognized for a long time that it was terribly important that Russia become increasingly involved in the crisis in Yugoslavia.  Russia is, I think as everybody knows, Yugoslavia's major ally and major supporter. If Russia could be brought into the process supporting the humanitarian goals of the stopping of ethnic cleansing, it would be a major step forward in solving what is increasingly becoming a very, very horrible situation in the Balkans.  Within that light, I was very delighted to learn about a trip to Vienna, Austria, that was being organized by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Curt Weldon), who has done an excellent job in trying to improve relations between the United States Congress and the Russian Duma. He was organizing a trip which would involve 11 Members of the United States Congress to meet with the leaders of the Russian Duma.  On that trip, in addition to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon), were the gentleman from New York (Mr. Maurice Hinchey), the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Neil Abercrombie), the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Dennis Kucinich), the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Corinne Brown), the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Don Sherwood), the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Roscoe Bartlett), the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Saxton), the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Jim Gibbons), and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joseph Pitts). There were six Republicans, four Democrats, and myself, who is an Independent.  Mr. Speaker, in arriving in Vienna and meeting with the Russians, I think we were all delighted that the Russians shared our strong concerns about bringing peace to Yugoslavia. We were able, after a lot of discussion, to come up with an agreement.  As others have said, we were not there to negotiate the fine points of a treaty. That was not our job. But we were there to see if we could come together on the broad outlines of what a peace process would mean for the Balkan area, and I think we did that.  Mr. Speaker, let me just touch on some of the important points that the Russians and our delegation agreed upon.  ``We call on all of the interested parties to find practical measures for a parallel solution to three tasks, without regard to sequence;'' in other words, to do it in a simultaneous manner. That is, ``the stopping of the NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia; the withdrawal of Serbian Armed Forces from Kosovo, and the cessation of the military activities of the KLA.''  What we have said is that these steps should be accomplished through a series of confidence-building measures, which include but should not be limited to the following:  A, the release of all prisoners of war. When we stated that, our three POWs were, of course, still being held by Yugoslavia, and a few hours after this agreement was reached Milosevic, as it turns out, released our three POWs.  My own view is that, consistent with this agreement, in an act of good faith on our part, we should release the two Serbian POWs that we are holding. But our agreement called for the release of all prisoners of war.  Second of all, what we said is the voluntary repatriation of all refugees in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and unhindered access to them by humanitarian aid organizations. In other words, what we were agreeing to is that the people who have been driven out of their homes whose villages were burned by Yugoslavia should be allowed to return to their homes and be allowed all of the humanitarian help they can receive.  Thirdly, and on a very important point, there was agreement on the composition of the armed international forces which would administer Kosovo after the Serbian withdrawal.  The composition of the group should be decided by a consensus agreement of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, in consultation with Macedonia, Albania, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and the recognized leadership of Kosovo.  This is a very important step forward, because what this means is the Russians are saying very clearly that there should be armed international forces, something that many of us understand is absolutely necessary if the people of Kosovo are to return safely and with protection to their homes.  I think increasingly, within our own administration and all over the world, there is an understanding that that armed international force need not strictly be NATO. That is what we are saying here, and that is what the Russians have agreed to.  Then we said that the above group would be supplemented by the monetary activities of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.  In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I think that this trip was a significant step forward in bringing the Russians into the peace process. I was very proud and delighted to be there with my fellow representatives from the United States Congress.                          ____________________
