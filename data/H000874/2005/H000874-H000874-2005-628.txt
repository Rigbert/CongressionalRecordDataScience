Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information. If I could raise one additional issue, it is my understanding that one of the reasons we have not appointed conferees and we have not gone to conference is the issue of the Medicaid cuts.  I understand a substantial number of Members on your side have suggested that those cuts are not advisable. Obviously, the Senate did not include those cuts. Can the majority leader tell me at this point in time if there has been any resolution of this issue, as to where we might stand on those Medicaid cuts.  I yield to my friend.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. All I can tell the gentleman is, I know there is a lot of discussion about that over in the Senate. I do not know what their resolution is, even if there is a resolution on the Senate side.  The House, as the gentleman knows, passed the budget that has substantial mandatory savings in it. The House is very interested in holding the line on their mandatory savings, and the Senate is trying to work through this process.  So it is really up to the Senate as to what they are going to bring to the conference.
