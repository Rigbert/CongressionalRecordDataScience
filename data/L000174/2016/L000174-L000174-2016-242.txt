President, for years, I have consistently opposed efforts by Congress to restrict the Obama administration's ability to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. The indefinite detention without trial of detainees at Guantanamo contradicts our most basic principles of justice, degrades our international standing, and harms our national security. The mere existence of this facility serves as a recruitment tool for terrorists, and the facility costs American taxpayers more than $4 million per detainee each year--an astonishing amount of money that could be repurposed to keep our men and women in uniform safe.  I recently received a letter from former Marine Corps Commandant Charles Krulak, co-signed by an additional 60 retired generals and admirals that noted ``closing Guantanamo is not just a national security imperative, it is about reestablishing the core values of who we are as a nation.'' I could not agree more. I ask unanimous consent that General Krulak's letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  Last May, I wrote a letter to President Obama urging him to expedite the transfer of cleared detainees to foreign countries and accelerate the periodic review board process to determine if additional detainees could be transferred. Since that time, the President has made progress toward closing the Guantanamo detention facility. To date, only 91 detainees remain, and top national security officials have already cleared 35 of those detainees for transfer to foreign countries. I am encouraged that the plan unveiled by the administration yesterday morning calls for accelerating the review process to determine if additional detainees can be transferred, as I urged, and for completing that process by the fall.  Now that President Obama has delivered a plan, Congress must do its part and lift the unnecessary and counterproductive restrictions on transferring detainees to the United States, so that we can finally shutter Guantanamo once and for all. We should all want to see additional detainees finally brought to justice in our Federal court system, which has a long and proven track record in terrorism prosecutions--unlike the military commission system that has been bogged down in legal challenges and procedural hurdles.  The detention facility at Guantanamo Bay has been a stain on our national reputation for more than 14 years. Closing Guantanamo is the morally and fiscally responsible thing to do, and it is long past time to stop the fear-mongering so we can work together to close it down.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                February 23, 2016.       Dear Senator Leahy: I represent a coalition of more than 60      retired generals and admirals of the United States Armed      Forces who have for years advocated the responsible closure      of the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. I write to urge      you to give serious consideration to the recently submitted      Department of Defense plan to close the detention facility at      Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Closing Guantanamo is in our national      security interest, and with the submission of the DOD plan,      there is a unique opportunity for Congress to lift the      remaining restrictions on transferring detainees so that      Guantanamo can be closed.       Guantanamo continues to impose significant costs to our      national security. As an offshore detention facility that--     rightly or wrongly--represents to the world an image of      detainee abuse and violations of the rule of law, Guantanamo      undermines counterterrorism cooperation with allies and      unnecessarily bolsters the propaganda and recruiting      narratives that terrorists seek to advance. It is a travesty      that the trial of the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks      remains bogged down at Guantanamo nearly 15 years after 9/11.       The issue of what to do with Guantanamo is not a political      issue. There is near unanimous agreement from our nation's      top military, intelligence, and law enforcement leaders that      Guantanamo should be closed. Even President George W. Bush,      who opened Guantanamo after the 9/11 attacks, tried to close      it, noting that ``the detention facility had become a      propaganda tool for our enemies and a distraction for our      allies.''       We understand that some fear bringing even a small number      of detainees to the United States as part of the plan to      close Guantanamo. However, we are confident that those      detainees can be held safely and securely stateside. Hundreds      of terrorists are already being held in U.S. prisons--     including one former Guantanamo detainee who is serving a      life sentence. Rather than trying to invoke fear, we should      applaud these communities that have successfully and safely      detained society's worst without incident. In any event, the      risks of keeping Guantanamo open far outweigh any risks      associated with closing it.       In the coming days and weeks, we plan on more closely      studying the Department of Defense's plan to close      Guantanamo, and we hope you will do the same. Closing      Guantanamo is not just a national security imperative, it is      about reestablishing the core values of who we are as a      nation, and we believe strongly that there must be a bi-     partisan approach to achieving that objective.           Semper Fidelis,                                                Charles C. Krulak,                                General, U.S. Marine Corps (Ret.).  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to be printed in the Record.)                            vote explanation Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for today's vote on S. Res. 374, a resolution relating to the death of Antonin Scalia, Associate Judge of the Supreme Court of the United States. I would have voted yea.                          ____________________
