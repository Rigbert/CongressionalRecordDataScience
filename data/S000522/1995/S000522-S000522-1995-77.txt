Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, which I chair, finally got the opportunity to hear the real-life stories in open hearing from some of the Chinese women who have had their baby killed by forced abortion in the People's Republic of China.  After having had to take the extraordinary step of issuing subpoenas to bring these women out of U.S. prisons where they have been held for 2 years by the Clinton administration, which is trying to deport these women back to their tormentors, yesterday we heard these women describe the horror, the humiliation, the suffering, the pain and the loss of being subjected to both forced abortion and forced sterilization.  Even though these and many other women like them have been found to be completely credible by the INS, these victims are poised to be forced back to their oppressors in China because the Clinton administration reversed a very human policy of the Bush administration, by providing asylum to women who have had a forced abortion or have a well-founded fear of force abortion or forced sterilization.  Bill Clinton, Mr. Speaker, has turned his back on these victims, and he is trying to force them back. Hu Shu Ye broke down in tears yesterday as she described the pain and suffering of being dragged by the family planning cadres in China to the abortion mill to have her six-month-old unborn child destroyed. When she was able to regain her composure during the hearing, later in the hearing, she told us that she as bleeding so profusely that the Chinese officials were unable to involuntarily sterilize her. But 5 months later they were back at her door physically dragging her to be forcibly sterilized.  These women, their tears that they shed yesterday at the hearing and their profound suffering is the reality of tens of millions of women in the People's Republic of China, in that terrible dictatorship.  I have led two human rights missions to China, Mr. Speaker. Religious repression has intensified since the Clinton administration delinked MFN from human rights. Oppression of political dissidents has gotten worse. For every prominent dissident they have released, usually on the eve of some important decision in the United States, they have taken many, many others and many of those that we do not know about. And now they have taken a U.S. citizen, Harry Wu.  Not only do these human rights problems get worse every single month that we continue to truckle to China, but they keep discovering new horrors. The PRC dictatorship times the executions, for example, of prisoners for the convenience of rich foreigners who pay for the harvest of the prisoners' organs. Now we learn that states who supported abortion clinics sell human embryos, and there are even some credible reports that late-term unborn children are actually being consumed as a new health food. Mr. Speaker, ideas have consequences, and the central organizing idea behind the PRC dictatorship is the utter devaluation of the individual human being. They have consequences.  Mr. Speaker, let me conclude. There is no moral or practical difference between trading with the PRC dictatorship and trading with the Nazis.  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record the following information:                                                    July 18, 1995.
