I am going to be very brief in wrapping this up. I think our colleagues know that I am not one who goes looking for frivolous litigation. The chairman of the committee and all our colleagues on the Commerce Committee know that I spent a lot of time on the Y2K liability legislation this year so we could resolve these problems without a whole spree of frivolous litigation.  But we do know that there are areas, particularly ones where injured consumers in international waters have no remedy at all, when they are subject to some of the most grizzly and unfortunate accidents, where there is a role for legislation and a need for a remedy.  I am very appreciative that the chairman has indicated he thinks it is appropriate that we devise a remedy. I intend to work very closely with our colleagues on the Commerce Committee. I know the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Gorton, has strong views on this. I am willing to look anew with respect to what that remedy ought to be so we can pass a bipartisan bill. But I do think we have to devise a remedy because to have innocent Americans run down in international waters without any remedy can't be acceptable to the American people.  With that, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw all four of the amendments I have had filed on this bill with respect to the Death on the High Seas Act.
