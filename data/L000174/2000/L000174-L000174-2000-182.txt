President, today Senator Hatch and I are introducing the Federal Judgeship Act of 2000. I am pleased that Senators Feinstein, Schumer, Boxer, Graham, Reid, Robb, Inouye, Edwards, Murray, Bingaman, Bayh, Kerrey, and Domenici are joining us as original cosponsors of this measure.  Our bill creates 70 judgeships across the country to address the workload needs of the federal judiciary. This bill incorporates the recommendations for additional judgeships most recently forwarded to us by the Judiciary Conference of the United States. Specifically, our legislation would create 6 additional permanent judgeships and 4 temporary judgeships for the U.S. Courts of Appeal; 30 additional permanent judgeships and 23 temporary judgeships for the U.S. District Courts; and convert 7 existing temporary district judgeships into permanent positions.  The Judicial Conference of the United States is the nonpartisan policy-making arm of the judicial branch. Federal judges across the nation believe that the increasingly heavy caseloads of our courts necessitate these additional judges. The Chief Justice of the United States in his annual year-end reports over the last several years has commented on the serious problems facing our federal courts having too much work and too few judges and other resources.  The Judicial Conference and Chief Justice Rehnquist are right. According to his 1999 year-end report, the filings in our federal courts have reached record heights. In fact, the numbers of criminal cases and defendants have reached their highest levels since the Prohibition Amendment was repealed in 1933. In 1999, overall growth in appellate court caseload included a 349 percent upsurge in original proceedings. This sudden expansion resulted from newly implemented reporting procedures, which more accurately measure the increased judicial workload generated by the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act and the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, both passed in 1996.  District court activity was characterized by an increase in criminal filings and a smaller increase in civil filings. Criminal case filings rose 4 percent from 57,691 in 1998 to 59,923 in 1999, and the number of defendants grew 2 percent from 79,008 to 80,822. Criminal case filings per authorized judgeship went up almost 5 percent. Since the last significant expansion of the federal judiciary in 1990, felony criminal case filings have increased almost 50 percent, from 31,727 in 1990 to 46,789 in 1999.  Despite these dramatic increases in case filings, Congress has failed to authorize new judgeships since 1990, thus endangering the administration of justice in our nation's federal courts. Without the extraordinary contributes of our senior judges, the administration of justice could well have broken down entirely.  Over the last several decades, a 6-year cycle for reviewing the needs of the judiciary and authorizing additional judgeships had been followed by Democrats and Republicans alike. For example, in 1978, Congress passed legislation to address the need for additional judgeships. Six years later, in 1984, Congress passed legislation creating additional judgeships. Then, again six years later, in 1990, Democratic majorities in both Houses of Congress fulfilled their constitutional responsibilities and enacted the Federal Judgeship Act of 1990 because of a sharply increasing caseload, particularly for drug-related crimes. At that time President Bush was in the middle of his first term in office.  That type of bipartisan effort broke down in 1996. It has now been 10 years since Congress made a systematic evaluation of the needs of the federal judiciary and acted to meet those needs. For each of the last two Congresses, the Republican majority has resisted any such action. Three years ago, the Judicial Conference requested an additional 55 judgeships to address the growing backlog. I introduced the Federal Judgeship Act of 1997, S. 678, legislation based on the Judicial Conference's 1997 recommendations. That legislation languished in the Judicial Committee without action during both sessions of the last Congress. Again last year, the Judicial Conference updated its request and recommended an additional 72 judgeships. I, again, introduced those recommendations in the Federal Judgeship Act of 1999, S. 1145. There was no action on it by the Judiciary Committee.  This year, the Judiciary Conference took the unusual step of updating last year's recommendations yet again. Those updated recommendations affect 70 judgeships. Today may signal a turning point in our efforts. Today Republicans are joining with us. I welcome them to this effort and look forward to working with them to pass the Federal Judgeship Act of 2000.  Included within our bill are the additional judgeships that would be authorized by S. 2730, the Southwest Border Judgeship Act of 2000. Senator Feinstein has been tenacious in seeking the resources needed the federal courts of our southwest border States, including southern California. She is right. Those 13 judgeships for California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas are included in our bill.  Implicit in our legislation is acknowledgment that the federal judiciary does not just have 64 current vacancies with 9 of the horizon, but that even if all those vacancies were filled, the federal judiciary would remain 70 judges short of those it needed to manage its workload, try the cases and provide the individual attention to matters that have set a high standard for the administration of justice in our federal system. In other words, considering vacancies and taking into account the judgeships authorized by our bill, the federal judiciary is today in need of more than 130 more judges.  We have the greatest judicial system in the world, the envy of people around the globe who are struggling for freedom. It is the independence of our third, co-equal branch of government that gives it the ability to act fairly and impartially. It is our judiciary that has for so long protected our fundamental rights and freedoms and served as a necessary check on overreaching by the other two branches, those more susceptible to the gusts of the political winds.  Let us act to ensure that justice in our federal courts is not delayed or denied for anyone. I urge the Senate to do in this last month of this Congress what the Republican majority has so strenuously resisted for the last four years: Enact the Federal Judgeship Act without further delay.                                 ______
