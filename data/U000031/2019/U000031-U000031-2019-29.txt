 This is from Mike Ford. Of course, his father was Gerry Ford, a great man, President, Michigander. And he wrote this, it is very brief:       Debbie,       Since learning of John's recent passing, my thoughts and      prayers have been constant with you and your extended family.       Through my reading of the many wonderful remembrances of      and tributes to John, I have been deeply moved and blessed to      revisit his remarkable legacy of leadership and service to      the people of Michigan and to all of our Nation.       John and my father, though identified from competing      political parties, held so much in common as men of wisdom,      integrity, compassion, and selfless service for all of      humanity, and their friendship was true and enduring through      a shared lifetime calling of public service. John Dingell and      Gerry Ford represent what is good, honorable, and decent in      our country.       Please know of our Ford family's grace giving wishes and      prayers for you and all the Dingell family at this time of      loss and grief.       May you know of God's abiding comfort, love, and hope this      day and always.       Mike Ford.  Good guy that, again, some of us know, particularly those of us on the west side of our State. You know, he was our dean. And when I became the dean of the Michigan Republican delegation--that was in the early nineties. I have got to say--I was just adding it up here sitting with Tim--I was probably in thousands of meetings with John.                              {time}  1845  Our delegation is close. We stand together on a host of issues, from the Great Lakes to the autos. We often had an agenda we worked together. Our offices were across the hall from each other for a lot of years. Of course, we have known Deborah forever and a day as well.  I had the chance to talk to John Dingell the day before he died, and I talked to him a number of times over the last number of weeks. I read his book, which I would recommend to folks. Might put the R rating next to it, in terms of his language. You can hear him speak, and he had a genuine sense of humor. He had so many stories.  I was asked a little bit earlier today: What about his tweeting?  He tweeted until, literally, the last day or two. For those of you watching tonight, get on Google. Google MLive. That is sort of the Michigan news network. Google: MLive Dingell tweet. This weekend, they ran the top 20 tweets that he did, and they will make you laugh. They really will, especially the one with the bulldog. All of the animal lovers out there, make sure you find this one. He had a sense of humor.  People say: How could a 92-year-old do all this?  Well, let me tell you how. It is because of our committee. The committee has so much jurisdiction, part of which is telecommunications. We were the first ones. We forced the broadcasters. It was actually the Tauzin-Dingell bill, I want to say a lot of years ago, and I had an amendment that was critical there. We passed the Tauzin-Dingell bill. He cared so much about bipartisanship.  We forced the broadcasters to go from analog to digital. That then allowed us all to have devices like this: iPhones and the internet. Instead of using a shoe for your phone, you got something like this that is like the world.  We forced them to go digital, and that allowed this to happen. So guess what? John Dingell, in Congress, we would often sit down. We all meet in Detroit, let's face it. All of us, our delegation, we come from someplace. Mr. Kildee comes from Flint. Tim Walberg is actually lucky and gets on in Detroit. I come from South Bend or Kalamazoo or Grand Rapids. We all come from someplace, but generally, we fly Delta from Detroit back to D.C.  We are all sitting at that A-75 gate. There is John Dingell, a colleague, andhe is on his BlackBerry, zipping away, typing just as fast as you could imagine, communicating with people around the world. It is because of the work he did in our committee. That made our lives what they are today.  Whether it is that or the environment or healthcare or pipeline safety, you name the issue--we are sorry Mr. Kildee went to the Ways and Means Committee. Deborah chose right; she went to the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. Kildee went to the dark side. Our committee has jurisdiction over so much.  John Dingell was such a leader. He didn't care about who got the credit. He just wanted to get the job done. He sat right over here. When you would come over and ask his advice, you would make sure that you were on his good ear, and he would talk, and he would remember things.  I can remember taking the Congressional Record from some big debates, the Voting Rights Act and others, and I would sit with him here, and we would go through the names, particularly the Michigan delegation, and why they voted this way or that way. He would tell the history. He was here for our lifetime.  He was a gentleman to the very end. He knew the rules. He had respect from both sides of the aisle. He was a guy who we will never see replaced here in this House.  In closing, let me say, even at the end, he was wondering: Did I make a difference?  Of course he did. But here was a guy who made such a difference and a guy who really never thought he would be in this institution. When his dad died, a week before his dad died, he didn't think he was going to run for that seat. It was the people at home who encouraged him to run. When he chose to retire, he didn't push Deborah, nudge Deborah, to run for that seat.  It is hard to imagine, 86 years of a Dingell representing southeast Michigan. What a tribute to a family that has made such a difference in this body, folks who love not only our State, but certainly their constituents.  Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Kildee for doing this Special Order.
