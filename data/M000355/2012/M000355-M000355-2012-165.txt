 Yet our friends in the majority want to get us to pass a bill that everybody from the ACLU to the NRA is opposed to, a bill designed to give the government the information to intimidate people who have the courage to stand up to the government and argue against what it is doing.  Not only should we not be doing this in good times but to waste the Senate's time on a proposal totally without merit at a time when our economy is in the tank is the ultimate waste of the Senate's time. I strongly urge a ``no'' vote.  I yield back the remaining time.
