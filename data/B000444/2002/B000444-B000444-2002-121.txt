 President, late last year, I offered a tribute to the legendary University of Delaware football coach, Harold ``Tubby'' Raymond, on the occasion of his 300th career victory. A few short months later, after 36 years as head football coach and a total of 48 years at Delaware, Coach Raymond decided to retire. And now, with a vote by the Board of Trustees this Tuesday, May 21st, the University has decided to designate the football field as ``Tubby Raymond Field.''  Like many Delawareans, present and relocated, I welcomed the University's decision with enthusiasm. I am a graduate of the University of Delaware. For a while, Tubby was my backfield coach, and I am one of many great fans and proud friends of Tubby Raymond. He deserves this honor; as his successor K.C. Keeler, who also played for Tubby--played more and played better, I might add--said, while looking over the Delaware football field, ``the man built this place.''  I will resist the temptation to recount again the remarkable success of University of Delaware football teams under Tubby Raymond, who ended his head coaching career with a record of 300-119-3, a winning percentage of .714.  But I would like to share a comment Tubby made, in response to a question he has been asked countless times in the course of his storied career. He was asked if he regretted not moving to coach on Sunday or at a bigger school, a I-A program, like his alma mater, the University of Michigan. Tubby said that he always had everything he wanted at Delaware, adding, ``I'm just as proud of the players who have gone on to be successful in business and other careers, as I am of those who have gone to the NFL.''  As a coach, Tubby Raymond has been a dedicated and very successful teacher, and the fact that he will be the speaker at this Saturday's commencement ceremony reflects the respect he has earned in the University community, well beyond the Athletic Department.  Tubby hasn't been able to leave the coaching completely behind, however; as he watched them setting up chairs on the football field for graduation, he shook his head with a slight wince, and said, ``They're going to kill some grass.''  The grass will grow back, and Tubby Raymond Field will be in good shape for the opening game on August 29th, when the name will become official. For the first time that many Delawareans can remember, Tubby will not be the coach. He will be the guest of honor, and it is Tubby Raymond who has honored us by his dedication as a coach and a teacher, his loyalty to the University of Delaware, his leadership in our State--and for those of us who are really lucky, the blessing of his friendship.                          ____________________
