 President, I rise to introduce the Identity Theft Penalty Enhancement Act of 2002 along with my colleagues Senators Kyl, Sessions, and Grassley.  This bill is the culmination of efforts by the Department of Justice to craft legislation that will crack down on the most serious identity thefts in the Nation, and I am pleased to be working with the Justice Department on this legislation. In fact, Attorney General Ashcroft and I announced this bill together earlier this month.  This legislation will make it easier for prosecutors to target those identity thieves who, as is so often the case, steal an identity for the purpose of committing one or more other crimes.  Many serious crimes, even including terrorism, are aided by stolen identifies.  For instance, According to a January article in the Baltimore Sun, ``six of the 19 hijackers from September 11 were using Social Security numbers illegally. Another man linked to al-Qaida, Lofti Raissi, a 27-year old Algerian pilot from London who is believed to have trained four of the suicide hijackers, was identified in British court papers as having used the Social Security number of Dorothy Hansen, a retired factory worker from Jersey City, NJ, who died in 1991.''  Attorney General Ashcroft last week cited the example of an Algerian national now facing charges of identity theft who allegedly stole the identifies of 21 members of a health club in Cambridge, MA. The Algerian national then transferred those stolen identities to one of the individuals convicted in the failed plot to bomb Los Angeles International Airport in 1999.  In another case, Michelle Brown of Los Angeles had her Social Security number stolen in 1999, and it was used to charge $50,000 in her name, including a $32,000 truck, a $5,000 liposuction operation and a year-long residential lease. Even worse, while assuming Michelle's name, the perpetrator also became the object of an arrest warrant for drug smuggling in Texas.  In another case recently announced by the Justice Department, Joseph Kalady of Chicago was charged just last week with trying to fake his own death using the identity of another. Kalady, who was awaiting trial on charges of counterfeiting birth certificates, Social Security cards and driver's licenses last December, allegedly suffocated a homeless man and sought to have him cremated under Mr. Kalady's identity in order to fake his own death and avoid prosecution.  The stories go on and on, and it is those stories that make the legislation we introduce today so vital.  Let me just outline what this bill would do.  First, the bill would create a separate crime of ``aggravated identity theft'' for any person who uses the identity of another person to commit certain serious, federal crimes.  Specifically, the legislation would provide for an additional two-year penalty for any individual convicted of committing one of the following serious Federal crimes while using the identity of another person: stealing another's identity in order to illegally obtain citizenship in the United States; stealing another's identity to obtain a passport or visa; using another's identity to remain in the United States illegally after a visa has expired or an individual has been ordered to depart this country; stealing an individual's identity to commit bank, wire or mail fraud, or to steal from employee pension funds; and other serious federal crimes, all of them felonies.  Furthermore, the legislation would provide for an additional five year penalty for any individual that uses the stolen identity of another person to commit any one of the enumerated Federal terrorism crimes found in 18 U.S.C. 2332b(g)(5)(B). These crime include: the destruction of aircraft; the assassination or kidnapping of high level Federal officials; bombings; hostage taking; providing material support to terrorism organizations; and other terrorist crimes.  Aggravated Identity Theft is a separate crime, not just a sentencing enhancement. And the two-year and five-year penalties for aggravated identity theft must be served consecutively to the sentence for the underlying crime.  This bill also strengthens the ability of law enforcement to go after identity thieves and to provide their case.  First, the bill adds the word ``possesses'' to current law, in order to allow law enforcement to target individuals who possess the identity documents of another person with the intent to commit a crime. Current Federal law prohibits the transfer or use of false identity documents, but does not specifically ban the possession of hose documents with the intent to commit a crime. So if law enforcement discovers a stash of identity documents with the clear intent to use those documents to commit other crimes, the person who possesses those documents will now be subject to prosecution.  Second, the legislation amends current law to make it clear that if a person uses a false identity ``in connection with'' another Federal crime, and the intent of the underlying Federal crime is proven, then the intent to use the false identity to commitment that crime need not be separately proved. This simply makes the job of the prosecutor easier when an individual is convicted of a Federal crime and use a false identity in collection with that Crime.  This legislation also increases the maximum penalty for identity theft under current law from three years to five years.  And finally, the legislation we introduce today will clarify that the current 25-year maximum sentence for identity theft in facilitation of international terrorism also applies to identity theft in facilitation of domestic terrorism as well.  Identity theft is a crime on the rise in America, and it is a crime with severe consequences not only for the individual victims of the identity theft, but for every consumer and every financial institution as well.  Fraud losses at financial institutions are running well over one billion dollars annually. VISA alone reported identity theft related fraud losses of more than $114 million in 2000, a 43 percent increase in just four years.  And for victims, the losses can be staggering. The average loss from one identity theft now ranges about $18,000. Just imagine, somebody takes a credit card receipt out of a trash-can, makes a few calls, and before you know it you've lost $18,000.  And even though an individual victim may not be forced to pay in the end, the credit card companies, financial institutions and other businesses absorb the loss and pass it on to all consumers, the time and effort required to regain your identity can be quite debilitating. In fact, on average it takes a full year and a half to regain one's identity once stolen. In many instances, it can take many more years than that.  Additionally, some victims are even subject to criminal investigation or even arrest because a criminal has taken their identity and used it to commit a crime. In fact, the FTC tells us that they have received 1,300 complaints from victims alleging that they have been subject to investigation, arrest or even conviction as a result of their identity being stolen.  Identity theft comes in many forms and can be perpetrated in many ways, and that is why I have worked for many years now with Senator Kyl and others to put some safeguards into the law that might better prevent the fraud from occurring in the first place, and to crack down on identity thieves.  And other legislation I have introduced would put into place certain procedural safeguards to protect credit card numbers, personal information, and other key data from potential identity thieves.  The legislation we introduce today is meant to beef up the law in terms of what happens after an identity theft takes place. In seriously enhancing the penalties for identity thieves who commit other Federal crimes, we mean to send a strong signal to all those who would commit this increasingly popular crime that the relatively free ride they have experienced in recent years is over. No longer will prosecutors decline to take identity theft seriously. No longer will identity thieves get off with just a slap on the wrist, if they are prosecuted at all. Under this legislation, penalties will be severe, prosecution will be more likely, and cases against identity thieves will be easier to prove.  Every day in this country serious criminals and criminal organizations are stealing and falsifying identities with the purpose of doing serious harm to common citizens, government officials, or even our Nation itself. It is time we did something about it, and this bill is an important step in that process.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2541       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
