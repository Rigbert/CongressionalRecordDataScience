 President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.  I am delighted we are here today to talk about one of the most important things this Congress has done for our children, and that is the Head Start Program.  I thank the Senators from Massachusetts and Wyoming for shepherding this important bill to the floor today, where it is in its last final step before it reaches the President for his signature.  For over 40 years now, Head Start has helped children from low-income families build the confidence and skills they have to have to succeed in school. As the Senator from Massachusetts said, I am a former preschool teacher, parent, school board member, and U.S. Senator. I can tell you, I have seen from every aspect how this important program benefits our children.  Today, I am very excited we are taking a vote to renew this important program.
