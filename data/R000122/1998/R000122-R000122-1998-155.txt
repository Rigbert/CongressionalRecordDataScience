President, March 3rd was the eighth annual celebration of National Sportsmanship Day in over 10,000 schools in all fifty states and more than 100 countries throughout the world.  Recognized by the President's Council on Physical Fitness, National Sportsmanship Day was conceived by the Institute for International Sport, located in my home state of Rhode Island. As the President's Council Co-Chairs Tom McMillen and Florence Griffith Joyner have stated, ``this event will serve as a highly visible, one-day effort to stress the importance of ethics and sportsmanship, not just on the athletic field but in all aspects of life. . . having a powerful and positive effect on the youth of the United States and the world.''  Heeding President Clinton's challenge to begin a serious dialogue on race relations in the United States, the centerpiece of this year's National Sportsmanship Day was a seminar and town meeting at the University of Rhode Island discussing race issues in sport. This day long event included panels composed of athletes, coaches, and journalists who discussed the many different aspects of these issues.  In addition, the Institute has enlisted the help of several Sports Ethics Fellows, including Mills Lane, a Reno, Nevada district judge and internationally known professional boxing referee, Billy Packer, CBS sports commentator, and Ken Dryden, the president and general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs. These men and women are wonderful role models who can be admired for more than just their athletic prowess. They have consistently demonstrated an interest in furthering the principles of honesty and integrity in sport and society.  These Sports Ethics Fellows are helping to teach the important lessons ofNational Sportsmanship Day by developing programs for National Sportsmanship Day. Through competition, young athletes can learn that while winning is a worthy goal, honor, discipline, and hard work are more important. Indeed, these values will guide them in all aspects of everyday life.  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports and the Rhode Island Congressional delegation in recognizing this day and the principles it embodies.                          ____________________
