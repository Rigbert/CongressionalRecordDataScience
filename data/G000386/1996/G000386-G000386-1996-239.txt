 President, many men and women of our Nation have been called to service during times of crises. Iowans, too, have boldly answered the call of duty. Today, as I continue my remarks about Iowa's spirit, I want to focus on one of our country's most bloody episodes--the Civil War--and, specifically, remember one university that almost was not.  From 1861 through 1864, Iowans eagerly responded to the need for soldiers to serve in the infantry, cavalry, and artillery. It has been recorded in the ``Roster of Iowa Soldiers'' that approximately 73,000 Iowans enrolled with the Union Army. Among these soldiers, over 2,000 were killed in action, almost 9,000 were wounded in action, and over 10,000 died of their wounds or disease. These numbers are quite significant since Iowa, in proportion to its population, outfitted more troops than any other State in the Union. In fact, Perry Township, located in Jackson County, gave the largest per capita troop enrollment during the Civil War.  Iowa women also played a vital role during the Civil War. Soldier's relief societies were formed to support the troops. These women sewed uniforms, provided bedding, and collected necessary funds to help purchase military supplies. One woman in particular,Annie Wittenmyer, played an instrumental role in organizing these societies throughout Iowa. Because soldiers were dying more from diseases than from their wounds, she created diet kitchens in hospitals to help rebuild their strength and aid in their recovery. Furthermore, Annie Witten- myer campaigned to provide relief for mothers, wives, and children adversely affected by the war because their sons, husbands, and fathers were killed or disabled during their service. Not only did she campaign for financial assistance for these women and children, but her efforts also helped build orphans' homes.  Unfortunately, as with every hard-fought battle, there comes a price. A battle-scarred Civil War flag, on display at Upper Iowa University in Fayette, is a poignant reminder of this sacrifice.  Upper Iowa was founded in 1857 by pioneer families living in the wooded hills surrounding the tiny village of Fayette. The nearest college, Cornell in Mount Vernon, was a long dangerous trip away by stagecoach over rough dirt roads and through territory roamed by native tribes. Colonel Robert Alexander, a veteran of the Black Hawk War, donated $10,000 in gold pieces toward the funding of a college, and a hall was constructed of native white limestone. The university doors opened on January 7, 1857.  Three short years after Upper Iowa's founding, though, the Civil War broke out, and the university's young men, many of them on the verge of graduating, enlisted in a body, along with many of their professors. Company C of the 3rd Iowa Volunteer Infantry went on to participate in 17 major battles, including the bloody fields of Vicksburg and Shiloh. For many young Upper Iowans, a battlefield grave ended their dreams for a future. In a quirk of fate, Upper Iowa's mathematics professor, Nathan Cornell, now a colonel in the Confederate Army, was captured by Colonel E.C. Byam of the Union Army--Upper Iowa's business manager.  With so much of the student body gone, the university was on the verge of closing, but the women students and the female professors were determined to carry on. Dean of Students Elizabeth Sorin, although born in the South, wholeheartedly supported the decision of the men to fight for the Union. She and the women students fashioned the first American flag that the men carried into battle, and later she recalled those dedicated women whose ``hearts went in with their stitches in the red, white, and blue.'' When the flag was captured at the bloody conflict called the Hornet's Nest during the battle of Shiloh, the women made a second flag for their soldiers and continued to support them with their letters and prayers. They were there to welcome home the remnant of Company C, and mourn the fallen. Life slowly returned to normal, and the university that almost wasn't became a thriving academic community once more.  Now, almost 140 years later, Upper Iowa University still stands amid the wooded hills of northeast Iowa, a tribute to the power of the academic spirit and a living memorial to those young Iowa soldiers and their fellow students who made sure they had a university to return to.                          ____________________
