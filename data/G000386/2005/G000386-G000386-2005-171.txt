 What I would like to do, if it is OK with the other side, is give Senator Kyl some time off of our time and then right after him, Senator Thomas, because Senator Thomas has been waiting for a long time to speak. I ask unanimous consent to make that the speaking order. These folks are talking about maybe 20 minutes apiece or less.
