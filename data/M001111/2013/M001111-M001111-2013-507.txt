 President, we have been working throughout the last vote. I am hoping we are getting to a very short list in the near future.  I recognize there are Senators who are frustrated and that want an opportunity to speak out. I know there are a number of Senators who are very tired. Everybody's patience is wearing thin. I would just ask everybody to hold your patience for just a few more minutes. I am going to put us into a quorum call. I am hoping we can get an agreement and give everybody some certainty.  I know on our side we want to get a budget passed. We have been working for a great deal of time. We want to move this process forward. We know there are Senators on the other side who may not agree with our budget but agree with us that we have to move to a process to get our country back on track.  So I would ask everybody's patience for just a short while; hopefully, we can get this resolved and we can get a budget passed.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
