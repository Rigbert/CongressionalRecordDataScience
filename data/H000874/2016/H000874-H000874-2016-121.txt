 We do have a serious problem. And I want to tell my friend, the majority leader, as someone who had served on the Appropriations Committee for 23 years, obviously, one of the important facts to know is how much will be allocated for each one of the 12 subcommittees so you can make judgments, as bills come to the floor or as they come to full committee, about whether the funding levels for those are appropriate or whether there ought to be other priorities that ought to be brought to the floor.  I appreciate the gentleman's response. I know that the Speaker has indicated that doing a budget is absolutely the responsible thing to do, that that is the regular order to do, and I know the budget has passed out of the committee. So I am wondering: What is holding the budget up, Mr. Leader? Why aren't we considering it?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding and asking again.  As for the schedule, we are not scheduled for next week. We continue to work through. We think the budget is very important. When we have it scheduled, I will notify.
