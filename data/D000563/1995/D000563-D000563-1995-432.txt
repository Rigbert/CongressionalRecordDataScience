Speaker, today I am introducing legislation along with Representative Dave Camp to encourage organ donation through a highly cost-effective campaign of public education. I am pleased to note that Senator Byron Dorgan is introducing similar legislation in the Senate.  The most common tragedy in organ transplantation is not the patient who received a [[Page E 1299]] transplant and dies, but the patient who has to wait too long and dies before a suitable organ can be found.  The demand for organs greatly exceeds the supply. More than 40,000 people are now waiting for an organ transplant, including more than 1,400 children and more than 25,000 people who must have a kidney dialysis while they wait for a kidney to become available. More than 3,000 people on the waiting list will die this year before receiving a transplant. Meanwhile, another person is added to the list every 18 minutes.  Our legislation, known as the Organ Donation Insert Card Act, would direct the Secretary of the Treasury to enclose, with each income tax refund check mailed next Spring, an insert card that encourages organ donation.  The insert would include a detachable organ donor card. It would also include a message urging recipients to sign the card, tell their families about their willingness to be an organ donor if the occasion arises, and encourage family members to request or authorize organ donation if the occasion arises.  The text of the card would be developed by the Secretary of the Treasury after consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and organizations promoting organ donation.  This proposal poses no logistical problems. Every year, the Treasury Department already puts an insert card in refund check mailings. In recent years, the insert cards have offered special coins for sale, such as last year's offer of World Cup commemorative coins. Shifting from an appeal about coins to an appeal about organ donation for 1 year could save a number of lives for many years to come.  This is also a highly cost-effective proposal. According to the Treasury Department, around 70 million households would receive this appeal at a cost of $210,000. There is no other way to reach so many households at such a modest cost.  Our approach also emphasizes the most important and often overlooked step in encouraging organ donation, which is talking to one's family beforehand.  Most people don't realize that a signed organ donor card does not ensure a donation. In order for an organ donation to take place, the next-of-kin must authorize it. If your family has not heard you express the desire to be an organ donor, they may be reluctant to authorize it. That is why talking to your family is critical.  Unfortunately, most Americans have never signed an organ donor card, and many of those who have signed a card have never discussed the matter with their family members. As a result, family members hesitate to authorize organ donation and opportunities to save lives are lost.  According to a Gallup poll cosponsored by the Partnership for Organ Donation, more than 90 percent of the public would authorize organ donation if their loved one had expressed that wish before death, but less than half would consent to donation if the discussion had not occurred. Unfortunately, according to the survey, less than half of the public have told their families of their wishes regarding donation.  Our bill is specifically designed to address this problem. Since organ donation begins with people who decide they want to be an organ donor if they should die unexpectedly, our bill encourages people to sign an organ donor card. But since an actual organ donation often hinges on whether loved ones are aware of that desire, our bill also encourages people to tell their family members about their desire to be an organ donor and urge their family to authorize a donation if the occasion arises.  By emphasizing the importance of family discussion, this legislation could expand the pool of potential donors, increase the likelihood that families will authorize donation for their loved ones, and reduce the number of people who die while waiting for transplants.  This legislation has the support of the United Network for Organ Sharing [UNOS], the American Nurses Association, and the National Kidney Foundation. Similar legislation in the 103d Congress had the support of nearly 20 organizations involved in the organ transplantation field, and we expect similar support this year.  This measure is desperately needed. When I first introduced the legislation in 1990, just over 20,000 people were on the waiting list and around 2,000 of those people died before receiving a transplant. Today, the waiting list has doubled in size, and more than 3,000 waiting list deaths are anticipated this year. Only a broad public education campaign can make a dent in these figures.  I urge my colleagues to join me as a cosponsor of this bill and encourage all Americans to ``give the gift of life'' by authorizing organ donations when the opportunity arises.                          ____________________
