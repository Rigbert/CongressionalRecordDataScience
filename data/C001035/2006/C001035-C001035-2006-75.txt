President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the motion to table the Schumer amendment No. 4930 occur at 4 p.m., with no second degrees in order prior to that vote. I further ask consent that following that vote, the bill be read a third time, and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage of the bill, with no intervening action or debate.
