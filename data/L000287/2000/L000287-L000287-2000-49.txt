Mr. Speaker, this morning I rise with a heavy heart. Yesterday, another child, another baby, lost her life to gun violence. This sad day, this great tragedy is made worse by the fact that this little girl was killed by another child.  How long will we tolerate gun violence? How long will we tolerate children killing children? Mr. Speaker, how long will it take for this House to demonstrate raw courage and pass real gun control legislation.  This morning, as we take a moment to consider our failure and to grieve this family's loss, we must not forget to take the time out to teach our children the way of peace, the way of nonviolence, to teach them the way of love.                          ____________________
