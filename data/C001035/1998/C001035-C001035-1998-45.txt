President, for the information of all Senators, the Senate will reconvene tomorrow at 9:45 a.m. and begin a period of morning business until 11:15 a.m. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the tobacco bill. At 12 noon, the Senate will proceed to vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the modified tobacco committee substitute. Assuming cloture fails, the Senate will continue debate on the tobacco bill. It is hoped that Members will come to the floor to offer and debate remaining amendments to the bill throughout Thursday's session. The Senate may also consider any other legislative or Executive Calendar item that may be cleared for action. Therefore, rollcall votes are possible throughout Thursday's session of the Senate.                          ____________________
