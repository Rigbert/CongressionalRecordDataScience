President, today I would like to recognize the accomplishments of William A. Richards--a friend, a colleague, and a dedicated public servant. Bill is retiring this month after nearly half a century of service to the U.S. Army and the Department of Defense. I had the privilege of working with Bill as an instructor at West Point. His lengthy career, as a soldier and as a civilian, truly exemplifies the motto of the Academy--``Duty, Honor, Country.''  Bill graduated from West Point in 1967 and served as an infantry officer in Vietnam and Germany. He continued his education at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton, receiving a master's degree in public policy. He then returned to West Point to supervise the core curriculum in American Government.  Following his return to West Point, Bill was selected for the prestigious position of speechwriter and executive assistant to NATO's Supreme Allied Commander--Europe. His exceptional work in this position resulted in his next assignment as speechwriter to Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger. Bill held this position until his retirement in 1989, after serving for 22 years in uniform.  Bill then started a second career as a budget analyst in the office of the Under Secretary of Defense, Comptroller, at the Pentagon. His military experience and speechwriting skills enabled him to analyze and translate the complexity of the annual defense budget. After 20 years of serving our Nation in this role, Bill retires as someone who is highly respected for his knowledge, experience, and dedication.  I congratulate him on a job well done. He leaves a proud and enduring legacy of public service. I wish Bill and his wife Donna the very best in the years to come.                          ____________________
