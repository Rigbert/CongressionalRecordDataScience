Mr. Chairman, I yield half of my time to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. McKinney) and ask unanimous consent that she be allowed to control that time.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey?  There was no objection.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. McKinney) will be recognized for 2\1/2\ minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Paul).  (Mr. Paul asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)
