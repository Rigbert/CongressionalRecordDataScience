We had dinner together but I had a chance to talk to Alan Alda about our mutual Italian heritage. Later I told my Italian-American mother how nice a couple they were. She said, basically, what would I expect? With an Italian background, they would have to be nice.  The New York Times recently ran an article about this remarkable couple, focusing on her prolific writing, and his acting and writing, but especially their ability to maintain a wonderful marriage and a sense of life. I wanted to make sure my fellow Senators and anybody else who reads the Congressional Record would read this profile. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the article from the New York Times entitled ``There's Always Room for Rum Cake.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Feb. 13, 2015]                    There's Always Room for Rum Cake                         (By Lois Smith Brady)       Arlene Alda, 81, and her husband, the actor Alan Alda, 79,      say that one secret to a long-lasting marriage (theirs has      been going for almost 58 years) is forgetfulness, which comes      naturally to them at this point.       The Aldas, who discussed their decades together by      telephone, with Ms. Alda also weighing in later by email,      haven't had a serious argument for the last 20 years, she      said, primarily because they can no longer remember for very      long whether they are angry with each other or why.       ``I have a short memory, and so does he,'' Ms. Alda said.      ``Was that always true? I don't recall.''       Both emanate warmth and thoughtfulness in the way of      beloved English professors or concerned therapists. Mr. Alda,      whose career in television and theater has been as remarkably      durable as his marriage, and Ms. Alda, a writer and      photographer, possess laughs that are like old jeans:      comfortable and well used.       Ms. Alda said that laughter is ``the real glue that keeps      us happily and willingly stuck together.'' They are      definitely not the kind of couple who sit silently across the      table from each other. ``We're both loud laughers,'' she      said. ``Guffawing ones.''       He said: ``I have a very highfalutin notion about laughter.      I think when you laugh you make yourself momentarily      vulnerable. Your defenses are not up, and if you can stay in      a playful mood, where you are susceptible to laughter, your      chances of being antagonistic with each other are lower.''       In general, they do not seem to act their ages. She      described a recent afternoon: ``I have a blurb to write for      someone's book. I have soup I want to cook. I have a good      chicken I want to roast. I have a book I'm reading that I      want to finish. I have email correspondence. I have Facebook      posts.''       Her 19th book, ``Just Kids From the Bronx,'' a collection      of vignettes about 65 noteworthy people who grew up in rough      Bronx neighborhoods and escaped in their own idiosyncratic      ways, is to be published next month.       Ms. Alda, who grew up in the Bronx herself and is a Hunter      College graduate, met Mr. Alda in 1956 while he was attending      Fordham University. They connected at a dinner party on the      Upper West Side when a rum cake accidentally fell onto the      kitchen floor and they were the only two guests who did not      hesitate to eat it.       ``He was a kindred spirit who was also funny, so there was      this great chemistry,'' she said. ``It sure was fun and      delightful to be with him that night. Boys from Manhattan      didn't date girls from the Bronx. That was a given. It was      too long of a trip. He took me home to the Bronx. Unheard      of.''       Eleven months later, they were married in a modest ceremony      (18 guests watched) that reflected their humble goals at the      time. They mainly wanted to be able to pay the rent and not      suffer as their parents had.       ``There was a lot of unhappiness in my parents'' marriage      partly because my mother was psychotic,'' Mr. Alda said. ``We      were already ahead of the game in that neither of us were      seriously mentally ill.''       Her parents had struggled financially and had no time for      luxuries like dinner parties or showing affection for each      other. ``I wanted something different,'' she said. ``I wanted      something without stress.''       So they filled their marriage with affection, music, dinner      parties with artists and actors and celebrations of every      paycheck.       ``The first job I got was with a traveling children's      company where we had to lug our own scenery,'' Mr. Alda said.      ``I got $10 a performance, and we were so glad, we went out      to get pizza to celebrate.'' To this day, whenever he gets a      new acting job, they celebrate by sharing a pizza.       Early on, they lived in Cleveland, where Eve, their first      child, was born. He often read poetry and short stories aloud      in the evenings. ``I'd be stirring a pot of soup, and the      baby would be sleeping, and he'd be reading to me,'' Ms. Alda      said. ``It was a warmth that's hard to describe.''       They eventually had two more daughters, moved to Leonia,      N.J., and discovered they had very different parenting      styles. ``I was the drill sergeant, and he liked to play with      the kids,'' she said. ``These were disagreements we had to      work out. How important is it for the kids to go to bed on      time?''       She added, ``We would talk a lot and talk angrily. When you      look back, you think, 'Why did I have to be angry?' ''       From 1972 to 1983, Mr. Alda commuted from New Jersey to Los      Angeles to play the part of Dr. Hawkeye Pierce in the iconic      television series ``M*A*S*H.'' Ms. Alda suddenly found      herself juggling raising their girls with trying to spend      time with a husband who was increasingly busy, famous and out      of town.       ``I was not a good juggler,'' she said. ``It all took      energy, and I found that I had spurts of energy. Not      sustained at all.''       Not wanting to become ``just an audience'' for her husband,      Ms. Alda worked harder on her own photography and writing      projects. ``I had my own drive,'' she said. ``One challenge      of marriage is how to keep your sense of self yet be able to      meld and blend with the other person.'' She said that being      married to a celebrity ``diminishes you, unless you feel      really secure in yourself.''       ``I like basking in someone else's glow,'' she said, ``but      not as a daily diet.''       Today, they live in an Upper West Side apartment and are      practically inseparable. On Facebook, she mentions Mr. Alda      in almost every post, and they seem to be always headed out      to a concert, play, lecture or reading. They even work on      their separate writing projects together.       Mr. Alda, who has written two memoirs, writes in the living      room, while Ms. Alda works in the study. They keep all the      doors open so they can talk back and forth, bounce ideas off      each other or call out when it's time to break for a meal.       ``Most likely one of us will die first,'' she said. ``I      can't even contemplate what that might be for either of us.      Meanwhile, we're doing what we should be doing. Living.''       Like many of the people profiled in ``Just Kids From the      Bronx,'' Ms. Alda believes that success in life--and in      marriage--is mostly a matter of luck. ``Luck is in neon      lights,'' she said, adding that there is no way a couple can      predict their future on their wedding day.       Both Aldas said it was especially lucky that they have      never grown bored of each other and that they didn't remain      penniless forever. ``I really do believe that scraping by can      damage a person and can damage a relationship,'' he said.      ``We have a lot of advantages. We know how lucky we are. I      don't think anybody can tell you how happy we'd be if we were      still scraping by.''       They have a house in the Hamptons and drink really good      wine, but otherwise they don't live particularly large. Both      dress in the comfortable baggy clothes of struggling writers      and have remained frugal and reluctant to waste anything.       ``That's never changed,'' she said. ``We are definitely      still those two people who would eat the cake off the      floor.''                          ____________________
