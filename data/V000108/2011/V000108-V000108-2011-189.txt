Speaker, it is with great pleasure and honor that I congratulate Mr. Michael Summers on his retirement. Mike, a 40-year member, 12-year officer, and Business Manager of Ironworkers Local #395, has dedicated his life to the interests of his fellow tradesmen and the entire community in Northwest Indiana. For his lifetime of service to the Ironworkers and the Northwestern Indiana Building and Construction Trades Council, Mike will be honored at a retirement dinner taking place at Avalon Manor in Merrillville, IN, on May 13, 2011.  During his 40-year membership in Ironworkers Local #395, Mike has held many positions and assisted the Building Trades in numerous capacities. Mike has represented the Ironworkers Local #395 as Trustee to the Health and Welfare Plan, the Annuity Plan, and the Joint Apprenticeship Training Committee. He has devoted much of his time to numerous boards and currently is a member of the Building Construction Resource Center. Additionally, he is a member of the Tri-Parte Committees for U.S. Steel, Arcelor Mittal Indiana Harbor, and Burns Harbor. Mike is the past President of the Northwestern Indiana Building and Construction Trades Council and has held elected office for the Ironworkers Local #395 as a Business Agent; currently, he is the Business Manager. Mike's passion, devotion, and continuous support to the Building Trades is truly remarkable and he is worthy of the highest praise.  Northwest Indiana has a rich history of excellence in its craftsmanship and loyalty to its members and service to the community. Mike Summers has always displayed these qualities and I profoundly respect his unwavering dedication to his own members and all the members of the Building Trades. I also deeply value his community involvement that has touched and inspired so many. When it comes to serving those in need throughout the community, Michael Summers has always been the first in line. He is generous to a fault.  Mr. Speaker, Michael Summers has given his time and efforts selflessly to those he has worked with and represented. He has been a true role model to his peers and a true friend to Northwest Indiana. Personally, I have found no better or loyal friend. I treasure our friendship. I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending Mike for his outstanding contributions and in wishing him well upon his retirement.                          ____________________
