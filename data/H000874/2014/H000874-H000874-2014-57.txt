And the American people said, that is not what we want done.  Again, they come to this floor because they cannot achieve, through their political process, the ends they seek. They have voted over 50 times to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act. They do not want it implemented. Now they want to sue the President because he is not implementing it fully, and now they are suing and refusing to say that impeachment is off the table.  In fact, their newly elected whip, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise) declined the opportunity to rule out impeachment on four separate occasions last weekend.  My friends, instead of wasting time and money on the lawsuit and what might follow, Congress ought to do what our constituents sent us here to do: create jobs, grow the middle class, invest in an economy where all of our people can work hard, and make it in America.  Reject this waste of time. Vote ``no'' on this unjustified, impractical, losing proposition for the suit against the President of the United States.
