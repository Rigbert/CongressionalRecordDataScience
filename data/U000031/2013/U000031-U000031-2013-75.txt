 I also want to thank Chairman Harkin and Senator Alexander for their leadership, and I've talked with them a number of times over the last number of weeks.  I want to thank our staffs on both sides, particularly on our side: Clay Alspach, Paul Edattel, John Stone, and Carly McWilliams. It is because of their collaborative and tireless efforts that we are near the resolution of last year's deadly outbreak, and their work is to be applauded.  To all of the families who have lost loved ones and to those who are still suffering today--and I talked to someone just within the last hour whose relative is still suffering--we are near the resolution of last year's deadly outbreak.  To those families who have lost loved ones and to those who are still suffering today, with this bill, we say: never again.  I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.
