Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, this bill is necessary for two reasons: first, the technology has gotten so good that it is very hard to determine whether the picture that is being transmitted and retransmitted on the Internet is a real child or a computer-created child. That means that if the government cannot prove that a real child was used, then the person who is the defendant will be able to walk out of the courtroom scot-free.  Secondly, as has been stated previously, every conviction of child pornographers as a result of the Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition decision is placed in jeopardy because at the time the prosecution took place, it was not a requirement that the government prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it was a real child that was being used for this purpose.  So the Ashcroft decision virtually guts our child pornography laws. That is why the Supreme Court has to be given an opportunity to reflect on the consequences of its decision. What this bill does is it attempts to respond to Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition in a way that we can have constitutional and effective anti-child pornography laws in this age of computers, the Internet, and e-mails.  Mr. Speaker, I urge every Member who is concerned about having that type of a law to vote ``aye'' on the motion to suspend the rules.
