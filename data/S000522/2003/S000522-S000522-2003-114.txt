Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I just want to thank the gentleman from Illinois for his leadership on this and for working so cooperatively with us. I also thank the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Renzi), the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Udall), the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Abercrombie), the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Case), the gentlewoman from Guam (Mr. Bordallo), the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Michaud), and the gentleman from American Samoa (Mr. Faleomavaega) for his cosponsorship of this legislation. I appreciate it very much and urge the body to adopt it.
