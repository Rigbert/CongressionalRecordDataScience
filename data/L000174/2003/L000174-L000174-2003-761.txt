President, if the Senator from Nevada is aware of what the Senator from Vermont said, I realize the junior Senator from Utah was not in the Chamber at that time--the senior Senator from Utah was, as was the distinguished majority leader--it would be safe to say to the distinguished Senator from Utah that the Senator from Vermont stated this morning very clearly that I would be prepared to see this go to a vote once response would be made. And the Senator from Vermont noted that Mr. Estrada himself said he had no objection to having all this memoranda that we have sought made available but had been told by the administration that he would not be allowed to.  If the question is how various Senators would feel if the memoranda were made available and we were allowed to question Mr. Estrada, something he said personally that he would have no objection to, then as far as I am concerned I would be perfectly willing after that to have the matter go forward to a vote and have Senators vote up or down however they may feel.
