 President, earlier this year, Hart County in my home State began a yearlong celebration of its bicentennial anniversary. This southcentral county is the proud home to an abundance of Kentucky history and culture. As they mark this impressive milestone, the people of Hart County, KY, are also ready to lead our Commonwealth toward its bright future.  The county was established in 1819 and named for a brave Kentuckian,Captain Nathaniel Gray Smith Hart. A brother-in-law of Henry Clay and a Lexington lawyer, Hart bravely served the young Nation in the War of 1812, when he was captured and killed at the Battle of the River Raisin in the Michigan Territory.  Its local history is deeply intertwined with the geography. Early settlers planted roots near present-day Horse Cave because of the fertile soil. Like many Kentucky communities, the economic success of burley tobacco drove the local economy, putting food on family tables and shoes on children's feet. The Green River opened access routes for commerce throughout the country, and the establishment of the Mammoth Cave National Park, the world's longest known cave system, has made Hart County a destination for tourism.  The strategic construction of Louisville & Nashville Railroad through both Horse Cave and the county seat of Munfordville in 1859 brought new waves of economic growth. However, at the outbreak of the American Civil War, the railroad's location also made it a target. Segments of the track were attacked by both Union and Confederate troops, and the county was the site of three battles. It is also the home of two Civil War generals, Thomas J. Wood fighting for the Union and future Kentucky Governor Simon Bolivar Buckner for the Confederacy. Each September, the community remembers its place in this chapter of American history during the Hart County Civil War Days.  Through the years, Hart County has continued to prosper. The building of I-65 through the county has bolstered the area's growth and opened new opportunities for tourism and economic activity. Local leaders are especially proud of the recent expansion of Sister Schubert's famous bakery and the opening of the Green River College and Career Academy. The county's best days are still ahead.  With a rich heritage and a promising future, Hart County certainly has a lot to celebrate. Along with the families and leaders of the county like Judge Executive Joe Choate, it is my privilege to mark this great occasion. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in celebrating 200 years of historic achievement in Hart County.                          ____________________
