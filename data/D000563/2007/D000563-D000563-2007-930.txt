I am going to ask unanimous consent that we set aside the pending Sanders amendment for the purpose of offering an amendment which I am going to offer and then, after a brief comment of 3 to 5 minutes, I will ask unanimous consent to return to the Sanders amendment as the pending business before the Senate. I don't wish to mislead anybody about what I am doing. This should be a total of about 5 minutes, and we will be back where we started. My amendment will be at the desk for later consideration.  I make that unanimous consent request to set aside the pending Sanders amendment for the purpose of offering my amendment.
