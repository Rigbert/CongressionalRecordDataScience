 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, the Senate stand in adjournment until 2 p.m. on Monday, April 11. I further ask unanimous consent that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved, and the Senate then begin a period of morning business with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each; provided that at 3 p.m. the Senate proceed to the consideration of H.R. 1268, the Iraq-Afghanistan supplemental appropriations bill, as provided under the previous order.
