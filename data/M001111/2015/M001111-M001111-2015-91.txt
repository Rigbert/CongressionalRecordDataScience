 The workforce in the years to come will depend on today's students being able to create and take on the jobs of tomorrow, and providing students with the chance to learn, grow, and thrive will help our country continue to compete and lead in the 21st-century global economy.  Today we are continuing our work on the Senate floor to make sure all of our students have access to a quality education by working to fix the badly broken No Child Left Behind law. I thank Chairman Alexander, the senior Senator from Tennessee, for working with me on this bipartisan bill. He has been a great partner throughout this process. The bipartisan bill, the Every Child Achieves Act, is a good step in the right direction. It gives our States more flexibility while also including Federal guardrails to make sure all students have access to a quality public education. But I want to work, of course, to continue to improve and strengthen this bill throughout this process on the Senate floor. I want to make sure struggling schools get the resources they need. I want to make sure all of our kids, especially our most vulnerable students, are able to succeed in the classroom.  Finishing this process and getting a bill signed into law isn't going to be easy. Nothing in Congress ever is. But students and parents and teachers in communities across our country--including in my home State of Washington--are looking to Congress to fix this broken law. We cannot let them down. We need to work across the aisle to provide a quality education for all students, regardless of where they live or how they learn or how much money their parents make.  So I look forward to continuing to work with Chairman Alexander as we move this through the Senate floor and to conference--and I think he agrees with me--and, hopefully, to the President to get it signed into law. I see the chairman is here.  I yield the floor.
