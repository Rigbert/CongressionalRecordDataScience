Before we set aside any pending amendment, I would like to have his assent to that happening. If the Senator from Arizona would like to ask for recognition and each of the Members to speak to their amendments, I have no objection. But if that includes setting aside the pending amendment and filing a new amendment, I would like to have Senator Inouye on the floor before that decision is made.  Mr. McCAIN. I amend my unanimous-consent request that the Senator from Louisiana, followed by the Senator from Wisconsin, followed by me, followed by the Senator from Texas, all to speak, and if the Senator from Hawaii agrees, for purposes of proposing amendments which requires setting aside the pending amendment.
