 President, recently, the problem of steroid abuse has been getting a great deal of media attention. While this publicity has helped to raise public awareness about the dangers of illegal steroids, recent studies indicate that more and more young people are taking these drugs to improve their performance, appearance, or self image. In fact, some recent studies indicate that as many as 5 percent to 7 percent of students, even as young as middle school, admit to using illegal steroids.  Even more widespread among adolescents, however, is the use of over-the-counter supplements. Many young people are turning to ``supplements'' as an alternative to illegal steroids, mistakenly believing that because they are sold over the counter, they must be safe. However, many of these over the counter ``supplements'' actually produce the same dangerous effects on the body as illegal steroids. Some, even become steroids in the bloodstream.  Last year, the President signed into law the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004, which added 18 anabolic steroid precursors to the list of anabolic steroids that are classified as controlled substances. Yet as I speak, on the shelves of health stores across the country, sits one anabolic steroid that can be bought by anyone, at any age, without the need of a doctor's prescription.  Dehydroepiandrosterone, or DHEA, is an anabolic steroid that once ingested, the body turns into testosterone. DHEA like all other steroids, may cause a number of long term physical and psychological effects, including: heart disease, cancer, stroke, liver damage, severe acne, baldness, dramatic mood swings, aggression etc. In fact, DHEA is already banned by the Olympics, the World Anti-Doping Agency, the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the National Football League, the National Basketball Association, and Minor League Baseball, yet it actually enjoys special protections under the Anabolic Steroid Control Act.  In an effort to keep all potentially dangerous steroids out of the hands of unsuspecting consumers and children, I am pleased to introduce legislationtoday that would add DHEA to the list of controlled substances under the Anabolic Steroid Control Act. This legislation will eliminate the special exemption granted to DHEA, thereby treating it as every other substance in the steroid family.  With the dramatic rise in the use of steroids among our nation's youth, now is the time to act to curb this increasingly growing problem. Just like all other anabolic steroids, DHEA should not be available over the counter, but only under a doctor's supervision. I encourage my colleagues to join in support of this legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1137       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
