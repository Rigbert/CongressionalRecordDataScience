 President, I know it is my turn to speak, but out of deference to Senator Baucus who is negotiating on the Children's Health Insurance Program, I ask unanimous consent that he go before me, and then I ask that Senator Tester would follow him, because I don't want Senator Tester to have to sit around and listen to me. Then I ask unanimous consent after those two, I be the next in line.
