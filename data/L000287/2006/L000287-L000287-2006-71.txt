Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this resolution, H.R. 1259, to authorize the President to award a gold medal on behalf of the Congress, collectively, to the Tuskegee Airmen in recognition of their unique military record, which inspired revolutionary reform in the Armed Forces.  The Tuskegee Airmen, formed from 1,000 pilots, bombardiers and navigators, overcame segregation and racial discrimination to become national heroes and advanced our society by desegregating our armed forces. While in combat, the Tuskegee Airmen completed 15,000 missions and never lost an Allied bomber under their escort.  The Tuskegee Airmen were the first people of color in U.S. military history to see air combat. This group of brave soldiers became one of the most respected Army Air Corp Fighter Groups of World War II.  In joining the fight to save Europe and the world from a cruel and heinous regime, the Tuskegee Airmen fought for freedom that they could not enjoy in their own country. In taking to the air during the launch of military aviation, these brave men were also fighting a war against bigotry and racism at home. Thus, they deserve the kind of recognition that the Gold Medal will give them.  The Tuskegee Airmen are now in their 80's, so we must pass this bill immediately to honor these WWII heroes so these medals will not be a posthumous honor.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E343]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 1259--TO AWARD A CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL ON BEHALF                          OF THE TUSKEGEE AIRMEN                                 ______                                                             HON.
