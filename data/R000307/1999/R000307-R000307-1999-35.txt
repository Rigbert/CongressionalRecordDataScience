President, for the information of all Senators, the Senate will convene at 10 a.m. tomorrow and be in a period of morning business until 12:30. It is expected that tomorrow morning the Senate will be able to reach an agreement for the consideration of the Energy and Water Appropriations conference report. It is hoped the Senate would begin that conference report at approximately 11 o'clock on Tuesday for 45 minutes of debate. If that agreement is reached, Senators could anticipate the first rollcall vote to occur at approximately 11:45 in the morning.  Following the party conference meetings, the Senate may begin consideration of the digital millennium legislation or any conference reports or appropriations bills available for action while waiting for the continuing resolution from the House of Representatives. Therefore, Senators can anticipate votes throughout tomorrow's session of the Senate.                          ____________________
