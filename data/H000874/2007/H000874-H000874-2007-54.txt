We did have a bipartisan vote on the Peru Trade Agreement which incorporated, as we had urged, both worker protections and environmental protections. And with respect to the other three agreements which have been negotiated, Panama, Colombia and South Korea, frankly, we don't yet know. As the gentleman knows, with respect to the agreement with Panama, the complication really doesn't regard the trade agreement as much as it regards the concern that many people have on both sides of the aisle that the Speaker or President of the Panamanian Parliament is under indictment in the United States with an extradition request for the murder of an American soldier. That, obviously, has complicated the consideration of that agreement.  With respect to Colombia, frankly, I want to tell the gentleman, I don't expect Colombia to come up until next year or South Korea to come up before next year. We obviously have, afternext week, we hope, a short time left to go, maybe six, seven legislative days. So it would be unrealistic to expect us to be able to move these agreements within that time frame. But if we could resolve, I think, the issue regarding Panama, that might be possible.
