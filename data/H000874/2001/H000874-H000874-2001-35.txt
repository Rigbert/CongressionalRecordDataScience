Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, first, I want to adopt the remarks of the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price): One minute is too short a time to substantively discuss obviously so important an issue. But I want to say that I reject the rationale of the gentleman from California who spoke immediately before me. I do not believe that a vote ``no'' will weaken the President. What a vote ``no'' will do is strengthen the process in this House.                              {time}  1445  The American public elected 435, not 221 or 222, but 435 of us; and they expected us to come together, to work together, to reason together, and to produce a product. I believe had that process been followed, this product would be better.  Like the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price) who spoke before me, I have supported Fast Track, PNTR, and NAFTA. Why? Because I believe that trade is an important aspect of the economic well-being of our country and of our workers. But I believe that this process needs to be open; and if so, it will be a better one. Reject this bill.
