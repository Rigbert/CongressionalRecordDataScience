Speaker, first, let me say to the gentleman from California (Mr. Cox) that I associate myself with his remarks and thank him for those comments. Let me say to my friend, the chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, he and I voted together probably 95 percent on issues of defense.                              {time}  1415  I will tell my friend, he has repeated the fact that we knew this in January at least four or five times, that I have heard. If that is the case, and I take him at his word, frankly, I did not focus on it, the chairman did not focus on it, there have been no hearings, there have been no investigations. It is a shameful reality that perhaps some knew this as early as January, and we are here today, some 4 months later, with the public getting that information and the Members of Congress being energized by it. And this resolution did not come from your committee, I say to my friend, until almost mid-May, notwithstanding the fact that you read that disclosure over and over and over again.
