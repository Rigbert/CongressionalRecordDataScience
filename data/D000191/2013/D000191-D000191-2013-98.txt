 What I think is absolutely crazy is the Republicans' constant denial of the overwhelming scientific consensus that climate change is real and human activity is largely responsible. I think it's absolutely crazy that the Republicans voted more than 50 times in the last Congress to block action on climate change.  In March, I talked about a new peer-reviewed report from Oregon State and Harvard that looked at temperatures over the last 11,300 years; and they found that over the last 100 years, coinciding with the widespread use of fossil fuels and turbines, et cetera, that we have seen more temperature increase than over the previous 11,000 years; 100 years versus 11,000 years.  Last month I came to the floor again to talk about a new NOAA report. Oceans are warming, fish stocks, many commercial fish stocks are moving north. Other things, which aren't capable of moving, are deteriorating in stocks.  And then, on the west coast, we've had shellfish failures due to ocean acidification; and the shellfish, of course, are only an indication of what might happen to the rest of the food chain in the oceans.  No one denies the acidification is due to the CO2 in the atmosphere. But the Do-Nothing Republican Congress just shrugs and says there's nothing to do.  But, unlike the Republicans, President Obama accepts the science; and in about 2 hours, the President will release a plan to combat climate change here at home and lay out steps for working with some of the world's largest polluters, including India and China, to reduce emissions abroad.  The details aren't all out yet, but the President's proposing to do something that I said we should do 5 years ago, that is, use the regulatory powers of the Clean Air Act to regulate new and existing power plants. That's responsible for almost 40 percent of our greenhouse gas emissions.  We can make a huge dent in our emissions by moving forward on responsible, flexible efficiency standards for coal and natural gas plants.  As the administration moves forward, it should take a close look at the climate plan outlined by the Natural Resources Defense Council. Their plan has two key elements: set State-specific emission rates to reflect the diversity of the Nation's electricity sector, and give power plant operators broad flexibility to meet those standards in the most cost-effective way through a range of existing technologies.  The standard for every State would be an overall emission rate average of all the fossil fuel plants, and individual plants could emit at a higher or lower rate. Each covered plant with an emission rate above the State standard could meet the target by retrofitting a more efficient boiler, installing carbon capture, or it could burn a mixture of coal and cleaner fuels such as gas and/or biomass.  The plan would allow for the owners of multiple power plants to average emissions rates of their plants and meet the required emission rate on average by running coal plants less often, increasing generation from cleaner sources, or integrating more renewable resources. Such an approach, that is both flexible and State-based, is exactly what makes the Clean Water Act one of our most successful environmental and public health statutes in history.  Mr. Speaker, it's time to listen to scientists. Get serious about climate change. The evidence is in. The President has a plan. The Supreme Court has given him the authority to regulate. The only question now is whether the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives will listen and act.                          ____________________
