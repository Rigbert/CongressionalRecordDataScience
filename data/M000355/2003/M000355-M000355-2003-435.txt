 The stationing of troops overseas is very expensive. So I say to our colleagues who are concerned about the costs, the sooner we can get the troops home, the sooner it will cost us dramatically less. That is why the reconstruction project part of it is so important. Getting the country structured in such a way that they have adequate power, clean water, and are able to move forward with their infrastructure is the key to getting the troops home. So the $20 billion part of this package is critically important.  I know we will be having amendments about whether it ought to be conditioned. I think the President is correct. I think it ought to be a grant. I think we ought to make it clear that we did not go in there to put them in debt beyond where they are already. But we will have that debate in the coming days on the supplemental.  I am thankful for the opportunity to share my observations about my recent trip with Members of the Senate.  I yield the floor.
