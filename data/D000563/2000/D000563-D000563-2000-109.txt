The efforts of our colleague, Senator Russ Feingold, and Republican Senator John McCain are well documented. Al Gore has said: As President, the first bill we will send the Congress is the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform. The first bill he will accept is a bipartisan bill to deal with campaign finance reform.  If we cannot come to grips with the abuses of the campaign finance system, several things will occur. The special interest groups, which rule the corridors of Congress and continue to rule the campaigns, will set the agenda; and secondly, many good men and women will continue to refuse to get into this business because they don't want to mess with multimillion-dollar campaigns, these attack ads that come from every direction, and the attacks on personal lives and reputation which have become so commonplace in negative campaigning.  It is interesting to me we have a bill so clearly bipartisan. The Republican Senator, John McCain, was very popular as a Republican candidate for President. In fact, he carried a few States in the Republican Presidential primary. Yet we can't even get thatbill to the floor for a vote in a Senate that is controlled by the Republican Party.  I think the American people see through this. I think they understand that this is not a fight over the Bill of Rights, it is a fight over the rights of Americans to be well represented.
