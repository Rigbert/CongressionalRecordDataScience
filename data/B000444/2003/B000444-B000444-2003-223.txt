 President, on April 11, 2003, I submitted for inclusion in the official Record of the Senate a section-by-section discussion and analysis of title IX of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, P.L. 107-204. At the end of that statement, the full text of a letter to me from the United States Department of Justice, dated December 26, 2002, should have appeared. In that letter, Assistant Attorney General Daniel J. Bryant confirms my view that the Department may use existing criminal provisions to prosecute corporate executives who fail to file a certification attesting to the accuracy of a company's financial reports, pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Unfortunately, the letter was inadvertently excluded from the Record, so I now resubmit it and ask unanimous consent that its text be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       U.S. Department of Justice,                                Office of Legislative Affairs,                                Washington, DC, December 26, 2002.     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Biden: This is in response to your letter of      October 16, 2002 to the Attorney General and the Chairman of      the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding enforcement      of section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (``the      Act''). The Department thanks you for your leadership in      corporate governance reform and, in particular, commends your      efforts as primary author of section 906 of the Act (18      U.S.C. Sec. 1350), which requires corporate executives to      make certain certifications with respect to their financial      statements.       The Department is fully committed to using the tools      Congress provided in the Act in our continuing efforts to      uncover and punish corporate fraud. As the President noted      when he signed the Act, ``this law gives my administration      new tools for enforcement. We will use them to the fullest.''      In keeping with the President's statement, Attorney General      Ashcroft has directed all United States Attorneys and FBI      Special-Agents-in-Charge to review the Act and to take all      appropriate steps to implement its provisions fully and      expeditiously.       The Department continues to consult with the Commission      staff regarding certain legal and technical issues associated      with implementing section 906. In particular, questions have      arisen regarding the form, location, method of filing and      scope of the certification required under section 906. We      want to assure you that the Department will continue to work      closely with the Commission and we are confident that these      questions will be resolved to your satisfaction and with the      full input of all affected parties in the near future.       The Department does believe that it is in a position to      respond to one question you raised in your letter. You have      inquired whether covered individuals who willfully fail to      file the certifications required by 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1350(a)      are subject to the penalties provided in 15 U.S.C. Sec. 78ff.      While the facts and circumstances determine which tools our      prosecutors utilize in each individual case, we believe that      section 78ff's criminal penalties are applicable when an      individual willfully fails to file the required certification      under section 906.       Section 1350(a) of the Act mandates that each periodic      report containing financial statements filed by an issuer      with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to      Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of      1934 shall be accompanied by the required written      certification. In addition, Section 3(d) of the Act states      that: ``a violation by any person of this Act, any rule or      regulation of the Commission issued under this Act, or any      rule of the Board shall be treated for all purposes in the      same manner as a violation of the Securities Exchangee Act of      1934 (15 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 78a et seq.) or the rules and      regulations issued thereunder, consistent with the provisions      of this Act, and any such person shall be subject to the same      penalties, and to the same extent, as for a violation of that      Act or such rules and regulations.''       The criminal provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of      1934 (15 U.S.C. Sec. 78ff) state that ``any person who      willfully violates any provision of this chapter (other than      section 78dd-1), or any rule or regulation thereunder the      violation of which is made unlawful or the observance of      which is required under the terms of this chapter . . . shall      upon conviction be fined not more than $1,000,000, or      imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.'' Therefore, as      you have suggested, the Department may utilize section 78ff's      criminal penalties to prosecute executives who violate the      Sarbanes-Oxley Act by willfully failing to file section 906's      required certifications.       The Department believes that it is critically important to      work with the Commission to resolve the remaining issues you      have raised in a timely and thoughtful manner, and we are      committed to moving forward expeditiously to achieve      consensus on those issues. We also will continue, where      appropriate, to formulate guidance for our prosecutors and      investigators who must enforce the new law and to provide      clarity for the corporate community which must comply with      it.       We appreciate your attention to these issues, and look      forward to continuing to work with you and others in Congress      on the implementation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.           Sincerely,                                                 Daniel J. Bryant,     Assistant Attorney General.                          ____________________
