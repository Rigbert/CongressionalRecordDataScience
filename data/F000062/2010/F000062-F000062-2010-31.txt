 President, I am in support of the nomination of Mr. David Buckley to be the next inspector general of the Central Intelligence Agency, CIA.  On Tuesday, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence voted unanimously to recommend Mr. Buckley's nomination. So there is overwhelming, bipartisan support for Mr. Buckley.  It is also important that the Senate act on this nomination before the upcoming recess. The position of the CIA inspector general has remained vacant since the retirement of John Helgerson in March 2009.  The Senate Intelligence Committee has seen firsthand the importance of the CIA inspector general. Many of the reports and audits from this office remain classified, but have had a major impact on our committee's understanding of CIA programs and at times have led directly to major changes in those programs.  Other reports have been made public, like the 2004 Special Review into the CIA detention and interrogation program. The report raised major questions about the program's legality and compliance and allowed the public to see some of what went wrong with the CIA program.  The inspector general of the CIA plays a crucial role. The CIA is an agency that is charged with operating in secret in locations around the world, conducting covert actions and collecting intelligence. It shields its activities from the public, but it needs oversight. The IG's Office has been conducting independent reviews of Agency offices and programs, recommended measures of accountability where appropriated, and performed detailed audits of CIA expenditures and financial statements.  In April 2010, Vice Chairman Bond and I wrote a letter to President Obama, pointing out the importance of the CIA IG position and the need to nominate and confirm a strong, independent auditor and investigator.  I am pleased that he nominated Mr. Buckley. His confirmation hearing was held on September 21, where Senators reviewed his record, his views on the position to which he has been nominated, and his plans if confirmed. Mr. Buckley was straightforward with our committee and very clear about his belief in a strong and independent IG.  Mr. Buckley has had more than 30 years of experience in government service that should provide him with an excellent background for the challenges he will face when confirmed.  Mr. Buckley enlisted with the Air Force in 1976, specializing in investigations. He continued service with the Air Force Office of Special Investigations as a civilian in 1984, working for 3 years before moving to the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations under then Chairman Sam Nunn.  Senator Nunn offered the following endorsement for Mr. Buckley when he wrote to the committee recently:       I found David to be a consummate professional of the      highest integrity, and he enjoyed a great reputation on both      sides of the aisle. He has excellent judgment and an      abundance of common sense.  Following 8 years on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, including time as chief investigator, Mr. Buckley worked as a special assistant to the inspector general of the Department of Defense, at the General Accounting Office, and at the Treasury Department for 7 years, most of it as assistant inspector general for investigations.  Mr. Buckley then served from 2005 to 2007 as the minority staff director of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. As such he had a purview of the entire intelligence community, including the CIA, and developed an understanding from the congressional point of view of the important relationships the intelligence committees have with the CIA inspector general.  Finally, Mr. Buckley has worked as a senior manager at Deloitte Consulting since 2007, consulting in the national security arena. In short, David Buckley has spent 34 years in a career focused on conducting oversight, much of it in the defense and intelligence areas.  I believe his background makes him an excellent candidate and I look forward to working with Mr. Buckley in his new position.                          ____________________
