 Speaker in 1935 in Plymouth, VT, the grave of an unknown soldier in the American Revolutionary War was discovered. It was found on land owned by a nature conservancy. That year the Daughters of the American Revolution placed a marker and a flag at the grave.  Today, it is my honor to introduce legislation to authorize the President to award the Medal of Honor to the Unknown Vermonter who gave his life while serving in the Continental Army in the American War of Independence. This tribute is especially fitting now that the Vermont legislature has approved legislation designating this unknown soldier's gravesite as an official site to honor Vermont soldiers of all wars who never returned home and whose ultimate fate is unknown.  I also ask that two recent articles from Vermont newspapers be reprinted in the Congressional Record to underscore the merit and significance of continuing to recognize the profound sacrifice made by all American veterans to secure and preserve our freedom.             [From the Burlington Free Press, Apr. 8, 1995]                   Revolutionary War Soldier Honored       Montpelier.--An unnamed soldier buried in Plymouth after      the Revolutionary War has been selected Vermont's official      unknown soldier following approval of a resolution this week      by the Vermont Senate.       The soldier, buried on land owned by a nature conservancy,      is believed to have died as he was returning from the      Revolutionary War.       According to oral history, the soldier died at a stream a      few hundred yards from the wooded knoll where he is buried.      The grave was exhumed in 1935, and a body was found. That      year the Daughters of the American Revolution placed a marker      and a flag at the grave.       The designation honors Vermont soldiers of all wars who did      not return home, said Rep. John Murphy, D-Ludlow, who      introduced the resolution in the House, where it      was approved in February. A July 4 ceremony is planned at the gravesite      near the historic Crown Point Military Road in Plymouth.                                                                    ____             [From the Burlington Free Press, Mar. 1, 1995]    Vermont Unknown Soldier May Serve Again--Legislature Considers                          Designation for Grave                            (By Molly Walsh)       Plymouth.--A nameless Revolutionary War soldier who was      buried in a remote, wooded grave roughly 220 years ago may      finally find an identity.       The soldier, believed to have died a few hundred yards from      Vermont's historic Crown Point Military Road as he returned      home from battle, will be designated Vermont's official      unknown soldier if a resolution introduced Tuesday in the      Legislature is approved.       The designation would honor Vermont soldiers of all wars      who never returned home and whose ultimate fate is unknown,      said Rep. John Murphy, D-Ludlow, who expects the resolution      to be discussed in the House today. It would also give the      forgotten soldier, who is buried atop a secluded knoll      overlooking the stream where he may have taken his last      drink, a place in history, even if he lacks a name.       ``History reflects those people that have given their      utmost support and their lives in some cases, and I think the      young people of the country should understand history on the      national level and the state level,'' Murphy said.       The grave is located off Vermont 103, about one-half mile      northeast of Lake Ninevah and just north of the Mount Holly-     Plymouth line. The land where it sits is owned by The      Wilderness Corporation, a Vermont conservation group that      owns 3,000 acres in the area, which it opens to hiking,      skiing and other recreational uses.       The grave itself is one-third of a mile from a branch of      the historic Crown Point Military Road, today a patchwork of      paths, town roads and overgrown woods that is frequently      hiked by history buffs.       But during the French and Indian Wars, as well as the      Revolutionary War, the 77-mile road was traveled by soldiers      heading to strategic positions at Fort Ticonderoga and Crown      Point, N.Y.       The road, built from 1759 to 1760, stretches from the      Connecticut River on the east side of the state to Lake      Champlain on the west. There are several graves of      Revolutionary War soldiers along and around the road and its      many branches.       The grave that was chosen for the designation was selected      for its peaceful setting and because the oral history      surrounding the soldier's death is compelling.       That history, passed down for generations, holds that the      soldier was returning home from battle and stopped to drink      at a stream with a comrade. He reportedly died on the spot      and was buried on the knoll overlooking the stream.       A local landowner told the story to the Rev. William Ballou      of Chester. Ballou, who was also a Boy Scout master,      investigated the site and confirmed the grave's location on      Oct. 19, 1935. A month later the Chester Boy Scouts cleared      brush from the site and placed a wooden marker on the old      road that goes by the grave. That year the Daughters of the      American Revolution also placed a marker and a flag at the      head of the grave. Whether the oral history is true, no one      can be sure. But that does not matter to the Rev. Charles      Purinton Jr., chaplain and family services coordinator for      the Vermont National Guard, who launched the designation      effort.       ``Nobody really does know what happened,'' Purinton said.      But he believes one thing is certain about the soldier: ``He      was doing his duty like Vermonters ever since.''       If the House and Senate approve the resolution, a July 4th      ceremony is planned at the knoll where the soldier is buried      and a simple plaque will be erected. It would be the first      recognition of this kind in Vermont.       Maj. Gen. Donald Edwards, the state adjutant general, said      that if the designation is made, no great influx of visitors      to the site is anticipated. Other than the plaque, he does      not expect any changes.       ``We think it's classic Vermont, why change it?'' he said.      ``We are not going to build any great big monuments or      anything.'' However, the site's remote beauty could be its      downfall. The path from the dirt road to the grave is uphill,      rocky and overgrown. It would be difficult for handicapped      people to navigate.       That's a major drawback, said John Bergeron, vice president      of the Vietnam Veterans of America Chapter One in Rutland.      ``A lot of veterans are getting up there in age,'' he said.      ``Certainly access to the place will be a problem.''       But the solitude hanging in the air over the grave covered      by field stones and snow inspires contemplation of what put      him there. And that makes the site special, said Scott McGee,      president of the Wilderness Corporation.       ``It is touching to go there and to contemplate what may      have occurred and to think about who may lie there and what      he may have done,'' McGee said. ``There is a sense of history      that starts to surround you when you go to the site.''                               ____________________
