 Speaker, some of the reforms we are voting today are good, and some I have problems with. The one I want to briefly focus on is the requirement that it will take a 60-percent vote to raise personal and corporate income taxes.  Mr. Speaker, the fact of the matter is that the current tax system in America is highly regressive. Tens of millions of working Americans and middle-income Americans are paying a higher percentage of their income in taxes than are millionaires. Corporations today in many instances that are very profitable, that are taking their jobs to the Third World, are not contributing their fair share in taxes.  Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that if we want a fair tax system, an equitable tax system, majority vote should rule in allowing the House of Representatives to raise taxes on the wealthy and on those corporations that are not paying their fair share of taxes.
