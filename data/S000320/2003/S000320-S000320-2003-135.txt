 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a dear friend, William Canary, of Montgomery, AL. Bill Canary was recently name president of the Business Council of Alabama.  While he now calls Montgomery, Al, home, Bill is a native of New York and attended the State University of New York at Oneonta. He also holds a juris doctorate degree from the Jacob D. Fuchsberg Law Center at Touro College.  Bill came to BCA from the American Trucking Association, the national trade and safety organization of the U.S. trucking industry. He began his career at ATA nearly a decade ago, serving as counselor to the AT president and CEO, Thomas J. Donohue. Over the years, he served ATA in various capacities including political advisor to the president and senior vice president for State, Federation and Intergovernmental Affairs. In 2001, the ATA board of directors named him their president and CEO.  Prior to his service at the ATA, Bill served as a Special Assistant to President George H.W. Bush for Intergovernmental Affairs. From January 1989 through June 1991, Bill served the White House as the President's liaison to local elected officials and mayors throughout the Nation.  Bill has also served as chief of staff for the Republican National Committee and as national political director for the Committee to Re-Elect President Bush. During the 2000 Republican National Convention he served as a senior advisor to the co-chairman, Andrew Card, currently chief of staff to President George W. Bush.  He is the coauthor of the public research product ``The Alabama Poll,'' and is a writer, commentator, and political analyst for several Alabama television programs.  In 2001, I was proud to recommend Bill's wife Leura to serve as the U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Alabama. Leura has served in this position with distinction. Bill and Leura have a daughter, Margaret, and a son, Will.  Bill Canary is a good friend and a beloved family man. I offer him my congratulations and best wishes in his new role as president of BCA.                          ____________________
