Speaker, I rise today to call for the immediate and unconditional release of Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev, Israeli soldiers who, as of today, have now been held captive by Hezbollah terrorists for a full year.  On July 12, 2006, a month-long military conflict between Israel and Hezbollah was instigated when the armored humvee Ehud and Eldad were riding in was bombarded by Hezbollah rockets.  Ehud and Eldad were captured during the course of this unprovoked attack and have been held hostage ever since.  In February of this year, I had the pleasure of welcoming Ehud Goldwasser's energetic wife, Karnit, to the U.S. Capitol. She told me how trying it has been to live without the ``the love of her life'' and how her once bright hopes of raising a family with Ehud are now in peril due to the cowardly and illegal acts of a terrorist organization whose only goal is the destruction of her homeland. It is my hope that when I meet with Karnit again in August, Ehud will once again be by her side.  Terrorist acts like the kidnapping of Ehud and Eldad are not military actions between warring nations. They are despicable crimes that tear families apart and shroud entire communities in grief and suffering. As the leader of the free and democratic world, the United States has a responsibility to condemn such attacks whenever and wherever they occur, and to help advance peaceful solutions to ongoing crises whenever they can be reached.  To that end, I stand by Karnit Goldwasser, I stand by Israel, and I stand by like-minded activists throughout the world in calling for the immediate and unconditional release of Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev--courageous individuals who answered Israel's call to serve and who have sacrificed greatly in fighting for the democratic principles for which our two countries stand.                          ____________________
