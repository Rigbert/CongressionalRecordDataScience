 But let me say this to my friend from Oklahoma, who I know is an honest guy. We disagree. We have differences of opinion. It was not my suggestion that ExxonMobil did not pay taxes over those years. That was not my suggestion. But let me say this. He mentioned that they do pay taxes, which is true. But let's understand that ExxonMobil was the most profitable corporation in the history of the world from 2006 through 2008, making $40 billion in profits in 2006, $41 billion in 2007, and $45 billion in 2008. In the midst of a recession, my understanding is they made $19 billion in profits last year.  Would my friend from Oklahoma deny that despite making these huge profits last year, $19 billion, they received--they paid zero in 2009 and in fact received a $156 million refund from the taxpayers of this country? I hope my friend from Oklahoma would comment on whether that is good public policy.  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.
