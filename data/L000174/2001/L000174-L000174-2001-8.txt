President, I am pleased to cosponsor this resolution to grant honorary citizenship to the Marquis de Lafayette.  Aside from being a hero of the American Revolution, the Marquis de Lafayette is known for the grand tour he took of the new Republic in the 1820's. During his visit to Vermont in 1825, a town was renamed as Fayetteville until it was changed again to Newfane in 1882.  He also laid the cornerstone of the Old Mill, a historic building on the University of Vermont's campus. The school now honors his memory with a statue on campus.  It is not inappropriate, at a time when we are engaged in a struggle against international terrorism, we recall that even in our infancy, this country has always had friends and allies from other parts of the world. After two hundred years, the world has gotten smaller and our international allies and coalition partners are essential to our long term success in the difficult times ahead. We should never forget this nation's friends.
