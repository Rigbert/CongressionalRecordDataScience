Chairman, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania and look forward to working with him on this matter and on other important issues in the future.  As a general rule, I, as a Member of Congress, would prefer that all DOE contracts be awarded on a competitive basis, and I believe that the burden of proof should be on the department to justify any sole-source award.  Mr. McDADE. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Smith].
