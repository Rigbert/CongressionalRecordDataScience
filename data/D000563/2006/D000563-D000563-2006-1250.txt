I know the Democratic leader is also aware that two of our colleagues came to the floor yesterday and asked for emergency consideration of measures to deal with this right now, things that could make a difference.  Senator Menendez of New Jersey came to the floor and asked that we have a tax holiday so that the money can be given back to consumers across America that is being charged them now at the pump.  Senator Cantwell of Washington came to the floor and asked for us to consider an antigouging amendment so we can say that if oil companies are found guilty of gouging, they will be asked to pay the price in the courts and through the regulatory agencies.
