President, one of the people who has done the most to protect so much in Vermont is Paul Bruhn. We Vermonters know that Paul, as the executive director of the Preservation Trust, has done an enormous service by leading conservation efforts to save the very best of our State.  I ask unanimous consent that the full article by Virginia Lindauer Simmon, from the April edition of Business People Vermont, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From Business People Vermont, Apr. 2008]Past Perfect: Guiding the Conservation of One of the Country's 11 Most                            Endangered Places                     (By Virginia Lindauer Simmon)       Paul Bruhn hasn't strayed far from his roots. What he has      done is continue to tweak them, to the benefit of us all.       Bruhn is executive director of the Preservation Trust of      Vermont, which he helped to found in 1980. The list of      properties the organization has helped since then--more than      1,500--reads like a compendium of places that make Vermont .      . . well, Vermont.       The organization's story is much broader than preserving      historic structures. The work involves, for example, a      partnership with Mad River Glen to reconstruct and      rehabilitate the single lift chair, an icon of skiing in      Vermont; helping people in Starksboro establish a village      store--so crucial to community life in small towns and      villages; acquiring a geologic site in Isle LaMotte;      encouraging large-scale retailers such as Wal-Mart to      consider building smaller-scale stores in Vermont's      downtowns; underwriting publications that speak to the      Vermont way of life; aiding community-supported agriculture      or a group in Hardwick that, says Bruhn, with contagious      enthusiasm, ``figured out that if you're going to have a good      community and downtown revitalization project, you need a      great small restaurant and pub that serves the entire      community.''       Bruhn's passion for his work makes perfect sense,      especially when it comes to downtowns. He grew up in      Burlington, where his family owned Bruhn Office Equipment on      Church Street--in the same building where Bruhn's office is      today. ``I used to hang out this same window when I was a      little kid watching parades,'' he says.       After graduating from Burlington High School in 1965, Bruhn      studied at Fairleigh Dickinson and the University of Vermont.      ``I left without graduating, and just before they were      probably going to throw me out,'' he says with a grin.       At the time, he was working for the Suburban List community      newspaper and its founders, Proctor and Ruth Page. ``I      started out selling advertising at $25 a week,'' he says,      chuckling. ``I was a reporter and took care of the paper when      they were on vacation. They really gave me my start in      life.''       That start included backing him when he launched Chittenden      Magazine, a monthly publication he poured his life into from      1969 to '73, including mortgaging his house for living      expenses. ``Proc and Ruth backed it for four years, and it      was arguably an artistic success and not a real financial      success.'' He laughs heartily. ``That was my real `college'      education.''       When the magazine folded, Bruhn found work with his friend      Patrick Leahy, the state's attorney for Chittenden County, as      a consumer fraud investigator. A year later, he was tapped to      run Leahy's campaign for the U.S. Senate.       ``That, obviously, was an amazing experience. I went down      to Washington and served as his chief of staff for four      years. I was 27, and fortunately lots of people took me under      their wing and helped me through the intricacies of the      operation of the Senate.''       Bruhn planned on staying two years, but lasted four, during      which his interest in historic preservation grew.       Returning to Vermont in 1978, he went into consulting,      first helping to organize the restoration of the Round Church      in Richmond. In Washington, he had worked with Leahy on      obtaining federal funding for the development of the Church      Street Marketplace. Back home, he helped put together the      campaign for the required local 10 percent match.       When a group he had encountered during the Round Church      project--the Vermont Council of the Society for the      Preservation of New England Antiquities--decided to start a      statewide preservation organization, Bruhn was hired to run      it, ``because I was available and inexpensive,'' he says with      typical humility.       The Vermont Division for Historic Preservation had provided      a good infrastructure for preservation work in the state,      having worked since the early 1970s on the state survey of      historic places. More than 30,000 buildings and numerous      historic districts are on the state register in Vermont, and      10,000 of those are also on the national register.       Grant-making has been a piece of the organization's work      since the early days, starting with small seed grants of $250      to $500. Funding comes from various sources. In the late      1980s, the organization started the Fund for Vermont's Third      Century to encourage people to celebrate the bicentennial in      ways that would last. It ran for four years leading up to and      through Vermont's bicentennial in 1991.       In 1994, a special partnership was developed with the      Freeman Foundation. ``It would be impossible to overstate how      important it's been,'' Bruhn says. ``We're the nudge, the      supporter, the enabler--and are lucky to have partnerships      like this.'' Funding from the Freeman Foundation has provided      grants to more than 300 projects and played a key role in      over $115 million worth of rehabilitation work, he says.       Bruhn's lively, creative mind, good sense of humor, and      ability to inspire affinity have served him well in his      chosen career. James Maxwell, a Brattleboro attorney and a      member of the board of the Brattleboro Arts Initiative, has      seen this first-hand. He was president of the board in 2000-     2001, when the BAI became involved in buying the Latchis      hotel and theater complex.       ``Paul is a man of wide comprehension as to the needs of      downtowns in Vermont, and I would venture to say in the      country as a whole,'' says Maxwell. ``Not only is his      knowledge comprehensive, but he is a feeling human being,      someone who resonates with groups that he works with and is      of incredible assistance, not only in the nuts and bolts of      how you go putting together a deal, but also how you move      things along.       ``He is a congregator. Without getting up on the pulpit and      giving a sermon, he is able to congregate people in a      situation.''       This talent and Bruhn's understanding of the benefit of      being willing to change with the times have helped keep the      organization strong.       He inspired change 10 years ago, when the organization      entered a nationwide competition sponsored by the National      Trust for Historic Preservation and the Mellon Foundation,      seeking ideas on how to improve the delivery of services and      the effectiveness of the historic preservation movement      nationally.       Vermont was one of two states whose submissions were      chosen, says Bruhn. ``We were selected for developing a      program for providing field services, so instead of providing      support to local organizations via telephone calls and some      visiting in the field, we would hire two part-time people who      would spend the vast majority of their time in the field      working with local organizations helping them move their      projects along.''       The Preservation Trust of Vermont received a significant      grant ``It was $170,000, and that was 10 years ago,'' says      Bruhn--which provided full funding the first year, 70 percent      the second year, and 30 percent the final year.       The program so impressed the National Trust, it recently      dedicated a $5 million grant it received to helping other      statewide organizations establish their own field service      programs.       Another big change came, says Bruhn, when Robert Hoehl, the      co-founder of IDX, and his wife, Cindy, purchased the former      Camp Marycrest from the Sisters of Mercy, then donated it to      the Preservation Trust in 1997. ``We had not owned property      prior to that--hadn't dreamed of owning property--but this      was an amazing opportunity.''       The organization gratefully accepted and formed a      partnership with caterer and former restaurateur and      innkeeper Beverly Watson, who leases the property. ``We use      it largely for weddings on weekends during the summer. During      the week, it's used for retreats and training.''       A big turning point was in 1993, when Vermont was named an      endangered state by the National Trust. This brought the      issue of sprawl to the fore. ``We became a much more visible      organization,'' he says, and work very closely with citizen      groups and partners like the Vermont Natural Resources      Council and Smart Growth Vermont on the issue of sprawl and      the negative impact that big-box retailing can have on our      downtowns and village centers and how they change downtowns.      In 2004, the National Trust again named Vermont one of the 11      most endangered places in the nation.       Bruhn was the only staff person early on, and even today,      the staff is small, with the equivalent of four full-time      employees.       The other full-timers are Elise Seraus, the office manager/     administrative assistant, and     Ann Cousins, who splits her hours between field services and      fund raising. Bill Polk, the financial officer, works one day      a week. Eric Gilbertson, who was deputy director of the      Vermont Division for Historic Preservation and recently      retired after almost 30 years, works half time in field      services. Meg Campbell, also half time, manages the facade      easement program, does field services in Bennington County,      manages the Web site, and produces the electronic newsletter.       Because he's been with the organization for so many years,      Bruhn says, ``there are people who say, `Well, the      Preservation Trust, it's just Paul Bruhn.' It's not even      close to that.''       ``I've always had a very strong, very involved board of      directors who provide a lot of the direction for the      organization.'' The directors, he says, genuinely like each      other, are very proud of the organization, ``but that doesn't      stop them from having good disagreements and good debate.''       The secret to keeping a board active and involved, he says,      is to have two-day board meetings four times a year. ``In      February, in the middle of a snowstorm, we went on a two-day      tour around the northern part of the state.'' He counts off      eight towns (and multiple projects within them). ``We talked      all the while on the bus, a great discussion about what's      happening in Vermont, how the community's doing, and this      work--the support we try to give to local organizations.       On the importance of the organization's downtown work,      Bruhn is adamant. ``I love downtown Burlington. I grew up      here, helped secure funding for the Marketplace when I was      working for Sen. Leahy; but downtown Burlington has become      one that focuses on entertainment, high-end retail and      tourism. We get that there are a lot of people in Vermont who      need to be able to shop at a place like Wal-Mart, but      wouldn't it be terrific if Wal-Mart would be interested and      willing to build a smaller-scale store in downtown      Burlington? It would insure that downtown Burlington would      serve the entire community.''       Bruhn pauses and takes a breath. ``We're not in favor of      pickling Vermont,'' he says. ``On the other hand, we've got      to find ways to grow that reinforce what's important about      our place. It's essential that we are good stewards of our      place.''                          ____________________
