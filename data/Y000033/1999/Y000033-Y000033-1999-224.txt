Mr. Speaker, today I would like to salute an outstanding young woman who has been honored with the Girl Scout Gold Award by Farthest North Girl Scout Council in Fairbanks, Alaska. She is: Alisa Pierson.  She is being honored for earning the highest achievement award in United States Girl Scouting. The Girl Scout Gold Award symbolizes outstanding accomplishments in the areas of leadership, community service, career planning and personal development. The award can be earned by young women aged fourteen through seventeen, or in grades nine through twelve.  Girl Scouts of the United States of America, an organization serving over 2.5 million girls, has awarded more than 20,000 Girl Scout Gold Awards to Senior Girl Scouts since the inception of the Gold Award program in 1980. To receive the award, a Girl Scout must earn four interest project patches, the Career Exploration Pin, the Senior Girl Scout Leadership Award and the Girl Scout Challenge Pin, as well as design and implement a Girl Scout Award project. A plan for fulfilling these requirements is created by the Senior Girl Scout and is carried out through close cooperation between the Girl Scout and an adult Girl Scout volunteer.  As a member of the Farthest North Girl Scout Council, Alisa Pierson began working on her Gold Award Project during the summer of 1997. Alisa developed her time management and communication skills and then used them in the community by organizing and arranging a picnic at Alaskaland, an outdoor park in Fairbanks, for the residents of Denali Center, an organization that caters to senior citizens with special needs. She also volunteered her time at Fairbanks Community Hospital where she performed data entry for theBio Medical Maintenance department. As a result of her accomplishments, Alisa developed greater leadership, organizational and planning skills. Her thoughtfulness also contributed widely to Fairbanks and it's surrounding communities. I believe that Alisa should receive the public recognition due to her for these significant services to her community and her country.                          ____________________
