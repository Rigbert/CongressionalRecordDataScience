Madam Speaker, Anita Smith is a woman who has made a remarkable and lasting contribution to the global battle against HIV/AIDS, who along with her husband, Shepherd, was instrumental in rallying the faith-based community--in particular, evangelical Christians--to the cause.  She has been heralded as an ``early voice'' within the Christian community calling for the need to bring God's love and tangible assistance to those stricken by a disease which all too often--particularly in the developing world--led to a wasting away of the body, a social ostracism and a lonely death.  Anita began her HIV/AIDS work in 1986 with Americans for a Sound AIDS/HIV Policy, which became the Children's AIDS Fund in 1996. Vulnerable children were a special focus of her ministry, and to give one example of that, in one year alone her Holiday Gift Program sent over 10,000 presents to AIDS-impacted kids living here in the United States.  Knowing that the call to be one's brother's keeper knows no boundries, Anita expanded her work overseas, particularly to Africa. Having become the President of Children's AIDS Fund International--or CAFl--in 1996, she opened CAFI's first clinic in Africa in 2002. Ultimately she established fifteen clinics in Uganda, South Africa, Zambia and Malawi.  Serving along with Louis Sullivan as the co-chair of President George W. Bush's President's Advisory Council for HIV/AIDS from 2002 to 2006, Anita was also there--and a tenacious advocate--when President Bush undertook one of his greatest lifeworks, the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. Anita was not only instrumental in garnering Christian support for PEPFAR, but in many respects helped lead the way, as her Africa work was already a shining example of how the faith-based community was effectively responding to the global pandemic.  At that time I was serving as chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Africa and Global Health subcommittee, and I saw first hand Anita's passion, wisdom, efficacy and commitment. Hers was the voice of wise counsel and compassion, which helped guide not only the White House, USAID and Congress but my subcommittee as well as we oversaw the work of PEPFAR and USAID.  In 2006, my wife Marie and I joined Anita and Shepherd and Marilyn and Ray Ruddy on a trip to Uganda and we saw firsthand how her work was helping to prevent HIV for many while bringing healing and hope to those infected.  Today, those clinics which Anita founded serve over 100,000 HIV patients. Anita's clinics have had a reputation for the high retention of patients, high engagement of males--which is oftentimes a hard-to-reach segement of the population in Africa--high adherence to courses of medication treatment and high morale.  In sum, more than simply being an early voice, Anita's was a powerful voice which consistently responded ``Here I am, Lord,''--I am available--when she heard the appeal ``Whom shall I send?''  Anita's lifework is an exemplification of Matthew 25--``when I was sick you looked after me.''  Anita Smith is an amazing hero in the global fight against HIV/AIDS.  Thank you--I say again thank you--Anita.                          ____________________
