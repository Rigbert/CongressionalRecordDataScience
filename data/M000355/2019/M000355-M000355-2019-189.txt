 The Kentucky New Era newspaper recently marked 150 years of quality journalism and community engagement, and I would like to take a moment today to review the paper's distinguished history and celebrate its many achievements.  Prominent Kentucky newsman Chip Hutcheson, whom I am proud to call a dear friend, spent years working for the New Era, and he summed up the reason it has thrived for so long. Chip recalled a paper-wide culture of writing ``columns that cemented readers' relationships to the writer and the paper.'' I think it is that commitment to readers and to what matters in their lives and community that has helped make the New Era the oldest business in Hopkinsville, KY.  Since the paper was launched as a weekly publication in the winter of 1869, the New Era has certainly undergone some change to solidify its relationship with readers. To meet a demand for local, State, and national news, the New Era added a daily issue, and delivered the news and commentary its subscribers wanted to read. Part of that frequent change during the early years came in the form of different owners, but in 1873, Hunter Wood took charge, and his family would steer the New Era as majority owners for the following 130-plus years.  Under their direction, the paper covered a wide range of issues affecting life in Christian County. From politics to agriculture, mixed with lighter community-interest pieces and extensive coverage of high school sports, the New Era has served as a important source of information for its readers. Its staffwould attract several award-winning journalists, including my friend Mary D. Ferguson, who held a high standard on its pages.  Adapting to changing markets, the New Era expanded its operations. To serve the nearby U.S. Army installation, the paper's media group began publishing the Fort Campbell Courier. Other respected local papers, including the Princeton Times Leader, the Providence Journal Enterprise, and Dawson Springs Progress, joined the New Era's organization to further stretch the reach of its community journalism. In whatever form subscribers want to receive their news--in print, online, or even listening to a podcast--the New Era is committed to reporting on the stories that must be told.  Just last year, the paper joined another well-respected Kentucky news institution, the Paxton Media Group. With this partnership, the Kentucky New Era has the ability to continue thriving into the future. Through the years, I have enjoyed reading the paper and speaking with its top-tier professionals, and I look forward to many more accomplishments to come.  It is a privilege to congratulate the Kentucky New Era on its celebration of 150 years of journalistic success, and I hope my Senate colleagues will join me in saluting this community institution on its anniversary. I would like to extend my best wishes to the reporters, editors, and staff who have made the New Era a vital resource in west Kentucky.                          ____________________
