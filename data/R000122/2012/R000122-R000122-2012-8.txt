President, I want to touch on a topic that was discussed by many of my colleagues, including Senator Whitehouse; and that is the fisheries disaster in the Northeast, which was declared by the Secretary of Commerce in 2012. There is language and support in the supplemental appropriations bill to help our fishing industry in the Northeast that has been affected by this disaster in the areas of New York, Connecticut, and Rhode Island.  These fishermen have been for years under a painful regime of restricted fishing so that the stock could be replenished. Despite their efforts, some of the fishing stock has not responded, leading to a declaration of a fisheries disaster by the Secretary of Commerce.  The funding that is included in the supplemental applies to New England, but it also helps Alaska and Mississippi. I appreciate very much the fact that Senator Mikulski is working to include this funding in the bill. She is an extraordinary leader in our Senate, an extraordinary and compassionate leader when it comes to issues affecting the fishing industry, not just in her home area of the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic but as far away as Alaska and Rhode Island and Maine. I would hope we could move to help these fishermen get on with their lives with this assistance.  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
