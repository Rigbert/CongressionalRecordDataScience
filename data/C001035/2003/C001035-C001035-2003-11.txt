She certainly continues that proud tradition in Alaska of women who have made a real difference. I am honored to serve with her. She does an extraordinary job. I also think we would be remiss in not recognizing the contributions of our Presiding Officer today, the Senator from North Carolina, Mrs. Dole, who also has established so many firsts in American history. I know that she, too, will be prominently featured in this museum once it comes about.  I think we can take great pride in being here tonight and knowing we have passed this legislation unanimously.  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
