Mr. Speaker, though the Congress is naturally focused and preoccupied with the historic process of reform, we should not ignore what is going on in the world. As you all know, President Yeltsin has sent the Russian Army to subdue the self-proclaimed Chechen Republic, which declared independence in 1991 under the leadership of former Soviet Air Force Gen. Djokar Dudaev.  Last Thursday, I had a meeting with Dr. Elena Bonner, widow of Andrei Sakharov and president of the Sakharov Foundation. She recently resigned from President Yeltsin's Human Rights Commission to protest the military campaign in Chechnya, which she has described as a step on the road back to totalitarianism. Dr. Bonner urged the U.S. Congress to do whatever it can to help resolve the Chechen crisis peacefully.  Mr. Speaker, Chechnya's desire for independence from Russia raises questions that are indeed difficult and troubling. The international community [[Page H154]] has not defined the limits and framework of self-determination, and has, in fact, shied away from this vexing issue, which many Governments view as threatening. Moreover, there is reason for concern about the potential breakup of the Russian Federation, which could follow a successful Chechen bid for independence. But, whatever one thinks about self-determination and its possible consequences, the Russian military action has been characterized by indiscriminate shelling and bombing of civilian targets, including apartment buildings, hotels, a chemical plant, stores, and even a hospital and an orphanage. By all accounts, thousands of men, women, and children have been killed or mutilated.  Mr. Speaker, the massive killing and maiming of noncombatants are a gross violation of human rights, as even most Russian political leaders have recognized, and can hardly be considered an ``internal matter,'' as the Clinton administration has characterized it. John Maresca, former U.S. Ambassador to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, succinctly summed up the dire situation in a recent Wall Street Journal article:       The Russians' use of brutal force in Chechnya, such as      massive bombing of a population center, has no place in      today's world, whether used against an enemy or on a segment      of a state's own population * * *. Moreover, Russia's      military actions are unlikely to resolve the problem. More      likely is that these actions will prompt a long and bitter      guerrilla war which will be a further drain on Russia's      limited finances and political energies.  Mr. Speaker, General Dudaev has stated his willingness to negotiate with Moscow, though President Yeltsin seems determined to wipe out all resistance by force. As Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, I urge the Russian Government to stop the killing, and initiate serious, meaningful negotiations with the Chechen authorities. On Thursday, January 12, the Permanent Council of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe will meet in Vienna. I urge Moscow to follow through on the willingness it has indicated to let the OSCE help resolve this crisis, to use the OSCE as a framework for political dialog, and to accept an OSCE mission in Chechnya.  The U.S. Government, for its part, should convey to Moscow that the eradication of a people and its territory is not an ``internal matter,'' and that pursuing a military solution in Chechnya--which has shown little evidence or prospect of success--could well lead to an immitigated regional disaster.                              {time}  1440
