President, this morning, due to flight delays, I missed the rollcall vote on the confirmation of William Lindsay Osteen, Jr., to be U.S. District Judge for the Middle District of North Carolina. Had I been present for this vote, I would have voted to confirm this nomination.                          ____________________
