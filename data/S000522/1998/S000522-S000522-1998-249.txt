Mr. Speaker, last week the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary heard testimony in support of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe's Fiscal Year 1999 budget request. In my written submission for the committee, I shared portions of a poignant letter I recently received from the National Director of the Union of Councils of Soviet Jews, Micah Natfalin. Mr. Naftalin's words and observations are well said and heartfelt, and frankly, he reflects observations about the Commission and its work that many NGOs and public policy analysts have shared with me over the years.  The Commission is aggressive in pursuing its mandate to monitor and encourage compliance with the Helsinki Accords. Through its hearings, public briefings, bilateral communications and encouraging strong statements by the U.S. delegation at OSCE meeting, the Commission encourages compliance through public diplomacy and suasion. The Commission's work is significantly enhanced by the diligent work of non-governmental organizations both here in the United States and in the field. The commitment and effectiveness of the Commission and the staff which are expressed in this letter from the Union of Councils speaks for themselves. Mr. Speaker, these complimentary words about the work of the Commission and particularly the expertise of the staff are not uncommon. For the record, I would like to share excerpts from the March 10 letter.       The Union of Councils for Soviet Jews has been a close      observer of the Commission's work since its inception. . . .      In the vast desert of policy and think tank meetings, largely      concerned with questions of economics, military defense, and      environmental protection, the Helsinki Commission stands as      the single oasis where those concerned with human rights, and      especially the grassroots efforts to support common citizens      in their quest to hold their national and local governments      accountable to the standards of democracy, rule of law and a      civil society, can invariably receive a responsive and      understanding hearing.       The power and moral influence of the Helsinki Commission      lies in the commitment of its entirely bi-partisan membership      in the House and Senate. Its strength and the quality of its      assessments derive from one of the most dedicated and      professionally expert staffs I have encountered since I was a      Congressional staff member in the early 1960s. . . . The      Helsinki Commission's high standard of quality tends to      obscure the limitations in its scope and reach. While it is      difficult to measure quantifiably the opportunities thus      lost, those of us in the human rights community can attest      that the success of your work demands greater resources. No      other institution can match the Helsinki Commission. It would      seem incumbent on the Congress to strengthen your ability to      expand the staff, which is your most precious resource.                               ____________________
