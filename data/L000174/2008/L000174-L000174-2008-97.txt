President, I will just leave with this: Let's make sure the Congress--especially this Senate--takes steps, as the other body did, to make it easier for the public to know not all the things the Government wants them to know but the times when our Government has made mistakes, the times when our Government has not followed the law, the times when our Government has tried to give disinformation. We are a stronger nation if we know the truth. We are a weaker nation if our laws allow the truth to be shielded from the American people. I trust the American people. I trust the American people to question our Government. I trust the American people to be able to handle the information. I do not trust those who would try to use every barrier to keep that information from the American people.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.      Media Coalition Supporting the Free Flow of Information Act                                                    July 21, 2008.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Russell Bldg., U.S.          Senate, Washington, DC.     Re: S. 2035--The Free Flow of Information Act.       Dear Chairman Leahy: On behalf of the men and women across      the country who work to bring the American people vital news      and information, we, the undersigned media companies and      organizations, thank you for your support and co-sponsorship      of S. 2035, the Free Flow of Information Act. Your leadership      in support of this bill has been invaluable in fighting to      ensure that the American public has access to news and      information about their government and the institutions that      affect their daily lives. Protecting confidential sources      through federal legislation has broad support on both sides      of the aisle, in both chambers of Congress, and from state      attorneys general across the nation.       The legislation is vitally important to the national      interest, an informed citizenry, and a free and vibrant      press. As you know last October, S. 2035 was favorably      reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on a strong      15-4 bipartisan vote and is supported by the presumptive      Republican and Democrat presidential nominees, Sens. John      McCain and Barack Obama. A similar shield bill (H.R. 2102)      passed by an overwhelming 398-21 vote.       Chairman Leahy, we appreciate your leadership and      respectfully request that you do whatever you can to make      sure that S. 2035 is approved by the Senate, without any      further amendments that would weaken the well-reasoned      protections in the bill.
