Speaker, President George Bush, in creating fear about terrorists in the American people rather than understanding, often says, ``If we don't fight terrorists over there, we will have to fight them right here.'' He never bothers to explain in detail who the terrorists are or what motivates them or how his policies are creating more of them. The President's explanations are too simplistic, and they are wrong.  The President tried to convince us if we got Saddam Hussein and brought him to justice the battle for peace in the Middle East would take a favorable turn. Indeed, the opposite has happened as Iraq descends into chaos. Indeed, despite the military firmness and bravery of our soldiers, the Iraq war has actually failed politically by failing to win the hearts and minds of the people.  Equally bad, the Iraq war has strengthened Iran and those loyal to it. By removing Saddam Hussein as a counterweight to Iran, President Bush has left a vacuum now being filled by increasingly radicalized Shia populations and disillusioned Sunnis. The Shia and Kurd factions inside Iraq and the outnumbered Sunnis are now at one another's throats. Great instability is being created in a region where rising religious fundamentalism, unleashed by Saddam's ouster, is the glue that is binding a rising revolution of expectations by formerly suppressed populations.  The President's own White House was forced this week to declassify an intelligence report that I am going to put in the Record. This is a summary, called ``Trends in Global Terrorism, a National Intelligence Estimate,'' and this report says the Iraq war is shaping a new generation of terrorists.  Anyone who knows anything about what is causing rising levels of hatred against the United States in the Middle East would have anticipated this eventuality. The key question the President and we must address and face is, why do his policies yield more and more terrorists who want to harm us, and harm us in many places beyond the boundaries of Iraq and Afghanistan?  The complete story will show terrorists will continue to plot ways to harm America because more than wanting to come here, although some of them are capable of doing that, they want America and American influence out of their countries and regions. They want us out of there more than they want to come here.  Rather than striking fear in the American people, the President ought to do more to explain the forces creating this anti-American and anti-Western sentiment across those troubled regions. Which American interests have caused this antagonism to our Nation? An important question to answer. In what countries has this hatred been fomented? Another important question to answer. And what is the face there of America that is hated more and more?  Let me suggest part of that face involves U.S. oil alliances in cahoots with some of the most repressive and brutal regimes and leaders who hold down the potential of their own people. There is not a democracy over there, and we are totally reliant on all of those oil kingdoms.  Let me suggest that the presence of U.S. military bases that ensure the status quo of those repressive regimes doesn't help.  Let me suggest America is hated more because we are not viewed as being evenhanded at arriving at fair and just peace settlements between Israel and the Palestinians and their neighbors. We need to do a better job of cultivating evenhanded diplomacy in the region.  Let me suggest our U.S. popular culture and many of its excesses are regarded as abhorrent to the fundamentalist legions that have gained even greater ascendancy after the disgusting and outrageous behavior by Americans at Abu Ghraib.  Let me suggest the U.S. now is being viewed by the multitudes of Muslims as fighting a religious war against Islam. President Bush made a huge blunder at the start of the Iraqi war by calling it a Crusade hearkening back to the Christian wars. His battle cry gaffe echoed across the Muslim world and became a rallying point for the opposition. How tragic and inappropriate.  Let me quote from a wise American voice who tries to enlighten about the roots of terrorism, rather than strike fear in our people:  Robert Baer, author of best selling book See No Evil, is a decorated CIA agent who put his life on the line for our Nation for three decades. He tries to build understanding about the conditions giving rise to terrorism. He defines our problem as larger than just a few men--like Bin Laden and Hussein--and their followers. He argues the reason animosity is growing against the U.S. is the result of much larger forces spanning several decades. To name but one element of the challenge we face--he discusses the Muslim Brotherhood.       The Muslim Brotherhood was an amorphous, dangerous,      unpredictable movement that shook every government in the      Middle East to its bones. Founded by an Egyptian, Hasan Al-     Banna, in 1929 it was dedicated to bringing the Kingdom of      God to earth. The Egyptian Muslim Brothers had unsuccessfully      tried to kill Egyptian President Abdul Nasser. The Syrian      branch had tried to kill Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad a      couple of times. In 1982, its followers seized Hama, a      historic city in central Syria, provoking Asad into shelling      them and Hama into the next life.       The Muslim Brothers are also distant cousins of the Wahabis      of Saudia Arabia, the most puritanical sect in Islam.      Underwritten by the Saudi royal family, the Wahabis spawned      Osama bin Laden. They also served as the inspiration for the      Taliban in Afghanistan and other radical Sunni movements.      Many Muslims consider the Wahabis dangerous because they      adopted the beliefs of Ibn Taymiyah, a 14th century Islamic      scholar who condoned political assassination. Al-Jihad, the      Egyptian fundamentalist who murdered Egyptian President Anwar      Sadat relied on Ibn Taymiyah as justification for what they      did.  Understanding the forces that generate terrorism is fundamental for solving it. The National Intelligence Report summarizes some of the essential steps our Nation must take to broaden our understanding of what it will take to break our dependence on oil regimes, resolve peace settlements that have been let languish, and form alliances that are broadly representative and democratic in their focus. The world needs more understanding, not fear, to counter terrorism.  Mr. Speaker, I am very sorry that my time is out. I will continue tomorrow with an additional statement including complementary remarks about thebook ``See No Evil'' by Robert Baer that gets the picture right.  The NIE report I referred to earlier is as follows:      National Intelligence Estimate--Trends in Global Terrorism:                    Implications for the United States   Declassified Key Judgments of the National Intelligence Estimate   ``Trends in Global Terrorism: Implications for the United States''                             dated April 2006       Key Judgments: United States-led counterterrorism efforts      have seriously damaged the leadership of al-Qa'ida and      disrupted its operations; however, we judge that al-Qa'ida      will continue to pose the greatest threat to the Homeland and      U.S. interests abroad by a single terrorist organization. We      also assess that the global jihadist movement--which includes      al-Qa'ida, affiliated and independent terrorist groups, and      emerging networks and cells--is spreading and adapting to      counterterrorism efforts.       Although we cannot measure the extent of the spread with      precision, a large body of all-source reporting indicates      that activists identifying themselves as jihadists, although      a small percentage of Muslims, are increasing in both number      and geographic dispersion.       If this trend continues, threats to U.S. interests at home      and abroad will become more diverse, leading to increasing      attacks worldwide.       Greater pluralism and more responsive political systems in      Muslim majority nations would alleviate some of the      grievances jihadists exploit. Over time, such progress,      together with sustained, multifaceted programs targeting the      vulnerabilities of the jihadist movement and continued      pressure on al-Qa'ida, could erode support for the jihadists.       We assess that the global jihadist movement is      decentralized, lacks a coherent global strategy, and is      becoming more diffuse. New jihadist networks and cells, with      anti-American agendas, are increasingly likely to emerge. The      confluence of shared purpose and dispersed actors will make      it harder to find and undermine jihadist groups.       We assess that the operational threat from self-radicalized      cells will grow in importance to U.S. counterterrorism      efforts, particularly abroad but also in the Homeland.       The jihadists regard Europe as an important venue for      attacking Western interests. Extremist networks inside the      extensive Muslim diasporas in Europe facilitate recruitment      and staging for urban attacks, as illustrated by the 2004      Madrid and 2005 London bombings.       We assess that the Iraq jihad is shaping a new generation      of terrorist leaders and operatives; perceived jihadist      success there would inspire more fighters to continue the      struggle elsewhere.       The Iraq conflict has become the ``cause celebre'' for      jihadists, breeding a deep resentment of U.S. involvement in      the Muslim world and cultivating supporters for the global      jihadist movement. Should jihadists leaving Iraq perceive      themselves, and be perceived, to have failed, we judge fewer      fighters will be inspired to carry on the fight.       We assess that the underlying factors fueling the spread of      the movement outweigh its vulnerabilities and are likely to      do so for the duration of the timeframe of this Estimate.       Four underlying factors are fueling the spread of the      jihadist movement: (1) Entrenched grievances, such as      corruption, injustice, and fear of Western domination,      leading to anger, humiliation, and a sense of powerlessness;      (2) the Iraq ``jihad;'' (3) the slow pace of real and      sustained economic, social, and political reforms in many      Muslim majority nations; and (4) pervasive anti-U.S.      sentiment among most Muslims--all of which jihadists exploit.       Concomitant vulnerabilities in the jihadist movement have      emerged that, if fully exposed and exploited, could begin to      slow the spread of the movement. They include dependence on      the continuation of Muslim-related conflicts, the limited      appeal of the jihadists' radical ideology, the emergence of      respected voices of moderation, and criticism of the violent      tactics employed against mostly Muslim citizens.       The jihadists' greatest vulnerability is that their      ultimate political solution--an ultra-conservative      interpretation of shari'a-based governance spanning the      Muslim world--is unpopular with the vast majority of Muslims.      Exposing the religious and political straitjacket that is      implied by the jihadists' propaganda would help to divide      them from the audiences they seek to persuade.       Recent condemnations of violence and extremist religious      interpretations by a few notable Muslim clerics signal a      trend that could facilitate the growth of a constructive      alternative to jihadist ideology: peaceful political      activism. This also could lead to the consistent and dynamic      participation of broader Muslim communities in rejecting      violence, reducing the ability of radicals to capitalize on      passive community support. In this way, the Muslim mainstream      emerges as the most powerful weapon in the war on terror.       Countering the spread of the jihadist movement will require      coordinated multilateral efforts that go well beyond      operations to capture or kill terrorist leaders.       If democratic reform efforts in Muslim majority nations      progress over the next five years, political participation      probably would drive a wedge between intransigent extremists      and groups willing to use the political process to achieve      their local objectives. Nonetheless, attendant reforms and      potentially destabilizing transitions will create new      opportunities for jihadists to exploit.       Al-Qa'ida, now merged with Abu Mus'ab al-Zarqawi's network,      is exploiting the situation in Iraq to attract new recruits      and donors and to maintain its leadership role.       The loss of key leaders, particularly Usama bin Ladin,      Ayman al-Zawahiri, and al-Zarqawi, in rapid succession,      probably would cause the group to fracture into smaller      groups. Although like-minded individuals would endeavor to      carry on the mission, the loss of these key leaders would      exacerbate strains and disagreements. We assess that the      resulting splinter groups would, at least for a time, pose a      less serious threat to U.S. interests than does al-Qa'ida.       Should al-Zarqawi continue to evade capture and scale back      attacks against Muslims, we assess he could broaden his      popular appeal and present a global threat.       The increased role of Iraqis in managing the operations of      al-Qa'ida in Iraq might lead veteran foreign jihadists to      focus their efforts on external operations.       Other affiliated Sunni extremist organizations, such as      Jemaah Islamiya, Ansar al-Sunnah, and several North African      groups, unless countered, are likely to expand their reach      and become more capable of multiple and/or mass-casualty      attacks outside their traditional areas of operation.       We assess that such groups pose less of a danger to the      Homeland than does al-Qa'ida but will pose varying degrees of      threat to our allies and to U.S. interests abroad. The focus      of their attacks is likely to ebb and flow between local      regime targets and regional or global ones.       We judge that most jihadist groups--both well-known and      newly formed--will use improvised explosive devices and      suicide attacks focused primarily on soft targets to      implement their asymmetric warfare strategy, and that they      will attempt to conduct sustained terrorist attacks in urban      environments. Fighters with experience in Iraq are a      potential source of leadership for jihadists pursuing these      tactics.       CBRN capabilities will continue to be sought by jihadist      groups.       While Iran, and to a lesser extent Syria, remain the most      active state sponsors of terrorism, many other states will be      unable to prevent territory or resources from being exploited      by terrorists.       Anti-U.S. and anti-globalization sentiment is on the rise      and fueling other radical ideologies. This could prompt some      leftist, nationalist, or separatist groups to adopt terrorist      methods to attack U.S. interests. The radicalization process      is occurring more quickly, more widely, and more anonymously      in the Internet age, raising the likelihood of surprise      attacks by unknown groups whose members and supporters may be      difficult to pinpoint.       We judge that groups of all stripes will increasingly use      the Internet to communicate, propagandize, recruit, train,      and obtain logistical and financial support.                          ____________________
