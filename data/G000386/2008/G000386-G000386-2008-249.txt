 President, I am pleased to introduce the Medicare Rural Health Access Improvement Act of 2008.  The purpose of this legislation is to continue ongoing efforts to ensure that Americans in rural areas have access to health care services. Much has been done in the past to improve access to rural providers such as hospitals and doctors. Much more still needs to be done.  I hold town meetings in each of the 99 counties in the great State of Iowa every year. As many know, Iowa is largely a rural State, and a significant concern that I consistently hear during these meetings is the difficulty my constituents experience in accessing health care services. As the former chairman and currently the ranking member of the Finance Committee, it has, therefore, been a priority for me to improve the availability of health care in rural areas.  In Iowa, as in many rural areas across the country, hospitals are oftennot only the sole provider of health care in rural areas, but also employers and purchasers in the community. Moreover, the presence of a hospital is essential for purposes of economic development because businesses check to see if a hospital is in the community in which they might set up shop. As you can see, it is vital that these institutions are able to keep their doors open.  In previous legislation, Congress has been able to improve the financial viability of rural hospitals. For instance, the creation and subsequent improvements to the Critical Access Hospital designation has greatly improved the financial health of certain small rural hospitals and ensured that community residents have access to health care.  However, there are still a group of rural hospitals that need help. I am referring to what are known as ``tweener'' hospitals, which are too large to be Critical Access Hospitals, but too small to be financially viable under the Medicare hospital prospective payment systems. These facilities are struggling to stay afloat despite their tireless efforts. Like in many communities across the country, the staff of tweener hospitals and their community residents take great pride in the quality of care at these facilities. I have heard countless stories of the exemplary work tweener hospitals in Iowa perform not only as providers of essential health care, but also as responsible members of their communities. It is for this reason that many provisions in this bill are intended to improve the financial health of tweener hospitals and ensure that people have access to health care.  Most tweener hospital are currently designated as Medicare Dependent Hospitals and Sole Community Hospitals under the Medicare program. There are provisions, both temporary and permanent, included in this bill that would improve Medicare payments for both types of hospitals. This includes improvements to the payment methodologies so that inpatient payments to these facilities would better reflect the costs they incur in providing care. Improvements are also proposed in this bill to Medicare hospital outpatient payments for both Medicare Dependent Hospitals and Sole Community Hospitals so they would both share the benefit of hold harmless payments and add-on payments.  Also, a major driver of the financial difficulties that tweener hospitals face is the fact that many have relatively low volumes of inpatient admissions. This bill would improve the existing low-volume add-on payment for hospitals so that more rural facilities with low volumes would receive the assistance they desperately need.  Over the years, many have commented that it is simply unfair for many rural hospitals to receive only a limited amount of Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital, or DSH, payments while many urban hospitals are not subject to such a cap. This bill would eliminate the cap for DSH payments for those rural hospitals for a 2-year period.  There are also other provisions that would continue to help rural hospitals. The rural flexibility program would be extended for an additional year. Certain rural hospitals that are paid on a cost basis for the outpatient laboratory services they provide would continue to do so on a permanent basis. And Critical Access Hospitals that provide outpatient laboratory services would be paid 101 percent of their costs regardless of whether the specimen was collected from a patient of the CAH or whether the specimen was collected in a skilled nursing facility or clinic associated with the CAH.  This legislation also seeks to improve incentives for physicians located in rural areas and increase beneficiaries' access to rural health care providers. It includes provisions designed to reduce inequitable disparities in physician payment resulting from the Geographic Practice Cost Indices, or adjusters, known as GPCIs. Medicare payment for physician services varies from one area to another based on the geographic adjustments for a particular area. Geographic adjustments are intended to reflect cost differences in a given area compared to a national average of 1.0 so that an area with costs above the national average would have an index greater than 1.0, and an area below the national average would have an index less than 1.0. There are currently three geographic adjustments: for physician work, practice expense, and malpractice expense.  Unfortunately, the existing geographic adjusters result in significant disparities in physician reimbursement which penalize, rather than equalize, physician payment in Iowa and other rural states. These geographic disparities in payment lead to rural states experiencing significant difficulties in recruiting and retaining physicians and other health care professionals due to their significantly lower reimbursement rates.  These disparities have perverse effects when it comes to realigning Medicare payment to reward quality of care. Let me put that into context. Iowa is widely recognized as providing some of the highest quality health care in the country yet Iowa physicians receive some of the lowest Medicare reimbursement due to these inequitable geographic adjustments. Medicare reimbursement for some procedures is at least 30 percent lower in Iowa than payment for those very procedures in other parts of the country. That is a significant disincentive for Iowa physicians who are providing some of the best quality care in the country, and it is fundamentally unfair. Congress needs to reduce these disparities in payment and focus on rewarding physicians who provide high quality care.  The inequitable geographic payment formulas have also exacerbated the problems that rural areas face in terms of access to health care. Rural America today has far fewer physicians per capita than urban areas. The GPCI formulas are a dismal failure in promoting an adequate supply of physicians in States such as Iowa, and more severe physician shortages in rural areas are predicted in the future.  The legislation I am introducing today makes changes in the GPCI formulas for work and practice expense to reverse this trend. It establishes a 1.0 floor for the physician work and practice expense adjustments. It also revises the calculation of the work and practice expense formulas to reduce payment differences and more accurately compensate physicians in rural areas for their true practice costs. We must act now to help rural States recruit and retain more physicians so that beneficiaries will continue to have access to needed health care.  Congress has previously enacted a number of other provisions to improve Medicare payment for health care professionals and providers in rural areas that will expire soon. This bill extends the five percent incentive payments for primary care and specialty physicians in scarcity areas through December 2009. It also extends the existing payment arrangements which allow independent laboratories to bill Medicare directly for certain physician pathology services.  The bill includes several new provisions to improve beneficiary access to health care services. It increases rural ambulance payments by 5 percent for the next 18 months. It permanently increases the payment limits for rural health clinics. It allows hospital-based renal dialysis centers and skilled nursing facilities to provide telehealth services. It also allows physician assistants to order post-hospital extended care services and to serve hospice patients.  Finally, the bill would protect rural areas from being adversely affected by the new Medicare competitive bidding program for durable medical equipment. It would ensure that home medical equipment suppliers who provide equipment and services in rural areas and small metropolitan statistical areas, MSAs, with a population of 600,000 or less can continue to serve the Medicare program by exempting these areas from competitive bidding. We must ensure that rural areas continue to have medical equipment suppliers available to serve beneficiaries in these areas.  Mr. President, as you can see, we still have much to do when it comes to ensuring access to health care in rural America. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important matter.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a summary of the bill.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          Medicare Rural Health Access Improvement Act of 2008             Title I--Provisions Relating to Medicare Part A      Section 101. Extension of Medicare Rural Hospital          Flexibility Grant Program.        Current Law        Presently, the Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Grant      Program is authorized for $35 million from FY2005 through      FY2008.        Explanation of Provision        The provision would extend this grant program through      FY2009.      Section 102. Improvements to the Medicare Dependent Hospital          (MDH) Program.        Current Law        MDHs are small rural hospitals with a high proportion of      patients who are Medicare beneficiaries (have at least 60% of      acute inpatient days or discharges attributable to Medicare      in FY1987 or in two of the three most recently audited cost      reporting periods). An MDH cannot be a Sole Community      Hospital (SCH) and must have 100 or fewer beds. Until October      1, 2006, MDHs were paid at the wage-adjusted national      standardized amount or, if higher, 50% of their adjusted      FY1982 or FY1987 hospital specific costs. Starting for      discharges on October 1, 2006, an MDH would be able to elect      payments based on its FY2002 hospital specific costs if that      would result in higher Medicare payments. Also, starting for      discharges on October 1, 2006, an MDH that elected to be paid      using its hospital-specific costs would have its payments      based on 75% of those costs.        Explanation of Provision        Starting for discharges on October 1, 2008 until October      1, 2011, an MDH that elects to be paid using the national      standardized amount would not have that per discharge payment      amount adjusted by an area wage adjustment unless such      adjustment will result in improved payments to the MDH.      Starting for discharges on October 1, 2008 until October 1,      2011, those MDHs would have their payments based on 85% of      their hospital specific costs.      Section 103. Rebasing for Sole Community Hospitals (SCHs).        Current Law        Medicare payments to SCHs for inpatient hospital services      are made on the basis of the federal per discharge payment      amount or on the basis of its updated hospital-specific per      discharge amount from FY1982, FY1987, or FY1996, whichever      would result in the largest payment.        Explanation of Provision        Starting for discharges on October 1, 2008, SCHs would be      able to elect payment based on their FY2002 hospital-specific      payment amount per discharge. This amount would be increased      by the annual update starting in FY2008.      Section 104. Temporary Improvements to the Medicare          Inpatient Hospital Payment Adjustment for Low-volume          Hospitals.        Current Law        Under Medicare's Inpatient Prospective Payment System      (IPPS), certain low-volume hospitals receive a payment      adjustment to account for their higher costs per discharge. A      low volume hospital is defined as an acute care hospital that      is located more than 25 road miles from another comparable      hospital and that has less than 800 total discharges during      the fiscal year. Under current law, the Secretary is required      to determine an appropriate percentage increase for these      low-volume hospitals based on the empirical relationship      between the standardized cost-per-case for such hospitals and      their total discharges to account for the additional      incremental costs (if any) that are associated with such      number of discharges. The low-volume adjustment is limited to      no more than 25 percent. Accordingly, under regulations,      qualifying hospitals (those located more than 25 road miles      from another comparable hospital) with less than 200 total      discharges receive a 25% payment increase for every Medicare      discharge.        Explanation of Provision        This provision would make a temporary adjustment that      would provide payments in FY2009 and FY2010 to more low-     volume hospitals. A low-volume hospital could be located more      than 15 road miles from another comparable hospital and have      2,000 discharges of individuals entitled to or enrolled for      Medicare Part A benefits. The Secretary would determine the      applicable percentage increase using a linear sliding scale      ranging from 25% for low-volume hospitals below a certain      threshold to no adjustment for hospitals with greater than      2,000 discharges of individuals with Medicare Part A      benefits.      Section 105. Temporarily Lifting the Disproportionate Share          Hospital (DSH) Adjustment Cap.        Current Law        Medicare will increase its payments to hospitals that      qualify for a DSH adjustment. In many instances, the size of      a hospital's DSH adjustment will depend upon the number of      patient days provided to poor Medicare patients or Medicaid      patients (DSH patient share). However, small urban hospitals      and many rural hospitals have their DSH adjustment capped at      12%.        Explanation of Provision        The provision would eliminate the DSH adjustment cap for      these hospitals for discharges occurring in FY2009 and      FY2010. For discharges on or after October 1, 20010, the DSH      adjustment cap would revert to 12%.            Title II--Provisions Relating to Medicare Part B      Section 201. Extension and Expansion of the Medicare          Hospital Outpatient Department Hold Harmless Provision          for Small Rural Hospitals.        Current Law        Small rural hospitals (with no more than 100 beds) that      are not Sole Community Hospitals (SCHs) can receive      additional Medicare payments if their outpatient payments      under the prospective payment system are less than under the      prior reimbursement system. For CY2006, these hospitals will      receive 95% of the difference between payments under the      prospective payment system and those that would have been      made under the prior reimbursement system. The hospitals will      receive 90% of the difference in CY2007 and 85% of the      difference in CY2008.        Explanation of Provision        The provision would establish that in CY 2009 and CY 2010,      small rural hospitals, including Medicare Dependent Hospitals      and SCHs, would receive 100% of the difference between      payments made under the Medicare Hospital Outpatient      Prospective Payment System and those made under the prior      reimbursement system.      Section 202. Expansion of the Medicare Hospital Outpatient          Department Add-on Payment for Rural Sole Community          Hospitals (SCHs).        Current Law        Under Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and      Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), the Secretary was required      to study to determine whether the costs incurred by rural      hospitals were greater than urban hospitals and whether the      prospective payment system (PPS) for hospital outpatient      departments (HOPD) accounted for those cost differences. The      Secretary was authorized to provide a payment adjustment for      rural hospitals by January 1, 2006 if such an adjustment was      warranted. Starting in CY2006, rural SCHs have had their      Medicare payments for outpatient services increased by 7.1%.        Explanation of Provision        This provision would establish that the Secretary's      authority to provide a payment adjustment would apply to      services furnished in 2006, 2007 and 2008. The Medicare      statute would be amended so that SCHs and Medicare Dependent      Hospitals (MDHs) in rural areas would receive a 7.1% increase      in payments for covered HOPD services for services starting      January 1, 2009. The increase would be applied before      calculating outliers and coinsurance. The Secretary would be      able to revise this percentage starting for services      furnished after January 1, 2010 through promulgation of a      regulation. The increase would not apply to pass-through      drugs and biologicals. The increased payments as they relate      to SCHs and MDHs would not be implemented in a budget-neutral      manner.      Section 203. Permanent Treatment of Medicare Reasonable          Costs Payments for Certain Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory          Tests Furnished to Hospital Patients in Certain Rural          Areas.        Current Law        Generally, hospitals that provide clinical diagnostic      laboratory services under Part B are reimbursed using a fee      schedule. Hospitals with under 50 beds in qualified rural      areas (certain rural areas with low population densities)      receive 100% of reasonable cost reimbursement for the      clinical diagnostic laboratories covered under Part B that      are provided as outpatient hospital services. Reasonable cost      reimbursement for laboratory services provided by these      hospitals will expire on July 1, 2008.        Explanation of Provision        This provision would add Section 1833(v) to the Social      Security Act which would make reasonable cost reimbursement      for laboratory services provided by qualified rural hospitals      permanent starting July 1, 2008. The Secretary would be      required to apply the current rules that are used to      determine whether clinical diagnostic laboratory services are      furnished as an outpatient Critical Access Hospital service      (without regard to amendments enacted in this legislation.)      Section 204. Clarification of Payment for Clinical          Laboratory Tests Furnished by Critical Access Hospitals          (CAHs).        Current Law        Medicare outpatient covered clinical laboratory services      are generally paid based on a fee schedule. Clinical      diagnostic laboratory services provided to patients who      receive services directly from CAHs on an outpatient basis      are paid 101% of reasonable costs. Clinical laboratory      services provided by CAHs to those who are not patients are      paid on the basis of the Medicare fee schedule. In no      instance are Medicare beneficiaries liable for any      coinsurance or deductible amounts.        Explanation of Provision        Under this provision, clinical diagnostic laboratory      services furnished by a CAH starting in January 1, 2009 would      be reimbursed at 101% of costs as outpatient hospital      services without regard to whether the specimen was collected      from a patient of the CAH or whether the specimen was      collected in a skilled nursing facility or clinic that is      owned by or co-located with the CAH.      Section 205. Extension of Medicare Incentive Payment Program          for Physician Scarcity Areas.        Current Law        MMA provided for an additional 5% in payments for certain      physicians in scarcity areas for the period January 1, 2005      through December 31, 2007. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP      Extension Act of 2007 (MMSEA) extended these payments through      June 30, 2008. The Secretary was required to calculate,      separately for practicing primary care physicians and      specialists, the ratios of such physicians to Medicare      beneficiaries in the county, rank each county (or equivalent      area) according to its ratio for primary care and specialists      separately, and then identify those scarcity areas with the      lowest ratios which collectively represented 20% of the total      Medicare beneficiary population in those areas. The list of      counties was to be revised no less often than once every      three years unless there were no new data. There would be no      administrative or judicial review of the designation of the      county or area as a scarcity area, the designation of an      individual physician's specialty, or the assignment of a      postal zip code to the county or other area. The listing of      counties appeared in Appendix I and Appendix J of the 2005      physician fee schedule update.        Explanation of Provision        The provision would extend the add-on payments through      December 31, 2009.      Section 206. Revisions to the Work Geographic Adjustment          Under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule.       Current Law        Medicare's physician fee schedule assigns relative values      to services that reflect physician work (i.e., the time,      skill, and intensity it takes to provide the service),      practice expenses, and malpractice costs. The relative values      are adjusted for geographic variations in costs. The adjusted      relative values are then converted into a dollar payment      amount by a conversion factor.        The geographic adjustment factors are indices that reflect      the relative cost difference in a given area in comparison to      a national average. An area with costs above the national      average would have an index greater than 1.00 while an area      with costs below the average would have an index below 1.00.      The physician work geographic adjustment factor is based on a      sample of median hourly earnings in six professional      specialty occupational categories. Unlike the other      geographic adjustments, the work adjustment factor reflects      only one-quarter of the cost differences in an area. The      Secretary is required to periodically review and adjust the      geographic indices.        MMA required the Secretary to increase the value of any      work geographic index that was below 1.00 to 1.00 for      services furnished on or after January 1, 2004 and before      January 1, 2007. TRHCA extended the provision for an      additional year, through December 31, 2008, and MMSEA      extended the provision for an additional six months, for      services provided before July 1, 2008.        Explanation of Provision        Subsection (a) would extend the 1.0 work floor through      December 31,2009. Subsection (b) would recognize the equality      of physician work in all geographic areas and eliminate      differing work index values by establishing a national value      of 1.0, effective 2010.      Section 207. Revisions to the Practice Expense Geographic          Adjustment Under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule.        Current Law        Medicare's physician fee schedule assigns relative values      to services that reflect physician work (i.e., the time,      skill, and intensity it takes to provide the service),      practice expenses, and malpractice costs. The relative values      are adjusted for geographic variations in costs. The adjusted      relative values are then converted into a dollar payment      amount by a conversion factor.        The geographic adjustment factors are indices that reflect      the relative cost difference in a given area in comparison to      a national average. An area with costs above the national      average would have an index greater than 1.00 while an area      with costs below the average would have an index below 1.00.      The practice expense geographic adjustment is calculated by      measuring variations in employee wages, office rents, and      miscellaneous. The Secretary is required to periodically      review and adjust the geographic indices.        Explanation of Provision       Subsection (a) would establish a practice expense floor of      1.0 for 2009 by requiring the Secretary to increase the value      of any practice expense geographic index that was below 1.0      to 1.0 for services furnished on or after January 1, 2009 and      before January 1, 2010. Subsection (b) would reduce the      geographic adjustment for practice expense to 50 percent of      the current adjustment for employee wages and rent, effective      2010.     Section 208. Extension of Treatment of Certain Physician          Pathology Services Under Medicare.       Current Law       BBA 97 specified that independent labs that had agreements      with hospitals on July 22, 1999, to bill directly for the      technical component of pathology services could continue to      do so in 2001 and 2002. The provision has been periodically      extended. TRHCA extended the provision through 2007, and      MMSEA further extended it through June 30, 2008.       Explanation of Provision       The provision would be extended through December 31, 2009.     Section 209. Extension of Increased Medicare Payments for          Rural Ground Ambulance Services.       Current Law       Ambulance services are paid on the basis of a national fee      schedule, which is being phased in. The fee schedule      establishes seven categories of ground ambulance services and      two categories of air ambulance services. The payment for a      service equals a base rate for the level of service plus      payment for mileage. Geographic adjustments are made to a      portion of the base rate.       Explanation of Provision       The provision would provide for an increase in the rates      otherwise established for ground ambulance services of 5% in      rural areas for the period July 1, 2008-December 31, 2009.     Sec. 210. Adding Hospital-Based Renal Dialysis Centers          (Including Satellites) As Originating Sites for Payment          of Telehealth Services.       Current Law       Medicare may cover a telehealth service for beneficiaries      who are located (i) in an area designated as a rural health      professional shortage area; (ii) in a county that is not      included in a Metropolitan Statistical Area; or (iii) at an      entity that participates in a federal telemedicine      demonstration project that has been approved by (or receives      funding from) the Secretary of Health and Human Services as      of December 31, 2000. If a beneficiary is located in those      areas, counties, or entities, then the beneficiary is      permitted to receive telemedicine at one of the following      sites: (1) a physician or practitioner's office; (ii) a      critical access hospital; (iii) a rural health clinic; (iv) a      federally qualified health center; or (v) a hospital.       Explanation of Provision       This provision would permit a hospital-based or critical      access hospital-based renal dialysis center (including      satellites) to serve as a telemedicine site. The provision      would be effective for services furnished on or after January      1, 2009.     Section 211. Expansion of Telehealth Services to Skilled          Nursing Facilities.       Current Law       Medicare covers certain services including professional      consultations, office and other outpatient visits, individual      psychotherapy, pharmacological management, psychiatric      diagnostic interview examinations and end stage renal disease      related services delivered via an eligible telecommunications      system. The originating site (the location of the beneficiary      receiving the telehealth service) can be a physician or      practitioner's office, a critical access hospital, a rural      health clinic, a federally qualified health center, or a      hospital. The originating site must be in a rural health      professional shortage area or in a county that is not in a      metropolitan statistical area or at an entity that      participates in a specified federal telemedicine      demonstration project.       Explanation of Provision       The provision would permit otherwise qualifying skilled      nursing facilities to be the originating site for the      provision of covered telehealth services furnished on or      after January 1, 2009.     Section 212. Rural Health Clinic Improvements.       Current Law       Most rural health clinics (RHCs) receive cost-based      reimbursement from Medicare, subject to per-visit payment      limits and certain productivity standards. Each year the      limit is increased by the percentage increase in the Medicare      Economic Index (MEI). For CY2007, the RHC upper payment limit      is $74.29 per visit.       Explanation of Provision       The provision would establish the RHC upper payment limit      at $92 per visit in 2009. The limit would be increased in      subsequent years by the limit established for the previous      year increased by the percentage increase in the MEI      applicable to primary care services.     Section 213. Exemption for suppliers in small MSAs and rural          areas.       Current Law       The MMA established Medicare competitive bidding for      durable medical equipment, supplies, and other items. The      Secretary is required to establish competitive acquisition      areas, but has discretion to exempt rural areas and areas      with low population density within urban areas that are not      competitive, unless a significant national market exists      through mail order for a particular item or service. The      programs are required to be phased-in so that competition      under the programs occurs in 10 of the largest metropolitan      statistical areas (MSAs) beginning in 2007, 80 of the largest      MSAs in 2009, and remaining areas after 2009.       Explanation of Provision       The provision would require the Secretary to exempt rural      areas and small MSAs with a population of 600,000 or less.      Competitively bid prices would not apply to rural and small      MSAs exempted under this section. The provision would be      effective as if included in the MMA, other than for contracts      entered into pursuant to implementation of competitive      bidding prior to September 1, 2008.     Section 214. Permitting Physician Assistants to Order Post-         Hospital Extended Care Services and to Provide for          Recognition of Attending Physician Assistants as          Attending Physicians to Serve Hospice Patients.       (a) Ordering Post-Hospital Extended Care Services.       Current Law       In a skilled nursing facility (SNF), Medicare law allows      physicians, as well as nurse practitioners and clinical nurse      specialists who do not have a direct or indirect employment      relationship with a SNF, but who are working in collaboration      with a physician, to certify the need for post-hospital      extended care services for purposes of Medicare payment.      Section 20.2.1 of Chapter 8 of the Medicare Benefit Policy      Manual defines post-hospital extended care services as      services provided as an extension of care for a condition for      which the individual received inpatient hospital services.      Extended care services are considered ``post-hospital'' if      they are initiated within 30 days after discharge from a      hospital stay that included at least three consecutive days      of medically necessary inpatient hospital care.       Explanation of Provision       The provision would allow a physician assistant who does      not have a direct or indirect employment relationship with a      SNF, but who is working in collaboration with a physician, to      certify the need for post-hospital extended care services for      Medicare payment purposes.       (b) Recognition of Attending Physician Assistants as      Attending Physicians to Serve Hospice Patients.       Current Law       Under the Medicare program, hospice services may only be      provided to terminally ill individuals under a written plan      of care established and periodically reviewed by the      individual's attending physician and the medical director      (and by the interdisciplinary group of the hospice program).      For purposes of a hospice written plan of care, Medicare      defines an attending physician as a physician or nurse      practitioner who may be employed by a hospice program and who      the individual identifies as having the most significant role      in the determination and delivery of medical care to the      individual at the time the individual makes an election to      receive hospice care.       For an individual to be eligible for Medicare-covered      hospice services, the individual's attending physician (not      including a nurse practitioner) and the medical director (or      physician member of the interdisciplinary group of the      hospice program) must each certify in writing that the      individual is terminally ill at the beginning of the first      90-day period of hospice.       Explanation of Provision       For purposes of a hospice written plan of care, the      provision would include a physician assistant in the      definition of an attending physician. The provision would      continue to exclude physician assistants from the authority      to certify an individual as terminally ill.       Both provisions would apply to items and services furnished      on or after January 1, 2009.                                 ______                                       By
