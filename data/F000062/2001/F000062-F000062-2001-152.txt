 President, I rise today to submit a resolution to honor correctional officers and employees. This resolution reaffirms our support for the thousands of correctional officers and employees who work in the face of danger each day, while reforming hardened criminals. They deserve our respect and support.  Nationally more than 200,000 corrections professionals work hard to maintain the safety of our communities. We must never forget that this is an often stressful and dangerous occupation. Nor can we forget the sacrifices made by those courageous individuals who have been injured or killed in the line of duty. Officers put their lives on the line every time they begin a shift.  Tragically, correctional officers have been permanently injured and killed in the line of duty. There have been over 356 men and women who have died while on duty. This year, we honor Wilmot A. Burnett, Lee Dunn, Raymond Curtis, Michael Price, Allen Gamble, Peter Hillman, Jason Acton, Leon Egly, William Giacomo, Alvin Glenn, and Allen Myers, who have all been killed during the past year.  Most of us leave for work knowing that we will return home safe and sound at the end of the day. While we take this peace of mind for granted, correctional officers are not afforded this luxury.  On June 6, 2000, Sergeant Allen Gamble, a correctional officer at Oklahoma State Reformatory was fatally stabbed in the throat as he attempted to help a fellow officer who was being attacked by a prisoner. Sergeant Gamble was survived by his wife, Sherri and his four children. Equally disturbing is the case of Officer Jason Coryell, a correctional officer at the Arizona State Prison Complex. On August 25, 200, Officer Jason Croyell was stabbed three times in the stomach when an inmate refused to be handcuffed. Though the wound was severe, Officer Coryell returned to work in November, 2000.  Officers Gamble and Coryell exemplify the heroism that takes place each day in our nation's correctional facilities. They remind us how individual acts of heroism are a regular part of the job among correctional officers and employees.  In addition to dealing with society's most hardened criminals, correctional officers and employees also seek to reform offenders. They play an important role in lowering recidivism rates. And through literacy programs and vocational training they help transform criminals into productive, law abiding members of society. This is not an easy task.  Correctional officers and their families and friends endure a tremendous amount of stress and sacrifice. Prison security never takes a break, which often means that officers work all hours of the day and night, weekends, and holidays. I hope with this resolution we can honor and recognize this sort of commitment and sacrifice, not just this week, but throughout the year.  America's correctional officers and employees efforts to make our world a better, safer place too often go unnoticed. Few of us can truly appreciate the perils faced daily by our correctional officers. With this resolution we reflect on the contributions correctional officers have made to keep our communities safe. This is why I am pleased to submit this resolution to establish June 3-10, 2001, as Correctional Officers and Employees Week.                          ____________________
