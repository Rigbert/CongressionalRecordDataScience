TITLE III--SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING MULTIEMPLOYER PENSION PLANS     SEC. 121. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING MULTIEMPLOYER PENSION                    PLANS.       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:       (1) Multiemployer pension plans have been a major force in      the delivery of employee benefits to active and retired      American workers and their dependents for over half a      century.       (2) There are approximately 1,700 multiemployer defined      benefit pension plans in which approximately 9,700,000      workers and retirees participate.       (3) Three-quarters of the approximately 60,000 to 65,000      employers that participate in multiemployer plans have fewer      that 100 employees.       (4) Multiemployer plans allow for greater access and      affordability for smaller employers and pension portability      for their employees as they move from one job to another, and      permit workers to earn a pension where they might otherwise      not be able to do so.       (5) The 2000-2002 drop in the stock market and decline in      equity values has affected all investors, including      multiemployer plans.       (6) The decline in value sustained by multiemployer defined      benefit pension plans have threatened the stability of this      private sector source of secure retirement income.       (7) Participating employers could face onerous excise taxes      and other penalties as a result of the serious, adverse      financial impact due to these market losses.       (8) In 2004, the United States Senate recognized the      severity of this situation and passed by an overwhelmingly,      large bipartisan margin of 86 to 9 temporary relief      provisions for single and multiemployer defined benefit      pension plans.       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate      that the Senate--       (1) expresses its strong support for multiemployer defined      benefit pension plans;       (2) recognizes the importance of an environment in which      multiemployer plans can continue their vital role in      providing benefits to working men and women;       (3) recognizes that multiemployer pension plan relief must      be designed for the multiemployer labor-relations environment      that supports the plans; and       (4) supports legislation to strengthen and protect the      viability of multiemployer pension plans for the continued      benefit of current and retired members, and their families      and survivors, and to strengthen the ability of all plans to      address funding problems that occur.                                 ______                                       By
