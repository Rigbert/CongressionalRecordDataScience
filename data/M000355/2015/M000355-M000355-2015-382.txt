 The House will vote later this morning on the nomination of Congressman Paul Ryan. I think it is appropriate to wait for that vote to occur before making full comments. But I also think it goes without saying that Paul Ryan is one of the most respected guys around here. Everyone knows he is smart. Everyone knows he is serious. I look forward to working closely with him in pursuit of conservative solutions for our country.                          ____________________
