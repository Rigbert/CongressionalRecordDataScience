President, reserving the right to object, and I don't object, I only make two points, and one perhaps the Senator from California can help us clarify. Again, that is reiterating what the chairman has said. We urge Members who have pending amendments to be here in the neighborhood of 3:30 or 3:45 to call up their amendment and make sure they are pending on the bill, so we can keep this moving along. This is a very important bill. It is all the more compelling because of the events of last week.  Second, relating to the Senator from New Jersey and how his time is going to be credited to this unanimous consent request, it is my understanding that the Senator from California has said that the time used by the Senator from New Jersey was to be taken from the time allocated to her amendment with Senator Cornyn; is that correct?
