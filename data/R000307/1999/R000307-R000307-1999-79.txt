President, today the Senate will immediately proceed to a period of morning business until 1 o'clock. By previous consent, at 1 p.m. the Patients' Bill of Rights will be the pending business. Amendments to that legislation are possible. However, any votes ordered will not take place until tomorrow at a time to be determined by the two leaders. Following this week's debate on health care, the Senate will resume consideration of the remaining appropriations bills. It is imperative that these funding bills be completed prior to the next legislative break.  As a reminder to all Senators, a cloture vote on the pending lockbox amendment to S. 557 is scheduled to take place on Friday, July 16.                          ____________________
