Chairman, I offer an amendment.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:       Amendment offered by Mr. DeFazio:       Page ____, after line ____, insert the following:       Sec. ____. The amounts otherwise provided by this Act are      revised by increasing the amount made available in chapter 3      of title I for ``Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide''      by, and reducing the amount made available in chapter 4 of      title I under the heading ``OTHER BILATERAL ECONOMIC      ASSISTANCE'' for ``Economic Support Fund'' (and the      allocation within that amount for grants for Turkey) by,      $207,000,000, which, in the case of the additional amount for      ``Operation and Maintenance, Defense-Wide'', shall be      available to establish National Guard Weapons of Mass      Destruction Civil Support Team as authorized by law,      including section 12310(c) of title 10, United States Code,      in order to carry out the requirement in section 1403 of      Public Law 107-314 (116 Stat. 2676), that an additional 23      such teams be established, for a total of 55 such teams, with      at least one team established in each State and territory.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I will take part of the time to respond to the chairman, since he did not give me time.  Mr. Chairman, I resent the broad-scale implications about the ``proven linkage'' between Saddam Hussein. They have been able to put Saddam Hussein in the same sentence with al Qaeda; but the CIA, DIA and others have not been able to find or prove a single link, except for the group that he did not control up in the northern part of the country behind the Kurds, who have now been eradicated.  But there are proven links to the Saudis, there are proven links to the Pakistani intelligence service, there are proven links to others who in fact will receive assistance under this bill.  That aside, and we will not get back into that debate again here tonight, but I believe the gentleman mischaracterizes my amendment. This was raised in light of Secretary Rumsfeld threatening to take action against Syria. We have heard that ``real men go to Tehran'' and other things from this administration. I am concerned what adventures they might have in mind in terms of further preemptive wars.  I was trying to make the statement that before we fight any more preemptive wars, that we would live up to our authority under article 1, section 8, which we failed, and we failed the troops and the American people in the Congress in the matter of this current action, although it was authorized under other auspices by this Congress.  My other amendment is really simple. I know it will be opposed, but here it is.  This Congress authorized that we would make the American people safe by setting up National Guard weapons of mass destruction civil support teams in every State of the United States and the territories. Guess what, we have not delivered on that. We do not have enough money. We have been told there are budget constraints. We cannot afford a National Guard weapons of mass destruction civil support team in 17 States, including my own and that of the ranking member of the committee and a number of other States. We cannot afford it; yet we can send $1 billion unsolicited to Turkey.  As I said earlier on the floor tonight, the ambassador of Turkey said these funds were not solicited; they were a unilateral action on the part of the United States of America; essentially a gift or bribe, however we want to characterize it.  Would the American people not be better served by just reducing that by 20 percent? So 20 percent of the $1 billion that we are going to borrow and send to Turkey would be spent here in the United States of America for the National Guard to prevent destruction by weapons of mass destruction.  Now, I know we are going to hear, this would be an insult to the Turks and others. But is it not an insult to the American people that we are not making them as safe as we could? If Members want to talk about patriotism, damn it, protect our people here at home. If Members want to cast aspersions on me, I want this money to be spent in the United States of America. They want to send it to Turkey, plain and simple.  We are going to vote up or down on this. It is real simple. They will get up and say, oh, the Turks, the Turks. We either fund under the law what we said we would or what we were mandated to do, which we say we do not have the money to do, or we do not. This is the simple way to do it. The Turks would still get $800 million that they did not ask for.                Announcement by the Chairman pro tempore  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The Chair would remind all Members that they are to refrain from the use of profanity on the House floor.
