TMACOG celebrates its 40th anniversary this month.  When in the early 1960s Federal funds began to go to local governments directly, local leaders from communities in northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan had been meeting informally as the Area Cooperation Committee and building a regional organization. In 1968 the group formally adopted bylaws and elected leadership as TMACOG. Andy Devine, who was then a member of Toledo City Council, was elected to be the first chair. The newly formed executive committee held its first meeting in the council chambers in the city of Oregon, Ohio. In celebration of TMACOG's 40th year, the April 16, 2008, meeting of the TMACOG executive committee will also be held in the city of Oregon.  TMACOG's areas of concentration are transportation planning, environmental planning, and commuter services. Looking to the future, member concerns also include alternative energy and energy conservation measures, economic development, and more interest in freight transportation and logistics.  TMACOG's vision statement, adopted in 2002, states that ``TMACOG will be the governmental partner of choice to coordinate regional assets, opportunities, and challenges.'' Over the course of four decades, local leaders have looked to the organization to lead the region forward. While we celebrate TMACOG's achievements the past 40 years. we join with the organization to promote a bright future of opportunity and growth.                          ____________________
