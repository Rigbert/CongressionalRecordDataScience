Thank you. I thank the Chair. I thank the two distinguished leaders.  If I might note for a moment, both the distinguished Republican leader and the Democratic leader have workedextremely hard on this, as has the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Sununu, and Mr. Gregg and others, and, of course, the distinguished chairman of the committee, Senator Specter.  I think this is a reasonable conclusion that will allow the Judiciary Committee to look at some of the questions which have legitimately been raised and would not have been heard had this gone through otherwise.
