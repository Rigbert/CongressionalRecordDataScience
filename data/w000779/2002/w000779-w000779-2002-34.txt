President, a little more than a year ago, the terrible events of September 11 forced the awakening and mobilization of a critical resource in this country. In response to that tremendous tragedy, America's technology innovators, skilled workers in all walks of life, have stepped forward to help America address the numerous threats our enemies pose.  One of these threats is cybersecurity. As computer networks have become increasingly central to this Nation's infrastructure and businesses, that the importance of securing our information and information technologies has grown. Today I wish to draw the Senate's attention to emerging technologies for dealing with these new threats. I also want to discuss how this country can maximize a uniquely American resource: that is, the skilled innovation of our tech sector.  Technology workers and managers from my home State of Oregon have inspired me with their technical skills and their passion to put their talents to work serving America. The Portland area is home to one of the Nation's largest concentration of cybersecurity vendors in the country. Portland now boasts a remarkable cluster of small and large companies actively working to make America's portion of cyberspace a safer place.  Just a few examples: Tripwire is the world leader in data integrity assurance, providing software that establishes the foundation for IT security and reliability. Tripwire is used to protect some of the world's most sensitive data, and that includes some of the most important systems right here in Washington.  Digimarc provides digitally watermarked drivers licenses for 37 States, and supplies official identification documents for governments around the world. Its technology enables authentication with a greater level of assurance than has historically been possible.  Swan Island Networks is building software platforms that enable secure communications of sensitive information to trusted users across organizational boundaries. It is helping Federaland local agencies and first responders to communicate effectively to audiences inside and outside the firewall.  Intel Corporation, which has its largest base of employment in Oregon, is leading the National Emergency Messaging Systems initiative from the Portland area. Intel is helping local, State and Federal officials respond to emergencies.  WireX has won international recognition for its Immunix Network Security Solutions. The company was founded by a grant from DARPA in 1998.  Galois Connections designs and develops high confidence software for critical and demanding applications. Its clientele includes the National Security Agency.  Kryptiq builds secure email systems that are built to preserve privacy, as well as the integrity of documents.  Oregon is home to many, many more, including Flatrock, Infotects, Network Associates, Rulespace, TechTracker and True Disk. Some of these companies have persevered and become successful selling products and services that government is using to defend its infrastructure. Many others have developed products, launched companies, and knocked on doors in Washington, trying to find an entry point. Their efforts must be sustained and encouraged.  There are numerous ways to provide that encouragement, and not all of them originate in Washington. It is vital to look at what is working on the local level and nurture it there. It is time to lower the speedbumps. Straighten the curves. Shorten the straightaways. Bring our technological talent quickly to the front lines of this new kind of war.  In Oregon, a coalition of these cybersecurity companies has come together in the wake of 9/11. The Oregon Regional Alliance for Information and Network Security, or Oregon RAINS, is banding together to offer products and services America needs now. These companies are working together to find new ways of navigating the Federal bureaucracy to get their products on the ground.  In my view, the Federal Government should do all it can to be responsive to organizations like Oregon RAINS. Currently, our sluggish bureaucracy often discriminates against small, young and distant vendors. America's enemies won't be defeated solely by the ideas of huge corporations or entrenched government contractors. This country needs the help of smaller, nimble players who are long on passion and talent, but short on expertise about dealing with their Federal Government.  It is essential to eliminate the roadblocks American innovators face. A 20-person company in Beaverton, OR shouldn't have to devote precious resources to hiring lobbyists, making multiple trips to see different people in different agencies, and pursuing expensive and, frankly, frequently obsolete certifications.  Earlier this year I was proud to author the Science and Technology Emergency Mobilization Act, along with my colleague Senator Allen, and to see it passed by this Senate. That legislation mandated the creation of a clearinghouse, or single entry point, for technology innovators offering new products for the war on terrorism. I am gratified to see that concept echoed in the Homeland Security legislation sponsored by Senator Lieberman.  My legislation, as well as Senator Lieberman's homeland security bill, also directs the executive branch to establish a national test bed to evaluate new technologies.  In my view, this national test bed could eventually serve as a model for regional test beds. If that little company in Beaverton, OR, could run pilot programs in its backyard, the company could more easily answer questions, deal with challenges and monitor results.  Regional efforts to test new technologies would also increase our likelihood of finding unexpected solutions in unexpected places. Some technology or technique that we couldn't have foreseen might pop up and help us win this war. The beauty of American innovation is that it could just as easily come from a suburban basement, a sparsely furnished loft, or a coalition of small companies as it could from the business-as-usual landscape.  There are other ways the Federal Government can be a better partner to small technology innovators like those in my home State. Accelerating research and public-private technology partnerships through Federal grants. Deepening our cyber-security bench by funding IT education and channeling bright students into those areas. Raising awareness in the general public so that everyone sees the importance of securing this country's infrastructure.  I can assure you that in my home state alone there are a plethora of skilled software engineers and managers who are eager to see their technologies deployed to serve America. The Federal Government needs to partner with them and help them help their neighbors. American lives are at stake.                          ____________________
