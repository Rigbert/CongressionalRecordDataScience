President, today I introduce the National Institute of Finance Act of 2010, which would create an Institute to provide our financial regulators with the data and analytic tools needed to prevent and contain future financial crises.  By establishing this new Institute, my bill offers the foundation for a new approach to financial regulation that would better protect Americans from the financial storm they are currently struggling through.  Over the past 18 months, we have learned that our regulators did not have the appropriate tools or knowledge to address risks that cut across different markets and sectors of the financial system. The recently passed House financial regulatory reform bill and other proposals take an important step in filling this huge regulatory gap by establishing centralized systemic risk oversight. However, any new regulatory structure will be ineffective unless we also equip it with a strong, independent, and well-funded data, research, and analytic capacity to fulfill its mission.  The idea for the National Institute of Finance has been endorsed by a dedicated group of the Nation's top academic researchers, economists, and statisticians--including Nobel Laureate Harry Markowitz--who recognize that any financial regulatory reform is incomplete without a much stronger data, research, and analytic capability.  To further explore these issues, I asked the National Academy of Sciences in August to study the data and tools needed for systemic risk regulation. Among the Academy's findings: that the U.S. currently lacks the technical tools to monitor and manage systemic financial risk with sufficient comprehensiveness and precision. That market efficiency, in addition to regulatory capacity, would be enhanced by improved intelligence about what is going on in the system as a whole. And that existing capabilities are not a sufficient foundation for systemic risk management.  The bill I introduce today addresses these significant weaknesses by creating the National Institute of Finance, whose mission will be to support the community of financial regulatory agencies by collecting and standardizing the reporting of financial market data; performing applied and essential long-term research; and developing tools for measuring and monitoring systemic risk.  The Institute would house a data center that would collect, validate and maintain key data to perform its mission, including a central database to map the interconnections between financial institutions, along with details on their transactions and positions, and their valuation of their assets and liabilities. By working with banks and other firms to standardize the format of such data and by providing standard reference data, such as databases of legal entities and financial products, the Institute would reduce the costs to regulators and financial institutions from the currently fragmented and disorganized systems used to collect and store such information.  Second, the Institute would contain a research and analysis center to develop the needed metrics and then measure and monitor systemic risk posed by individual firms and markets. This new Institute would house some of the country's most-well-respected researchers to collect and analyze the data needed to understand what is happening in our financial markets, to conduct investigations of market disruptions, and to work with regulators to identify new and dangerous trends.  It would conduct and help coordinate applied research on financial markets and systemic risk, a field that is not well-represented right now at the Federal Reserve or within our other regulatory agencies. It would also develop the metrics and tools our regulators need to measure and monitor systemic risk and help policymakers by conducting studies and providing advice on the impact of government policies on systemic risk.  Finally, the Institute would provide independent periodic reports to Congress on the state of the financial system, ensuring that we are kept apprised of the overall picture of our markets more effectively than we have been in the past. The domino effect caused by the recession will continue to cripple Rhode Island families and Americans across the country unless we put in place a strong new infrastructure and shore up our financial markets.  I hope my colleagues will join me in strengthening our financial system by cosponsoring this legislation and supporting its passage.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3005       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``National      Institute of Finance Act of 2010''.       (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act      is as follows:     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:       (1) The United States is experiencing the worst economic      and financial crisis since the Great Depression. The nature      of the current crisis is systemic. It was set in motion not      by the actions of any single entity, but by a loss of      confidence throughout the financial system as a whole.       (2) Such catastrophic events revealed significant      shortcomings in the legal tools available to financial      policymakers. The scale and systemic nature of the crisis      calls for a thorough review of the United States' system of      financial regulation, to assess its capacity to understand,      monitor, and respond to systemic threats. It is critical that      financial regulators have the legal tools they need to act      quickly, decisively, effectively, and when appropriate,      preemptively, to prevent systemic financial crises in the      future and to mitigate their negative impact, should they      recur.       (3) The recent catastrophic events in financial markets      also revealed significant gaps in the information and      analytic tools available to regulators and policymakers      charged with ensuring the health of the financial system.       (4) Systemic risk involves interactions among financial      entities in addition to features of individual firms.      Therefore, to understand and monitor the buildup of systemic      risk in the financial system requires information about such      interactions among institutions.       (5) Operational methods do not exist by which to measure      systemic risks in the United States financial system. Nor do      proven operational techniques exist by which regulators can      identify the buildup of systemic risks in the United States      financial system.       (6) Regulators do not have effective methodologies for      assessing the effects of particular regulatory actions or      approaches on the overall health of the financial system.       (7) Financial regulators do not have the data needed to map      the networks of counterparty relationships through which      systemic contagion could spread. Nor do they have the      analytic tools required to translate such data into useful,      actionable information.       (8) Notwithstanding noteworthy efforts from the research      community, sustained, large-scale programs of applied      research and development necessary to create operational      systems for understanding, measuring, and monitoring systemic      risk in financial systems have not emerged.       (9) There is a substantial amount of high-quality research      in academia in relevant disciplines, including financial      economics, statistics, and operations research, but such      research tends to focus on theoretical or conceptual      innovations that are not immediately reducible to operational      practice.       (10) The incentives confronting academic researchers work      against the production of research that does not yield novel      theoretical insights or computational techniques.       (11) The challenges of gaining access to data and obtaining      funding from government and industry for academic research      severely restrict the number of academics working on      understanding and monitoring systemic risk in the financial      markets.       (12) Some of the largest commercial firms make substantial      investments in research and development in the area of      quantitative finance, but such commercial research programs      are targeted almost exclusively at applications that create      commercial value for the firms undertaking the substantial      investments necessary to support the programs, and focus      primarily on techniques for pricing particular financial      instruments and managing firm-specific risks.       (13) Financial institutions that sponsor research programs      usually protect the results of investigations as commercial      trade secrets. Even those results that might be useful in      application to the analysis of systemic risk are generally      not available to the public.       (14) No organization anywhere has access to the      comprehensive transaction-level data that are necessary to      map the network of counterparty relationships in the      financial system. Absent such data, it is not possible to      evaluate the primary counterparty risks, the extent to which      any given firm is vulnerable to the failure of one of its      counterparties, or broader counterparty network risks.       (15) It is not possible to understand, assess, or predict      how the collapse of one or more institutions might set off a      cascade of failure that destabilizes the entire financial      system.       (16) Without intelligence about the network of counterparty      relationships and the liquidity provided by the members of      the counterparty network, it is difficult even to identify      reliably the set of institutions that regulators should deem      to be systemically important.       (17) Notwithstanding statutory mandates that call for      sharing of information among regulatory agencies, United      States financial regulators do not require that firms report      data in a uniform standard format. The lack of compatibility      in the data formats used by different agencies implies in      practice that agencies find it difficult and expensive to      integrate data from multiple sources.       (18) In periods of financial crisis such as that      experienced in the 2 years preceding the date of enactment of      this Act, absence of data comparability becomes a critical      handicap, in that dispersed information cannot quickly be      integrated into a comprehensive framework that could help      reveal the condition of the financial system as a whole.      Without a capacity quickly to compare and integrate financial      data of diverse types from multiple sources, regulators are      unable to analyze the state of the financial system      accurately and comprehensively. Nor are they able to foresee,      and potentially head off, the onset of a financial crisis.       (19) The events of September 2008 offer a sobering example      of the consequences that can flow from an inability quickly      to integrate financial data from diverse sources. During      several critical days in that month, senior Government      officials contemplated the possible consequences of allowing      the failure of Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. Insofar as the      content of their deliberations is accessible in the public      record, there is little evidence that such officials had at      their disposal an intelligence system that could illuminate      the potential consequences of alternative choices.      Notwithstanding that the United States Government, through      its several agencies, collects a broad range of information      from financial firms, the events of September 2008 revealed      that, at this most critical juncture, these data and      accompanying analytics could not provide financial officials      with the information they needed.       (20) The creation of a system for collecting and organizing      a comprehensive financial transaction database that employs      standardized formats is feasible.       (21) The Enterprise Data Management Council, an industry      consortium, is on record as advocating both the feasibility      and desirability of bringing uniform standards to the      collection, reporting, and management of financial      transaction data.       (22) A leading financial firm has developed for its      internal use a system that incorporates comprehensive      reference databases of all legal entities in its counterparty      network and of all of the many types of financial instruments      in which it transacts. Using the system, the firm can compute      its exposure to many of their counterparties within an hour.       (23) A leading information technology firm has developed a      prototype of an operational system that would support a      comprehensive database of financial instruments and      transactions across the entire economy, and in collaboration      with other private sector firms and public sector entities,      is in the process of developing a prototype system for      maintaining the needed system-wide reference databases.       (24) The community of financial regulators can realize      substantial benefits by consolidating into one entity the      highly technical tasks of establishing and maintaining      uniform standards for reporting financial data, organizing      and managing high-volume flows of financial data, providing      analytic and high performance computational services,      performing applied research and development activities, and      conducting, coordinating, and sponsoring essential long term,      fundamental research in the field of financial analysis and      regulatory intelligence.       (25) Such technical tasks benefit from increasing economies      of scale, the total cost of providing such services to the      regulatory community promises to be lower if one agency is      tasked to provide all of such data, instead of creating      redundant and less effective units in each of the several      financial regulatory agencies.       (26) An entity that provides access to data and analytic      tools to all regulatory agencies on a common basis would help      to ensure that all agencies are receiving accurate,      consistent, comparable data and analytic tools that can be      modified for agency-specific needs.       (27) The creation of an entity that creates shared data and      analytic services will provide a natural and regular vehicle      for the exchange of research and collaboration between      regulatory agencies.       (28) The emergence of uniform standards for referencing and      reporting financial transactions would generate substantial      benefits for the financial services industry. There is, at      present, no consistent, comprehensive, and universal system      for coding, transmitting, and storing financial transaction      data. Data reside typically in unconnected databases and      spreadsheets, using multiple formats and inconsistent      definitions. The routine conduct of business obliges firms to      incur substantial costs to translate and transfer data among      otherwise incompatible systems. In addition, this data      incomparability impedes the ability of companies to assess      their risks accurately. The adoption of a common language for      data coding and handling would dramatically reduce costs for      processing transactions and carrying out other administrative      tasks. Standardized reporting would also enable firms to map      their counterparty relationships more clearly and more easily      understand their     credit exposures to other firms, a development that promises      improvements in risk management practices across the      industry.       (29) In August 2008, the Counterparty Risk Management      Policy Group called for the financial industry to move      rapidly toward real-time reconciliation and confirmation of      financial transactions. Industry experts believe that this      change would yield substantial benefits to firms      individually, to the financial services industry, and to the      economy as a whole. Achieving this goal would not be      possible, however, without industry-wide adoption of common      standards for coding and handling financial transaction data.      Despite the clear benefits of data standardization and      despite years of effort by the industry, through consortia      such as the Enterprise Data Management Council, the financial      services industry has not been able to make meaningful      progress towards the goal of universal adoption of uniform,      consistent standards for data handling.       (30) Efforts to see a common set of standards for financial      data adopted universally are impeded by so-called ``network      effects''. The benefits of adoption for any one firm depend      on the extent to which other firms adopt the same common      language. For any one institution, the full benefits are      distinctly limited until a critical number of participants in      the industry adopt the same standards. In light of these      network effects, the adoption of a single data handling      standard by all industry participants presents a daunting      coordination challenge. Each individual firm is discouraged      from making the substantial investments required to upgrade      its own systems, unless and until they receive assurance that      others in the industry will follow suit. Many firms are      deferring significant upgrades to their systems until well-     defined industry-wide standards are accepted.       (31) The financial services industry's historical      experience strongly suggests that the industry is unlikely to      achieve universal adoption of a single data-handling standard      on its own initiative, through either the decentralized      actions of industry participants or through voluntary      coordination at the urging of industry consortia or trade      associations. Standardization of financial data will require      an external mandate.       (32) The new data standards promulgated for reporting by      firms will emerge as the de facto standard for data      management in the finance industry, a standard on which firms      could converge. Firms could then be confident of realizing a      significant return on the investment needed to update their      internal systems, knowing that other industry participants      were doing likewise.       (33) The establishment of Federal requirements for the      maintenance and provision of reference databases and      reporting of transactions and position data to a central      repository would assure individual institutions of a      significant return on the investment needed to update their      internal systems. Firms would benefit from not having to      maintain their own unique reference databases, standardized      reporting would greatly reduce the cost of reconciling trades      and other back office activities, and it would give firms a      clear map of their counterparty relationships, which would      facilitate better risk management across the industry.       (34) Once achieved, the universal adoption of standard      protocols for handling financial transaction data promises to      generate significant and sustained improvements in the      efficiency and productivity of the financial services      industry in the United States. Such improvements will help to      secure and maintain the international leadership position of      United States capital markets.       (35) United States regulators must never again find      themselves confronting a financial crisis without the full      set of legal, data, and analytic tools they need to      understand, measure, monitor, and respond intelligently to      systemic risks that threaten the stability (of the United      States financial system.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to ensure that the financial regulatory community is      equipped fully with the data and analytic tools it needs to      fulfill its responsibility to safeguard the United States      financial system;       (2) to reduce the likelihood of another systemic financial      crisis occurring;       (3) to restore integrity and confidence to the financial      markets of the United States;       (4) to provide for the security of the United States      economy from potential external threats to the United States      financial system;       (5) to improve the efficiency of the financial markets in      the United States;       (6) to reduce the cost and increase the effectiveness of      coordinated financial regulation in the United States;       (7) to help maintain the leadership position of the United      States as home to the most efficient, competitive, and      productive capital markets in the world; and       (8) to help restore and maintain conditions in the United      States financial system that will support the creation of      wealth and prosperity in the United States.

(a) In General.--       (1) Establishment.--There is established the National      Institute of Finance, which shall be an independent      establishment, as that term is defined in section 104 of      title 5, United States Code.       (2) Mission.--The mission of the Institute is to support      the Federal financial regulatory agencies, including any      systemic risk council or agency established by Congress, by--       (A) collecting and providing data;       (B) standardizing the types and formats of data reported      and collected;       (C) performing applied research and essential long-term      research;       (D) developing tools for risk measurement and monitoring;       (E) performing other related services; and       (F) making the results of its activities available to      financial regulatory agencies.       (b) Director.--       (1) Appointment.--The Institute shall be headed by a      Director, who shall be appointed by the President, by and      with the advice and consent of the Senate.       (2) Term of service.--The Director shall serve for a term      of 15 years.       (3) Executive level and pension.--The position of the      Director shall be at level II of the Executive Schedule, and      a Director who serves a full term, or becomes disabled and      unable to fulfill the responsibilities of the Director after      serving at least 10 years, shall receive a pension at      retirement equal to the salary of that person in the last      year of the term, and that pension shall increase in      subsequent years with the increase in the cost of living.       (4) Vacancy.--In the event that a successor is not      nominated and confirmed by the end of the term of service of      a Director, the Director may continue to serve until such      time as the new Director is appointed and confirmed.       (5) Prohibition on dual service.--The individual serving in      the position of Director may not, during such service, also      serve as the head of any financial regulatory agency.       (6) Responsibilities, duties and authority.--The Director      shall have sole discretion to fulfill the responsibilities      and duties and exercise the authorities described in this      Act, except in cases where specific authorities have been      given to the Board of Directors.       (c) Board of Directors.--The Board of Directors of the      Institute shall be comprised of the Director, the Secretary      of the Treasury, and the head of each financial regulatory      agency.       (d) Membership of the Director on the Board of Directors.--     The Director shall serve as a voting member of the Board of      Directors and as a member of any financial systemic risk      regulatory council or agency established by Congress.       (e) Funding.--       (1) Annual budget.--The Director, in consultation with the      Board of Directors shall establish the initial annual budget.      For all other annual budgets, the Director shall submit an      annual budget for the Institute to the Board of Directors not      later than April 30 of each year. The Board of Directors may,      without amendment, reject the budget with a two-thirds      majority vote. Each time a budget is rejected, the Director      shall submit a revised budget to the Board of Directors      within 60 days, and the Board of Directors may, without      amendment, reject the budget with a two-thirds majority vote.      If the Board of Directors fails to reject the budget within      60 days of submission by the Director, the budget shall be      automatically approved. If a new budget is not approved      before the existing budget expires, the most recent approved      budget shall continue on a pro rata basis. Each submitted      budget and all votes by the Board of Directors on each budget      shall be part of the public record of the Board of Directors.       (2) Assessments.--The Institute shall be funded through      assessments on the financial entities required to report data      to the Institute. The formula by which the budgetary costs      are allocated among the reporting entities shall be      determined by the Board of Directors.
