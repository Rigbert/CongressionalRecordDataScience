President, I rise this morning to take note of the real progress this Congress has made and is on the verge of making in strengthening our homeland security.  This progress--reform of FEMA, protection of our chemical facilities and improved security for our seaports--should not be overlooked as we conclude a hectic month.  In the midst of all the charges that Congress has failed to accomplish all that we should, I want to call attention to the many times when, in fact, Members have cooperated among committees, between Chambers, and across party lines to make real progress to benefit the American people.
