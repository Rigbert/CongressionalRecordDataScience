President, I want to express my full support for the passage of H.R. 3365, the Fallen Patriots Tax Relief Act. Earlier this year, the Senate passed S. 704, introduced by myself, Senator Warner, Senator McCain, Senator Allen, and Senator Ben Nelson, which would have increased the death gratuity paid to the survivors of deceased members of our military from $6,000 to $12,000. Further, it would make this increase retroactive to September 11, 2001. I am pleased that H.R. 3365 incorporates this legislation.  There is no better way to honor the memories of fallen soldiers than to ensure that their loved ones receive the support they deserve. The death gratuity is provided within days to the family of the servicemember killed while on active duty. These funds help the family to deal with immediate needs during this difficult time. Given the sacrifices of our troops currently in Iraq. I believe that this increase in assistance is far past due.  H.R. 3365 also ensures that the death gratuity is tax free. I fully support this legislation, and believe that it sends a strong message of support to our troops. As the brave men and women of our military continue to go in harm's way in defense of our Nation, it is crucial that they do so with the confidence that their families will have our full support should tragedy occur.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the McCain-Baucus-Grassley amendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed; that the title amendment be agreed to; that the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, en bloc; and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.
