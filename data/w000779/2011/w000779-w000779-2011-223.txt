I wish to propound a unanimous consent at this time. At this point, Senator Udall would be the next speaker. There would be a Republican who would speak next. I am very hopeful it will be Senator Grassley because he and I have been partners for almost 14 years in this effort to force the Senate to do public business in public and get rid of these secret holds. So after Senator Udall, there would be Senator Grassley. After Senator Grassley, there would be my friend and colleague Senator Merkley who would speak. At that time there would be a Republican who would be next in the queue to speak.  So my unanimous consent request at that point is--I would like to be able, for up to 30 minutes, to have the bipartisan sponsors of the effort to get rid of secret holds once and for all, including the distinguished Presiding Officer, to have up to 30 minutes for a colloquy on this bipartisan effort to eliminate secret holds.
