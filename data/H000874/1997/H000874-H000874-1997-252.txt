Chairman, reclaiming my time, I do not ascribe to the gentleman any disingenuousness by asking the question. He knows full well that the Government was never once shut down by Democratic policy. Not once. There were, clearly, disagreements and the President refused to sign bills. The President was President Reagan. The President was President Bush.  I would ask the gentleman, am I correct those 17 times occurred in the 1980's?
