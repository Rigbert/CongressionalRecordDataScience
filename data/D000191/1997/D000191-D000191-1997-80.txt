 Mr. Chairman, the gentleman raised a very serious concern earlier about one particular section of the bill which resembled language from the infamous timber salvage rider which I opposed. The language in concern was that the Secretary concerned shall not rely on salvage timber sales as a basis for administrative action limiting other multiple use activities, et cetera.
