Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator Kerry's amendment. Also, I recognize the very thoughtful analysis that Chairman Bond has done about the budget problems that face this committee as it struggles to fill many different needs in the area of housing.  All this discussion underscores a very fundamental question that transcends all of our considerations in the Senate and that is, we have many unfulfilled obligations in the country which make us very wary of significant reductions in our revenues and significant changes in policy until we address these very fundamental concerns: How would we provide going forward with resources so every American can have a safe, decent, affordable home?  I also agree with Senator Bond that we have to do a lot more in terms of construction policies, in terms of encouraging the creation of housing units. But the section 8 program is particularly critical to so many people throughout this country.  I think it is also very important to note that this is one of those very significant and very efficient combinations of public purpose and private enterprise because we are not, in most cases, operating at public facilities these housing units. They are private housing units which are receiving, through the section 8 subsidies, supports which are available to low-income people--again, a very efficient, very effective way to use very scarce Federal resources to allow individual Americans access to safe and decent housing.  I think we have to, in this situation--even recognizing the significant budgetary constraints--move forward because this is one of those situations where if we make the commitment we will find a way to fund it.  I think the essence of Senator Kerry's amendment is: Let's make this commitment. Let's make this commitment this year again to expand the section 8 voucher program so we can offer the real possibility of safe, decent, affordable housing to more citizens of this country.  I, too, agree with Senator Bond's analysis, which I have been listening to intently over the last several days, about the need to go deeper with our targeting for the low-income housing tax credit program, to support the HOME program, to support the CDBG program. All of these contribute to the housing market, to the availability ofadequate, decent housing for all of our citizens. All of them will contribute to the solution of the dilemma facing us all: How do we provide affordable, decent, safe housing for all of our citizens?  I support very strongly Senator Kerry's amendment and commend him for doing this. I also commend, as I have said before, both Senators Bond and Mikulski for their great efforts to try to work through this very difficult thicket.  Let me, before I conclude, also raise another topic which I have addressed previously on the floor; that is, the staffing level within the Department of HUD, but in particular the HUD Community Builders Fellowship. I must confess I did not know too much about this particular program until we began this debate. But it has come to my knowledge this is an innovative program which is essentially selecting through some very rigorous means professionals in the area of urban policy planning, housing policy, to spend 2 years as a fellow at the Department of HUD after training at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, to try to create an entrepreneurial spirit in HUD, to go beyond the box to create new opportunities in housing. Then these individuals, having served their fellowship, have the opportunity to go back to their communities and take these skills, this training, and their expertise and again contribute to their communities.  I think it is a worthwhile program. But I am prompted to speak not so much because of what I have heard on this floor but because of what I am hearing back in Rhode Island as a result of the success of this program. Stephen O'Rourke is the executive director of the Providence Housing Authority. He is a tough-minded administrator who stepped into a difficult situation decades ago in a housing authority that was crumbling, both physically and in terms of its management style, a housing authority that was beset with all the problems of urban cities--crime, drug use, violence, dilapidated units--and he has done a remarkable job. He has done it by being hard-nosed, aggressive. I suspect people would probably characterize his approach as ``tough love.'' And it has worked.  He has seen every fad and fancy in housing in the last two decades. He has taken it upon himself to communicate with the regional HUD office, commending the Community Builders Fellowship Program. In fact, in his words:       I find their enthusiasm and ``can-do'' attitude infectious.      They constitute a new, special breed of government workers.  When I start hearing about that kind of performance from a local official, I think there is something here we cannot discard totally.  In Rhode Island, this program is working to do things that people have wanted to do for years. But they have never been able to think outside the box or cross the bureaucratic lines of organization to get the job done. These fellows are doing that. They started a statewide ownership center so we can do what I think we all want to see--get people into their own homes.  They are working with the Welfare-to-Work Program to develop an innovative program where a housing authority is sponsoring a microbusiness, a van service, that not only employs individuals but contributes to one of the most significant issues facing people making the transfer from welfare to work--how do you physically get to work? This van service helps that.  These are the types of out-of-the-box, innovative, entrepreneurial solutions we should encourage and not discourage. There have been several preliminary assessments of the program.  Anderson Consulting company has looked at the program and has concluded that it has a positive effect on the ability of HUD customers to conduct their business and get the job done. Ernst & Young has interviewed many people involved in this program. They, too, are convinced. These are their words:       They consider Community Builders to be responsive to their      concerns and timely in addressing them.  Finally, the individuals at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government who were training these professionals believe the program is worthwhile. So I think at this juncture, after barely a year of experience, to totally eliminate the program is the wrong approach.  The other aspect we should know is that HUD has already seen significant reductions in its personnel rolls from 13,000 to 9,300. In fact, both GAO and the HUD IG are arguing that perhaps they have reached the limits of cuts that can be made reasonably. There is no way we can demand a new reformed, reinvigorated, entrepreneurial HUD if they do not have physically the men and women to hold the jobs and to do the jobs. If this program is eliminated totally, as proposed in this appropriation, 81 communities throughout the country will be affected, including Providence, RI, and others. In fact, for the sheer lack of personnel, many significant functions of HUD will be lost if this program is abandoned. If we are asking HUD to be more efficient, more effective, more customer conscious, I do not think at this juncture we should eliminate a program that shows promise.  There also has been a suggestion on the floor that there are some internal criticisms. There was reference, I think, to the Commissioner of the Federal Housing Administration, of Mr. Apgar's criticism. He, in fact, indicates there is potential for this program.  At this juncture, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from Mr. Apgar.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                U.S. Department of                                Housing and Urban Development,                               Washington, DC, September 21, 1999.     Hon. Christopher Bond,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Bond: I understand that in the Senate      Appropriations Committee discussion on the FY2000 HUD/VA      Appropriations Act, you attempted to discredit HUD's      Community Builder initiative by referencing a memo dated      September 2 and signed by me. By taking this routine internal      communication out of context, you presented a distorted      picture of my views on the critical role Community Builders      play in helping the HUD's Office of Housing manage its      programs.       I would like to take this opportunity to set the record      straight. My views on this topic are informed both by my      experience as the Federal Housing Commissioner, as well as by      two decades of research and teaching on housing and community      development issues at Harvard's Joint Center for Housing      Studies and Kennedy School of Government. Based on this      experience, I truly believe that your efforts to ``fire''      some 400 Community Builders will significantly harm HUD's      ability to accomplish its mission and protect the public      trust. Initially, over 20 offices could be forced to close as      they would not have adequate staff to function. To close      these offices would be disastrous. In particular, the loss of      400 HUD employees could cripple HUD's ability to dispose of      HUD held assets (Real Estate Owned Properties) in a cost      effective manner and seriously undermine the financial      integrity of the FHA fund.       The Community Builder initiative is an innovative effort to      clarify the roles and responsibilities of HUD staff. Leading      management experts frequently write and speak about the      dysfunction that results from requiring employees to assume      dual roles--at times offering assistance, facilitating and      problem solving, and at other times performing oversight and      enforcing compliance. Through a series of public forums on      the future of the Federal Housing Administration that I led      in 1994, I gained extensive first hand knowledge about the      adverse consequences of the Department's historical failure      to separate the service and compliance functions.       Even before joining the HUD team, I applauded Secretary      Cuomo's plan to identify two distinct groups of HUD      employees. ``Public Trust Officers,'' with responsibility for      ensuring compliance with program rules and requirements and      protecting against waste, fraud and abuse; and ``Community      Builders,'' who function out in the communities as the      Department's ``front door'' and access point to HUD's array      of program resources and services. While working at HUD, I      have watched the Secretary's vision become a powerful reality      as each day Community Builders serve HUD, and FHA, taxpayers      and low- and moderate-income families and communities.       I appreciate that you and many of your Senate colleagues      are concerned about the effective and fiscally responsible      operation of FHA and HUD. I am therefore hard pressed to      understand how the Subcommittee's effort to terminate 400      essential HUD employees will help. Community Builders are      vital to the success of FHA's homeownership and rental      housing initiatives. Community Builders have primary      responsibility for all marketing activities including      ensuring that FHA's single-family programs effectively serve      minority and other underserved communities. They work with      community based organizations to implement the new      Congressionally mandated single-family property disposition      initiative. They also work with state and local agencies to      expand     availability of services for HUD's elderly and family      developments. These are just a few of the ways that Community      Builders assist the Office of Housing in meeting the needs of      low- and moderate-income families and communities.       Community Builders play a particularly important role in      HUD's effort to manage and dispose of distressed multifamily      properties. The September 2 memo reflects HUD's ongoing      commitment to manage these disposition efforts in a way that      both empowers communities and preserves the public trust.      Property disposition must be a team effort involving      Community Builders working in cooperation with the      Department's Enforcement Center, Property Disposition      Centers, and Office of Multifamily Housing. As indicated in      the memo, Edward Kraus, Director of the Enforcement Center,      Mary Madden, Assistant Deputy Secretary for Field Policy and      Management and myself constantly monitor the work effort of      both Community Builders and Public Trust Officers to insure      that each HUD employee knows his or her role and      responsibility, and that through effective communication      these employees operate as a team.       The Community Builders play an essential role in property      disposition efforts. While all monitoring, compliance, and      enforcement decisions must be made by Public Trust Officers,      Community Builders serve as HUD's ``EYES AND EARS'' in the      neighborhood, providing important early information about HUD      insured and HUD subsidized properties obtained from their      ongoing meetings with tenant and community-based      organizations and state and local officials. Clearly,      effective early communication with all interested parties is      essential for the fair and quick resolution of issues      associated with troubled properties, and if need be the cost-     effective disposition of assets through foreclosure and sale.       In closing, I ask you to stop this wrong headed effort to      fire 400 HUD employees. As you know, the management of HUD's      portfolio of troubled properties has long been a source of      material weakness in our operations. The loss of 400 front      line workers, combined with the Subcommittee's equally      questionable decision to cut back funding for Departmental      salaries and expenses, could very well cripple HUD's capacity      to manage these troubled assets. Rather than continue to use      the memo of September 2 to present a distorted picture of the      Community Builder program, I trust that you will share this      letter with your Senate colleagues so that they will have a      fair and accurate accounting of my own views on this matter.           Sincerely,                                                 William C. Apgar,                 Assistant Secretary for Housing--Federal Housing                                                      Commissioner.
