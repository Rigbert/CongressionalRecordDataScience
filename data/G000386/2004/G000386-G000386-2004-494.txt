R. 3108, the pension bill. Under the previous order, there will be 40 minutes of debate prior to the vote in relation to the Kyl second-degree amendment regarding waivers. Following the disposition of the Kyl amendment, we should be prepared to quickly move to a vote on passage of the underlying legislation. Senators should therefore expect a vote or maybe two votes prior to noon tomorrow. In addition to the pension rate bill, the Senate may consider any judicial nominations that can be cleared for action. Additional votes are, therefore, possible during Wednesday's session of the Senate.                          ____________________
