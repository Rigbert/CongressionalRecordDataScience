President, the realignment toward Asia has focused our attention on partnerships with countries in the region. We share political, economic, security, and humanitarian interests, creating complex and multidimensional relationships. But our commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights must continue to be a foundation for our relations with these countries, as with others around the world. We must continue to advocate for open societies where dialogue and dissent are encouraged and where security forces are professional and accountable. At the same time, we cannot ignore history.  Fifty years ago, under the guise of a state-sanctioned Communist purge, hundreds of thousands of Indonesian men, women, and children were murdered. Many more were rounded up and led to concentration camps where they were imprisoned, and many were tortured by the security forces of a dictatorial and brutal regime that had the backing of the United States. It has been widely recognized as one of the worst mass atrocities of the 20th century, but efforts to establish a truth and reconciliation commission to come to terms with these crimes have stalled at every turn. The atrocities are still not recognized or discussed by the Indonesian Government, and the perpetrators were long celebrated as heroes for their actions.  The United States should lead by example in acknowledging this tragic history and reaffirm that human rights are at the forefront of our strategic relationships in Indonesia and beyond. As the most senior member of the Appropriations Committee, I have supported conditions on foreign assistance, including requiring recipient countries to protect freedoms of expression and association, respect the rule of law and due process, reform their judicial systems and security forces, and strengthen other key elements of a democratic society.  Through the ``Leahy Law,'' I have sought to encourage reform of Indonesia's military and police forces, promote cooperation with civilian authorities, and hold human rights violators accountable. I have also supported efforts to demilitarize West Papua and stop the human rights violations associated with the militarization of that island.  Unfortunately, while Indonesia has made important economic and political strides since the systemic repression of the Suharto years, impunity for the horrific crimes of the 1960s and during the final years of the independence struggle in East Timor remain glaring examples of unfinished business that are inconsistent with a democratic society based on the principle that no one is above the law.  We need to recognize the role of our own government in this history, declassify relevant documents, and urge the Indonesian Government to acknowledge the massacres and establish a credible truth and justice mechanism.  I ask unanimous consent that a poignant opinion piece on this subject that was published in the New Yorker on September 29, 2015, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the New Yorker, Sept. 29, 2015]                  Suharto's Purge, Indonesia's Silence                        (By Joshua Oppenheimer)       This week marks the 50th anniversary of the beginning of a      mass slaughter in Indonesia. With American support, more than      500,000 people were murdered by the Indonesian Army and its      civilian death squads. At least 750,000 more were tortured      and sent to concentration camps, many for decades.       The victims were accused of being ``communists,'' an      umbrella that included not only members of the legally      registered Communist Party, but all likely opponents of      Suharto's new military regime--from union members and women's      rights activists to teachers and the ethnic Chinese. Unlike      in Germany, Rwanda or Cambodia, there have been no trials, no      truth-and-reconciliation commissions, no memorials to the      victims. Instead, many perpetrators still hold power      throughout the country.       Indonesia is the world's fourth most populous nation, and      if it is to become the democracy it claims to be, this      impunity must end. The anniversary is a moment for the United      States to support Indonesia's democratic transition by      acknowledging the 1965 genocide, and encouraging a process of      truth, reconciliation and justice.       On Oct. 1, 1965, six army generals in Jakarta were killed      by a group of disaffected junior officers. Maj. Gen. Suharto      assumed command of the armed forces, blamed the killings on      the leftists, and set in motion a killing machine. Millions      of people associated with left-leaning organizations were      targeted, and the nation dissolved into terror--people even      stopped eating fish for fear that fish were eating corpses.      Suharto usurped President Sukarno's authority and established      himself as de facto president by March 1966. From the very      beginning, he enjoyed the full support of the United States.       I've spent 12 years investigating the terrible legacy of      the genocide, creating two documentary films, ``The Act of      Killing'' in 2013 and ``The Look of Silence,'' released      earlier this year. I began in 2003, working with a family of      survivors. We wanted to show what it is like to live      surrounded by still-powerful perpetrators who had murdered      your loved ones.       The family gathered other survivors to tell their stories,      but the army warned them not to participate. Many survivors      urged me not to give up and suggested that I film      perpetrators in hopes that they would reveal details of the      massacres.       I did not know if it was safe to approach the killers, but      when I did, I found them open. They offered boastful accounts      of the killings, often with smiles on their faces and in      front of their grandchildren. I felt I had wandered into      Germany 40 years after the Holocaust, only to find the Nazis      still in power.       Today, former political prisoners from this era still face      discrimination and threats. Gatherings of elderly survivors      are regularly attacked by military-backed thugs.      Schoolchildren are still taught that the ``extermination of      the communists'' was heroic, and that victims' families      should be monitored for disloyalty. This official history, in      effect, legitimizes violence against a whole segment of      society.       The purpose of such intimidation is to create a climate of      fear in which corruption and plunder go unchallenged.      Inevitably in such an atmosphere, human rights violations      have continued since 1965, including the 1975-1999 occupation      of East Timor, where enforced starvation contributed to the      killing of nearly a third of the population, as well as      torture and extrajudicial killing that go on in West Papua      today.       Military rule in Indonesia formally ended in 1998, but the      army remains above the law. If a general orders an entire      village massacred, he cannot be tried in civilian courts. The      only way he could face justice is if the army itself convenes      a military tribunal, or if Parliament establishes a special      human rights court--something it has never done fairly and      effectively. With the military not subject to law, a shadow      state of paramilitaries and intelligence agencies has formed      around it. This shadow state continues to intimidate the      public into silence while, together with its business      partners, it loots the national wealth.       Indonesia can hold regular elections, but if the laws do      not apply to the most powerful elements in society, then      there is no rule of law, and no genuine democracy. The      country will never become a true democracy until it takes      serious steps to end impunity. An essential start is a      process of truth, reconciliation and justice.       This may still be possible. The Indonesian media, which      used to shy from discussing the genocide, now refers to the      killings as crimes against humanity, and grassroots activism      has taken hold. The current president, Joko Widodo, indicated      he would address the 1965 massacre, but he has not      established a truth commission, issued a national apology, or      taken any other steps to end the military's impunity.       We need truth and accountability from the United States as      well. U.S. involvement dates at least to an April 1962      meeting between American and British officials resulting in      the decision to ``liquidate'' President Sukarno, the      populist--but not communist--founding father of Indonesia. As      a founder of the nonaligned movement, Sukarno favored      socialist policies; Washington wanted to replace him with      someone more deferential to Western strategic and commercial      interests.       The United States conducted covert operations to      destabilize Sukarno and strengthen the military. Then, when      genocide broke out, America provided equipment, weapons and      money. The United States compiled lists containing thousands      of names of public figures likely to oppose the new military      regime, and handed them over to the Indonesian military,      presumably with the expectation that they would be killed.      Western aid to Suharto's dictatorship, ultimately amounting      to tens of billions of dollars, began flowing while corpses      still clogged Indonesia's rivers. The American media      celebrated Suharto's rise and his campaign of death. Time      magazine said it was the ``best news for years in Asia.''       But the extent of America's role remains hidden behind a      wall of secrecy: C.I.A. documents and U.S. defense attach      papers remain classified. Numerous Freedom of Information Act      requests for these documents have been denied. Senator Tom      Udall, Democrat of New Mexico, will soon reintroduce a      resolution that, if passed, would acknowledge America's role      in the atrocities, call for declassification of all relevant      documents, and urge the Indonesian government to acknowledge      the massacres and establish a truth commission. If the U.S.      government recognizes the genocide publicly, acknowledges its     role in the crimes, and releases all documents pertaining to      the issue, it will encourage the Indonesian government to do      the same.       This anniversary should be a reminder that although we want      to move on, although nothing will wake the dead or make whole      what has been broken, we must stop, honor the lives      destroyed, acknowledge our role in the destruction, and allow      the healing process to begin.                          ____________________
