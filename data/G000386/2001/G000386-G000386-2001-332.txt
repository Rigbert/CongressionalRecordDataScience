 President, 2 weeks ago, we passed the budget resolution. It seems as if we are involved in redebating the enacted budget resolution. The budget resolution provides record levels of funding for prescription drug coverage. The budget resolution also says we have more than enough tax surplus to enact the tax cut before us. We handle one issue at a time in the Senate.  The Finance Committee will address the prescription drug issue at a later time. I have said that I hope to do that in committee the last 2 weeks of July. The Senate does make one piece of legislation contingent upon another.  The pending amendment is not germane to the provisions of the reconciliation measure. I therefore raise a point of order against the amendment under section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.
