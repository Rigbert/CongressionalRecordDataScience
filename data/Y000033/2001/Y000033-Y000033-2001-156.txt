Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  If I thought the gentleman's words were true in the sense that that would happen, I would probably support the substitute. In the bottom of my heart, I do not believe that will happen. We will be back here and our people will not be safe. That is not the correct thing to do to the American people. Let us not kid the American people.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Vitter).
