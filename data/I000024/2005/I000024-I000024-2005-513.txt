President, it is my understanding that the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, is on his way to use his remaining time. While he is doing that, I will comment that the statements that have been made are excellent. We have agreed we will use the remainder of our time. I will use about 10 minutes, whatever time I have, and they will have the last 10 minutes. However, they are not in the Senate right now. We should serve notice we want the concluding remarks as soon as the Senator from New Mexico completes his remarks.  There are a couple of things of interest. For one thing, it is interesting when we hear about the science. I will have a chance in a minute to talk about the science and how flawed the science is. Look at the Oregon petition. Over 17,000 scientists signed a petition. I will read one paragraph from that petition:       There is no convincing scientific evidence that human      release of carbon dioxide or methane or other greenhouse      gasses is causing, or will, in the foreseeable future, cause      catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption      of the Earth's climate. Moreover, there is considerable      scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon      dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural      plant and animal environments of the Earth.  It is important that we realize CO2 is not a pollutant. CO2 is, in fact, a fertilizer. CO2 is needed. CO2-enhanced earth grows crops better than it does in the absence of that.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from New Mexico controls 6 minutes.
