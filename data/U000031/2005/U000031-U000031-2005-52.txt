Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, last week I was appalled to hear about the release of the new version of the video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas having a back door to porn embedded in its files. That kind of material would have certainly earned it an ``Adults-Only'' rating rather than the ``Mature'' rating that it has been marketing. I cannot imagine how a good player in the video game industry could make an honest mistake of something like that, so you have to wonder just what they are trying to do.  We have had hearings on rating video games as well as music and movies in our committee, and I believe fully that parents are the first line of defense for controlling what their kids watch. Up until now, parents have been able to trust the Entertainment Software Ratings Board, ESRB, to give them credible information about exactly what is in a video game. I want to make sure that that remains the case.  According to the Federal Trade Commission, the FTC, parents are involved in the purchase and rental of games more than 8 out of 10 times, better than 80 percent, making it indisputably clear that parents are the gatekeepers when it comes to deciding what games they bring into their homes.  The facts about consumer awareness and use of the ESRB ratings: 78 percent of parents are aware of the rating system, up 8 percent in the last 2 years; 61 percent of parents are aware of content descriptors, up 53 percent in the last 2 years; 70 percent of parents regularly check the rating before making a purchase. If this company purposely hid that information or material to make a sham of the ratings, it is nothing less than deceptive advertising and it ought to be punished, in this case severely.  My resolution, coauthored by the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), calls on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Rockstar Games to see if they intentionally deceived the ratings board to avoid the Adults-Only rating, and, if they determine that such deception or fraud has taken place, that they apply the very toughest of penalties or sanctions. The video game industry has gone into great detail to define their ratings, but I want parents to feel confident that the labeling of the video games that they allow their kids to play or purchase is reliable and that bad actors do not get away with deceptions like this.  Mr. Speaker, if these ratings were willfully violated, they ought to be punished, and a firm should not be allowed to profit from that outrageous circumstance when those rules are followed by so many families when they buy or see the video games in their homes. This resolution calls for that.  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record a letter that I sent earlier this week to the Chair of the FTC signed by more than 75 Members of Congress, the cover letter signed by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell), the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton), thegentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey) and myself, asking that the FTC take every action that they can if, in fact, the material shows that it was wrong in terms of getting the ``M'' rating.                                Congress of the United States,                                    Washington, DC, July 21, 2005.     Hon. Deborah Platt Majoras,     Chairman, Federal Trade Commission,     Washington, DC.       Chairman Majoras: We write to express our profound concern      regarding the sexually explicit material contained in the      rated ``M'' video game ``Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.'' We      ask for your attention to this matter and to determine if the      publisher, Rockstar Games, intentionally deceived the      Entertainment Software Rating Board to avoid an ``Adults-     Only'' rating. We believe that they may have and the toughest      penalties need to be applied.       The recent release of ``Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas'' was      widely anticipated by consumers, but an ``Adults-Only''      rating would have severely limited its sales in retail      outlets. It appears that the publisher has blatantly      circumvented the rules in order to peddle sexually explicit      material to our youth, and they should be held accountable.       We stand in agreement that parental involvement is the most      important line of defense in determining the type of content      suitable for children, and the ratings system empowers      parents to do just that. Unfortunately, this latest incident      of deceit has severely degraded the integrity of the ratings      system. How can parents trust a system in which game makers      do an end-run around the process to deliver pornographic      material to our kids?       We appreciate the ESRB's swift action in investigating the      matter and revoking the M rating and ensuring any further      sales of ``Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas'' will be under an      AO rating. But this action should have never been necessary      had Rockstar Games complied with industry standards from the      outset.       We respectfully request that you investigate this matter,      and if Rockstar Games is found to have intentionally deceived      American consumers, we ask that severe sanctions are imposed      to the greatest extent under the law. This type of      profiteering from peddling smut to minors must not be      tolerated. A company cannot be allowed to profit from deceit.       We appreciate your attention to this matter and look      forward to your response.           Sincerely,       Fred Upton, Ed Markey, Joe Barton, John Dingell, and 75      other Members of Congress.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I appreciate the opportunity to speak on House Resolution 376. I would like to commend the resolution's author, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton). I agree with the previous remarks made by him.  Let me start by commending an organization, however, I have worked with over the past 3 years, the National Institute on Media and the Family, and its founder Dr. David Walsh, for uncovering and exposing this video game scandal. Dr. Walsh and the Institute on Media and the Family have for years been calling for an independent rating system on interactive video games. They have been national leaders on calling on retail stores across the country to ensure age-specific ratings are enforced. I agree, and I support an independent rating system and retailer responsibility.  The video game industry has a scandal on its hands, and parents across America have been given a wake-up call. Video games can be fun, but they can also be very powerful tools for exposing children to violence, sex and inappropriate material. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is not a video game. It is a violent and sexually explicit tool to train virtual victimizers in crime and sexual violence, and this was before the current pornographic scenes were exposed.  In a review of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas on Amazon.com, it is described as ``even more bloody, violent and sadistic than its popular predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the local population for their money or weapons, to make time with prostitutes, or to simply roam to their heart's content.'' That was a review before the pornographic scenes were made known.  Dr. Walsh has been, as I said, outspoken on this issue. Even before the pornographic scenes were exposed, Dr. Walsh, and I quote him as saying, this was not an appropriate game for our children, this violence training tool was rated ``M'' for mature, meaning the material was suitable for persons age 17 and older. Titles in this category may contain intense violence, blood and gore, sexual conduct, and/or strong language. The shooting of police officers, the killing of senior citizens for sport and winning points for sleeping with prostitutes and then killing them is not a game for 17-year-olds. It is disgusting, and it is a vile example of an industry with enormous potential being hijacked.  However, I would like to applaud two Minnesota-based retailers, Best Buy and Target, for their responsible and prudent decision to remove this so-called ``game'' from their shelves. I strongly support the intent of this resolution.  I would also like to enter for the Record two editorials, one from the Minneapolis Star Tribune and one from the New York Times, calling on action because of this game.           [From the Minneapolis Star Tribune, July 25, 2005]              Grand Theft/Absent Porn, Still Not for Teens       Take-Two Interactive and Rockstar Games must have thought      they were pulling a fast one on parents. Hidden in the      bestselling video game ``Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas''--     activated by an Internet download and a code--are scenes that      allow players to engage in virtual sex acts.       But the inside joke eventually went public. And people      didn't laugh.       Last week, the Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB)      slapped an AO (adults only 18-plus) rating on the popular      video game. Immediately, Wal-Mart, Target, Best Buy and      several other retailers pulled it from their shelves.      Rockstar, the game's developer, which for weeks blamed      ``outsiders'' for the sexually explicit modifications, now      admits that the retail version was produced with them on the      game. It has now ceased production of that version and will      produce one minus the pornography.       Before someone is tempted to nominate either company for a      Good Citizenship Award, keep in mind what will remain on the      game. ``Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas'' is definitely not      ``Ms. Pacman.'' An amazon.com review describes it as ``even      more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular      predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which      nearly any criminal act is possible. Players are free to      steal cars, beat up the local population for their money (or      weapons), make time with prostitutes, or simply roam to their      heart's content.''       The ``toned-down'' version will be rated Mature, making it      available for anyone 17 or older.       The violence in ``Grand Theft Auto'' is not an aberration.      Take-Two is excited about its upcoming release, ``Bully.''      Take-Two says ``you'll laugh and cringe as you stand up to      bullies, get picked on by teachers, play pranks on malicious      kids, win or lose the girl, and ultimately learn to navigate      the obstacles of the fictitious reform school, Bullworth      Academy.'' Given its track record with other games, it is      safe to assume gunplay will be featured prominently in      ``Bully.'' We wonder if the folks in Littleton, Colo., or      Cold Spring, Minn., will laugh.       This all alarms David Walsh, president and founder of the      National Institute on Media and the Family. His research      shows that the teen brain is still a work in progress,      struggling to manage sexual and violent impulses. These      games, which are marketed toward teens, should not be in the      hands of teens, he believes.       We agree. The rating system for video games simply doesn't      work. The ESRB was established by the Entertainment Software      Association. Advising the ESA is an executive from Take-Two      Entertainment, which owns Rockstar, which makes of ``Grand      Theft Auto.'' It's comparable to letting the defense attorney      serve as the jury foreman.       This industry repeatedly has shown it can't be trusted to      monitor itself. There is too much money to be made from young      people by keeping ratings standards relaxed, and there are no      penalties for companies that skirt the rules.       Parents aren't off the hook. They need to take more of an      interest in the kinds of games their children are playing.      But a truly independent oversight body is necessary. By      evaluating and rating these games, a proper oversight panel      would help arm parents with the information they need to      ensure the video games their children are playing are age-     appropriate.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, July 21, 2005]     Video Game Known for Violence Lands in Rating Trouble Over Sex                           (By Seth Schiesel)       Under pressure from Democratic senators, the board that      rates video games assigned the latest installment of the      Grand Theft Auto series an adults-only label yesterday,      effectively removing it form the shelves of most major retail      stores.       The decision comes a few weeks after independent      programmers uncovered a sexually suggestive scene that the      game's creators say was never meant to be seen.       The board's president, Patricia Vance, said yesterday that      the move was the first time in years that the group, the      Entertainment     Software Rating Board, had changed the rating for a game that      had already been released. The rating was changed to ``Adults      Only'' from ``Mature,'' which is meant to signal      appropriateness for players 17 and older.       Several top video game retailers, including Wal-Mart and      Target, said yesterday that they would no longer sells the      current version of the game, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.       Like the motion picture ratings system, the video game's      review system is nominally voluntary but usually compulsory      in practice. Just as major movie theater chains almost always      refuse to exhibit NC-17 movies, most mainstream retailers      refuse to stock adults-only games.       The game's developer, Rockstar Games, which is owned by      Take-Two Interactive, said yesterday that it would stop      making the current version of the game and would release a      new version as soon as possible.       Fueled by a mix of freewheeling play and rough-and-tumble      urban motifs, the Grand Theft Auto series has become one of      the world's most popular game franchises. According to the      NPD Group, a market research firm, the game had sold more      than 21 million copies since 2001 and had generated $924      million in revenue for Rockstar Games.       Even as game players, mostly young men, have flocked to the      series, politicians have signaled it out for its violence and      sexually suggestive material.       The franchise's latest installment, San Andreas, has sold      almost six million copies since its release in October but      has drawn close scrutiny in recent weeks after independent      game enthusiasts uncovered a sex-oriented ``minigame'' that      had been hidden in the program's code.       To unlock the hidden scene, a user must download a program      from the Internet known as Hot Coffee that was created by      fans of the game. The scene depicts mostly clothed digital      people performing sex movements.       ``An artist makes a painting, then doesn't like the first      version and paints over the canvas with a new painting,      right?'' said Rodney Walker, a spokesman for Rockstar Games.      ``That's what happened here. Hackers on the Internet made a      program that scratches the canvas to reveal an earlier draft      of the game.''       Yesterday's decision by the rating board is sure to fuel      tension between game companies and a subset of their players,      known as modders, who make modifications for their favorite      titles. Many companies, including Rockstar, have      traditionally encouraged modders as a way of extending the      life and relevance of their games.       But yesterday's action may also encourage publishers to      make their games less alterable so that they are not held      responsible for the changes the modders make or the old code      that they unearth.       In a statement, Take-Two said that it was considering legal      action against companies that help game players change the      content.       Game players can buy devices on Web sites that allow them      to alter games for consoles like Sony's PlayStation 2 that      are impossible for normal users to change. On personal      computers, users can change their games without special      hardware.       Ms. Vance, the board's president, said that the mere      presence of the Hot Coffee scene on the game disc, even in      locked form, was cause to change the rating.       This is the first time that we have dealt with a third-     party modification and this raises a number of issues that we      as an industry will have to deal with,'' Ms. Vance said.       ``We want to make it very clear to publishers that they      must clean up their product before shipping it.'' she said.      ``In the past they may have included content on the disc that      they never intended the audience to access, but now hackers      have sophisticated tools to unlock this stuff and the      publishers have to be sure to either disclose the material to      us or delete it.''       Yesterday's move came as the industry and the ratings board      have come under increasing political pressure. After reports      about the modification, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton,      Democrat of New York, called on the Federal Trade commission      last week to investigate the game's earlier mature rating.       Mr. Walker of Rockstar said the company intended to release      a new version of the game without the Hot Coffee code as soon      as possible.       Ms. Vance said such a move would restore the Mature rating,      and a Wal-Mart spokeswoman said that her company would almost      certainly restock the new version.       Nonetheless, Take-Two lowered its financial forecast for      its year that ends in October.       The company said it expected net sales for the year of      $1.26 billion to $1.31 billion, down from an earlier forecast      of $1.3 billion to 1.35 billion. The company said it expected      earnings of $1.05 to $1.12 a share, down from an earlier      forecast of $1.40 to $1.47 a share.  The Federal Trade Commission should look into this matter and investigate how this hidden material was placed in Grand Theft Auto. Parents across America must learn from this episode and participate and understand the games that their children are playing. They must play the games with their children when they bring them home and constantly review as the child progresses through the game, as the game changes. But right now what is needed more than ever is an independent rating system. We need it. We need it immediately.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
