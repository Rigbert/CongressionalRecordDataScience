Chairman, I yield myself 2\1/2\ minutes.  Mr. Chairman, I offer this amendment with the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. Myrick) and the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kind) in a bipartisan amendment for two main reasons: The first is cost.  What this amendment does, it says that none of the funds made available in this act may be used for embassy security, construction and maintenance. In essence it is about a $592 million savings amendment. I would note in a CRS document printed a couple of weeks ago, it states that the State Department has identified $990 million thus far for the new embassy in Baghdad. Fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2004 supplementals provided $35 million from the State's Diplomatic and Consular Program account, another $105 million came from the fourth quarter fiscal year 2004 Coalition Provisional Authority appropriations, and another $184 million of the Iraqi relief and reconstruction funds was designated for the embassy. This bill provides yet another some $590 million for this building.  The second reason that I support the amendment and oppose this provision in the bill is that we knew years ago that we were going to need a new embassy, and yet last summer when plans were laid for construction of this particular site it was not included in the omnibus appropriation bill taken up in November. The 2006 budget request which came up in February, no moneys were included in the President's budget request for that as well.  I would note that the National Taxpayers Union supports this amendment. I would also note that time and time again I supported more support for our troops, body armor, supported the President's request, but this embassy stuck into this bill with this process is not right.  We need regular order and that is why the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. Myrick) and the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kind) and I are offering this amendment on a bipartisan basis.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
