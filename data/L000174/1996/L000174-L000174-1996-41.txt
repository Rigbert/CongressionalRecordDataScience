President, on July 1, 1946, 27 World War II veterans formed the nucleus of a new military unit, and the Vermont Air National Guard was born. Today, when the 158th Fighter Wing pilots strap into the technological marvel that is the F-16, the Revolutionary War soldier painted on the tail stands as a stark reminder to us all: There is a direct lineage between the militia tradition that our Nation was founded on and which is very much alive today here in Vermont.  The original Green Mountain Boys were mostly farmers who left their homes in the 1700's to defend against encroaching New Yorkers and then fought enthusiastically against the British in the Revolutionary War. The Vermonters wore homespun civilian clothes, often with only a sprig of evergreen in their caps to identify each other in the field.  But the Green Mountain Boys were citizen soldiers, and throughout most of our history the American people have relied on the militia to defend them. It has only been in the recent past that we have created a large peacetime standing army. Now with the former Soviet Union gone, we are seeing a renewed emphasis on National Guard and Reserve forces as the Nation's premier insurance against worldwide aggression.  When I go to Vermont in the coming weeks, I will be giving the Vermont Air National Guard a token of my appreciation for the tremendous service that they have shown over the last 50 years. The list of aircraft that have been flown by the Vermont Air Guard reads like a who's who of American air power--the P-47 Thunderbolt, the P-51 Mustang, the F-94 Starfighter, F-89 Scorpion, the F-102 Delta Dagger, the EB-57, the F-4 Phantom, and now the F-16 Falcon. Those who have served in Vermont have different memories depending on the aircraft and people of the time, but the sense of duty has remained constant over the years.  Having said that, Randy Green, one of America's most renowned aviation artists, has painted a very special picture that perfectly captures the spirit of the Vermont Air Guard. Entitled, ``Vermont Thunder'' it is a depiction of a Vermont F-16 flying into a stormy sunset. To me it represents the great contrasts of flying military aircraft; the beauty of flight is tempered by the responsibility and danger of military service. It is my sincere hope that this painting will serve as a small reminder to future Air Guard members of our State's proud past.  As the ultimate reminder of that past, it is fitting that we remember here on the floor of the U.S. Senate the memories of those who paid the ultimate sacrifice for their service. The following is a list of Vermont Air National Guardsmen who have died in the line of duty since 1946:  Lieutenant Thomas A. Mundy, Major Carroll A. Phylblo, Lieutenant John Williamson, Lieutenant Francis W. Escott, Colonel Robert P. Goyette, Lieutenant Jeffrey B. Pollock, Major John J. Ulrich, Captain John A. Harrell, Captain Bertrand R. White, Jr., Captain Charles W. Diggle III, Captain Robert W. Noble, Lieutenant Stephen L.C. Taylor.                          ____________________
