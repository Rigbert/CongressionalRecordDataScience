We have had a lot of people who worked for the Senate and for our committees and worked for various Senator's offices who have been one of those 70. It is a proud achievement. I keep worrying when we are seeing somebody gilding the lily on this person, when we see his background and his history change constantly to make it better and better. Well, he has things to be proud of, but you wonder why his supporters have to constantly change it and embellish it.  Jeff Toobin, who has become a journalist, author, and legal commentator, was a student editor there that year. Actually, the supervising editor, who had a far more significant position, was none other than Elena Kagan. I mention this because my friends on the other side said that Mr. Estrada's being one of the 70 editors is reason to be on the court. Elena Kagan was a supervising editor. Now, that is really significant. Professor Kagan is a Harvard law professor. Professor Kagan served as Mr. Estrada's supervising editor, got the highest qualification by the ABA; and based on those qualifications, President Clinton nominated her to the DC Circuit.  I mention this because so much has been made by those on the other side, who say even if you are one of the 70 editors, and got a high qualification from the ABA, that should be enough. Elena Kagan was a law professor and was a supervising editor. She was nominated by President Clinton, but guess what happened.
