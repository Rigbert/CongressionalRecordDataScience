  Mr. McCAIN. I see the majority leader wants to speak, but my question is, isn't it true that there has been a series of meetings including the sponsors of the bill, those of us who believed significant modifications needed to be made, and large numbers of Senators have at least tentatively come to some agreement that we think could move this legislation forward in a fashion that recognizes the importance of the issue and yet dramatically, in our view, improves the legislation? I hope the Republican leader and majority leader would not interpret this vote--which clearly cloture will not be invoked--as an impediment to the process that I think was moving on a path where we could have reached some agreement and addressed this issue and this legislation conclusively.  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes, I say to my friend from Arizona, he is entirely correct. A vote not to finish the bill today is a vote to actually have amendments and an opportunity to modify the bill, as we all know is necessary, including my friend the majority leader, who indicated as much back in February.  I know the majority leader is on his feet and wants to discuss the matter further. I know he may have time commitments, but I do as well. I have two other issues I wish to address, and then I will be happy to yield the floor.
