Speaker, deception is at work in this House today as Congress considers an amendment to our Bill of Rights in the name of respecting our flag, when just last week the Speaker of this House and his emissaries voted to terminate the American flag service here in our Nation's Capital.  This flag office has served millions of Americans, and over the last decade over 1 million flags were purchased for special occasions by our citizens at cost; I underline ``at cost.''  Nobody should profit excessively from flying our flag. All Americans, even if they are not rich enough to travel here to Washington, should be able to get a flag flown over this Capitol.  Now that Speaker Gingrich will close down this patriotic service, are we to stick a red, white, and blue feather in our caps for passing a constitutional amendment when we cannot get flags anymore?                              {time}  1020  Mr. Speaker, the best way to show respect for our flag is to fly it. Shame on those who have put a price on flying our flag, and shame on those who would trample on our Constitution.                          ____________________
