President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2137       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``All Kids Health Insurance      Coverage Act of 2005''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Senate finds the following:       (1) There are more than 9,000,000 children in the United      States with no health insurance coverage.       (2) Uninsured children, when compared to privately insured      children, are --       (A) 3.5 times more likely to have gone without needed      medical, dental, or other health care;       (B) 4 times more likely to have delayed seeking medical      care;       (C) 5 times more likely to go without needed prescription      drugs; and       (D) 6.5 times less likely to have a regular source of care.       (3) Children without health insurance coverage are at a      disadvantage in the classroom, as shown by the following      studies:       (A) The Florida Healthy Kids Annual Report published in      1997, found that children who do not have health care      coverage are 25 percent more likely to miss school.       (B) A study of the California Health Families program found      that children enrolled in public health coverage experienced      a 68 percent improvement in school performance and school      attendance.       (C) A 2002 Building Bridges to Healthy Kids and Better      Students study conducted by the Council of Chief State School      Officers in Vermont concluded that children who started out      without health insurance saw their reading scores more than      double after obtaining health care coverage.       (4) More than half of uninsured children in the United      States are eligible for coverage under either the State      Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) or Medicaid, but      are not enrolled in those safety net programs.       (5) Some States, seeing that the Federal Government is not      providing assistance to middle class families who are unable      to afford health insurance, are trying to extend health care      coverage to some or all children in the State.       (6) State efforts to cover all children may not be      successful without financial assistance from the Federal      Government.     SEC. 3. ELIGIBILITY OF ALL UNINSURED CHILDREN FOR SCHIP.       (a) In General.--Section 2110(b) of the Social Security Act      (42 U.S.C. 1397jj(b)) is amended--       (1) in paragraph (1)--       (A) by striking subparagraph (B); and       (B) by redesignating subparagraph (C) as subparagraph (B);       (2) in paragraph (2)--       (A) by striking ``include'' and all that follows through      ``a child who is an'' and inserting ``include a child who is      an''; and       (B) by striking the semicolon and all that follows through      the period and inserting a period; and       (3) by striking paragraph (4).

(4) Section 2102(b)(3)(E), section 2105(a)(1)(D)(ii),      paragraphs (1)(C) and (2) of section 2107, and subsections      (a)(1) and (d)(1)(B) of section 2108 of such Act (42 U.S.C.      1397bb(b)(3)(E); 1397ee(a)(1)(D)(ii); 1397gg; 1397hh) are      amended by striking ``low-income'' each place it appears.
