 President, it is never too late to honor great heroism and sacrifice. That is why I am proud to say that after 40 years, a brave Kentuckian lost in battle will finally return home with honor to American soil.  On May 12, 1968, MAJ John Lee McElroy of the U.S. Air Force undertook what would be his final mission. Stationed in the Quang Tin province of the Republic of Vietnam, he was the navigator on a C-130 Hercules aircraft when his plane was struck by intense enemy fire and crashed. There were no survivors.  ``On this particular day [Major McElroy] was flying a most important mission of aerial evacuation for American and allied personnel,'' wrote COL Marion F. Garuthers, the major's commander, in a letter to his parents. ``His example of Christian living significantly influenced all persons with whom he associated.''  Sadly, while the family of Major McElroy knew his final fate, they did not get to say their final goodbyes. For four decades, his remains went unrecovered. His wife, Regina M. McElroy, and his parents, Oscar L. and Gladys V. McElroy, passed away never knowing iftheir loved one's remains would be found and brought back to the United States.  Now, thanks to the work of some dedicated men and women in the Department of Defense, Major McElroy's remains have been identified. Along with the rest of his flight crew, Major McElroy will return from Vietnam and join the honored few who rest in Arlington National Cemetery.  Born in Eminence, KY, in 1932, Major McElroy served his country in the Armed Forces for 12 years. Several months after his tragic death, he was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal and the Purple Heart for his valor in uniform.  At that medal ceremony were Major McElroy's three children--Russell Lee McElroy, Mary McElroy Tucker, and Linda Anne McElroy Starnes. Russell, the oldest, was just 14 years old at the time.  Now every one of them is older than their father ever was. And now it's their turn to take care of the father who cared for them, by seeing him laid to rest this December 18 in a hero's grave.  Our Nation and the Commonwealth of Kentucky cannot be grateful enough for MAJ John Lee McElroy's service and immense sacrifice. We owe the McElroy family a debt that cannot be repaid, because he died defending all of us and our freedoms.  I know the entire U.S. Senate joins me in expressing comfort and pride that this courageous airman has finally returned home. It is never too late to honor our heroes. And it is never too late for one Kentucky family to say their farewells and see a hero rest in peace.                          ____________________
