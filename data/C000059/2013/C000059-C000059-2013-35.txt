Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to our country are exceptional. Today, the City of Norco will recognize and honor Army Specialist George Alan Ingalls for his ultimate sacrifice and proclaim today George Alan Ingalls Day.  George was a Norco resident who died in Vietnam on April 16, 1967. On that day, he threw himself onto a grenade to save the lives of the members of his squad. For his gallantry and self-devotion to his unit, George posthumously received the Congressional Medal of Honor.  In his youth, George was active in local sports, and attended Norco Junior High and later Corona High School. He also served as President of the youth group at the Community Church of Norco.  As we look at the incredibly rich military history of our country we realize that this history is comprised of men, just like George, who bravely fought for the ideals of freedom and democracy. Each story is unique and humbling for those of us who, far from the dangers they have faced, live our lives in relative comfort and ease. The goodness George brought to this world and the sacrifice he has made will always be remembered.                          ____________________
