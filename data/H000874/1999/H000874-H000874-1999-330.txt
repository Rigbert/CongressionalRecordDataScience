Speaker, last Friday, I attended the Eighth Annual Wreathlaying Ceremony commemorating the Anniversary of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial's Dedication. Although I have attended these commemorations in the past, this year's ceremony was particularly touching.  Over the course of this decade, our federal, state and local law enforcement officers increasingly have faced dangerous conditions in communities around the Nation. During the 1990s, an average of more than 62,000 officers were assaulted, more than 21,000 were injured and 160 were killed in the line of duty each year. The walls of the Law Enforcement Officer's Memorial are lined with more than 14,000 names, including three of our very own Capitol Police Officers--Officer Jacob J. Chesnut, Detective John Gibson and Officer Christopher Eney.  Every single day, the men and women of law enforcement put their lives on the line to protect and serve large and small communities across this Nation. They risk their lives to make ours safe and secure. Whether as a border patrol agent, state trooper, or community-oriented police officer, all face the ultimate sacrifice in upholding the laws that serve as the foundation to our democratic form of government.  Below you will find that text of remarks made by Mrs. Shirley Gibson. Mrs. Gibson is the mother of Officer Brian Gibson, one of 160 police officers killed in the line of duty in 1997 and one of three officers from the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department to be killed during a three-month period in that year. Officer Gibson was brutally gunned down outside of a District night club not far from this Chamber.  Since Brian's death almost two years ago, Mrs. Gibson has formed a local chapter of theConcerns of Police Survivors. I salute her efforts to remember Brian and the thousands of other officers that have left behind family and friends while making the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty.       Mrs. Gibson: I feel qualified to stand here today and      represent the survivors of each name inscribed on the walls      of this beautiful Memorial. I see so much more than names on      these walls. I see husbands and wives, fathers and mothers,      brothers and sisters, sons and daughters. I see my son's      face. His name was added to these walls two short years ago,      along with the names of two fellow Metropolitan Police      Department officers, Oliver Smith, Jr. and Robert Johnson,      all killed in a span of three months.       640 law enforcement officers' names from the District of      Columbia and the Metropolitan area are included in the more      than 14,0000 names that line these walls.       This Memorial recognizes all law enforcement, whether      federal, state or local, and pays tribute to those officers      killed in the line of duty. There are no boundaries in the      family of law enforcement. The grief, shock, and anger felt      that the deaths of U.S. Capitol Police Officer J.J. Chestnut      and Detective John Gibson, and the support from MPD and other      departments here and around the country, is an example of how      law enforcement is truly a family.       To survivors, this is a place that evokes a flood of      emotions. I remember seeing my son Brian's name being      inscribed on the wall, and the pride I felt mixed with the      pain. Pride, knowing that my son was an outstanding officer      who was killed during what he loved most, and that his name      was being memorialized for all who love him to see and      remember. Pain, because I realized that Brian's name would      not be the last name inscribed here. Since Brian's death,      there have been many more names added, and as much as we pray      that there will be no more, we realize that it is inevitable.      To those law enforcement officers who diligently continue the      job that Brian and the thousands of others here died for, the      message this Memorial sends is that you are appreciated, you      are needed and you make the world a safer place for law-     abiding citizens.       On this, the eighth anniversary of the dedication this      Memorial, another message is clearly sent. That message is      that the role of Law Enforcement Officers will never be      diminished, that the names inscribed here and the names      attached to every law enforcement badge, convey the strength,      courage, and valor symbolized by the imposing lions with      guard the entrance to this Memorial.       The survivors who visit this Memorial find a quiet place of      remembrance, dignity and pride. A mother from New York called      me a few weeks after Police Week this year. Her only son had      been honored. When she returned home, the desire to come back      to the Memorial was so strong, that a few days later she      boarded a train to Union Station, got a taxi and came here to      simply spend the day looking at her son's name and remembered      faces of those who advocated peace. A place where the wind      whispers ``Always remembered. Never forgotten.'' A place      worthy of the name of those who sacrificed their lives in the      line of duty.  God Bless the Gibson Family and God Bless the thousands of families whose loved ones are remembered on the walls of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. Their tremendous sacrifice will never be forgotten. We will forever be in their debt.                          ____________________
