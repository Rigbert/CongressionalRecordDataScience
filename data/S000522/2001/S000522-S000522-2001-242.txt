FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) Viet Nam is a one-party state, ruled and controlled by      the Vietnamese Communist Party.       (2) The Government of Viet Nam denies the people of Viet      Nam the right to change their government and prohibits      independent political, social, and labor organizations.       (3)(A) The Government of Viet Nam consistently pursues a      policy of harassment, discrimination, and intimidation, and      sometimes of imprisonment and other forms of detention,      against those who peacefully express dissent from government      or party policy.       (B) Recent victims of such mistreatment, which violates the      rights to freedom of expression and association recognized in      the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, include Dr. Nguyen      Dan Que, Dr. Nguyen Thanh Giang, General Tran Do, Most      Venerable Thich Huyen Quang, Most Venerable     Thich Quang Do, Father Nguyen Van Ly, numerous leaders of the      Hoa Hao Buddhist Church and of independent Protestant      churches, and an undetermined number of members of the      Montagnard ethnic minority groups who participated in      peaceful demonstrations in the Central Highlands of Viet Nam      during February 2001.       (4) The Government of Viet Nam systematically deprives its      citizens of the fundamental right to freedom of religion.      Although some freedom of worship is permitted, believers are      forbidden to participate in religious activities except under      circumstances rigidly defined and controlled by the      government:       (A) In 1999 the Government issued a Decree Concerning      Religious Activities, which declared in pertinent part that      ``[a]ll activities using religious belief in order to oppose      the State of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, to prevent      the believers from carrying out civic responsibilities, to      sabotage the union of all the people, to against the healthy      culture of our nation, as well as superstitious activities,      will be punished in conformity with the law''.       (B) The Unified Buddhist Church of Viet Nam (UCBV), the      largest religious denomination in the country, has been      declared illegal by the Government, and over the last twenty-     five years its clergy have often been imprisoned and      subjected to other forms of persecution. The Patriarch of the      Unified Buddhist Church, 83-year-old Most Venerable Thich      Huyen Quang, has been detained for 21 years in a ruined      temple in an isolated area of central Viet Nam. Most      Venerable Thich Quang Do, the Executive President of the      Unified Buddhist Church, has also been in various forms of      detention for many years, and was recently rearrested and      placed under house arrest after he had proposed to bring Most      Venerable Thich Huyen Quang to Saigon for medical treatment.       (C) The Hoa Hao Buddhist Church was also declared to be      illegal until 1999, when the Government established an      organization which purports to govern the Hoa Hao. According      to the United States Commission on International Religious      Freedom, ``[t]his organization is made up almost entirely of      Communist Party members and apparently is not recognized as      legitimate by the vast majority of Hoa Haos . . .      [n]evertheless, [this government-sponsored organization] has      sought to control all Hoa Hao religious activity,      particularly at the Hoa Hao village, which is the center of      Hoa Hao religious life''. Hoa Hao believers who do not      recognize the legitimacy of the government organization are      denied the right to visit the Hoa Hao village, to conduct      traditional religious celebrations, or to display Hoa Hao      symbols. Many have been arrested and subjected to      administrative detention, and several Hoa Hao have been      sentenced to prison terms for protesting these denials of      religious freedom.       (D) Independent Protestants, most of whom are members of      ethnic minority groups, are subjected to particularly harsh      treatment by the Government of Viet Nam. According to the      United States Commission on International Religious Freedom,      such treatment includes ``police raids on homes and house      churches, detention, imprisonment, confiscation of religious      and personal property, physical and psychological abuse, and      fines for engaging in unapproved religious activities (such      as collective worship, public religious expression and      distribution of religious literature, and performing      baptisms, marriages, or funeral services) . . . [i]n      addition, it is reported that ethnic Hmong Protestants have      been forced by local officials to agree to abandon their      faith''.       (E) Other religious organizations, such as the Catholic      Church, are formally recognized by the Government but are      subjected to pervasive regulation which violates the right to      freedom of religion. For instance, the Catholic Church is      forbidden to appoint its own bishops without Government      consent, which is frequently denied, to accept seminarians      without specific official permission, and to profess Catholic      doctrines which are inconsistent with Government policy. A      Catholic priest, Father Nguyen Van Ly, was arrested in March      2001 and remains in detention after submitting written      testimony to the United States Commission on International      Religious Freedom.       (F) The Government has also confiscated numerous churches,      temples, and other properties belonging to religious      organizations. The vast majority of these properties--even      those belonging to religious organizations formally      recognized by the Government--have never been returned.       (5) Since 1975 the Government of Viet Nam has persecuted      veterans of the Army of the Republic of Viet Nam and other      Vietnamese who had opposed the Viet Cong insurgency and the      North Vietnamese invasion of South Viet Nam. Such persecution      typically included substantial terms in ``re-education      camps'', where detainees were often subjected to torture and      other forms of physical abuse, and in which many died. Re-     education camp survivors and their families were often forced      into internal exile in ``New Economic Zones''. Many of these      former allies of the United States, as well as members of      their families, continue until the present day to suffer      various forms of harassment and discrimination, including      denial of basic social benefits and exclusion from higher      education and employment.       (6)(A) The Government of Viet Nam has been particularly      harsh in its treatment of members of the Montagnard ethnic      minority groups of the Central Highlands of Viet Nam, who      were the first line in the defense of South Viet Nam against      invasion from the North and who fought courageously beside      members of the Special Forces of the United States Army,      suffering disproportionately heavy casualties, and saving the      lives of many of their American and Vietnamese comrades-in-     arms.       (B) Since 1975 the Montagnard peoples have been singled out      for severe repression, in part because of their past      association with the United States and in part because their      strong commitment to their traditional way of life and to      their Christian religion is regarded as inconsistent with the      absolute loyalty and control demanded by the Communist      system.       (C) In February 2001 several thousand Montagnards      participated in a series of peaceful demonstrations      throughout the Central Highlands, demanding religious freedom      and restoration of their confiscated lands, and the      Government responded by closing off the Central Highlands and      sending in military forces, tanks, and helicopter gunships.       (D) Credible reports by refugees who have escaped to      Cambodia indicate that the Government has executed some      participants in the demonstrations and has subjected others      to imprisonment, torture, and other forms of physical abuse.       (E) The Government of Viet Nam has also taken steps to      prevent further Montagnards from escaping, and there are      credible reports that Vietnamese security forces in Cambodia      are offering bounties for the surrender of Montagnard asylum      seekers.       (7) The Government of Viet Nam has also persecuted members      of other ethnic minority groups, including the Khmer Krom      from the Mekong Delta, many of whom fought alongside United      States military personnel during the Viet Nam war and whose      Hinayana Buddhist religion is not among those recognized by      the Government.       (8) The Government of Viet Nam also engages in or condones      serious violations of the rights of workers. In August 1997,      the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) reported that      child labor exploitation is on the rise in Viet Nam with tens      of thousands of children under 15 years of age being      subjected to such exploitation. The government's official      labor export program also has subjected workers, many of whom      are women, to involuntary servitude, debt bondage, and other      forms of abuse, and the reaction of government officials to      worker complaints of such abuse has been to threaten the      workers with punishment if they do not desist in their      complaints.       (9)(A) United States refugee resettlement programs for      Vietnamese nationals, including the Orderly Departure Program      (ODP), the Resettlement Opportunities for Returning      Vietnamese (ROVR) program, and resettlement of boat people      from refugee camps throughout Southeast Asia, were authorized      by law in order to rescue Vietnamese nationals who have      suffered persecution on account of their wartime associations      with the United States, as well as those who currently have a      well-founded fear of persecution on account of race,      religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a      particular social group.       (B) In general, these programs have served their purpose      well. However, many refugees who were eligible for these      programs were unfairly denied or excluded, in some cases by      vindictive or corrupt Communist officials who controlled      access to the programs, and in others by United States      personnel who imposed unduly restrictive interpretations of      program criteria. These unfairly excluded refugees include      some of those with the most compelling cases, including many      Montagnard combat veterans and their families.       (10) The Government of Viet Nam systematically jams      broadcasts by Radio Free Asia, an independent broadcast      service funded by the United States in order to provide news      and entertainment to the people of countries in Asia whose      governments deny the right to freedom of expression and of      the press.       (11) In 1995 the Governments of the United States and Viet      Nam announced the ``normalization'' of diplomatic relations.      In 1998 then-President Clinton waived the application of      section 402 of the Trade Act of 1974 (commonly known as the      ``Jackson-Vanik Amendment''), which restricts economic      assistance to countries with non-market economies whose      governments also restrict freedom of emigration. In 1999 the      Governments of the United States and Viet Nam announced      ``agreement in principle'' on a bilateral trade agreement.      This agreement was signed in 2000 and has been presented to      Congress for approval or disapproval.       (12) The Congress and the American people are united in      their determination that the extension or expansion of trade      relations with a country whose government engages in serious      and systematic violations of fundamental human rights must      not be construed as a statement of approval or complacency      about such practices. The promotion of freedom and democracy      around the world--and particularly for people who have      suffered in large part because of their past associations      with the United States and because they share our values--is      and must continue to be a central objective of United States      foreign policy.     SEC. 102. PURPOSE.       The purpose of this Act is to promote the development of      freedom and democracy in Viet Nam.

(2) Continuation of assistance in the national interest.--     Notwithstanding the failure of the Government of Viet Nam to      meet the requirements of subsection (a)(2), the President may      waive the application of subsection (a) for any fiscal year      if the President determines that the provision to the      Government of Viet Nam of increased United States      nonhumanitarian assistance would promote the purposes of this      Act or is otherwise in the national interest of the United      States.
