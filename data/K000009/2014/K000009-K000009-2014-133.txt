Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the people of Ukraine on conducting free and fair elections that the world watched closely. As a beloved friend of mine from Ukraine wrote me:       These elections were amazing. People were standing in long      lines with the purpose to vote. And we did it. We do hope      that we will start to live in a new way. Ukrainians deserve      much better in life and in leaders. Thank you.  With a nearly 60 percent turnout, and despite the fearful invasion by Russia of Ukraine's eastern provinces, the election proceeded on schedule and without major disruption. This is a living testament to the future and the hopes the Ukrainian people invested in their new government.  The people of our region send heartfelt congratulations to the incoming Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. A successful businessman in his own Nation, he now holds a historic opportunity to lead Ukraine to write a new era of stability, prosperity, and democratic reform. It will be a major undertaking. May the hopes of the Ukrainian people for a better life be realized in our time.  Ukraine can rise to be one of the greatest nations on the European continent. Her time is now.                          ____________________
