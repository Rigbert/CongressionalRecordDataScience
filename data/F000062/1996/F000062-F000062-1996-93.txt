 I appreciate what the Senator is saying. But when you continue to read the report that you were reading from the Congressional Budget Office, it does say:       While the new mandates imposed by the bill would result in      additional costs to some States, the repeal of existing      mandates and the additional flexibility provided are likely      to reduce spending by more than the additional costs.  That cannot be true for California. In a way, it is a play with words because the numbers are so big in California in terms of 52 percent of the impact of this section of the bill with SSI falling on California. Fifty-two percent of all of the SSI users are in California. That is who you are talking about. Those are the elderly. Those are the blind. Those are the disabled. By this bill, boom, they are off. That is the issue that both of us are trying to bring respectfully to your attention.  What I do not understand is--and I understand the savings. See, the reason this section of the bill has the large amount of savings that it does is because of California, because $7 to $9 billion of it is California. The minute you transfer it and it goes to the county--because California alone is a proposition 13 State and cannot raise its property tax to accommodate the general assistance added burden--you could force some counties--and LA could be one under this; you just have to know this because the numbers are so huge in Los Angeles. It is a very precipitous situation.
