 I am aware that the bill already contains a considerable increase for the program but it still remains well below what is essential to sustain a viable international narcotics effort.  In the last several years, funding for our international narcotics program has been in a free fall. In addition, the administration has failed to articulate a coherent strategy or consistently defend the programs that it has put forward. This has left the impression that it does not care about the drug program, does not see fit to push its own ideas.  Some in Congress seem to have concluded from this that the drug program does not work and that the money can do better service someplace else.  Both views are wrong.  When we made the drug issue a continuing policy concern we saw success. And when we provided our efforts with adequate guidance and support, backed up by the moral authority of the government in support of the public, we made significant progress on the drug problem. We saw the result in steady declines in use, the most important barometer of how we are doing.  We can also see the results of a retreat from our earlier commitment. In the last 2 years we have seen marijuana use among 12-17-year-olds soar, up 50 percent. At this rate, within the next year or so we will have wiped out the gains made in reducing use over the last 13 years. It is from this new, emerging user population that tomorrow's addicts will come. The situation reminds me of what happended to us in the 1970's. We let indifference get the better of us. We had to suffer a major drug epidemic to learn our lesson. We cannot afford to let that lesson go to waste.  It is a national tragedy if we let drug use escape us again. With serious effort we reversed the worst years of drug abuse. What clearer indication can there be of the effects of meaningful effort and indifferent effort than in these contrasting pictures.  More important, I would remind my colleagues that it has been Congress that has lead the effort in representing the public's interest on the drug question. In 1986 and 1988, we moved to increase both the funding for our drug efforts and to put pressure on the administration to take forceful action. We saw results. Just this year, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Senators Helms and Coverdell, took the lead in putting pressure on Colombia to do something about arresting drug kingpins, something everyone told us could not and would not happen. Well, it happened in jig time. Consistency and meaning what you say are still solid currency, here and abroad. It is that kind of fortitude and stick-with-it-ness that we still need.  We still have a substantial responsibility to represent the American public on the drug issue. And we still have the need to be the leaders in insisting on adequate funding for well-executed programs. This does not mean we have to measure our drug efforts by impossible standards of success. We need to be realistic and we need to be consistent.  Given recent gains in putting drug kingpins behind bars in Colombia we also need to build on our efforts to go after the second and third tier of cartel leaders. This means continued support for our international programs.  I would also remind my colleagues, that the money we spend on this foreign assistance program goes directly to support efforts aimed at individuals and groups that target Americans, whose actions daily kill and wound more people than all the terrorists combined. Drug dealers, here and abroad, are real enemies whose actions have direct and immediate consequences on the quality of life in our homes and on our streets. Money spent on this international program pays real benefits here. We can see the result when we are willing to act and we can see the consequences when we fail.  I support the amendment to increase the international narcotics program by a further $20 million, which still brings the total international effort in at over $40 million below the administration's request. This funding will help us do the job we must continue to do.                           amendment no. 2738  (Purpose: To provide for the transfer of excess defense articles to                                 Estonia)       At the end of section 546 of the bill, insert the      following:       (c) The President may transfer to Estonia such excess      defense articles as the President determines necessary to      help modernize the defense capabilities of Estonia, subject      to the requirements of subsections (b) through (f) of section      519 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2321m).
