Speaker, reclaiming my time, and I appreciate the information, of course I do not have the specifics on what the house colored white agreed to in terms of a number; but I might inquire, is that number that they are keeping down the deficit more or less than the deficit we would add by the tax bill we passed just minutes ago?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would further yield, actually it would be much less because, as we all know and history has proven, as we give tax relief and tax cuts, revenues go up as a result of those tax cuts. So our tax cuts are more than covered by revenues that are gained.
