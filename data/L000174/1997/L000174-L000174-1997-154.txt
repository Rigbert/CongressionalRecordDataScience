President, Chairman Gregg and the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State and the Judiciary recognize in the Report for S. 1022 that the ``pace of technological change in the telecommunications industry poses enormous challenge'' both to law enforcement and national security agencies in conducting court-authorized wiretaps and ``in the conduct of foreign counterintelligence and terrorism investigations in the United States.'' The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act [CALEA], which I sponsored in the 103d Congress, addressed this public safety and national security problem, after considerable debate and hearings in the Judiciary Committees of both the House and the Senate. I commend the chairman and the subcommittee for recognizing ``that digital telephony is a top law enforcement priority.''  CALEA authorizes $500 million for the Attorney General to pay telecommunications carriers for costs associated with modifying the embedded base of equipment, services, and facilities to comply with CALEA. Nevertheless, S. 1022 does not include any funding for this law, based upon the Committee's finding ``that the Bureau has adequate resources available.''  Moreover, the report recommends that no funds be expended for CALEA until the following requirements are met: First, the Bureau creates a working group with industry officials approved by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, and second, the working group develops a new ``more rational, reasonable, and cost-effective CALEA implementation plan'' that is satisfactory to the Senate Appropriations Committee.  Would Chairman Gregg agree with me that in addition to the Appropriations Committees, the Judiciary Committees of both the House and Senate, which authorized CALEA, should also be involved in approving the industry officials on the working group and any plan provided by the working group?
