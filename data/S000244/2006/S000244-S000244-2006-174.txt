Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1054, I call up the bill (H.R. 4772) to simplify and expedite access to the Federal courts for injured parties whose rights and privileges under the United States Constitution have been deprived by final actions of Federal agencies or other government officials or entities acting under color of State law, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
