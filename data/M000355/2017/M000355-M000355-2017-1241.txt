 President, on another matter, like those who have called for relief from ObamaCare, many Americans across the Nation are counting on us to ensure better quality healthcare for our veterans. This is a critical issue for each of us no matter what State we come from, no matter what party we represent. Our veterans have sacrificed too much. In return, they deserve our support. We must keep the commitment we have to them when it comes to ensuring that the VA is providing the quality healthcare they rely on.  Unfortunately, as we all know, many VA facilities across the Nation have long failed to provide our Nation's heroes with the timely and effective medical attention they need. Already, Congress has taken a number of steps to improve these facilities for our veterans and to keep the faith for thosewho have willingly and courageously fought on our behalf.  Now we can build on those efforts by passing the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act. As the name implies, this legislation will enhance accountability measures at the VA and better enable the Department to remove--to remove--employees who are failing to meet the standards expected of them.  This bill, in conjunction with the continued administration efforts like those Secretary Shulkin announced yesterday, will further improve medical services offered to our veterans at VA facilities all across our country. It was unfortunate to see this legislation held up in a previous Congress, but I am proud that the Republican Senate has made its passage among our top priorities.  I once again recognize Veterans' Affairs Committee chairman Johnny Isakson and Senator Rubio for the part they played in moving this very important bill forward and remaining vigilant on behalf of America's veterans. I know we are all eager to advance it today and send it on down to the White House for the President's signature.                          ____________________
