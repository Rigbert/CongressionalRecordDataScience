 President, I would like to wish a happy, if slightly belated, 70th birthday to Norm Brownstein--a dedicated husband, father, and grandfather, and a talented and effective advocate for the alliance between the United States and Israel.  Norm's story is a classic American tale of a young man rising from humble beginnings to achieve big things. Born to an immigrant family, Norm was orphaned at an early age and faced a number of hardships. But he did not let that stop him from working hard or realizing his dreams--even if they differed from his original goal of becoming a dentist. In fact, Norm became the first member of his family to graduate from college and received both undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Colorado-Boulder.  He then opened a law firm with two fellow UC-Boulder law graduates in the 1960s. In the ensuing decades, that firm would transform into an agency with hundreds of employees and offices in all corners of the country.  And, as a board member of the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee, Norm would also establish himself as a well-regarded supporter of the State of Israel and the relationship between our two countries. Clearly passionate on the issue, Norm has made his case effectively to numerous policymakers over the years--Republicans and Democrats alike.  As he looks back over his 70 years, though, I think Norm will be most proud of his role as a father of three, a grandfather of four, and as a husband.  So, today, please allow me to wish Norm a happy birthday, and to also wish him good health in the years to come.                          ____________________
