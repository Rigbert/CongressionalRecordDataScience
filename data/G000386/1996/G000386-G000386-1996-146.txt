 President, yesterday's display by the President of the United States, snapping at reporters' questions about the Billy Dale bill, says a lot to me.  First, it tells me the President has once again gone back on his word. This is not a surprise. It has happened so often with this President. And to be fair to him, he is certainly not the first politician that has gone back on his word, from either party.  Yet, this President has championed the little guy. He came to town declaring war against all the wrongs resulting from the Washington political culture. Then, his own White House committed such a wrong.  Initially, the President did the right thing. He said his staff had made a mistake. They had handled the matter wrong. Their display of cronyism and favoritism was at the expense of the careers and reputations of seven dedicated public servants and their families.  All the while, the President's staff was waging war against the character of these seven. It's also known as character assassination. After that, the White House launched the IRS and the FBI to harass them, as if to justify the staff's wrongdoing.  Then, they sent the Justice Department out to prosecute them. They had the full force of the Federal Government out after these seven public servants and their families.  The case went to trial. And it took no time at all for a jury to acquit Billy Dale. That is how trumped up the charges were. A jury had no problem seeing that.  Clearly, the White House drove Mr. Dale and the others right out of town with no justification. It was pure, naked politics, cronyism and favoritism. And when a White House uses the powers and resources of the Nation's No. 1 law enforcement agency, the Nation's tax collecting agency--which also happens to be the No. 1 harassment agency--and the Nation's No. 1 prosecution department, against innocent workers and their families, try telling the public that's not grotesquely wrong.  And that is why Congress moved to reimburse Mr. Dale and the others for their legal expenses.  Even the President, after the acquittal, said he regretted what Mr. Dale had to go through. But the President has now decided that the right move is to reverse himself and defend what his staff did to these seven families. He defends zealous White House staffers using the full powers and resources of the Federal Government to harass innocent people. He lines up on the side of politics, cronyism and favoritism. He fails to right a wrong that was perpetrated by the Washington culture of politics.  The President did another reversal as well. After the acquittal, the President's personal attorney, Robert Bennett, issued an inappropriate and sour-grapes response. Mr. Bennett improperly discussed in public a confidential matter involving a plea agreement he alleged Billy Dale's attorney offered. Billy Dale denies the allegation.  Upon Mr. Bennett discussing confidential information, the White House rightly said Mr. Bennett had stepped over the line. His comments were objectionable and improper. The reason is, plea negotiations are confidential. Rules exist to protect that confidentiality. Mr. Bennett may have violated the intent of those rules. And so the White House admonished him.  It turns out, Mr. President, that the plea agreement issue came up again yesterday. In public. Notwithstanding the rules of confidentiality.  But this time, the White House didn't issue a statement of admonishment.That's because it was discussed by none other than the President himself. The President of the United States is discussing confidential information in the public arena. And in the process, he's doing exactly the same thing that his office had admonished the President's attorney for doing earlier this year.  So here is what we have learned from the President's skirmish yesterday with reporters. First, he has now done a U-turn and allowed himself to get caught up in the mean-spirited attitude of his zealous political staff. Second, he has allowed himself to stoop to the level of the leakers and character assassins by discussing confidential information. Is this behavior befitting of what is expected of the President of the United States?  At the same time, the President has not kept his eye on the central issue--the clear need to right the wrong perpetrated by zealous White House agents.  Mr. President, this Travelgate issue is marked by a curious but telling phenomenon. At the beginning, the President was saying one thing, but the government he runs was doing the opposite. Obviously, we don't want or expect this in a Presidency. You want the President to say one thing, and have those in his control do that one thing, too. You want uniformity. You want the ``saying'' and the ``doing'' to be one and the same.  But there is another variable in the equation. In the Travelgate matter, the President's words reflected the right thing, and his staff's deeds reflected the wrong thing. So the President, in seeking uniformity, made the wrong choice. Instead of making his administration conform to his admirable utterances, he went native with the wrong side. That is why he is now attacking Billy Dale like his attorney did; and that is why he has suddenly decided he will not sign the bill.  Mr. President, this episode shows that the President has failed to uphold the principle of justice, fairness, and right vs. wrong in this matter. The test of any leader is to view his actions on matters that happen in his own back yard, or which affect him personally. [This is one such matter.] And to me, the President has failed that test of leadership.  By not doing the right thing--and in fact, by now joining the wrong side in the campaign to assassinate one's character--he has undercut his own moral authority as a leader. He has abdicated his responsibility to see that justice was done for seven of his own former employees and their families. He has abandoned his commitment to stand up for the little guy. In a sense--it is okay to stand up for all these high and mighty principles--jut not in my back yard.  And that is why, Mr. President, the President's about face in the Billy Dale matter is disappointing to me. And it tells me much about his leadership capacity.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
