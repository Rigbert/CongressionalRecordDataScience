Speaker, I stand before you today to pay tribute to an American hero, Mr. George Sajewych, a U.S. citizen who experienced firsthand the violence in Kiev while peacefully assembling in solidarity with the people of Ukraine.  An esteemed, long-time retired broadcaster for the Voice of America, originally from Chicago, Mr. Sajewych was one of many journalists to have endured ruthless violence firsthand when he was beaten by Berkut police forces.  The attack left him bleeding in the street, surrounded by the shreds of the helmet that he had worn for protection. His motorcycle helmet shattered by the beating. He was hospitalized after having suffered serious injuries.  I commend Mr. Sajewych for his fortitude and continuing resolve in standing for freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of the press, the fundamentals of an open society.  I urge our President to swiftly impose targeted financial and travel sanctions on any Ukrainian Government official found to have endorsed this brutal violence and to channel all financial assistance offered by our country to Ukraine only to those who are committed to upholding the rights of freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of press.  Let us praise Mr. Sajewych for his courage and inspiration, standing at liberty's side.                          ____________________
