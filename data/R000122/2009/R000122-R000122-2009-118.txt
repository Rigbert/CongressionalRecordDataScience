President, this is a bipartisan effort to reform our homeless programs. This amendment would simplify the application process, give greater flexibility and accountability at the local level. It would also provide additional resources to prevent homelessness. We are in the midst of a huge crisis in terms of people who literally cannot find housing. We have pictures in newspapers of tent cities sprouting up all across the country. We need to act.  This amendment is bipartisan and is supported by Senator Bond and, before him, Senator Allard, and Senators Boxer, Collins, Durbin, Kerry, Lautenberg, Lieberman, Schumer, and Whitehouse. It is good, sensible reform legislation that will make our programs more effective and, hopefully, prevent people from losing their homes and keep them away from these tent cities that are sprouting up. I urge its passage.
