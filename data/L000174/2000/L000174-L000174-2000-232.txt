President, as the Senate debates the FY 2001 Interior and Related Appropriations Act, I would like to take a moment to ask the distinguished subcommittee Chairman and Ranking Member a clarifying question concerning Section 329 of the bill. That section, as my colleagues know, contains language concerning the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol.  Mr. President, the Senate has clearly expressed its views regarding the Kyoto Protocol in S. Res. 98, the Byrd-Hagel resolution adopted unanimously by the Senate on July 25, 1997. That resolution calls on the Administration to support an approach to climate change that protects the economic interests of the United States and seeks commitments from developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Administration is aggressively engaging developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through international projects and activities emphasizing market-based mechanisms and environmental technology. Furthermore, the U.S. is currently engaged in climate change negotiations to ensure meaningful participation of developing countries and to ensure that greenhouse gas emissions reductions are achieved in the most cost-effective manner.  Mr. President, I ask my friend from West Virginia if my understanding is correct that Section 329 of the FY 2001 Interior bill is not intended to restrict the Administration from engaging in these international negotiations related to both the Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was ratified by the Senate in 1992, and the Kyoto Protocol to that Convention? Am I also correct in my understanding that Section 329 is not intended to restrict international programs or activities to encourage commitments by developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions?
