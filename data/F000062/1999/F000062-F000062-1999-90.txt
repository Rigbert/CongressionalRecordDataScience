 President, I was dismayed to learn that the SenateInterior Appropriations budget has zeroed out funding to the State of California for its share of the Elk Hills Naval Petroleum Reserve Settlement. By right, the State should receive $36 million this year. This is the money that California gives to retired teachers whose pensions have been most seriously eroded by inflation.  Here is the brief history of the issue: In 1996, Congress authorized the sale of Elk Hills Naval Reserve. However, a portion of the property consisted of more than 1300 acres of school lands owned by the state of California. Until the California's land claims were resolved, the sale could not go forward. Ultimately the Federal Government reached an agreement with California in which the state released its claim in exchange for installment payments over a seven-year period.  The settlement allowed the federal government to sell the reserve for $3.65 billion. California kept its part of the bargain. Now the Federal government must meet its obligations. Last year the first installment of the $36 million was paid. But six years of installments remain.  Actually, the money needed to compensate the state had been waiting in escrow.  The House has properly allocated $36 million in the House Interior Appropriations Bill.  I am hopeful that the Senate will also recognize the importance of keeping the Federal government's end of the bargain. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that the House appropriation of $36 million be upheld in Conference.                          ____________________
