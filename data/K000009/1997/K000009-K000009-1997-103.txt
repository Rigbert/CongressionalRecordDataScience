Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise this evening to commend our chair, the gentleman from New Mexico [Mr. Skeen], an outstanding Member of this House to work with; all of the members of our subcommittee and the committee staff, for their wonderful leadership in putting together a solid bill. It will help keep our Nation at the leading edge for food, fiber, fuel, and forest production, as well as research, trade, and food and drug safety.  There is no question that agriculture is America's lead industry. Our farmers and our agricultural industries remain the most productive in the world, and they well understand, as we do, how difficult it is to maintain our Nation's commitment to excellence in agriculture in tight budgetary times.  Our bill appropriates $3.7 billion or 7 percent less than last year's budget, and $2.8 billion less or 5 percent less than the amount requested by the administration. Over two-thirds of the bill's spending is dedicated to mandatory programs, largely nutrition programs like the school breakfast and lunch programs and the Food Stamp Program, which comprise nearly 70 percent of the funding in this bill.  The committee provided $35.8 billion in mandatory programs, which is a decrease of $4.3 billion below the amount available for fiscal year 1997, and $2.4 billion below the budget request.  The bill includes a total of $13.65 billion for discretionary programs, which is $599 million more than the amount appropriated in the last fiscal year, and $424 million less than the budget request.  Mr. Chairman, those who serve farmers and work with agriculture are taught over and over again that there is a big difference between money and wealth. Our job on this Committee on Agriculture is to help create the wealth of America through the investments that we make in food, fiber, fuel, and forestry, all essential components of production agriculture.  Market-oriented farm policy means farming for the market, not the Government, and requires investments in research, some of it high risk, in conservation, in sustainability, in education and technology transfer, which will keep agriculture competitive as we move into the new century.  Overall, the bill represents a fair, bipartisan approach. The committee did face tough choices, given our spending constraints. There are no funds in this bill for any Member for university facilities. Our committee turned down over a dozen requests for university research facilities. Further, we were only able to fund $50 million of over $200 million in requests for agricultural research.  I am not proud of the fact that we can only provide $50 million. That is only a quarter of what we were asked to provide, but that is the reality in today's world. Facing tight budget constraints, we did our best to shift research needs to priority areas. But in every case where a priority program received additional funding, some other budget function had to be cut.  Farm ownership and operating loans sustained a major cut in this bill, and were reduced $229 million below FY 1997 levels. This will have an impact. APHIS, the Animal Plant Health Inspection Service budget, was reduced by approximately 4 percent, at a time when we are experiencing increasing problems with inspection at our ports of entry.  The Natural Resources Conservation Service conservation operations programs, the primary source of technical assistance to producers and landowners, was cut by $10 million over last year's level, and more than $112 million below the President's budget request.  With the increasing public concern about food safety, I am pleased with the increase we were able to include for the food safety initiative under both the USDA and the Food and Drug Administration, as well as the Youth Tobacco Prevention initiative proposed under the FDA.  It is also noteworthy that this bill includes, after great compromise on the committee and struggle, an $118 million increase for the women, infants, and children feeding program, which will allow the program to maintain its current participation level of 7.4 million participants.  This bill also includes an $800,000 increase to upgrade investigative activities of the Grain Inspectors' Inspection Packers and Stockyards Administration regarding concentration in those industries. This increase is critical for monitoring and analyzing anticompetitive practices in the meatpacking industry, where now three huge firms control 80 percent of the meat that consumers in this country purchase.  Mr. Chairman, I continue to have serious reservations about some amendments which were adopted in full committee, and hope that these issues can be resolved during this floor debate. For example, our subcommittee, after considerable debate, provided $152 million for sales commissions to private crop insurance agents, as requested by the administration. However, at the full committee level, the chairman's en bloc amendment included a further increase of $36 million. There are many other programs that are of higher priority in this bill than underwriting private insurance agents, particularly in light of the April GAO report on abuses discovered in the crop insurance program.  In its report, GAO stated that expenses reimbursed with taxpayer funds appeared excessive, and I underline ``excessive,'' or did not appear to be reasonably associated with the sales and service of Federal crop insurance. These include, and I quote from the report, agent's commissions that exceeded the industry average, unnecessary travel-related expenses, questionable entertainment activities like skyboxes, expenses associated with acquiring competitors' businesses, profit-sharing bonuses, and lobbying.  GAO suggested that future reimbursement rates could be reduced. Consequently, the U.S. Department of Agriculture indicated to our committee that $152 million would be sufficient funding for this program for fiscal year 1998, and that these funds would provide assurance that valuable crop insurance products would be delivered by private crop insurance companies and their agents.  I strongly support the crop insurance program as a continuing safety net for our Nation's producers, but certainly a 24.5 percent level of commission, 24.5 percent, should be sufficient to encourage private companies to provide this service. Some might say it may even be too generous. Providing an additional $36 million increase to raise those commissions from 24.5 percent to about 27 percent of the value of the insurance policy is simply not the highest priority use of this subcommittee's limited funding.  I also remain concerned about some of the reductions proposed for salary accounts in the Department of Agriculture, particularly reductions in the Farm Service Agency, and the potential for disruption of the delivery of programs and services to farmers at the local level.  I strongly oppose the amendment adopted in full committee that would eliminate the salaries for the deputy and assistant deputy administrator of the Farm Services Agency. While we realize that the farmers and landowners in one State, Washington State, are very disappointed with the results of the 15th consecutive conservation reserve program sign-up, we strongly oppose this punitive and misguided attempt to effect a change through micromanagement of a Federal agency.  There remains in this bill, language adopted in full committee which seems to give special preference and consideration to one university building under the CSREES buildings and facilities account. With limited Federal funding available for priority programs, this subcommittee agreed in fiscal year 1997 that it would end the practice of building academic research facilities for universities.  While we followed this approach in subcommittee markup and provided no funding in this account, the language adopted in the full committee markup subverts an established process and I think compromises us at the conference committee level. It appears to give preference to one university while disallowing other priority proposals from consideration.  The full committee also adopted an amendment that authorizes on this appropriations bill by changing the designation of a community in California from a rural to an urban community. I have extremely strong reservations about the intent of this language, since no hearings were held on the subject. I underline, no hearings were held on the subject. It sets a very bad precedent, including unintended consequences that we may not fully appreciate. This language should be stripped from the bill.  Traditional farm programs continue to receive a decreasing portion of Federal support, and in my view, we should target our scarce agricultural dollars to smaller family farmers to assure competition in our industry now dominated by megagiants. I opposed last year's farm bill because I do not believe that it did enough to insure against undue risk to family farmers and to provide them with a safety net when times turn bad. While the farm bill made progress by enacting a $40,000 payment limitation, I remain concerned that large corporate farmers can still have undue call on Federal payments.  In recent decades, America has slowly eroded the historic basis of American agriculture, the family farmer, and is moving in the direction of giant corporate farms. We must address the increased concentration in agricultural markets that is squeezing family farmers out of business.  In the final analysis, a concentrated production system risks price manipulation and lack of competition. Commodity prices must be maintained at a level high enough to compensate for the costs of production, and to maintain standards of living in order to attract and retain farmers and farm production.  On the international front, we must also negotiate reciprocal trade agreements which encourage and enhance the ability of our farmers to compete in world markets.                              {time}  2015  On agricultural trade, we must work harder to recapture lost markets and increase exports. As American agricultural exports grow, foreign agricultural imports to our country are being shipped in greater magnitude.  Since 1981, our agricultural exports have exhibited a rather roller coaster ride, first declining from $43.8 billion to a low of $26 billion in 1986, and then rising to a record high of $60 billion in 1996, but at the same time agricultural imports have increased from $10.8 billion to approximately $30 billion in 1996, now equaling half of our exports.In many cases, these products our own farmers could be producing and marketing.  In closing, I want to express my appreciation to the gentleman from New Mexico [Mr. Skeen] for putting together the best bill we could under current fiscal circumstances. Let me remind our colleagues in closing that the agriculture portion of Federal spending has taken more than its share of budget cuts in these past several years. Overall spending on programs in our committee's jurisdiction has declined from $70.8 billion in fiscal year 1994 to $49.45 billion in fiscal year 1998 projected.  Employment at USDA has declined by approximately 13,000 since 1993. County-based office staffing has been reduced by 13.7 percent since fiscal year 1993 and will be reduced further for a total cut of 40 percent by fiscal year 2002. I think our subcommittee has met the challenge to reduce Federal spending. I am not quite sure how much more we can do.  Mr. Chairman, I again thank the gentleman from New Mexico for his cooperation.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
