Can the gentlewoman cite me one instance of a criminal charge being proven that that is the case? I don't doubt that you can assert that some people said there is fraud. Yes. Can you cite me one conviction of anybody who facilitated one of those 1,500 dead people going in, saying, ``I am Sam Brown,'' who is dead, ``and I want to vote''? Can you cite me one example of one conviction where that was found to be the fact, as opposed to an assertion?
