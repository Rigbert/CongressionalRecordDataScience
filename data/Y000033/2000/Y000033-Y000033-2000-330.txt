Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the Congress of the United States. This has been 2 days of very interesting debate. Everybody had their time to speak and to offer amendments. I want to congratulate those that stood with me and the gentleman from California (Mr. George Miller). Those that oppose me, I admire their enthusiasm and hope they will see the wisdom of supporting this legislation.  Before I go into my last closing statement, though, I want to thank Mike Henry, who has worked very hard on this bill for 2 years; as well as Liz Megginson, Lisa Pittman, Lloyd Jones, and all my staff on this side of the aisle; and, of course, the staff on the other side of the aisle, John Lawrence and Jeff Petrich.  I would suggest respectfully that the amendment that is offered as a substitute destroys everything we have done in the last 2 days. I know the gentleman does not intend to do that, but he does that. He waits for 5 years, puts everything back with the appropriators, which I think have not done an adequate job.  We have allowed this bill to go on budget. We will have the process of the budget, we will fund this program, and we will do what we should do for the future of this Nation.  For those that oppose the bill on private property rights, again I will tell them that this bill improves private property rights. It helps those people; it does not hurt them.  But more than that, may I suggest the bill, not the substitute, takes care of a problem that should have been taken care of beginning in 1964. The money put in the general budget are nonrenewable monies. They come from oil offshore, primarily Louisiana, Texas, and Alabama. They have carried this burden to fund programs very frankly that may have merit but not what the intent was. The intent was to protect our land, our water, and to conserve, not preserve, our wildlife. Our land is for people to enjoy. This bill will do that.  This bill will heal some scars that this government created in reclamation. I believe this bill recognizes that wildlife is necessary. And for money being spent in Endangered Species, I will tell my colleagues that I have tried to amend the Endangered Species Act, and I hope to do that with the next administration, but this bill will help species from becoming endangered.  This bill will establish an area of land where the American people, the future, the young ones, can go and hunt and fish, and be alone and think, to meditate, to be away from the television and the computer. This bill will, in fact, give us an opportunity to be free. Because we have gone from a rural area to an urbanized area. We have to face this. As much as I reject it, we have to face that. If we do not take and allow room for our people, we will have a society that is not stable.  Mr. Chairman, I urge the defeat of the substitute and the passage of this bill for the future generations.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. Quinn). The question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry).  The question was taken; and the Chairman pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it.                             Recorded Vote
