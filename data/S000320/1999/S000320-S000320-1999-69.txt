 I strongly concur that the Coast Guard should ask the City of Unalaska to use its own local knowledge and competitive procurement process to manage the pier extension. I also agree that the Congress should encourage an arrangement between the City and the agency to reduce the Coast Guard's operating costs associated with the long-term maintenance of any dedicated pier space. We will seek to address this in conference at the appropriate time.                          savannah water taxi
