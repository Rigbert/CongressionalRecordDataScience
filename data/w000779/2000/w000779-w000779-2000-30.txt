President, my friend and colleague, Senator Smith, has said it extremely well, and I know our colleague Senator Reed is waiting to speak, so I, too, will be very brief.  My view is that this Steens legislation is a monumental wilderness triumph. This legislation creates for the first time in statute cow-free wilderness. In the past, wilderness designations allowed the continuation of historic grazing practices, but because the ranchers in the Steens recognize the delicate nature of this ecosystem and because they were willing to work with Democrats and Republicans in our congressional delegation, Congressman Greg Walden, Congressman Peter DeFazio, and so many of our colleagues, we were able to build a coalition for a truly historic approach to protecting our wilderness.  We were able to find acceptable alternative grazing sites. Almost 100,000 acres of the total wilderness designation is now going to be by law cow free. In my view, this is just an example, a precedent of how communities can work together to protect our treasures.  All across this country when there are debates about national monuments, the sides go into opposing and what amounts to warring camps, the decibel level gets very high, and there is an awful lot of finger pointing and accusations.  In Oregon, we did it differently. We came up with an Oregon solution. Like Senator Smith, I am very proud ofwhat we have been able to achieve. This is a model that our delegation is going to use to tackle other critical natural resource questions and, frankly, we are especially proud tonight because we think that with our Steens bill, we set a model for other communities across this country.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
