 President, I have a couple of unanimous consent requests, cleared on both sides.  As in executive session, I ask that, at 5:45 today, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 270, the nomination of Florence-Marie Cooper to be United States District Judge for the Central District of California.  I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate then immediately proceed to a vote on the confirmation of the nomination and, following that vote, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate then return to legislative session.  Mr. McCAIN. I object.
