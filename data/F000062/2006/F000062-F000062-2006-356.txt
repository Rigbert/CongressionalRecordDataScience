 President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New Mexico for his thoughtful comments on the bill. I have the privilege of serving as a member of the Energy Committee, of which he is chairman. It has been a pleasure for me to serve under his chairmanship. I thank him for those comments.  I come to the floor to discuss an amendment, SA 4087, which I filed this morning. It is entitled ``To modify the Conditions Under Which Aliens Who Are Unlawfully Present in the United States Are Granted Legal Status.'' I ask unanimous consent that Senator Harkin be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.
