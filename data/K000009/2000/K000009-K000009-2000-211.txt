We were discussing this. She is a Chinese American. Her roommate was shot. Her roommate was a demonstrator in Tiananmen Square in 1989. This young woman who is a physicist and now lives in my community in Ohio became politically active when she saw this happen to her friend who was a democracy demonstrator inside China.  I asked her about this attitude of Americans, this kind of belief. She said, I cannot believe how naive the people here really are. Do you think because China promises something, she is going to do it? Do you, who live under a rule-of-law society, believe if someone signs a piece of paper, they are going to do it? Why are you so naive? Do you not understand what goes on there?  I just wanted to add that to the record this evening, and thank the gentleman so very much for taking out this special order. I know my colleagues will also want to comment. We thank the American people for listening.  Maybe it is important to say if people want to see this report on the website, if they have a website, this is Made in China by Charles Karnighan, and it is at www.NLCnet.org.
