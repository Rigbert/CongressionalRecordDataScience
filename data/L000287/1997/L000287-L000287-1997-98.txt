Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a great man and a great institution, Robert Paschal, the founder and owner of Paschal's Motor Hotel and Restaurant, who recently passed away.  Mr. Paschal moved to Atlanta at a young age and opened a soda fountain and a hot dog stand. The small stand grew into an Atlanta institution, an establishment famous for its fried chicken. He helped build a business the old-fashioned way, the hard way, through hard work.  My first meal in Atlanta was at Paschal's during the civil rights movement. This man practically fed the entire movement. Paschal's was one of the few places blacks and whites could socialize and discuss the order of the day. It was there we talked about the Selma march, the Poor People's Campaign, and the Mississippi summer project. It was there we checked the pulse of the movement. Paschal's was referred to as the Paschal precinct, and to this day it is a meeting place, a gathering place for all Atlanta.  So when Robert Paschal left us, we lost a part of Atlanta, part of our history and our hearts. He will be missed by our city and our State.                          ____________________
