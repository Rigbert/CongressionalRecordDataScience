President, on Thursday the Senate overwhelmingly approved reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA). I want to take this opportunity to explain the benefits of this legislation for the State of Illinois.  First, let me offer my congratulations and also say thank you to Senators Chafee and Baucus for their extraordinary work in bringing this bill to the floor and shepherding it through in record time. The final product, S. 1173, reflects their diligent work and profound understanding of our nation's diverse transportation needs.  Illinois is a vitally important link in our nation's transportation system. My colleague, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, who has helped lead an important effort to improve this bill to reflect Illinois' needs, has referred to the State as the ``Transportation Hub of the Nation.'' I couldn't agree more.  Illinois has the third largest Interstate system in the nation. It is a critical freight transfer point. The Chicago area boasts of the nation's largest intermodal hub. Illinois is also a passenger and freight rail hub. The State's ports handle the third largest amount of domestic waterborne traffic. Illinois' rivers are the fourth busiest in the nation. The Chicago Transit Authority operates the nation's second largest public transportation system. And, of course, O'Hare International Airport is the busiest in the world.  Unfortunately, Illinois' urban roads have been rated as the second worst in the nation. And, the six-county Chicago region is considered the fifth most congested area in the U.S.  This ISTEA reauthorization is a good first step toward improving the conditions of Illinois' roads and bridges, properly funding mass transit in Chicago and downstate, alleviating congestion, and addressing highway safety and the environment.  The bill provides $173 billion over six years for highway, highway safety, and other surface transportation programs. Illinois can expect to receive more than $5.3 billion over six years from the highway formula, as well as from the high density and the bonus programs. That's a 29 percent increase or $1.2 billion more than the ISTEA of 1991. Major reconstruction and rehabilitation projects like Downtown Chicago's Wacker Drive and the Stevenson Expressway (I-55) will be able to move forward thanks, in large part, to this legislation.  Mass transit funding is vitally important to the Chicago area as well as to so many downstate communities. It helps alleviate congestion and provides access to thousands of Illinoisans everyday. Under the Banking Committee title, Illinois can expect to receive $2.1 billion over six years. A 40 percent increase or $600 million more than the 1991 ISTEA. These important transit dollars will help the Chicago Transit Authority rehabilitate several lines, the METRA and PACE systems in Northeastern Illinois expand and improve their service areas, the Metro Link light rail system in St. Clair County complete an Illinois extension, and transit authorities throughout the state purchase and upgrade bus and bus facilities.  The Senate bill also preserves and expands some important environmental and enhancement programs, for example the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) program and bicycle pedestrian facilities. CMAQ's goal is to help states meet their air quality conformity requirements as prescribed by the Clean Air Act. S. 1173 increases funding for CMAQ by 18 percent. Illinois can expect more than $1 billion over six years under the program. S. 1173 also provides for increases in funds for transportation enhancement activities, such as bicycle pedestrian facilities and historic preservation.  This bill also contains a number of highway safety provisions. One of the most notable is the .08 amendment. Thanks to the efforts of Senators Lautenberg and DeWine, S. 1173 contains a provision that would lower the legal blood-alcohol concentration level for drivers to .08. It's a law that Illinois has had on the books since July 1997. The provision could save as many as 600 lives a year.  Finally, the Senate ISTEA bill extends the current excise tax exemption for an important Illinois product--corn-based, renewable ethanol fuel--to 2007. Farmers and the ethanol industry must be able to plan for the future. Extending the incentive will allow them to do so.  Mr. President, the Senate's action on ISTEA sets the stage for Congress to uphold its obligation to reauthorize these vitally important transportation programs before they expire again later this spring. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that our nation's transportation needs are properly met.                          ____________________
