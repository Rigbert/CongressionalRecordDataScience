Chairman, I yield myself the balance of the time.  Mr. Chairman, we do not know if the gentleman from New York's approach is constitutional. That has not been tried before, and it would be a case of first impression in the courts.  We know that the provision of denying Federal funds in the base bill is constitutional, because it was done by this Congress 20 years ago where we denied States transportation funds that did not raise the drinking age to 21. So the constitutional precedent was set 20 years ago in the transportation area. The base bill does that. The gentleman's amendment does not. That is why it ought to be rejected.  The Acting CHAIRMAN (Mr. Simpson). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.
