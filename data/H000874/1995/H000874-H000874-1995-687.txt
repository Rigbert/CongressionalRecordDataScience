Speaker, 25 years ago this week, the Maryland State Police made its first medical evacuation flight, transporting a patient to the University of Maryland's hospital in Baltimore. I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating the Maryland State Police and the Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services System for their outstanding achievements since 1970. That year, a total of 197 medical transport flights were made with an 88 percent survival rate. Today, I want to recognize this maiden flight by Cpl. Gary Moore and Trooper First Class Paul Benson which started one of the Nation's first airborne medical evacuation programs. Maryland's Med-Evac program, operated by the Maryland State Police, [[Page E692]] has since established itself as a leader worldwide in performing this mission.  I want to share with my colleagues why Maryland's Med-Evac program has become the envy of other units throughout the world with the same mission. Since that maiden flight in March 1970, this unit has transported over 62,000 patients, delivering them to a hospital system that includes the University of Maryland Hospital at Baltimore, where Dr. R. Adams Cowley pioneered his principle of the Golden Hour, the critical time following trauma when a patient's life is most vulnerable. Maryland's Med-Evac program is unique because it uses a multimission approach carried out by the Maryland State Police Aviation Division. This unit provides law enforcement, search and rescue, and medical evacuation, providing a high quality service for the least cost.  Working with other local officials, I was pleased that former Gov. William D. Schaefer agreed to upgrade the State's helicopter fleet to provide state of the art helicopters at each of the 8 bases throughout Maryland. In October 1994, a new American Eurocopter Dauphine began operating from its base in St. Mary's County for the southern Maryland area, making Maryland the only State that provides 24 hour per day Med-Evac coverage for its citizens, with the ability to fly in most weather conditions. This service has become an intricate, high-technology link in the statewide emergency medical services system, utilizing a sophisticated communications system to incorporate a systematic approach to interface with all licensed medical care institutions in an effort to match the needs of the patient with the most appropriate treatment center.  The significant achievements of the aviation division have not come without sacrifice. Six pilots have been killed while performing three separate missions. Following each tragedy, actions have been taken to upgrade the equipment and training needed to conduct this important mission.  Today, Major Johnny Hughes is the commander of the 144-person unit which operates 11 helicopters from the 8 sites throughout Maryland. All Maryland State Police flight paramedics are nationally registered EMT-paramedics, possessing emergency and critical care skills with the ability to function as complete pre-hospital practitioners.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the accomplishments of the Maryland State Police Aviation Division and the excellent continuous service they provide, along with the emergency medical services community in our great State. I ask that my colleagues join with me to commend them for this extraordinary record of service to the people of Maryland for the past 25 years.                          ____________________
