 President, I rise today to remember the life of Dr. Alvin C. Poweleit. For nearly 50 years, the people of Covington were blessed to have Dr. Poweleit as a member of their community, and few families were not touched by the kind gentleman known as ``Pepa.''  Pepa Poweleit grew up in Northern Kentucky in the town of Newport. After earning his medical degree, Dr. Poweleit returned to Newport in the late 1930s as general practitioner. Like most young men of his generation, he left his hometown behind when he signed up to serve in World War II. He soon found himself in the Philippines, where he was the first U.S. medical officer to be decorated in the war, when he saved personnel in a submerged Brenn Gun Carrier.  Dr. Poweleit spent over three years in Japanese POW camps in the Philippines, and was a survivor of the Bataan Death March. After the war, Dr. Poweleit returned to Northern Kentucky, where he opened up his own practice in Covington as an eye, ear, nose and throat specialist.  For the last 50 years, the Poweleit family has maintained the office at the corner of Eighth and Scott in Covington. It was a rare day that Dr. Poweleit didn't work 14 hours. If there were sick patients to be seen, Pepa Poweleit would see every single one. At a time when most people lived within walking distance of their family doctor, it wasn't rare to see Dr. Poweleit still in the office after midnight.  Pepa Poweleit retired from practice in 1981, leaving the family practice to his son Alvin D, an eye specialist known in the community as Dr. Alvin. Carrying on the tradition of family practice, Dr. Alvin remains a fixture today in the Covington community.  Mr. President, last June, Pepa Poweleit was tragically killed when the car in which he was a passenger was run into by a truck. He was 89. Pepa Poweleit was a beloved figure in the communities of Northern Kentucky. Though nearly two decades have gone by since he retired, and almost a year has passed since his death, Pepa Poweleit is still sorely missed.                          ____________________
