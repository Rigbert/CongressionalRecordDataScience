Speaker, I yield myself a minute and a half.  Mr. Speaker, once again the opponents of this legislation are not correct. My friend, the gentleman from Massachusetts, says that someone whois injured in Iraq and comes home is not going to be protected from medical expenses. The United States Government has stood behind everybody who has a service-connected injury or disability and pays for the medical treatment out of taxpayers' money because that is the right thing to do.  Secondly, he says that this bill continues the millionaires' exemption in the eight States that have unlimited exemption. Wrong. It plugs that exemption.  And if this bill goes down, a corporate crook can build a multimillion dollar mansion on the Intercostal waterway in Florida and be able to shield that asset from bankruptcy. What this bill does is it does plug that unlimited exemption and it plugs it in a way that was negotiated out in a bipartisan manner in the conference committee two Congresses ago with a motion that was made in that conference committee by my senior Senator, Herb Kohl, who is a Democrat.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
