 Mr. Chair, I join the chairman in opposing this amendment. It is, truly, a blunt cut--5 percent to the Department of Energy from its current level with no analysis, no consultation, no consideration of impact. It is just a blunt cut. It would actually mean about 700 people who would be fired at headquarters, at field offices, even at our Power Marketing Administrations across the West. Layoffs of this magnitude would profoundly impede the Department of Energy's ability to oversee its nuclear security responsibilities, its science and energy and environmental cleanup mandates.  I strenuously oppose this amendment and urge the gentleman to bring back a more thoughtful amendment at some point if he wishes, but I don't support the blunt cut.
