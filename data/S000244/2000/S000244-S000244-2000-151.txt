Chairman, I wish to comment on the Department of Energy's (DOE) Fossil Energy and Energy Conservation Research and Development (R), and Clean Coal Technology provisions in H.R. 4578, the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2001. H.R. 4578 represents the hard work of Mr. Regula and the members of the Appropriations Subcommittee and Committee and I appreciate their diligence.  The Science Committee has responsibility for setting authorization levels for funding civilian research at the DOE. The Committee has passed two authorization bills which address DOE fiscal year 2001 funding: (1) H.R. 1655, the DOE Research, Development, and Demonstration Authorization Act of 1999; and (2) H.R. 1656, the DOE Commercial Application of Energy Technology Authorization Act of 1999. H.R. 4578 appropriates $535.6 million for Energy Conservation R programs, while H.R. 1655 and H.R. 1656 provide a combined $623.2 million for similar programs. Furthermore, H.R. 1655 and H.R. 1656 provide $442.4 million for Fossil Energy R, and H.R. 4578 provides $410.4 million for similar accounts. Although H.R. 4578 does not fully fund these accounts to their authorized levels, Chairman Regula has made a serious effort to fund R in a tight fiscal framework. Despite the shortfall in R funding, I am pleased the bill does provide $11.7 million for the Science Committee's Energy Efficiency Science Initiative.  I am also pleased to see that section 330 of H.R. 4578 contains the Knollenberg amendment that prohibits the use of funds to propose or issue rules, regulations, decrees or orders for implementing the Kyoto Protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change prior to Senate ratification. Mr. Knollenberg's language assures taxpayers that Senate ratification must precede actions to implement the Kyoto Protocol. Given the glaring problems with this unfunded, unsigned, and unratified Protocol, such a limitation is proper and necessary and I commend the Appropriations Committee for including it in H.R. 4578.                          ____________________
