President, if the majority leader will yield, the Leahy amendment has now been amended by the Exon amendment. Because many, many Senators supported the amendment as one by itself--obviously, the majority support the Exon amendment--there is really no reason to have a rollcall vote on my amendment.  I recommend we adopt the Leahy amendment, as amended by the Exon amendment, by voice vote.
