President, in reference to the language that came from the other body, which I am concerned about, the Congressional Research Service said:        . . . if an Internet user utilized one provider to connect      to the internet and another paid provider of, for instance,      email services, the connection provider would be covered by      the moratorium but not the paid email provider. Under the      current moratorium, each would be covered.  What that means is, if you are an American, for example, who gets your Internet access from Verizon, under the House language that would continue to be protected. But if you get your e-mail from, say, another provider--perhaps EarthLink or Google or Yahoo--under the language that was passed by the other body, that could be taxed, according to the Congressional Research Service. I do not think any Member of this body wants that to happen.  Also, reading further from the Congressional Research Service memorandum, they say it would also allow the taxation ``of many more products and services than the existing exemption under the current moratorium.''
