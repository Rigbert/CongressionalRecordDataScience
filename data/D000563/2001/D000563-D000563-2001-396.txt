I am stunned at the suggestion that putting fewer kids in classrooms does not create a better learning experience. Every parent knows that. I can recall raising one child, then two, then three, and how the challenge grew geometrically as the number of children grew. I can't imagine facing a room full of 30 kids and saying it is just as easy to teach there as it is in a room of 13 or 18 children.  The thing that is said repeatedly by one of our colleagues is that ``this is a mandate.'' I ask the Senator from Washington to say once and for all, are we mandating school to districts that they have to reduce class size with this amendment?
